"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-03-16,"—I commenced my contribution last night before the adjournment and I am pleased to continue today. Essentially, this is an important piece of legislation. There is an enormous amount of debate in the community about this in terms of what role midwives should have in our health system and in the delivery of children in this country. I think it is an issue that deserves ongoing debate and close scrutiny in terms of what the government is proposing to do.
As I said last night, over the past few months I have been contacted—as I am sure my colleagues have also—by many dozens of families who want to share their experience of their pregnancy and of delivering their baby at home with a midwife. In fact there have been hundreds of emails about the trust and bond they shared with their midwife throughout their pregnancy and how safe they felt during the delivery of their child. Some have also told me that they have had previous experience of such traumatic hospital deliveries that they would rather not have another child than be ‘forced’ to deliver their baby in a hospital situation. Indeed many wrote that ultimately it is their right to choose and removing that choice is fundamentally unfair.
There is no question that homebirth and/or midwives is not for everyone, but for those who choose it, it is fair to argue that that choice should be available to them. As I understand it, the statistics show that about one per cent of births are homebirths in this country compared to about 30 per cent in the Netherlands, and I will refer to that shortly.
Similarly and scarily, I have heard from women who had a ‘normal’ or textbook case low-risk pregnancy but because of an unexpected complication during labour they almost lost their child and, but for the intervention of the hospital’s doctors, would have lost their son or daughter. I have been advised by medical professionals about the risks of delivery without an obstetrician and how every second counts and that in some instances by the time the midwife realises there is a complication it might be too late to get the mother to a hospital. However, I emphasise that that contrary position has been put to me by those who argue that homebirths are something to be avoided.
I must stress that I do not believe any mother would knowingly make a decision that would risk her baby’s life. I have full confidence that the priority of midwives is to look after the mother and baby, as is the case with the medical profession. I would hope that a mother who is considering having her baby with a midwife would do all of the research and ask all the appropriate questions to ensure that it would be a safe decision for her to have her baby without an obstetrician present. Of course, these are the sorts of questions that need to be asked about a so-called conventional delivery through a hospital model and I am sure the same would go for a mother considering delivering her baby in a hospital.
Since the medical indemnity crisis of 2001, insurers have refused to give professional indemnity insurance to midwives who attend homebirths. But from 1 July 2010 the single National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for Health Professions will be introduced, which means that without indemnity insurance it will be illegal for privately practising midwives to provide antenatal care, labour and birth support, and post-natal care to women at home. I understand and I have heard the concerns of women who fear that this will result in homebirths being ‘forced underground’, and from a public policy and individual point of view this is in no way desirable. This should not be seen as an attempt to ban midwifery by stealth. One of the roles of parliament is to establish measures that ensure the safety of all Australian mothers and their babies. This legislation, although it may be seen to be punitive against midwives, does not need to be, and I believe it does not intend to be so.
The government’s amendments to the legislation include transitional arrangements for privately practising midwives through the provision of a two-year exemption until June 2012, and collaborative arrangements are an indication of this. Again, I acknowledge the fears of midwives who argue that this may in time undermine their role and the requests of intending mothers. Once again, it must all be balanced up against the safety of mother and child. Whatever decision is made in this place I hope that Australians and midwives know that it is to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards in place so that the health of a baby and the health of a mother are protected no matter where they give birth.
In Australia, demand for homebirths is about one per cent of all deliveries nationwide. Compare this to the Netherlands, where some one in three babies are born at home. Indeed, last year a review of 500,000 births in the Netherlands revealed no difference in survival rates between hospital births and homebirths, for low-risk pregnancies. In terms of adverse outcomes that is a very telling statistic. However, it is important to keep in mind that in the Netherlands they have in place a streamlined system that allows women to plan a homebirth and to access specialist emergency obstetric care in hospital should complications arise.
Under the scheme proposed in these bills, however, midwives will be unable to access Medicare unless they are sponsored by a doctor or obstetrician, by a medical practitioner, and therefore will be unable to admit a patient to a public hospital. It is for those occasional instances where an otherwise normal, safe and supposedly predictable low-risk pregnancy becomes, at the very last minute, for whatever reason, risky for the survival of the baby that I feel I have to support these bills. Having said that, I want to stress that I do believe midwives play a very important role in our health system. The services and support that they provide make a significant difference to women and families around Australia. It is important that we recognise that individual women and individual pregnancies have individual needs. Given this, I believe an independent inquiry should be conducted into midwifery in Australia, with the key focus on safety but also addressing the demand, the cost benefits for the public hospital system and international best practice, such as the system that exists in the Netherlands. I do not think we have had a level of scrutiny of midwifery and homebirths in this country to that extent. I think there is a demand for it. I think more women would avail themselves of midwives if we had systems in place similar to those in the Netherlands and other countries.
It is interesting to note that a review of homebirths in Western Australia was undertaken for the Western Australian Department of Health in August 2008. The review team members and report authors were Professor Caroline Homer and Dr Michael Nicholl. That was a very positive report about homebirths in Western Australia. There is no reason why it would be any different anywhere else in the country. It indicated that homebirths, as practised in WA, compared very favourably with hospital births in the Western Australian hospital system. There were specific terms of reference. The first term of reference was to:
Investigate the clinical experiences and health outcomes of mothers and babies accepted for homebirth by the Community Midwifery Program or midwives acting independently in Western Australia between 2000 and 2007. As a minimum, the investigation is to include mortality of mothers and babies; and emergency transfer of mothers or babies to hospital care at any stage of pregnancy, including during the post-partum period.
I think that indicates the sort of thing that should be done at a federal level. The national health and hospitals review did not specifically look at this very important issue because the government had already undertaken a maternity services review, and that report was provided in February 2009. However, the concern that has been expressed to me by midwives and those who are advocates for homebirths is that there has not been an adequate and robust study of the benefits and risks of homebirths, integrating that into our health system and looking at international best practice, such as in the Netherlands.
Let us look further at the international experience. Midwifery became a regulated profession in Canada in the 1990s. Midwives are today the lead healthcare professionals attending the majority of births, albeit mostly in a hospital setting. There is a different attitude to the role of midwives at births in Canada. Under legal recognition, Canadian midwives have access to hospital privileges, the right to prescribe medications commonly needed during pregnancy, birth and post-partum, the right to order blood work and ultrasounds for their patients and full consultation access to their own physicians. That, to me, seems to be a sensible way forward. Many would say that the Canadian system is leaps and bounds ahead of the US health system just south of the border. In 1990 New Zealand restored the professional and legal separation of midwifery from nursing. About 78 per cent of women choose a midwife in New Zealand. That is a dramatically different statistic from here in Australia.
Midwifery is a long-held practice, going back centuries. Midwives are educated and trained providers who care for child-bearing women throughout their pregnancy, during the delivery process and in the post-partum period. I think we have not availed ourselves of the resource and professionalism that midwives can offer. The fact that so few women choose to go down the path of using a midwife says something about the structural imbalances in our health system. I do not think we have had a robust enough analysis of that, even with the report of the maternity services review. That is something that ought to be looked at.
This is not easy legislation to decide on. I am sure that I am not the only one in this chamber who has been deeply concerned about this issue. As I said at the start of my contribution, there are so many aspects and arguments to this debate. In so many ways it is not a black and white issue; there are shades of grey in relation to this. I need to support measures to ensure the safety of all Australian mothers and babies, and for that reason I give my support to this package of bills. However, I believe ultimately that the fair and right thing to do is to have an independent inquiry into this area of practice. I think it is crucial to ensure that all Australian child-bearing women have access to the best care and the most appropriate care for them, whether that is in a hospital or clinic with an obstetrician or in a hospital with a midwife or at home with a midwife. The fact that other nations, such as Canada, New Zealand and the Netherlands, and a number of states in the US, have a different approach I think indicates that we have a long way to go. I hope that the regulations that will be set up under this legislation will not prejudice midwives and will look fairly at the importance of their contribution to our health system. Until we have that robust, independent inquiry, I do not think we will get the best policy answers. So I urge the government to go through the process of an independent review, particularly during this transition period. I think that in the absence of that we will not make the best decisions for the mothers and babies of this nation. Families need to be able to make an informed choice as to what is best for them.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIDWIVES AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2010-03-16,"—I am very happy to contribute to the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009, the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Bill 2009 and the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Bill 2009, which introduce significant changes for Australia’s nurses and midwives. These bills are an important component of the government’s maternity reform package. I would like to make a short contribution and put a number of issues on the record.
The purpose of the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009 is to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953 to support the inclusion of nurse practitioners and appropriately qualified and experienced midwives under the Medicare benefits schedule, MBS, and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, PBS, in line with the 2009-10 budget measures. The midwives and nurse practitioners bill will enable those health professionals to request appropriate diagnostic imaging and pathology services for which Medicare benefits may be paid and to prescribe certain medicines under the PBS. The 2009-10 budget measure also provides for the creation of new Medicare items and referrals under the MBS from these health professionals to specialist consultant physicians. The Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Bill 2009 and the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Bill 2009 will support the new MBS and PBS arrangements by enabling the establishment of a government supported professional indemnity scheme for eligible midwives. These bills will commence on 1 July 2010.
The bills before us expand support for midwives and nurse practitioners in our community, improving choice and extending funding for a range of midwife and nurse practitioner services for the first time ever. The bills will enable patients of appropriately qualified and experienced midwives and nurse practitioners to access benefits under the Medical Benefits Schedule for improved access to maternity services and improved choice for women. The government was supported in their commitment to better services by witnesses to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into the bills, and I quote from the report:
The government’s commitment to increase women’s access to midwifery care by providing midwives with access to the MBS, PBS and affordable indemnity insurance was supported by witnesses. The Australian College of Midwives (ACM) stated:
Evidence confirms that women and babies benefit from continuity of care by a known midwife. We welcome the Minister’s recognition of this evidence and commitment to expanding women’s access to the choice of primary continuity of care by midwives in both hospital and the community.
It is fair to say that the two community affairs inquiries held into these bills, which recommended the passing of the bills, generated considerable interest. The committee received over 1,000 submissions.
It is important to note that these three bills do not take away any rights and that none of these bills make homebirth unlawful. The indemnity insurance issue as it relates to privately practising midwives—raised by community members and organisations with many members and senators—is dealt with.
I am pleased that the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, announced back in September 2009 that she was able to achieve agreement from all state and territory health ministers to a transitional clause. The clause provides a two-year exemption, until June 2010, from holding indemnity insurance for privately practising midwives who are unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance for attending a homebirth. This issue was raised with me prior to the transitional arrangements being put in place, and after. I am pleased to say that the women I have spoken to have supported Ms Roxon’s approach.
At a recent meeting I had with representatives from the homebirth rally on their ‘national day of action’, they agreed that the exemption approach was a positive outcome. I spoke at the homebirth rally, which was held in Hobart on 18 February. It was attended by homebirth supporters, midwives and children. I had a meeting prior to the rally with rally representatives: Ms Jo Durdin, Director, Australian College of Midwives, Tasmania; Ms Lalita Holmes, one of the rally organisers; and an expectant mother, Ms Chernov. I also have had meetings with other individual midwives and interested individuals. The rally meeting was very constructive, and a number of issues were raised at the meeting which also have been raised by witnesses at the community affairs committee hearings.
An issue of concern was the impact of the requirement for midwives to have collaborative arrangements with medical practitioners. And, as the committee reported noted and has been repeated by interested parties that I have spoken to, the concept of collaboration to ensure appropriate care for women and their babies is supported. This was echoed by the Australian College of Midwives in their comment, ‘midwifery is a profession committed to the provision of collaborative care.’ They also stated that:
… there is no argument that women choosing the care of a private MBS funded midwife must have ready access to appropriate medical care if and when the need arises for themselves or their baby.
The ACM and others saw the issue as being how collaboration is ensured. The community affairs committee noted:
… effective collaborative arrangements amongst health professionals ensures the delivery of safe and high quality care. Collaborative arrangements are at the heart of the midwives and nurse practitioners reforms introduced by the Government and thus the Committee supports the principle of collaborative arrangements in legislation.
The details of the collaborative arrangements will be included in subordinate legislation and will continue to be the subject of consultations with health professionals. The majority report from the community affairs committee believes:
This consultation is critical to the effectiveness of the process and reflects the shared commitment and professional skills focused on safe birth practice.
These bills, as I have said, are a significant step towards improving access and services. I commend the bills to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIDWIVES AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2010-03-16,"—I would like to make a few remarks about these bills, the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009, the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Bill 2009 and the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Bill 2009. I see the most important part as being the suggestion that there should be collaborative agreements between doctors and midwives, and I think that should occur. But I note that there has been some opposition to this from some midwives who feel professionally threatened by having to work in collaboration with a medical practitioner—one trained in obstetrics, one presumes.
It is interesting to look at the figures over the years. Since the beginning of last century we have had quite a dramatic drop in the infant mortality rate. In 1907 the infant mortality rate was about 8,945 a year, whereas today it is around 1,200. There has also been a dramatic drop in maternal mortality rates associated with deliveries. In both cases, that is largely due to the fact that most babies are born in hospitals now and children are in hospitals under medical care—that is, with medical doctors as well as midwives caring for the mothers and babies.
But the one thing that has gone up over that time is the incidence of litigation. Medical litigation in Australia has skyrocketed, and that, I would suggest, is why the idea of having a collaborative arrangement between doctors and midwives is very important and in fact essential. Litigation can occur for many reasons, often quite trivial reasons such as failure to do a test in an antenatal clinic or failure to manage complications during delivery. I think, for the benefit and protection of midwives, having a qualified obstetrician or at least a general practitioner with a diploma in obstetrics overseeing what is done will protect them from the risk of litigation which might otherwise occur. I know that many GP obstetricians have ceased practising obstetrics because of the fear of litigation and because the cost of the insurance premiums is so high that the income from the deliveries they do does not at all cover the cost of the insurance.
As I said, litigation can follow from quite trivial events, such as failing to do a blood sugar test on an Indigenous woman who might only come into a clinic once or twice before she delivers. Then she turns up at the hospital with gestational diabetes, causing a very large baby, and then has complications because it is often very difficult to deliver large babies without surgical or other intervention. If there was an adverse outcome there, the midwife might find that, because she failed to order a blood sugar test very early in the pregnancy, which might have indicated that the patient was in danger of developing gestational diabetes, she could be liable for that adverse outcome of the pregnancy.
In fact I know of a doctor who was in exactly that situation in the north-west. He saw a patient only twice during her antenatal period and did do a blood sugar test, but the patient never came back and disappeared into the unknown. But in due course she turned up in a hospital with diabetes in pregnancy and a very large baby, and there were some complications. The doctor found that his insurance had to pay out damages of nearly $1 million to that patient. So I think a formal collaborative arrangement is very wise in terms of protecting the interests of midwives so that they are not subject to unnecessary litigation, and also of course to protect mothers and babies.
I note that the AMA has supported the requirement for inclusion of collaborative arrangements in legislation. Dr Andrew Pesce, the president of the AMA, stated in the Senate committee inquiry:
If collaborative care is essential, then it must be enshrined in the legislation. It is simply too risky to say that health professionals can use their discretion as to when, where and in what circumstances they will collaborate—and that works both ways. It is essential that the primary legislation encapsulates a requirement for collaborative arrangements so that the most important goal, quality and safety of patient care, is achievable.
The midwives who have objected to the suggestion that there should be a legislative requirement for collaborative agreements have said that in some way this questions their competence. But, as the AMA President said, addressing the issue of a perceived power imbalance between midwives and obstetricians:
If there is an imbalance, I suspect that it emerges from the fact that midwives can care for a patient to a certain point and then, if something goes beyond that, they need to enlist the services of a collaborating obstetrician. But that obstetrician obviously is hesitant to just become a technician and say, ‘I will just step in when I am asked to.’ They would like to step in at the right time. So, if there is a power imbalance, it arises from the different competencies of the people who work in the team, and I do not think it is one which stems from a desire to deal with the competition.
In other words, I think most doctors are very happy to see midwives involved in delivering babies and ongoing obstetrics, but they do feel there is a point at which it may be necessary for people with a higher degree of competence, a greater degree of knowledge, to step in and manage the delivery. That requirement can be achieved and protected through having written collaborative agreements. So I very much agree with the need for these sorts of agreements.
Senator Xenophon talked about the fact that in the Netherlands there are a great number of home deliveries. That is also the case in the United Kingdom, but fewer than there used to be in that country. Of course, the difference is that in both the Netherlands and the UK the population is fairly concentrated and it is never very far from someone’s home to a major hospital where there is an obstetrics team. And in both of those countries they have flying squads to go out and pick up ladies who are having babies and get into trouble such as having an unexpected haemorrhage or obstructed labour. Unfortunately, in Australia, where the distances are so much greater, that kind of service is more difficult to set up. Again, I think it is very important in the case of rural obstetrics that these collaborative agreements with local doctors who do have diplomas in obstetrics should be set up. That would then protect the mothers and babies as well as the midwives from later allegations of incompetence and from damages being awarded for matters which could have been otherwise avoided. So I strongly support the conclusion that the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee reached in its report, which was that the committee ‘supports the principle of collaborative arrangements in legislation’ and:
The Committee considers that the collaborative arrangements as envisaged will enable a flexible approach to meet the different circumstances of practice across Australia, particularly in remote and rural areas.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIDWIVES AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-03-16,"—It seems that everyone has provided their contribution on the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009 and related bills. I thank the senators and I table a replacement explanatory memorandum relating to the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Bill 2009 and the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Bill 2009. I am pleased today to have the opportunity to sum up debate on these bills because they do introduce landmark changes for Australian nurses and midwives.
Since the election the government has been working to boost our workforce piece by piece. This legislation is a key part of the puzzle which has already seen funding for over 1,000 additional undergraduate nursing and midwifery university places a year and funding to provide new nurse practitioner and midwifery scholarships to build the workforce for the future. And just yesterday the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing announced a major investment to tackle the doctor shortage.
These bills deliver access to the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the MBS, and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule, the PBS, for midwives and nurse practitioners for the first time in Australia. These bills will also provide Commonwealth support for indemnity insurance for midwives who, as we are aware, have been unable to access insurance since 2002. This opens the way forward for improving access to maternity services, improved choice for women in maternity services and improved access to services provided by nurse practitioners. Put simply, this recognises the skill and expertise of nurse practitioners and midwives, which is long overdue recognition, and provides better services to the community.
The government has always been clear about the fact that these arrangements will need to be provided collaboratively with other health professionals. The Minister for Health and Ageing circulated amendments that reflect this intention, and I can confirm that we will not be proceeding with the amendment on the insurance bill and I will formally withdraw that at the appropriate time. The arrangements that these bills bring in do not cover homebirths. However, they do not take away any current right and they do not make homebirths unlawful. Privately practising midwives who are unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance for attending a homebirth will benefit from an exemption from the requirement under the new national registration and accreditation scheme to hold indemnity insurance for a two-year period, until June 2012. The framework for accessing the exemption is being developed by the Victorian government and has just been the subject of consultation.
The government recognises the importance of these arrangements to midwives, women and their families around the country. It also recognises the significant time and effort put in by their representative stakeholders. The government is looking forward to continuing to develop the details of the collaborative arrangements with stakeholders and to implementing this exciting reform in the coming months. It is vital to emphasise a point which I think the opposition has now acknowledged: that to vote against this package of bills would prevent a major expansion of services to many hundreds of thousands of women and prevent the establishment of any type of indemnity insurance for midwives. The government is committed to supporting Australia’s nurses and midwives who, quite frankly, are the backbone of our health workforce. The changes in these bills are significant and are a practical step in improving access and choice for Australians. We remain extremely proud that we are providing new and innovative options for thousands of women across the country.
In addition, I can provide some response to the second reading amendment moved by the Greens. The government do not accept that amendment. We have been clear about the coverage of these arrangements, as I have said in the summing-up, and we have been instrumental in gaining agreement to a transitional arrangement in the national registration and accreditation arrangements. This means that homebirth will not be outlawed or driven underground. We will continue to work with all stakeholders on these significant maternity services reforms and closely monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangements. With these closing remarks can I again thank all the senators for their contributions to the second reading debate. I commend the bills to the Senate.
 (Senator Hurley)—The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Siewert be agreed to.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-03-16,"—I rise to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill 2009. This bill implements changes to create a national consumer law, provide protection against unfair terms in standard form contracts and increase the range of powers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, in enforcing the Consumer Law. The Trade Practices Act will be amended to establish a new schedule called the Australian Consumer Law. The states and territories will then implement the Australian Consumer Law by way of mirror legislation.
These changes are the result of a process started in 2006. In that year the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, asked the Productivity Commission to undertake a broad-ranging review of Australia’s consumer policy framework. The changes in this bill reflect the recommendations of that report and the subsequent discussions between the current government and state and territory governments. At the outset, I would like to recognise the contribution made by Minister Emerson—and you would rarely hear me say that—in progressing these changes and the open and cooperative way in which he and his team have dealt with the coalition’s views and concerns—and he should treasure those comments as well.
The coalition broadly supports this bill but it retains concerns in some specific areas. I will go through the amendments that the coalition proposes. Australia’s consumer laws are generally sound and the vast majority of consumer transactions in this country are concluded satisfactorily, but significant changes in consumer markets over the past two decades necessitate the broad changes proposed in this bill. Foremost among these is the increasingly national nature of consumer markets. Around 50 per cent of consumer needs are now met by suppliers operating in multiple jurisdictions. Even small suppliers can now sell over the internet to people miles away. It therefore makes no sense to persist with differences between states in our consumer laws.
Secondly, the range of products that consumers now choose from have become increasingly complex. Standard form contracts now proliferate for mobile phones, credit cards, computer software and electricity and telecommunications services. Most of these products are recent inventions or, as in the case of utility services, until recently consumers could not choose between suppliers. The other marked characteristic of these types of products is their inherent complexity. The average consumer no doubt struggles to understand all of the clauses in these types of contracts, let alone has the wherewithal to negotiate for a better deal. It is likely that these changes to consumer markets will only accelerate over time as consumer markets become increasingly global in nature and the variety of products available grows. Accordingly, Australia can no longer afford a fragmented consumer policy framework divided along state boundaries. For this reason the coalition supports the creation of a national consumer law. This bill replaces the differing regimes currently operating in each state and territory across the country. Businesses and consumers bear the costs of these differing regimes; they create unnecessary compliance burdens for business, they can add to the costs or they restrict growth. Consumers are the ultimate losers in the resulting higher prices or reduced amount of choice. A national consumer law will bring benefits by reducing complexities, confusion and costs and providing more clarity about rights and obligations wherever goods and services are bought or sold.
As noted earlier, consumers are increasingly being offered non-negotiable, take-it-or-leave-it standard form contracts. At times these contracts include clauses that allow the supplier to unilaterally vary terms and conditions without the option for the consumer to subsequently rescind the contract. Another example is clauses that allow the supplier to cancel the contract before its term, which the consumer may find unreasonable. In any case, standard form contracts are increasingly lengthy and complex. No doubt consumers often enter such contracts without a full understanding of all the conditions. Standard form contracts would be more often signed than read.
Though it is clear that standard form contracts are widespread, it is less clear that they actually cause substantial amounts of consumer detriment. Clearly, standard form contracts can be beneficial to consumers. I certainly would not want to negotiate the terms and conditions of a contract every time I went out to buy a new mobile phone or hire a car. The reason we can generally be confident of entering standard form contracts is that there will always be a minority of consumers who take a ‘buyer beware’ approach and shop around for a better deal or a less onerous contract.
In principle, we would instinctively wish to strengthen the hand of consumers to discipline those businesses which provide inferior terms and conditions. In practice, though, there is not always the ability for consumers to shop around. Many standard form contracts are the same across an industry. There is little point in the buyer being aware and shopping around if the consumer has no alternative. In this context, laws that provide protection against clearly unfair terms and conditions have the potential to increase consumer confidence in entering these contracts. Equally, though, a too onerous imposition of constraints on standard form contracts may increase costs and prices. Under this bill, a term will be unfair where there is significant imbalance between the parties’ rights and obligations and the term is not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the supplier.
I will point out three crucial aspects of the detail of the law. First, this bill allows particular terms to be prohibited by regulation, though no prohibited terms have been declared at this time. This would seem to run counter to other elements of the bill, which require courts to take into account the transparency of a specific term and the context of the term in the contract as a whole.
Second, this bill reverses the normal onus of proof that would apply. It will be for the party advantaged by a term, usually a business, to rebut the presumption that the term is not reasonably necessary to protect its legitimate interests. The business must also rebut the presumption that the contract is in the standard form. The coalition is concerned that these provisions subject businesses to the possibility of frivolous and vexatious claims.
Third, some have expressed concerns that there is no requirement in this bill for a consumer to show that actual detriment would occur. The coalition is sympathetic to industry views that the bill’s reference to ‘a substantial likelihood of detriment’ creates an unacceptable degree of risk and uncertainty for businesses and consumers. As the bill is currently drafted, there is no requirement that the term actually create detriment for it to be unfair. It will be unclear to those entering a contract which terms may be judged to be likely to cause detriment. The coalition has proposed amendments in response to these issues, which I will go through later.
The original proposal for this bill extended the application of the unfair terms law to business-to-business contracts. This had been agreed to by cabinet and was in accord with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission, but then Minister Emerson gained responsibility for the portfolio and within days he exempted business-to-business contracts. The minister’s reason for this was that, in his view, including business-to-business contracts would create uncertainty in business dealings, would potentially increase costs and would possibly jeopardise small business funding. All of these arguments could equally apply to business-to-consumer contracts, so there is a paradox in his change of position. The minister’s reasons are unconvincing and he has referred the matter to reviews of the Trade Practices Act and the Franchising Code of Conduct. The minister has now delivered an initial response to the Franchising Code of Conduct review and there is no mention of unfair terms provisions.
A broad section of the small business community was dismayed by the government’s change in direction. For example, the Australian Newsagents Federation has some 2,100 members, nearly all of whom employ fewer than 20 staff and most of whom employ five or fewer. They are subject to standard form contracts in their dealings with major companies such as News Limited, Fairfax and Hallmark Cards. In these contracts, the majority of key contractual terms are presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. For major items of their stock they can go to no other suppliers. In addition, they may be subject to a standard form contract covering the lease of their premises in a shopping centre. This example demonstrates that, in their dealings with larger businesses, small businesses face the same issues as individual consumers. Like individual consumers, they lack the resources to engage the legal and other expertise required to negotiate contracts. Even if they did, they lack the bargaining power to enforce their views. It is self-evident that there is an immense power discrepancy between small businesses and large businesses, which is similar to the discrepancy between consumers and businesses.
In summary, there is a compelling case for regarding small businesses in the same light as consumers when they are buying goods or services to consume themselves or to offer for resale. Small businesses have a dual role in consumer policy: not only do they supply goods and services, they are also consumers in their own right. Small businesses will be the losers in the government’s reversal. The coalition will therefore be taking an active interest in the outcomes of the reviews of the Trade Practices Act and the Franchising Code of Conduct and will wait for the government’s response to those reviews.
The bill will give the ACCC and ASIC broader powers to enforce the consumer law. Under this bill, the ACCC and ASIC will be able to seek civil pecuniary penalties for unconscionable conduct and participation in pyramid selling, and for breaches of product safety, product information and substantiation notices, as defined by the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The maximum penalty will be $1.1 million for corporations and $220,000 for individuals. The explanatory memorandum to this bill states that this will fill a significant gap in the range of enforcement options available to the ACCC and ASIC. Current consumer protection provisions are enforced through civil remedies such as injunctions and other orders and, in certain circumstances, criminal sanctions. Civil pecuniary penalties currently apply for breaches of the restrictive trade practices provisions of the Trade Practices Act.
The ACCC and ASIC will also be able to seek disqualification orders or issue substantiation, infringement and public warning notices. Where circumstances warrant it, disqualification orders will ban people who disregard the consumer protection laws from being a director of a company. When issued, substantiation notices will require a person to provide the relevant information and documents capable of substantiating claims or representations made by that person. Infringement notices will allow the ACCC and ASIC to deal with minor breaches of the law through the payment of an amount that avoids costly legal proceedings. Public warning notices will allow the ACCC and ASIC to warn the public about actual or likely harm that my result from suspected breaches of the consumer laws. The ACCC and ASIC will not have immunity from defamation actions in relation to these notices.
Finally, under this bill, a court will be able to order the payment of refunds and similar forms of redress without the need for all consumers affected to be named as parties to the regulator’s court proceedings. The enforcement provisions of this bill greatly increase the powers of the ACCC and ASIC to act not just as a cop on the beat but also as a judge and jury. The coalition has concerns about the way the ACCC may apply these powers in a quasi-judicial role. Its application last year of anti-cartel measures continues to cause some concern.
I note that, despite giving the ACCC and ASIC significant additional powers, the government has not trusted individual consumers with similar extensions. Under this bill, consumers will not be able to take action on unfair terms directly to the courts. Instead, they must first complain to the ACCC or ASIC, who will then decide whether to take the matters further. So they are once more precluded from taking a direct path to progress their case. This is a strange decision to disenfranchise individual consumers. Consumers and small businesses can already take action directly under the unconscionable conduct provisions and other parts of the Trade Practices Act. It is unclear why they have not been trusted with a similar scope in this instance. Further, in their submissions to the Productivity Commission’s inquiry, the ACCC was sceptical of introducing unfair terms legislation. How committed will they be then to taking further action under these provisions? The coalition favours measures that result in appropriate and timely redress, but will watch very carefully the operation of these new enforcement powers. We will also closely examine the appetites of the ACCC and ASIC for taking appropriate action against unfair terms in standard form contracts.
I turn now to the specific amendments that the coalition proposes. The coalition wants three amendments. Two of these have been agreed with Minister Emerson, working with my colleagues in the lower house, and we thank him for the open and cooperative manner in which he approached the negotiations. First, we propose to delete clause 6, which relates to the prohibition of prescribed terms. Second, we propose to change the wording of clause 6(2)(a), which asks the court to consider the detriment that a contract would cause.
However, we also asked for one amendment not agreed to by Minister Emerson and we will be moving this amendment to the legislation. We propose to delete clauses 3(4) and 7(1), which reverse the onus of proof in establishing that the term is in the legitimate interests of the supplier and that the contract is in standard form. As I mentioned earlier, the coalition is concerned about the reversal of the onus of proof. We consider that reversing the onus will allow litigation from consumers in circumstances where they merely do not like the terms of the contract and no longer wish to be bound by them. Forcing a party to prove the fairness of a contract against frivolous claims will open Australian businesses up to costly litigation. The costs of this litigation might flow on to the costs of goods and services. As such, the coalition thinks that reversing the onus will have unintended consequences on the Australian economy. Our amendments will improve the legislation to get a better outcome for consumers and business across Australia.
As I stated at the beginning of my speech, in general we support the bill, both in its general aim of creating a national Australian consumer law and its specific aim of strengthening the hand of the consumer, where the ability to choose is limited by the use of standard form contracts. With the coalition’s amendments, this bill promises to increase protection for consumers without jeopardising the lower compliance costs for businesses that will result from establishing a national consumer law.
In closing, I would like to also acknowledge the assistance given by those members in the other place and the continued support of the Senate Economics Committee—no doubt the most powerful and substantial committee in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2010-03-16,"—I rise to also speak to the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill 2009 and note that I have been waiting to do so since at least November—it has been in the red every week since November. It is good to see that the government has finally got its priorities in order to enable a bill to be debated which may have some chance of being passed.
There are clearly circumstances where two parties to a standard form contract have unequal bargaining power and the party with the greater bargaining power includes terms which may prove to be unfair to the party holding less power. There is no doubt that at times this imbalance of bargaining power has been employed, and it continues to be employed, by unscrupulous businesses to the unfair detriment of consumers and, at times, small businesses. In my view, the consequences of such action by an unscrupulous party justify intervention by legislators to protect the unfairly impacted party from the consequences of having to comply with unfair terms.
In an overall sense, I am persuaded by the arguments of the Law Council of Tasmania and others at the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into this bill that the circumstances as to what constitutes ‘unequal bargaining power’ and ‘unfair’ will vary depending on the circumstances relating to each of the parties, their reasons for entering the contract and their level of understanding and ability to consider and accept the consequences of the terms to which they are agreeing. As such, I am of the view that the principles-based approach to addressing the very real mischief that needs to be addressed may prove to be unsophisticated in practice, may lead to the creation of unnecessary uncertainty for both business and consumers, may actually preclude many terms in contracts that are, in the circumstances, fair, and may even allow the inclusion as fair of some terms that, were the particular circumstances to be examined, could be considered unfair.
I welcome the move to nationalise the approach to consumer protection in the area of consumer trade law and recognise that the rationalisation of jurisdictions dealing with this issue will result in some savings for businesses that operate across state borders. However, I am also of the opinion that the problems in compliance and certainty introduced as part of this legislation will add to the costs of many of the goods and services provided under the standard form contracts affected. Ultimately, this cost will be passed on to all consumers of such goods and services as a cost of addressing actual detriment to a subset of such consumers, and, more pointedly in the context of the legislation as written, as a cost of addressing the possibility of detriment arising from the mere presence of an unfair term in such a contract.
A number of specific matters were put forward by submitters to the economics inquiry that raise issues in my mind with respect to the effect of the proposed legislation. The primary issue raised by all business submitters was that of uncertainty. On the basis of the evidence received, it is arguable that anyone who signs up to a standard form contract—as alluded to by Senator Joyce—will be able to allege that its terms were unfair if they find later that they do not like the contract, they do not like the product, a new product comes out and they want to get that, their circumstances have changed, or for any other reason they no longer wish to remain a party to that contract. Under this bill, once they have alleged that such a contract contains unfair terms, the onus of proof shifts entirely to the business to prove otherwise. This is clearly a recipe for anyone not wanting to meet their obligations under a standard term contract to make an unfair allegation and thereby shift the onus of proving the contract is fair onto the other party. The clear impact of this will be the removal of any degree of certainty a business might assume would apply upon such a contract being entered. Let’s face it: that is the reason parties enter standard form contracts, or any contract really—to set out, for certainty’s sake, the basis on which two or more parties will conduct a transaction. If that degree of certainty is removed, it will render many, if not all, forms of standard form contracts unenforceable.
If the legislation turns out to have this impact, the primary advantage of standard form contracts—that being the removal of the costs and the time involved in negotiating the respective rights of parties for common goods and services, which coincidentally reduces transaction costs and, hence, prices—would evaporate. The only possible outcome then would be a revision of the manner and terms on which parties to such transactions contract or higher prices for those goods and services.
Uncertainty resulting from this legislation is exacerbated by the lack of a clear definition for the terms ‘standard form contract’ and ‘company’s legitimate interests’. This lack of certainty also increases the personal risk to directors of companies, who will no longer be able to rely on the enforceability or even legality of standard form contracts drafted by their employees.
Issues were also raised during the inquiry regarding the start dates of the obligations under the proposed legislation. If business as a whole is to ensure that its standard form contracts are fully reviewed and brought into line with what they understand to be required, longer lead times will be required than have been provided—particularly given the uncertainty surrounding definitions and what needs to be included to ensure that such contracts comply with the legislation. It seems to me that a longer transition period, maybe 12 months, would be more workable. In this regard it is worth noting evidence that it took some 12 months for the disruption caused by the introduction of equivalent provisions in both the UK and Victorian legislation to work through the consequent confusion caused by the lack of clarity in the definition of what constituted an unfair term. It is also worth noting that, as also noted by Senator Joyce, the government’s reasoning for removal of business-to-business contracts from the effect of this legislation was that it was too vague and likely to lead to uncertainty. Surely, if this is the case between businesses, it could be said to also apply to standard form contracts between businesses and consumers.
Many industry sectors are already very heavily regulated, including, but not limited to, the insurance industry, which has long been regulated in reflection of the potential for insureds to be treated unfairly as a consequence of differing levels of bargaining power, and more recently the financial services sector has also come under heavy regulation. In recognition of the specific protections already built into the insurance legislation, the insurance sector has been exempted from the effect of this legislation. This is a controversial decision but in my opinion the correct one. Although I acknowledge there remain many issues of unfairness in the way some insurance contracts are applied, I do not consider this proposed legislation to be the best way of addressing those issues. In many cases it is the application of insurance terms that is unfair, not necessarily the terms themselves, and it is this that needs to be better addressed in the context of the regulation of the insurance industry. In that context it is worth noting evidence from the Insurance Council of Australia that over 98 per cent of insurance claims are paid out without question and only 0.065 per cent of claims go to the Insurance Ombudsman. In terms of the financial services industry, it seems to me that there is a strong case that their current and very recent regulation requires them already, through their fiduciary and common law obligations, to treat their clients fairly and, indeed, to prefer the rights of investors over those of their shareholders. It may be that extending this legislation to cover their industry will not add to existing consumer protection but will add to the cost of the services they provide to consumers, costs that will again ultimately have to be paid by consumers.
These two examples highlight my preferred approach to addressing the issue of unscrupulous exploitation of unequal bargaining power in standard form contracts. That is, in those industries that are already regulated, I am persuaded that it would be preferable to use that regulation to ensure that consumers are treated fairly. If the current legislation is not up to scratch then tweak it so that it is. Where industries are not regulated, it would be appropriate to apply such a law as proposed as a ‘catch-all’ to ensure all remaining consumers are protected from unfair provisions, subject, of course, to fixing the issues highlighted by Senator Joyce and me today.
Professor Zumbo at the hearing suggested that one way to improve certainty is to provide what he described as ‘safe harbours’. As the legislation currently stands, there is scope for grey lists to be compiled with terms that may or may not be unfair. This fails to provide any certainty, and in fact the identification of terms that might be considered unfair will probably add to uncertainty. As I understand it, Professor Zumbo suggests that if a business were able to get their standard form contract signed off as compliant with the Australian Consumer Law by an appropriate regulator, with such a sign-off providing them with protection against an unfair term allegation, it would vastly improve business certainty. Despite my view that what is actually unfair depends on the specific circumstances of a case, I am attracted to Professor Zumbo’s suggestion as it would significantly improve certainty of the enforceability of contracts if a general test of unfairness could be applied to standard form contracts prior to their being entered into.
Evidence was also received at the inquiry that there is a need for the Australian Consumer Law to cover business to business transactions. It is clear to me that there are also situations where small businesses lack bargaining power, are effectively ‘consumers’, and are just as subject as individuals to unscrupulous activities when entering into standard form contracts. Indeed, in many circumstances, busy small business operators can be easier prey for the unscrupulous than well-informed consumers. As such, there is clearly a need for a legislative framework that provides equivalent relief for small business from inappropriate and unfair contract terms in situations where there is clearly unequal bargaining power. The Australian Consumer Law as proposed, however, may not deliver that relief in a way that will be of net benefit to either of the parties involved, for the reasons already discussed, whether in respect of individual consumers or business, and in that sense the removal of business-to-business contracts from the scope of the proposed legislation was probably, in my view, the correct decision.
At the hearings Treasury was asked about the extent to which existing remedies contained in the Trade Practices Act already provided protection against unscrupulous conduct of the sort the proposed legislation is intended to curb, such as that provided under section 51AB. Treasury’s view was that the proposed unfair contracts aspect of the Australian Consumer Law would provide additional avenues of redress for consumers. Other witnesses stated that the section 51AB remedies were rarely used, in part because of cost, and also because they possibly are not fully tested in terms of their ability to offer remedies for matters such as unscrupulous behaviour by a party with unequal bargaining power in a standard form contract. Of interest is the evidence by Treasury that all remedies available to be pursued under the Australian Consumer Law can be pursued in state based forums. As such, one of the major benefits that I see in this legislation is that it has the potential to reduce to a significant extent one of the major barriers to justice, that being the cost and ease of access to it. Because those with unscrupulous intentions often fail to pay the degree of attention to legal requirements than those of more pure intentions, I consider that in many ways this is a more important development, as it would vitally improve the ability of consumers, individuals and small businesses, who are the victims of unscrupulous dealings to have access to remedies. If state jurisdictions ensure there are appropriate low-cost dispute resolution forums in place that offer consumers access to all remedies available under the Australian Consumer Law, it may well be the case that remedies such as those already contained in section 51AB may prove far more effective than they have so far proven to be.
The proposed Australian Consumer Law is in itself a significant step forward in terms of consumer protection. However, with respect to the unfair contracts section of the proposed Australian Consumer Law, it is my view that the specifics of that proposal do not provide the best way to address the very real and serious issues that do occur between parties of unequal bargaining power, as the uncertainty and other consequences appear likely to be to the benefit of neither party. Many industry sectors are already regulated. To the extent that the regulation fails to fully address unfair contract issues within each of those sectors, consideration should be given to amendments to those regulations to provide a fair balance.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2010-03-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Faulkner) to questions without notice asked by Senators Humphries and Johnston today relating to asylum seekers.
Incompetence in public policy is often very difficult to see, in a walking, living, breathing sense. Incompetence and ignorance are the principal ingredients that Labor ministers have, of recent times, been bringing to public policy. The government’s border protection policy is a classic example of a policy effected by an enormous amount of incompetence. Can I say that ceiling insulation, the solar rebate and solar hot water system schemes, green loans, school halls, the Auditor-General’s report on the NBN mark 1 and, of course, the emissions trading scheme, are but a few examples of gross public policy incompetence.
Border protection is another example of the simple ignorance of dozy and lethargic ministers with a complete lack of capacity to put themselves across the detail of the portfolio. This year 24 boats and 1,200 people have arrived illegally in Australia, in the last 10 weeks. This is all because the Rudd government dismantled the previous scheme inaugurated by the Howard government. The situation has become so dire and so out of control that we will shortly be processing people in Darwin.
The costs have blown out. By July of this year the government will have spent in excess of $230 million, in Christmas Island, which was not budgeted for. The total extent of this policy failure since August 2008 has been 92 vessels and 4,166 people. I pause to say that many of these people have traversed some 3,000 nautical miles from Sri Lanka. As of today, what is the government’s response to this matter? As of today, what is their policy initiative? Where is their movement to a solution to this policy? There is none. They sit there saying, ‘Mr Howard had the same problem more than eight years ago.’ That is simply an underlining of the level of incompetence and the level of disparagement of the problem and it shows a failure to perceive that there is a huge potential for a humanitarian disaster in the 3,000-mile air-sea gap between Sri Lanka and the north-west coast of Australia.
Just like in ceiling insulations where people’s lives have been put at risk through fire and electrified roofs, our Navy personnel have been exposed to extraordinary risks in dealing with these people. There is no better example than SIEV36. This is a risk they should not have had to bear. This is a risk that has put young Australian men and women in the Australian Defence Force at risk whilst they board illegal entry vessels and expose themselves to desperate people taking desperate measures. I was very disappointed that the minister did not know precisely, or have at his fingertips, the nature of the injuries sustained by those Navy people on board SIEV36 when it blew up and could not tell me their current state of health. I was extremely disappointed with that. Not only is this a policy failure; it is not a matter at the forefront of the consideration of this most incompetent and callous government.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2010-03-16,"—I rise in response to the taking note of questions from senators opposite on asylum seekers. I am disappointed, Senator Johnston, you could not take up your whole five minutes on this most crucial and important matter that you believe is so central to your re-election at this coming federal election.
—I ran out of time.
—I take that interjection. You finished with at least 31 seconds to go. You could not stand up and give us five minutes of why you believe the position you have taken. Let me just reiterate for the record, as I understand we have done a number of times in this place, that this government still has a policy of excision. This policy has not been changed from the last government to this government—that is, we still excise islands and people who are seeking to arrive here and claim refugee status are taken to Christmas Island. That policy has not changed. We also have a policy of mandatory detention. Once they are taken to Christmas Island, they are mandatorily detained for health, security and identity checks. That policy has not changed. They are processed offshore at Christmas Island. That is also a policy that has not changed. We maintain a very strong anti-people-smuggling stance. People who are seeking to enter this country by refugee status, if they are coming here by boat, can expect to be detained on Christmas Island as part of our excision policy, our mandatory detention policy and our processing offshore policy.
All irregular maritime arrivals are transferred to Christmas Island and, as I said, they are subject to mandatory detention, simply because that is a way in which we can manage health, security and identity checks. We know there is a range of facilities on Christmas Island. The most amazing facility on Christmas Island was that constructed under the Howard government at a cost of over $440 million. It caters for diverse groups. I have been there myself and have had a tour of that centre a number of times now. Family groups and unaccompanied minors are also accommodated on Christmas Island, but we have explicitly banned the detention of children from the immigration detention centre—something that is vehemently different from those who sit opposite who sought to still detain children in detention centres.
Let us have a look at the capacity of Christmas Island and the area to which the opposition would like us to go. On 14 March, there were 1,920 regular maritime arrivals and 23 crew accommodated on Christmas Island. Christmas Island can adequately accommodate this number of arrivals and, as part of the routine contingency planning, this government continues to increase the accommodation capacity on Christmas Island. The current overall capacity is over 2,040. Additional demountables were installed at the detention precinct in late 2009 to further expand the capacity by 212 beds. The capacity will be increased by 400 with the establishment of an additional contingency compound and these works are due to be completed fairly soon, in addition to the demountable accommodation currently used by staff at the Phosphate Hill facility that will be made available for detainees in the near future.
So what we are proving to the general public and to those opposite who refuse to accept, believe or listen is that there is capacity at Christmas Island and we are processing people on Christmas Island, developing the capacity we require. You heard Minister Evans say today that people on Christmas Island are being processed as quickly as possible, in around 115 days, to get their processing applications through. They are moved on, moved off or moved back. We have never shied away from the fact that if they are not genuine refugees they will be sent home. This is a much faster processing time than was ever experienced under the previous government.
We have always said that if there is a need to use the detention facility in Darwin it will be used. This is not news. I have heard Minister Evans repeatedly say that if the Darwin Immigration Detention Centre is needed it will be used to assist with the accommodation of refugees. (Time expired)

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2010-03-16,"—I should not be surprised by the response from those opposite on the issue of asylum seekers. Can you imagine them in a boat where there is water coming in through the corking? All they will do is hand out life jackets. All they seem to do is try to deal with the consequence of their failed policies. Australia is dealing with this policy failure that is ensuring people put their lives and the lives of their families at risk. They are ensuring the livelihoods of those people whose primary business role is to traffic in human misery. They are doing all right out of it—there are no worries about that. They are reading the brochures that say, ‘Come to Australia because we now have changed our policies.’ These guys opposite say, ‘The only issue with our policy is that we don’t have enough places to put them.’ What they are focusing on is: ‘Can we make Darwin bigger? We always knew they were going to go to Darwin.’ The only issue we are going to see from the other side is where we open up more detention facilities, because those on the other side are completely incapable of understanding that this is about policy and not about detention.
When the Howard government was in government we acknowledge that we went through this process. We had an increase in boats and we changed our policies. We said, ‘We are going to introduce some tough policies that send a clear message that if you are a refugee then you can go into any of the embassies on the way to coming here and seek asylum.’ We put in place processes to assist them with that. We started with a very large number of boats. I can recall that when I first came here, in 2001, we had 19 boats. The next year we had zero. The next year we had three. The next year we had zero. This is what happens.
So I would commend looking at a bit of history to the other side. Change your policies to make those policies disincentives and the people and the boats will stop coming. You have to put your eye on the right ball. You cannot just decide that your only policy response is to go and build bigger facilities. They talked about the Darwin detention facility. I had a little bit to do with that. There was a little bit of tension at the time that it was built. I was assured that this was a facility that was designed and built as a short-term processing facility for those people who came to Australian waters to engage in illegal fishing. That is was it was purposely built for. The level of security was up to exactly that stage.
I had someone ring me the other day who said, ‘When this opens up, Nigel, are those people who blew that SIEV up going to come here?’ I said, ‘Why are you concerned?’ He said, ‘Don’t you remember reading in the paper how they all walked out, went and had lunch or something, decided that it was all too hard and came back for supper?’ I said: ‘Oh, yeah. Well, I’m not really sure what they’ve done with the security.’ I said that I was sure that it would be all right.
This is complete and utter bungling. If they do not change their policy approach to this, we are going to see increasing numbers of vessels arriving in the future. I acknowledge that this is only a newspaper article, but this newspaper article from today and other media indicate that there may well be quite large numbers of people coming on a couple of boats. Darwin only has the capacity for 550, and that is if you include the surge capacity, which takes it up to 547. If any of these reports are correct—and they are going to be correct, because giving them a 30-day processing visa means that immediately they only have to wait 30 days to get to Australia, which is the outcome that they want and why they are coming—the process has to change. We are going to have more and more people and we are going to be wondering where to put them. But where to put them is not the problem. The sugar is the problem, as the Indonesians would tell us. We have policies that invite people to come to Australia.
It does not seem to matter what program we have—whether it is the ETS, the NBN, insulation, the tragedy of the SIHIP program in Indigenous housing, the Julia Gillard memorial halls program—all of them have been run with ineptitude. On every level, it is embarrassing internationally that every single program that those opposite have decided that they are going to put in place as one of their policies has failed miserably. They have not got the grunt to be able to manage these programs. Border protection, sadly, just grows on the line. We are now expecting another influx of people and all those in the Labor Party can do is flail around and say, ‘My God, I wonder where we’re going to put these poor souls.’ They had better find more and more accommodation, because without a change in policy the people and the boats will keep coming.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-03-16,"—Today, we heard questions from those opposite directed to Senator Faulkner about concerns expressed about a coroner’s report that is due out tomorrow. I found that quite perplexing, given that surely we are patient enough to see what sort of findings the coroner might deliver about that unfortunate event. I am more concerned, however, about the debate that the opposition is prosecuting, which seems to be consistent with the view that they took in 2001. At that particular election the then government used this as an election platform to run on. It certainly disturbed me when the placards of John Howard demanding that we say who will come to this country and on what terms were distributed during that election. I had friends going into the polling booths on that particular day disturbed by the type of position that the then government had taken. To this day, I take offence that the opposition is trying to prosecute that type of belief and scaremongering out among the public, regardless of the facts.
The facts are that, as indicated today by Senator Evans, the highest number of boat arrivals on record were under the John Howard Liberal government in 2001. Reflecting on those numbers, 5,516 people arrived in 43 boats. During the months of August and September in 2001, we saw more than 2,200 people arrive in 10 boats. All of us were present in the other place last week—in fact, a week ago today—where we heard from the President of Indonesia. In his speech, he gave a commitment to work with Australia in combating people smuggling. That is a true indication of the corroborative arrangements that the Rudd Labor government has with one of our closest neighbours to assist in combating this problem.
The problem is the people smugglers, not the poor unfortunates who in these boats trying to make it to our shores. No-one can blame them for wanting to take the trip from countries like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. We have taken a stance. The stance is that, although we take a firm stance on people smuggling, we are guided by what is expected of us as a nation under UNHCR rules. We will ensure that we conduct ourselves appropriately and use mechanisms that are suitable for humane acceptance and processing of these people.
I will go to some of the history of people-smuggling. In particular, I want to reflect back on what former Liberal immigration minister Philip Ruddock said in 1999:
It is timely to remember that the use of people smugglers to get around a country’s rules about who can come and who can stay is a worldwide problem. Australia is not alone. We are also seeing large numbers of people seeking asylum in developed countries—people from the same groups as we are seeing in Australia. For example, Iraqi asylum-seekers are registered in 77 countries and last year—
which would have been 1998
—there were over 34 000 applications for asylum lodged by Iraqis in 19 European countries.
So even back then there were problems associated with asylum seekers wanting to gain access to other countries throughout the world. It is not a problem that is going to go away overnight. It is a problem on which we need to work together and find a solution. The government is on the path to reaching a solution as to how we deal with it. In fact, if we look at the 2009-10 budget—and I recall that just yesterday Senator Evans spoke about the forthcoming budget, but if we look at 2009-10—an additional $654 million was dedicated to upholding the government’s strategy to combat people-smuggling as part of the Rudd government’s $1.3 billion strategy to strengthen national security and border protection overall. This government is serious about combating this problem, and we will continue to combat the problem to resolve this issue. (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2010-03-16,"—As both Senator Johnston and Senator Scullion said, the failure of the Rudd government’s border protection policy is just another one of the typical policy failures of this government—the pink batts story, where nothing was thought through or planned properly and which has turned into a disaster, and other policies of this government. It shows a lack of planning, a lack of commitment and a lack of real determination to solve the problem.
The boats do not lie. They are a continuous reminder of the Rudd government’s policy failure and refusal to accept responsibility for a problem of their own making. The people smugglers have wasted no time in sending another message to the Rudd government. Ninety boats have now arrived in Australia since the Rudd government first started rolling back the strong border protection policies inherited from the coalition government led by John Howard. The boats are now arriving at a rate of more than two per week.
—Might as well put a tunnel in.
—As Senator Parry says, we might as well put a tunnel in. It would be so much easier than crossing the sea. Probably something like the Chunnel between England and France would do the trick, but it would be very difficult. Senator Parry, in making that statement, is pointing out that it is now very, very easy for refugees to make their way to Australia. There is no impediment at all; you just sail down to Christmas Island, you pull up at the wharf, you get put into accommodation, your claims are processed and in due course, it seems, you are allowed to stay in Australia.
Australia has a very good record of dealing with refugees. In the time after World War II Australia, along with Canada and the United States, took a lot of refugees from the displaced persons camps of Eastern Europe. We have a very fine and respectable record. But we have always had an orderly program of accepting refugees. We make sure that the refugees who come to this country have identity checks, checks of their police records to make sure that they are not kidnappers or murderers on the run and, of course, security and health checks. That is the way we should be conducting our refugee intake. But, unfortunately, rather than setting up an arrangement for the orderly processing of the people who want to come to this country as refugees, the Rudd government, it seems, has just opened the floodgates to people who are prepared to get in little boats and sail down from Indonesia and across from Sri Lanka.
I do not think that is good enough. The answer to this sort of problem is, surely, a regional solution. We need to be working with our regional neighbours: with Indonesia, with the government of Sri Lanka and with the governments of other countries in this region that the refugees are setting out from. We did have a fairly good arrangement with the Indonesians. They have always been willing and cooperative partners in combining with Australia to do their best to ensure that the number of refugees coming down here is minimised. But this program has failed. The Rudd government has unwound the fairly strict policies of the Howard government, and the people smugglers, on behalf of the refugees, see Australia as now having what amounts to an open door policy. They know that if they just put people in a boat and send them down to Christmas Island, those people will probably be given refugee status.
One must ask the cost of all this. What is the burden to the Australian taxpayer? We are told that there has already been a $132 million blow-out in the cost of processing illegal arrivals at Christmas Island and that it is going to cost a lot more to open up the Darwin detention centre. In fact, it is estimated that over the year 2009-10 the additional cost will be over $1 billion. That is quite outrageous. It is time the Rudd government got its act together to strengthen our borders and maintain the sort of security that the Howard government— (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2010-03-16,"—by leave—It seems, Senator Brown, that there may have been an oversight. I asked my staff to contact the various Independents, and obviously the Greens as well, to indicate that I sought from those opposite additional time to deal with government business in the program this week. It involved two 30-minutes slots for government documents. The opposition indicated that that was okay and, on that basis, I proceeded with the motion. I also seek your concurrence so that we can deal with some of the legislative program this week and allow debate.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-03-16,"—by leave—I will agree to that move, but I must say here that this is effectively the government taking one hour of time when members can discuss government documents to give to government business. But there is no reciprocation from the government here on private members’ business so that the big backlog of bills—and some of them are very important pieces of legislation that are not the government’s—get a go. I say to the government that it is testing the Senate to be simply expanding government business in a year in which it sets sittings at an almost record low period of time without any quid pro quo for proper consideration of the pile-up of legislation that comes from members other than the government in this place.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,9,1

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-03-16,"—I move:
“That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The failure of the Rudd Government’s paid parental leave scheme to support parents for the World Health Organisation’s recommended minimum of 6 months, and to address the great inequity between male and female retirement incomes.”
I rise today to speak on an important issue. The reason I have moved this motion is that it is clear that Australia is in the midst of a debate, not about whether we should have paid parental leave in order to support working families in Australia but about what type of paid parental leave that should be and what that form of support should look like. The only piece of current legislation before the Australian parliament is the bill that I introduced in this very same place almost a year ago. While we have not been able to debate that bill, because it was moved as a private senator’s bill, that bill outlined a plan forward for paid parental leave. It was offering six months plus superannuation at the minimum wage. When I introduced this bill, we were yet to see any commitment from the government or the opposition as to this issue. Haven’t we come far! We now have a commitment from the Rudd Labor government for an 18-week scheme and of course we now have a commitment from the opposition, the coalition, for a scheme of 26 weeks with superannuation at replacement income paid for by big business. While we are still waiting to see the legislation for either the government’s scheme or the opposition’s scheme, what we do know is that by the end of this year parents need to know what type of support they will get and what type of scheme they should be looking forward to. Hopefully, Australia can again hold its head high among our OECD brothers and sisters in being able to say, ‘Yes, Australia too believes that paid parental leave is an important aspect of any workforce participation action plan and of course support for working families.’
Australia lags far behind the rest of the OECD countries in relation to paid parental leave. It is often said that Australia is one of only two countries that do not offer a paid parental leave scheme, Australia and the United States. But of course even in the United States 50 per cent of women have access to some type of government funded system through various US states that offer a government funded scheme. It is just not universal across the federation. Of course here in Australia we have nothing. There is no government funded paid parental leave scheme unless of course you work in the public service. Federally we offer 14 weeks for mothers to be able to take time off with their babies. It is a really important step for Australia to take when we know that we have one of the lowest female participation rates in the OECD. Where does that drop in female participation come in, despite the fact that over 63 per cent of our graduates are women? It is during the child-bearing years. It is during that time when women are forced out of the workforce to have their child and that attachment to the workplace is lost because we do not have a properly funded scheme. In other countries around the world which have had schemes in place for quite some time, that female workplace participation rate is brought up and correlates with that level of support that they are given by their federal governments.
It is time for Australian mums and dads to have the best possible paid parental leave scheme. While I welcome the commitment from the government to putting something on the table, 18 weeks is pathetic. Eighteen weeks at the minimum wage without superannuation is really nothing more than a rebadged baby bonus. Not just that but the fact that it seems as though it will not even be an amendment to the Fair Work Act but rather an amendment to the Social Security Act means that it really is nothing more than a rebadging of the baby bonus. If we honestly believe that Australian working families—mums and dads, and women in particular—deserve the workplace entitlement of paid parental leave then, of course, it needs to be in the Fair Work Act. That is where all the unpaid maternity leave provisions are. It would make sense to have it in the Fair Work Act.
I look forward to seeing that legislation. We called the government on it yesterday. Let us see it. Let us see that legislation so we can get on and debate it because until now the only piece of legislation sitting in this chamber is that put forward by the Greens—six months plus super at the minimum wage. I would also like to see the detail from the coalition’s policy. It sounds good on face value but we need to see the detail. Where, in reality, are we going to be in 12 months time? I hope that we are able to, in this place, once we see the government legislation, agree on a six-month paid parental leave scheme with superannuation included. The compromise between the government and the opposition’s proposal would be for that to be at the minimum wage.
That seems like a pretty fair compromise to me. If you asked families right around the country if that would be a good way forward, most of them would say ‘yes’. Why should we accept the argument from the government that we should start with a paltry 18-week scheme that we will build on, even though it is only going to be in the Social Security Act? Why should we accept the argument from the government that is where we should start and we should not be asking for any more?
Let us not forget that it has been more than 30 years since we had the last amendment to legislation to provide unpaid parental leave. It has taken over 30 years to get to the point of talking about paid parental leave. I am not prepared to wait another 30 years to increase it to six months. The World Health Organisation, various women’s and children’s associations and unions—not just in Australia but globally—recognise that the minimum must be six months. It needs to be recognised as part of workplace attachment and, therefore, a workplace entitlement. It needs to include superannuation.
Let us touch on the issue of why superannuation is important. It is because we know already that we have generations of people worried about their superannuation to date and about whether they can actually retire. My mum and dad are worried about whether they can retire on their superannuation. I can tell you, the gap between the superannuation levels that men are going to retire on and the levels of superannuation that women are going to retire on are vastly different. Why? It is because of that gap during those child-bearing years. It is absolutely fundamental that any government that is committed to the rights of women in the workplace, to workplace participation and to the rights of people to have a secure retirement through their superannuation, must include, in any type of workplace entitlement, superannuation. That has to be in any type of paid parental leave scheme.
It is a scam by the government to try and convince Australians that 18 weeks without superannuation is anything more than a rebadged, glorified welfare provision otherwise known as the baby bonus. We need to move on from that. We need a paid parental leave scheme that has the guts to deliver the real action and support for parents. It has to be six months; it has to include superannuation. The compromise, I do believe, between the government and the opposition proposals, is that minimum wage component. Let us move forward from there. Let us not settle for something less simply because it does not taste politically nice to the government of the time. Let us strive for something that is worth supporting and worth building on, and that has to be that six-month time frame. Let us not wait another 30 years to have the debate just to make things better.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Paid Parental Leave</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2010-03-16,"—I sincerely hope today that we are not witness to the spectacle of the Greens combining with conservative parties in this country to sabotage the implementation of this much needed, important and progressive policy. Having hooked up with those opposite to defeat the CPRS, I hope they are not, on this issue, seeking to combine with a man who believes climate change is ‘absolute crap’ or to defeat a scheme like they did when they lined up and defeated a scheme that would have, for the first time, put a price on carbon. I hope today they are not lining up with the opposition to sabotage a scheme that will, for the first time, give all working women on low-to-middle incomes access to paid parental leave.
I know the Greens do not think the scheme goes far enough but I hope they are not gearing up to stop the parliament from introducing a paid parental leave scheme from 1 January next year. Just because they believe this scheme does not go far enough, I hope they are not preparing to sabotage it. Playing politics on this scheme could leave Australian women with no ability to plan for pregnancy secure in the knowledge that they will be eligible for leave next year.
I remind senators in this chamber, the Greens and those opposite, that the government’s scheme is based extensively on research and analysis conducted by the Productivity Commission. It has widespread support in the community, amongst business, unions and women’s advocates. Some of these groups would like our scheme to go further and I certainly hope that, in the future, it can. But none of them—unlike the Greens—are stupid enough to believe that nothing is better than something. None of them are reckless enough to sabotage the government’s ready-to-be-implemented scheme for the sake of some flight of fancy concocted by the likes of Abbott—a man who said paid parental leave would be introduced over his dead body.
—Order! You must refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his proper name.
—Mr Abbott?
—Yes.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President, I do believe I said Mr Abbott. This is a man who was a cabinet minister in a government that did nothing about paid parental leave for 12 years. The seasoned campaigners for paid parental leave in our community are not crazy enough to believe that Mr Abbott is going to deliver on this issue. Apparently today that honour is reserved for the Greens, the party that on this issue does not seem to be able to tell left from right and cannot distinguish a practical, progressive policy from an archconservative’s thought bubble. We cannot lose our way on this debate for the sake of big statements such as those embodied in this spurious motion. The government scheme is fully costed and budgeted and has a starting date of 1 January next year.
I urge the Greens not to be led astray again—not on this matter. Let us not miss a historic opportunity to make a real difference. Right now, by far the most important thing about paid parental leave is that we should not let this chamber stand in the way of working mothers in this country receiving paid parental leave as of 1 January next year. Sharan Burrow knows this, Elizabeth Broderick knows this, Heather Ridout knows this, the press gallery knows this, working mothers know it and the Rudd government certainly knows it. This chamber, and indeed the Greens, will be held to account if, spurred on by Tony Abbott’s latest thought bubble, it sabotages the government’s—
—Order! Senator Pratt, you must refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his proper title.
—I beg your pardon. Thank you, Mr Deputy President. The Greens will be held to account if, spurred on by Mr Abbott’s latest thought bubble, they sabotage the government’s scheme for the sake of another opportunity to use this chamber as a soapbox. There is no other fully developed paid parental leave scheme on offer; there is only the government’s—there is only the government scheme or Mr Abbott’s thought bubble, which has not been developed. No real thought has been given by the opposition as to how the scheme will interact with other family payments. This thought bubble is not fully costed, let alone budgeted, and will be paid for by a new tax on larger businesses, although the opposition promised not to fund election promises with new taxes. Presumably, this is why the opposition says this proposed tax on larger business is not a tax; it is a levy—or perhaps an ‘investment in human capital’. It is no wonder that Mr Abbott’s own party room is confused and business in this country is up in arms.
It is not clear which businesses are going to be liable or who is going to pay for the shortfall if the new tax is insufficient to fund Mr Abbott’s promises. It is no wonder that unions, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and women’s advocates are sceptical when the funding mechanism for this scheme is so unclear. Mr Abbott’s thought bubble gives the most support to those who earn the most and gives the least to the many women on low wages and part-time wages—those who currently have the least entitlement to paid parental leave.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Yes, that was the most recent adjustment, Eric.
—There has been a recent adjustment of policy on the run? I stand corrected. Thank you.
The government’s scheme, unlike the opposition’s scheme, will provide paid parental leave at a minimum wage for all those eligible mothers and deliver the greatest gains to women on low incomes. Again, it is no wonder that unions, women’s advocates and the business community have concluded that Mr Abbott’s scheme is more concerned with buying votes, whatever the price tag, than with actually getting down to implementing a workable paid parental leave scheme.
Mr Abbott’s thought bubble has no specific starting date, unlike the government’s scheme. The allegedly forthright Mr Abbott cannot seem to get his spin straight when it comes to the start date for his scheme. He cannot make up his mind about whether it will be within a few months, within a couple of years or sometime in his first term. If it is the latter, working women could be waiting more than three years for paid parental leave. Everyone knows that Mr Abbott will not be able to get a scheme up and running in months, not when so many details are unclear. Contrast that with the way the government has put its scheme together, with the great deal of consultation that has taken place. There is no way that Mr Abbott’s thought bubble is going to give working mothers paid parental leave on 1 January. Senators in this chamber all know in their heart of hearts that only the government’s scheme can do that, and I hope this chamber will not stand in the way.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Paid Parental Leave</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-03-16,"—Paid parental leave is an issue that we need to address as a nation. As is becoming the hallmark of the leadership of the Hon. Tony Abbott MP, he has developed a direct, practical, workable action plan to deal with this issue—an action plan that deals simultaneously with the social and economic imperatives facing our nation. Sixty-two per cent of women about to give birth are in the paid workforce. Therefore, two-thirds of women having children forgo income. Sure, this is a decision of choice, but the evidence is suggesting that many women defer or have fewer or no children because of the financial impact of making such a choice or decision. I pose the question: is it good social policy to limit the number of Australian born children because of financial considerations? Of course not. I also ask: given the Intergenerational report and the need for more young Australians to be engaged in the workforce, does it make good sense to show society’s support with a relatively modest paid parental leave scheme to ease the financial burden on families having children? Of course it does. Finally, given the need for greater participation rates in the workforce, does it make good sense to encourage women to combine paid work with child rearing? The answer again is a resounding: of course it does.
So the coalition’s policy, bold and dynamic as it is, ticks all the boxes for social equity, planning for our nation’s future and economic wellbeing. It is recognised that many Australians make the choice to be full-time homemakers—one of the greatest, most challenging and most rewarding career moves that can be made. I, for one, salute them. I was the beneficiary of such a home. It was a great privilege, and I will always be indebted to my parents for that. We as a coalition will shortly be announcing a specific policy for them. They will not be forgotten. They are often the parents who help build community by helping on school trips, in the tuckshop, in school and community sports clubs or with the elderly in the local community. These homemakers and community builders will not be forgotten under coalition policy.
Some people ask the question: ‘Why does the coalition plan provide six months worth of income to a threshold of $75,000? Does that make some babies worth more than others?’ The answer, of course, is a resounding no. The paid parental leave proposal would reflect the income actually forgone by the parent and bulk up to the minimum wage the incomes of those who work part time. Above the threshold of $75,000, it is less likely that family decisions on having a child or the number of children to have would be so heavily based on forgone income. As I said, this direct, practical action plan is about genuine action dealing with the genuine needs of our fellow Australians. On top of the income support there would be the superannuation support to protect retirement savings.
The simple fact is that a paid parental leave scheme would be an economic stimulus and help future proof the needs of the Australian workforce in terms of both participation and numbers available. It is affordable, but we have seen Labor from Mr Rudd to Ms Gillard squander not millions but billions of dollars on disastrous pink batt schemes employing backpackers installing formaldehyde-ridden pink batts from overseas.
Remember the cash splash, when tens of millions of dollars went overseas? How quickly we forget. We now think of that $78 million having been splashed overseas as just petty cash, but Labor, flushed with the success of that debacle, turned their minds to doing even better. Instead of wasting just $78 million here and there, they lifted the high bar to solar panels, with hundreds of millions of dollars wasted to now billions of dollars wasted on the so-called Building the Education Revolution, pink batts and the interest payable on all the moneys that have been borrowed—and all this from such self-described ‘economic conservatives’ as Mr Rudd. The waste and the reckless spending are reminiscent of that of Messrs Whitlam and Cairns about a generation ago, albeit without all the fun that was attached to the then Whitlam government. However, the waste, the recklessness and the incompetence are all there, as is the party in power—Labor. Without this waste, a paid parental leave scheme, as proposed by the coalition, would be easily affordable and a great investment in our families, workplaces and economic wellbeing.
—Why didn’t you do it, Eric?
—Senator Collins interjects and asks why we didn’t do it when we were in government. We did not do it for one simple reason: we had to pay back $193 billion worth of Labor debt. The Australian Labor Party always want to forget the debt. They always want to forget the debt that they incurred for this nation without introducing paid parental leave. They racked up the debt without even introducing paid parental leave. Given Labor’s recklessness, we have proposed a source of funding on which we are consulting. But seeking the support of Australia’s large companies is based not only on their capacity to pay but also on the fact that they will be the major beneficiaries through increased workforce participation.
What is Labor’s response to all this, having been left flat-footed and wallowing in the wake of Mr Abbott’s announcement? It is to bring in Senator Pratt to claim that Elizabeth Broderick does not support our scheme. I suggest that in the time available Senator Pratt ring the commissioner to find out what the actual position is, and she might like to come back into the chamber to make a clarifying statement.
Mr Shorten, the brains trust of the Labor Party, was on Q&A last night. To Mr Peter Dutton, who accidentally said ‘paid maternity leave’ instead of ‘paid parental leave’, Mr Shorten said:
Yeah, but Peter, just Liberals use the language of the women have got to stay—it’s women’s responsibility …
He tried to make a big point of it. Unfortunately, Mr Shorten forgot that Mr McClelland, the former shadow Attorney-General who is now the Attorney-General, when in opposition and announcing Labor policy said:
The Labor Party is committed to introducing paid maternity leave …
‘Paid maternity leave’ were the words Labor used. Mr Shorten’s response to Mr Dutton was intended as a cutting riposte—there is no other way to attack the coalition’s policy but to seize on an accidental slip of the tongue and say that using the phrase ‘paid maternity leave’ is a heinous crime. But what do we find in Labor’s own documentation? They refer to ‘paid maternity leave’. I dare say that Mr McClelland will now be taken out to re-education classes courtesy of Mr Bill Shorten. Really, the Labor Party are scrambling all over the place on this issue. They have been left wallowing in the wake of Mr Abbott’s bold announcement. It is a bold announcement for the 21st century and something that will assist individual families, society at large and also our economy.
I am very proud to be associated with this forward-looking policy. Never have I seen a government and a leader after only 2½ years in government run out of puff and run out of words. This government is all about words and never about action. We have shown, whether on climate change or on parental leave, that we have the answers. We are ready to step up to the plate in the event that the Australian people support us at the next election. We are ready to take over from Labor.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Paid Parental Leave</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-03-16,"—When it comes to paid parental leave, as on so many other issues, Labor is all talk and no action. We commend the Greens and Senator Hanson-Young, who, along with former Democrat senator Natasha Stott Despoja, have had a long commitment to paid parental leave. If the Rudd Labor government were serious about paid parental leave, we would have seen legislation by now. It is nearly 12 months since they announced their mickey mouse scheme at the last budget. This is yet another example that this government is all talk and no action.
Of course, last week we had a conga line of failed Labor ministers attacking us for blocking legislation and attacking the Senate for obstructing the government from getting its many broken promises and other policy failures through this chamber. You know what, Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett: among them was Minister Jenny Macklin. She was accusing us of blocking Labor’s paid parental leave scheme, except that there is no legislation. Minister, where is the legislation that we are allegedly blocking? If the Rudd government were serious about paid parental leave, they would join us and support the coalition’s proposal for a serious paid parental leave scheme. The coalition’s plan for a national paid parental leave scheme would be good for women, good for families and children and good for our economy moving forward. Our plan for a paid parental leave scheme would help us lift our employment participation rates and it would help us lift our productivity moving forward. These are some of the issues that the Prime Minister himself has pointed out as having been identified in the Intergenerational report.
Tony Abbott’s plan, the coalition’s plan, for a national paid parental leave scheme provides for six months leave at the actual salary level up to a certain threshold. As is pointed out in the motion put forward by Senator Hanson-Young, the World Health Organisation’s recommended minimum for paid parental leave schemes is six months, because that is the recommended minimum period for exclusive breastfeeding and it gives parents and babies time to bond. The coalition’s scheme, put forward by Tony Abbott, is very clearly a superior scheme. Labor’s scheme is a mickey mouse scheme—the sort of scheme that you put forward if you want to tick a box, like a bureaucrat does, and say, ‘We’ve delivered. We promised we would deliver,’ but you do not really. It is a pretend scheme. It is the sort of scheme that you put forward so that you can go out into the community and say, ‘We promised you a paid parental leave scheme. Here it is,’ even though it does not actually properly address the needs of families, children and our economy moving forward.
Have there been any comments supporting our scheme? Have there been any comments out there in the community? I will read just a few: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10—I have about 10 for you.

Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—

—I will run through them, and some of the people might surprise you, Senator Collins. Prominent feminist, Eva Cox, cautiously welcomed the plan. I quote from the Age on 9 March 2010:
I think it’s a game-changer. Whether it comes off or not it’s radical and ambitious and sets a benchmark of 26 weeks instead of the 18 that was originally proposed by Labor.
                …            …            …
If you’re a woman (or man) of baby-making age, it’s a difficult scheme to fault from a personal point of view.
I applaud the time-frame of 6 months and I applaud the idea of the payment being at full wage.
That was in an article by Mia Freedman, in MamaMia, on 10 March 2010.
The national chairwoman of the Women’s Electorate Lobby, Eva Cox, again—
—That’s the same person, now!
—I will give you a further comment:
“The thing I would agree with ... is that the government’s plan is Mickey Mouse,’’ Ms Cox said.
John Sutton from the CFMEU, in the Australian Financial Review, said: ‘I like the fact it asks the corporate sector rather than taxpayers to foot the bill. What I don’t like about Labor’s is it lets employers off scot-free.’ These are your people, Minister. We have allegations from that side attacking us for introducing a supposedly great, big new tax. This is from a government that, long before the global financial crisis, rediscovered spending, taxing and borrowing like drunken sailors. Well before the global financial crisis, the government increased taxes in their first budget by $20 billion. They increased spending in their first budget by $15 billion. They whacked on a $2½ billion additional tax on the North West Shelf Gas project in Western Australia.

Senator Sterle interjecting—

—Senator Sterle should be very embarrassed about the eastern-states-centric performance of this very eastern-states-centric government. The reality is that we would much rather introduce this scheme and fund it out of a surplus, but this reckless-spending government has put the budget in serious deficit. It has lumbered future generations of Australians with serious debt. The responsible way for us to introduce Tony Abbott’s and the coalition’s responsible plan for a paid parental scheme is through a temporary levy on big business. As I said in the introduction, this is an important proposal. It is a positive proposal which would be good news for women, good news for families and children and good news for the Australian economy moving forward.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Paid Parental Leave</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2010-03-16,"—From the debate today, we could all enjoy Tony Abbott’s wonderful social policy adventure. The Greens are obviously on board. If it were not such a serious matter then perhaps we could have such a light debate today. The problem is that this is a very serious matter. As I indicated in the adjournment debate last night—and I probably will not have sufficient time now to go through all of the detail here; I will follow through later this evening—the serious issues at stake here should not be of the nature of the banter that we have just been enjoying. When we go back and look at the history of this matter—and perhaps Senator Hanson-Young might absorb some of the aspects here—we can see that, yes, it is definitely about time we acted. But suggesting that there has been no action in Australia for 30 years is a bit rich.
I remember the very first thing I did in this chamber when I entered in 1995. I was six months pregnant at the time. Personally, I would not have been entitled, but that was when a Labor government introduced a maternity allowance in Australia. That maternity allowance, as Senator Hanson-Young will acknowledge, was based on welfare related payments, although they were not to be means tested against a spouse’s income, and they introduced for the first time as an entitlement for women in the immediate period before and after childbirth. That was back in 1995. There were some enhancements to that program when the previous government adjusted it and turned it into what they then characterised as the baby bonus—a cheap and light tag that I do not think an entitlement of this character should ever have been called, but there were some improvements for women. However, as even Senator Abetz characterised today, there are a lot of gaps in this debate that Tony Abbott has introduced, and I will cover some of them. Before I do that I want to also comment on this procedural farce—or fraud, as I would call it.
The Greens say that they have introduced a bill. Well, how many bills have the Greens introduced? How many bills have ever made legislation? For them to portray this procedural fraud in such a serious policy issue is an outrage. For them also to join with Mr Abbott in sticking his chin out on this particular issue is a joke. All of us could have predicted that in Tony Abbott’s leadership of the opposition he would fairly soon stick his chin out somewhere. He has probably chosen a poor area from my point of view in terms of the issues of policy that I value, but I think he has made a poor judgment on the views of Australian women about these issues also. This is partly why we have various iterations of the policy. Let us run through a few of them and then, if I have time, we will get to the gaps.
How will it be funded? First up, Sharman Stone was working on one which would be funded by taxpayers. But the announcement by Tony Abbott was that it would be funded by a big new tax on big business, which of course Australians all understand will translate to increases in costs and other charges that they themselves will feel very quickly, let alone the technical issues about how you separate these different businesses and the problems that will be created by businesses avoiding getting into those categories to avoid this big, new tax. Apparently now, in the next iteration, if you listen to Julie Bishop, this big new tax will only be temporary. I am a bit confused over exactly who has authority in the Liberal Party. I remember when the shadow minister said there was going to be a $30 increase in pensions and very quickly afterwards she was shut down and that was not going to be the case. So is this going to happen here? Must we wait to see a notice on a Liberal senator’s board—as I did as I walked down the corridor—which is apparently now on their website, before we get further details of the next iteration?
I am very pleased that, as Senator Abetz seemed to indicate, the opposition is now talking to Liz Broderick, because perhaps that explains the next iteration I saw. We are now giving some assurance to part-time working women that they will not miss out on at least the minimum-income level of support, which was the most obvious, glaring gap in this scheme on the first day. Most of the newspaper reports picked it up straightaway. If you are a low-income, part-time working woman—which, let us face it, are most of them—then you are not going to get very much out of this scheme. You are probably going to get less than the minimum wage, if anything, and you will lose out from the Tony Abbott scheme. So, if the opposition has repaired that aspect of their original proposal, that is great. That is very assuring. But of course what is not assuring to the Australian public at large is the credibility factor. Talk about policy on the run: we announce a policy on International Women’s Day, we have not consulted cabinet, we have not consulted business and indeed we probably have not even read the Productivity Commission report that investigated these issues in considerable detail.
The Labor Party has the ambition of 26 weeks leave too. That was part of the Productivity Commission’s brief. But what it also dealt with was a whole myriad of aspects in a fairly complex policy area that needed to be taken into account. I wait to see the next iteration of the opposition’s policy in this respect, because there is still one area that is missing. They are suggesting that their new public funded schema will absorb people’s current entitlements. Why should low-income, part-time working women in retail pay in their taxes dollars to help fund women working in full-time, high-paid, high-level jobs, with reasonable levels of income, through public spending?
I wonder what the next area Tony Abbott is going to come up with that we should introduce full income replacement for. Will there be other areas, apart from parental leave, that he believes should now attract full income replacement? Not only are we going to have middle class welfare; now, according to Tony Abbott, we are going to have higher class welfare. We are going to start funding schemes and absorbing existing entitlements into public spending. Our scheme aims for 26 weeks too. I think the figure was that 90 per cent of women would combine existing entitlements with our 18 weeks and achieve that goal, and certainly we have objectives for the longer term on superannuation and additional support.

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2010-03-16,"—I rise today to speak on the urgency motion, which reads:
The failure of the Rudd Government’s paid parental leave scheme to support parents for the World Health Organisation’s recommended mini-mum of 6 months, and to address the great inequity between male and female retirement incomes.
I really do welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important issue. The Rudd government’s paid parental leave scheme falls well short of the six months recommended by the World Health Organisation and what has been proposed by the coalition. Labor’s scheme quite simply does not meet the financial or maternal needs of families. It falls well short of the real-time, real wages support that a coalition government would deliver. The coalition has proposed a national paid parental leave scheme which would give the principal carer of a newborn baby six months leave at her or his actual salary, capped at an annual salary of $150,000. This is six months of real-time support and real wages.
A paid parental leave scheme should be set at six months because that is the recommended minimum period for exclusive breastfeeding—as a midwife I certainly recommend that to all the mums out there—and it gives parents and babies time to bond. While I am talking about parents and time to bond, I will quote from the transcript of last evening’s Q&A. On that program, Mr Shorten said:
First of all, I was listening to what Peter said—
Peter is Peter Dutton—
and Peter said “paid maternity leave” and this is the first issue I want to get out. Why did Liberals always think that it’s paid “maternity” leave. It’s paid paternity leave.
He continued, ‘Men should have the opportunity if they want to raise their kids too.’ Peter Dutton responded:
And they do. Under this scheme they do.
Mr Shorten then said:
Yeah, but Peter, just Liberals use the language of the women have got to stay - it’s women’s responsibility. The first issue is blokes want to take time off. Certainly, I’ve taken five and a half weeks off at the beginning of this year. It’s a good thing.
I would like to remind those opposite that the Labor scheme does not provide any paternity leave, whereas the coalition scheme provides two weeks of paternity leave. I think that is very, very important.
The funding of the coalition proposal will affect only 3,200 big companies out of an estimated 750,000 companies in Australia—that is, less than one per cent of Australian companies will be levied. There would also be potential offset savings for those large businesses that are already paying some parental leave. Small businesses will not pay the levy and they will not administer it but their employees will benefit. The coalition’s scheme will also be administered by the government. This is unlike Labor’s scheme, which places an administrative burden on small business.
Unfortunately, Labor has spent the surplus that was left by the Howard government. That is why a levy on big business is proposed for the time being—it can be removed later. There have been a number of occasions where a levy was applied and removed later. The paid parental leave scheme should ideally be paid for from a surplus. But because Labor has spent everything that was left in the bank and then run up a huge debt a levy is necessary to fund this program. Examples of previous levies include, in 1996, a 15 per cent superannuation surcharge levy that was applied to high-income earners to fix Mr Beazley’s black hole in the budget. It was then abolished in 2005 after Labor’s debt had been almost paid off. In 1996, a 0.2 per cent levy was placed on the Medicare surcharge for the gun buyback scheme. This levy was abolished after 12 months. In 2001, a $10 levy was placed on airline tickets to cover Ansett employee entitlements. This levy was abolished in 2003. The coalition wants to meet paid parental leave out of a budget surplus, but, unfortunately, there isn’t one. Labor has spent it all with its excessive stimulus spending. So, as we have done in the past, a temporary levy will be used until such time as government can pay for the scheme.
Labor is also doing nothing to address the great inequity between male and female retirement incomes. An issue that disturbs me greatly is the level of financial difficulties for many retired Australian women. Seventy three per cent of single age pensioners are women, and half of all women aged between 45 and 59 have $8,000 or less in their superannuation funds, compared to $31,000 for men. The average super balance in 2004 was $56,400 for men and $23,900 for women. The average retirement payouts in 2004 were $110,000 for men and only $37,000 for women. Quite simply, women in Australia are worse off in retirement. This can quite probably be put down to the fact that older women in our society have had their careers interrupted or did not have the flexibility in work arrangements to be able to meet their family responsibilities. So with this initiative we are going to make sure that women who have had to give up their careers to have a family, which is a very worthwhile exercise, will not end up in later years in the same very sad position that some women of my age have. We cannot go on with this situation and I would like to see more done in that respect.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2010-03-16,"—I am privileged to rise today to speak on this matter of urgency. I would like to speak not only as a responsible government senator but as a former trade unionist who represented a number of women in the airline industry, particularly in Qantas Flight Catering, and also as a parent. I am proud to say that my wife and I have brought up two fantastic kids who are off doing their own thing in the world, now. My wife would have loved to have had the opportunity to have paid maternity leave. We made the decision that we wanted kids and for that there were a lot of sacrifices. This is a wonderful initiative from the government to take the massive step forward to introduce paid maternity leave.
God bless the Greens. I certainly think sometimes they have the best interests of Australia at heart. They are opportunistic at times—one can understand that, because they do not have the numbers—but I will give them the benefit of the doubt when I need to. But they excuse the coalition, who stand up in this chamber when Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, has a thought bubble. He witnessed the latest polling. I do not know how the Liberals do their polling—through their focus groups or whatever—but all of a sudden, wowie, a party officer has found out that the Leader of the Opposition does not connect with young women! Having been photographed in budgie smugglers, which he could not even fill, no wonder he does not connect with the public!
This is a darn disgrace. They had 12 years when they had control of the tills. What did they do? It was very quiet over there. They did not talk about paid maternity leave. Sorry, I have misled the Senate; there was a statement on paid parental leave. It was the now Leader of the Opposition who uttered words something along the lines of ‘over my dead body’. Well, whoopee! They got the latest polls, saw Mr Abbott does not connect with women and thought, ‘My goodness, how can we fool the Australian public into thinking that we’—them over there—‘care for young families, mothers and working women?’ What an absolute farce!
The biggest farce—I was in this chamber last year witnessing it—was the swords-at-dawn caper of the extremist anti emissions trading and climate change mob, who decided to take the swords to their leader at the time, Mr Turnbull, after Mr Turnbull had got it through their caucus that he was going to send off Mr Macfarlane to negotiate with the government to get through an emissions trading scheme. Whoppee! It was great for five or six weeks. I have got to tell you, I was frightened walking through the staff canteen: every time a National or Liberal got near a knife I shuddered! There were knives flying. They could not wait to take out their leader. They took out their leader because of this ‘great big tax’ they were talking about. What do we have here? If $2.7 billion is not a great big tax—strike me down!—what is?
This is absolutely incredible. It is bad for them but it is worse for Australians. But Australian voters will not be fooled. Australian voters can see through the nonsense. The Leader of the Opposition, who took out Mr Turnbull because Mr Turnbull would not consult—he allegedly was not inclusive—has come out, after reading the polling, to make an announcement, but not through his caucus. Mind you, I would not like to take anything to that rabble, anyway.
The Leader of the Opposition did not even consult with big business. I am not in the pocket of big business. I am the last one, as a trade unionist, to ever be accused of being in the pocket of big business. But, my god, what planet are the opposition on? They think that they can impose a 1.7 per cent tax—this monstrous financial slug—on businesses. I will tell you some of the businesses. It is important that people understand what businesses we may be talking about. We are talking about ANZ—wowie, the banks! And the banks will not pass it on, will they? No, no, no!
Then there is Ramsay Health Care. Will the health funds pass the tax on? No, out of the goodness of their hearts they will just wear the 1.7 per cent slug! Then there is McDonald’s. This is getting worse. I mean no disrespect to these companies; they are major employers in this country, and I love major employers because they employ Australian workers. When Australian workers are employed they spend money—and it goes around and around and it is a wonderful situation. Medibank Private is another company that will probably cop the 1.7 per cent monstrous tax slug from that lot over there! Optus will not put the price of phone calls up! How could I be so silly? Look, here is another one that has jumped out at me—Shell Australia. Perish the thought that the big oil companies would pass the tax on! They will wear it; there’s no worries!
But here are the scary parts—these are really scary parts. Myers will be affected. Shopping will be affected, and there are a lot of women employed there. Coles has predominantly female employees. There is Woolworths, but it gets worse—Bunnings and David Jones. We hear the nonsense that the cost will be absorbed and that it will not be passed on. Those who say that are in cuckoo land. I cannot believe it. What planet are they on to believe this?
That mob on the other side of the chamber slagged off at us for our stimulus program to save 200,000 jobs—two MCGs full of workers whose jobs were saved because we initiated the stimulus program. What the heck do they think their policy would do to shoppers and purchasers? Your grog would go up. Consider Tabcorp. Crikey, I’m even going to cop it on my $10 bet on a Saturday. Oh me, oh my! But it gets worse. I will show you how united this lot on the other side of the chamber are! Only three or four hours ago we had the serial pest for breaking ranks, Senator Joyce—I think he holds a front bench spot now; he was gagged last time I heard and he is still gagged but here he is putting out a press release—with the headline ‘Joyce breaks ranks on parental leave’. ABC News reported:
Senator Joyce has agreed the extra tax will feed into the price of goods such as bread and milk ‘in a fashion’.
What the heck does ‘in a fashion’ mean? He clearly says that the tax is going to influence the price of bread, milk, fuel, clothing and everything that we purchase from those top 3,200 employers.
But it was not just Senator Joyce; we have a couple of different people on the other side of politics. I am allowed to call them ‘different’ because their own party calls them different. There is the ‘mad uncle’. We know who that is: the member for O’Connor. He has come out and recognised that it would be a massive big slug. They call him the mad uncle: it is Mr Tuckey. Mind you, it does not matter because all he does is bag everyone. The other is the member for Tangney—this is an interesting one. If Mr Tuckey is the mad uncle—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I think for Senator Sterle to refer to members of the other place by titles such as ‘mad uncle’ is clearly outside the standing orders and he should withdraw those expressions.
 (Senator Barnett)—Senator Sterle, I will ask you to consider your language. I have given you a fair amount of latitude in the last many minutes and I would ask you to withdraw the comment that referred to members in the other place.
—I will withdraw it, but it was not me that tagged him the ‘mad uncle’ but his mate the member for North Sydney. Do you feel better? Dry your eyes, you lot over there, because the truth will not stop. We have another one in the member for Tangney. He has come out and made a fantastic statement in relation to Mr Abbott’s wild thought bubble that translated into: ‘Oh my God, we’re going down in the polls. Women can’t stand me. I’ve got to resurrect this.’ The member for Tangney warned the leader that if he does pre-emptively produce a policy again—without consulting his caucus, I suppose that means—there will be quite a few people lining up to give him a smack. There you go. If the member for O’Connor and the member for Tangney get it and Senator Joyce, our esteemed colleague from Queensland gets it, of the 41 people who did not vote for Mr Abbott as leader, what are your thoughts?",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Paid Parental Leave</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-03-16,"—I rise to conclude the debate on the urgency motion today. Wow! Obviously, the Labor Party have their knickers in a knot over this one. They know that their 18 weeks paid parental leave scheme is a sham and is paltry and they have spent the entire debate not defending it. What we heard from the members of the Labor Party, representing the government, is that they want 26 weeks or six months. Their aspiration is for 26 weeks. Come on guys, let’s get it together. Let us deliver 26 weeks, six months, with superannuation. We can do this—we do not have to wait another 30 years. We can do this now. Let us move beyond the aspiration and move to action; otherwise, it is just going to be one of those other promises without delivery from Mr Rudd, like so many other things. It is all talk, no action—no delivery. It is all talk, all promise—no action.
It is absolutely clear that the government have no intention of defending their 18-week scheme. They want 26 weeks. Let us bite the bullet. Let us debate it properly. Let us see the legislation and bring it on. Let us ensure they get the support of all the groups that they need, including the ACTU, which knows well and truly that its associate unions all want 26 weeks. Let us get them in the room with the government and admit that 26 weeks, six months, is what we should be delivering. We should not be delivering anything less. Let us move beyond the aspiration and into the action.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-03-16,"—I table a ministerial statement on the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Aviation Security in Tokyo, Japan.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Aviation Security</title>,Ministerial Statements,16,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-03-16,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The ministerial statement is on the important issue of aviation security. It is important because so much of the terrorism in the skies these days is international in its context and so countries must get together from time to time to talk about the way in which they can cooperate to address this menace. The statement by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government relates to the conference in Japan, led by the Japanese who have shown real leadership on aviation security. Since 11 September 2001, there have been significant changes in Australia’s approach to issues of aviation security. Initiatives of the previous government—like strengthening cockpit doors on all aircraft, a lot of work on tightening passenger carry-on baggage screening at all airports with jet operations, introducing explosive tracer detection at domestic and international screening airports and providing an additional Australian protective services officer at airports around Australia—have been embarked upon. Indeed, we also initiated the use of armed air security officers on domestic flights and on certain international flights.
Well ahead of the organisation’s international civil aviation deadline, we introduced 100 per cent checked bag screening on all international services. Between 2001 and 2007, we spent something like $500 million on aviation security, with $82 million specifically going towards regional aviation. While that was the taxpayers’ contribution, the airlines themselves made a significant financial investment in that. The travelling public had to wear the annoyance at times associated with that increased security.
In his statement, the minister made reference to a number of new initiatives that the incoming Labor government have taken, such as expanding the cooperative inspections and security assessments at last ports of call. Work that Australia has done in helping to improve security systems in other countries is perhaps one of the most important ways in which Australia can help keep our skies safe. I welcome the fact that the government intends to do that work and indeed intends to place Office of Transport Security people at overseas ports.
It is intended that there will be increased policing and the strengthening of security procedures at airports. Body scanners will be introduced progressively at screening points servicing international passengers by next year. The issue of body securities has caused to be raised significant privacy issues, but we have all accepted that some compromise to our privacy must be made in the interests of security. Most of us live with that.
The minister also referred to an extension to screening measures to approximately 20 airports in regional Australia that have flights by Q400 aircraft. This is a significant step forward, and raises some quite important issues. The huge cost of the installation of security at those 20 airports in regional Australia is going to be very difficult for many of those regional airports to cover. I welcome the fact that the government intends to provide $32 million to assist with the purchase of the necessary equipment. But there is no way in the world that that funding is going to meet anything like the full cost for the airports.
Many of the airports are very basic. Some of them will have to be completely rebuilt because there is no capacity at most of these regional airports. The ones that are going to come under these new arrangements will need to separate and screen passengers from other passengers and to provide secure areas to deal with baggage. In many of these airports, you simply collect your baggage under a tree outside what we would call the airport building. So there is going to be very substantial cost. Some of these airports only have two or three services a week, and they sometimes carry only 50 passengers a week. You simply cannot justify a multimillion terminal building for 50 passengers a week.
Even if the government gives them a free terminal building, they still will have operational costs, such as six to eight people to run the X-ray equipment and explosive detection equipment and to check baggage that is going on board the aircraft. So you need six to eight people every time the flight arrives. Under the government’s new industrial relations scheme, of course, it will take four hours at a time for all of these people to load 10 to 12 passengers at the various airports, because you cannot just employ them for the hour or hour and a half; you have to employ them for four hours, thus adding to the cost for these airports—many of which are run by local government.
My concern is that many of these places that currently have a service in remote Australia will simply say, ‘We can’t afford to keep it going,’ and they will shut down the air service. That will mean that the people who are the ones who most need air transport and air services are not going to have them, because the airports will not be able to remain operational. This is a real concern that the government must address.
At the same time as these new arrangements are coming in, the government is making significant cuts in areas of aviation security. There was an AFP report at the same conference that the minister went to and which he reported on today which said that there were calls at the conference for more to be done on sky marshals or air security officers. The minister did not mention that in his statement, but news reports of the conference did refer to that. The government has provided no money in the future for the sky marshal program. There has been no commitment by the government to the sky marshal program, so it would seem that that is going to phase out.
Furthermore, the government has cut $58 million out of the Customs program, which means that 4.7 million fewer consignments arriving in Australia by air are being inspected by Customs officer than was the case previously. And 125 quarantine officers have been sacked. All these sorts of things demonstrate that on one hand the government is talking about tougher security, which is essential in this day and age, but on the other hand they are cutting back on some of the more important initiatives, such as inspecting air cargo and the issues relating to sky marshals. If those things are not addressed, it is going to make our skies less safe. If the government wants to be taken seriously on aviation security, it really needs to address some of the issues that I have mentioned.

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2010-03-16,"—I present a response to those recommendations in the 106th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on nuclear and non-proliferation and disarmament which relate to the responsibilities of the Presiding Officers. With the concurrence of the Senate, I ask that the response be incorporated in Hansard.
The response read as follows—

Joint Standing Committee on Treaties Report 106, Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament


Recommendation 18

The Committee recommends that the Presiding Officers agree to all outgoing official parliamentary delegations being briefed on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation issues, with a mandate to raise these issues during discussions with other parliamentarians as appropriate.
For each outgoing delegation visit, oral and written briefings are requested from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Generally those briefings relate to the specific issues that the delegation will be focusing on during its visit and, for bilateral visits, on the relationship Australia has with the country to be visited.
Should individual delegations wish for briefings on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation to be provided for all outgoing delegations, then such briefings will be requested from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Recommendation 19

The Committee recommends that the Presiding Officers agree to the Parliament’s outgoing delegation program for 2010 being arranged so that the regular bilateral visit to the United States coincides with the 2010 NPT Review Conference, thus allowing parliamentarians an opportunity to participate in this Conference.
In general the regular bilateral visit to the United States is conducted on a biennial basis, except in circumstances where the proposed year of a visit is not optimal (eg during a Presidential election year).
The most recent bilateral visit to the United States took place from 26 September to 11 October 2009, so the next visit would not be due until 2011.
The 2010 outgoing delegations program was developed over several months from June to September 2009, and included consultation with the Presiding Officers, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Australian embassies and high commissions. The Presiding Officers wrote to the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs seeking approval for the 2010 program on 16 September 2009, a day prior to the tabling of the Treaties Committee report. The 2010 program proposed by the Presiding Officers did not include a bilateral visit to the United States as one was taking place in 2009 and the next was not due until 2011.

Recommendation 20

The Committee recommends that the delegation to the 121st Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in October 2009 takes this report to that conference to promote further discussion of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament issues.
As the 121s` IPU Assembly was in October 2009, this recommendation relates to a past event. The Treaties Committee report was tabled on 17 September 2009 and Australia’s IPU
delegation departed for the assembly on 6 October 2009. It is not known whether the Treaties Committee report was drawn to the attention of the delegation prior to its departure.
Nevertheless it should be noted that a special session on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation is scheduled to take place at the 122nd IPU Assembly to be held in Bangkok in March 2010. Australia is expected to have a leading role in presentations at that session, as a result of Australia playing a lead role in having a resolution on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation adopted at the 120th IPU Assembly in Addis Ababa in April 2009.

Recommendation 21

The Committee recommends that the Parliament adopt a resolution on the Parliament’s commitment to the abolition of nuclear weapons.
This is a matter for the Parliament as a whole rather than the Presiding Officers and would require a resolution to be prepared and then put to the Parliament by a parliamentarian or group of parliamentarians.

Recommendation 22

The Committee calls on parliaments around the world to support similar actions to those contained in recommendations 18, 19, 20 and 21.
This is a matter for parliaments around the world to consider individually.
The special session on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation scheduled to take place at the 122nd IPU Assembly to be held in Bangkok in March 2010 will bring the issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation to the attention of parliaments from around the world.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-03-16,"—I seek leave to make a short statement on the 106th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I will speak briefly on the recommendations of the 106th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. We had a response from the government short while ago—a matter of only a couple of weeks—that addressed the recommendations of the report. I spent nearly a year working with the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on this report. It is a very good document. It canvasses the issues very well, including some very difficult issues that this parliament has struggled to get cross-party or cross-partisan agreement on for years, if not decades. I put to the chamber that it is quite a step forward to have all the major representation in the parliament come out with a unanimous report on an issue as divisive as nuclear weapons has been. It addresses not simply non-proliferation and the very real concerns that people have about nuclear states or nuclear threshold states like Iran, North Korea and Burma, which obviously pose grave security threats, but also disarmament. Disarmament is the sometimes forgotten article of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which proposed that the five permanent nuclear weapons states—I should not say ‘permanent’—and the other states that have obtained nuclear weapons in the past 60 years should put those weapons aside, dismantle them and remove them from strategic doctrines permanently. It is a very good study, and it addresses many of the issues that Australia is going to find itself having to contend with, including the obvious hypocrisy of being one of the largest suppliers of uranium in the world to many of the world’s nuclear weapon states. The fact that the report was able to come to such a set of recommendations is, I think, a credit not only to the chair and to the secretariat but to all members of the committee.
I want to address in particular recommendation 21 of the report. In the government response, for some reason recommendation 21 was that the parliament adopt a resolution on the parliament’s commitment to the abolition of nuclear weapons. That is quite an important way for this parliament to send a sign to the rest of the world as delegations from around the planet convene in New York at the end of next month for nearly a full month of talks on the five-yearly Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, an absolutely crucial conference. In the past, Australia has played, in fits and starts, quite a productive role in these negotiations through the work of the former Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons and, more recently, through Prime Minister Rudd’s announcement of the Australian co-chaired International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. We have played quite a powerful enabling role in recent times. We have 12 ‘lost years’, I would say, under the Howard government when we simply did more or less whatever the Bush Administration told us to. Thankfully, we have moved to a more nuanced position. We are looking after Australia’s strategic interests in a better way, even though we have not been as outspoken on the issues of nuclear weapons in Australia’s security policy, as we have seen a much bolder statement more recently from our ally in this matter, Japan.
Recommendation 21 was quite sensible: it just said that there should be a parliamentary resolution. We are not seeing such a thing at the moment. It is quite clearly not on the government’s radar. For some reason the government, in their response to JSCOT report 106, bounced that to the presiding officers. So, quite rightly in my view, the statement that has been tabled by the President this afternoon says that this is a matter for the parliament as a whole rather than for the presiding officers. It would require a resolution to be prepared and then put to the parliament by a parliamentarian or group of parliamentarians. In the absence of such a move by the executive—and perhaps we could see a contribution from the Minister for Defence, if he has any information that would enlighten the chamber that this view is incorrect—the Parliamentary Cross-Party Group nuclear on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, of which I am one of the co-chairs, will forward such a resolution for consideration by the Senate. This coming Thursday is the last sitting day of the Senate before that very important Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. I think it is entirely appropriate that the Parliament of Australia forward an extremely strong resolution that will give our delegation to New York in a matter of only a few weeks—and my understanding is that it will be a large delegation—the knowledge that they have the support of all the parties in the parliament to rid the world of these weapons once and for all.
By some mystery or miracle of self-preservation and sanity, these weapons have not been used since late August 1945. In conflict they have been used many times and caused great harm to civilian populations and military personnel in testing, including here in Australia, but they have not been used actively in warfare since the end of the Second World War. That is something that three generations of people can be profoundly grateful for, but it is not something that we can assume will remain in perpetuity. We have a very brief moment in time in which I can stand here in this chamber and say that these weapons have not been used since the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Every single day that passes, we simply cannot take that as it for granted.
I have read the reports of security analysts who have said that they do not understand why nuclear weapons have not been used in some fashion or other by the terrorist networks that are receiving this material in unknown quantities through the very porous borders of the world’s black markets in nuclear materials. They do not know why such large quantities of these materials are still loose and circulating on the world’s black markets. They know we simply cannot take it for granted. The most common thing we hear is people saying that that is a Cold War issue: the risk of nuclear attack has simply abated since the United States and the former Soviet Union stood off with Western Europe as the potential battleground; those days have passed, and this is not an issue we need to worry about anymore. I strongly disagree with that. The authors of this report strongly disagree with that. It is absolutely time that Australia played its part, as we have played a productive part in times past, to abolish these weapons once and for all so that we never again face the spectre of the atomic bomb victims, which the Japanese called hibakusha. For many of them, their entire life’s work since those attacks has revolved around peace education and around the abolition of these weapons so that there are never, ever more hibakusha.
The cross-party group on nuclear weapons in this chamber will produce a resolution which we will put to the Senate and which we believe should be very strong. It should be unambiguous that these weapons must be abolished for all time. They must be taken out of Australia’s security policy, to the extent that they still remain there. Australia can play a productive role diplomatically, politically and in its defence capabilities in ridding the planet of these weapons once and for all.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,17,1
"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2010-03-16,"—I present a response to those recommendations in the 106th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on nuclear and non-proliferation and disarmament which relate to the responsibilities of the Presiding Officers. With the concurrence of the Senate, I ask that the response be incorporated in Hansard.
The response read as follows—

Joint Standing Committee on Treaties Report 106, Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament


Recommendation 18

The Committee recommends that the Presiding Officers agree to all outgoing official parliamentary delegations being briefed on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation issues, with a mandate to raise these issues during discussions with other parliamentarians as appropriate.
For each outgoing delegation visit, oral and written briefings are requested from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Generally those briefings relate to the specific issues that the delegation will be focusing on during its visit and, for bilateral visits, on the relationship Australia has with the country to be visited.
Should individual delegations wish for briefings on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation to be provided for all outgoing delegations, then such briefings will be requested from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Recommendation 19

The Committee recommends that the Presiding Officers agree to the Parliament’s outgoing delegation program for 2010 being arranged so that the regular bilateral visit to the United States coincides with the 2010 NPT Review Conference, thus allowing parliamentarians an opportunity to participate in this Conference.
In general the regular bilateral visit to the United States is conducted on a biennial basis, except in circumstances where the proposed year of a visit is not optimal (eg during a Presidential election year).
The most recent bilateral visit to the United States took place from 26 September to 11 October 2009, so the next visit would not be due until 2011.
The 2010 outgoing delegations program was developed over several months from June to September 2009, and included consultation with the Presiding Officers, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Australian embassies and high commissions. The Presiding Officers wrote to the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs seeking approval for the 2010 program on 16 September 2009, a day prior to the tabling of the Treaties Committee report. The 2010 program proposed by the Presiding Officers did not include a bilateral visit to the United States as one was taking place in 2009 and the next was not due until 2011.

Recommendation 20

The Committee recommends that the delegation to the 121st Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in October 2009 takes this report to that conference to promote further discussion of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament issues.
As the 121s` IPU Assembly was in October 2009, this recommendation relates to a past event. The Treaties Committee report was tabled on 17 September 2009 and Australia’s IPU
delegation departed for the assembly on 6 October 2009. It is not known whether the Treaties Committee report was drawn to the attention of the delegation prior to its departure.
Nevertheless it should be noted that a special session on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation is scheduled to take place at the 122nd IPU Assembly to be held in Bangkok in March 2010. Australia is expected to have a leading role in presentations at that session, as a result of Australia playing a lead role in having a resolution on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation adopted at the 120th IPU Assembly in Addis Ababa in April 2009.

Recommendation 21

The Committee recommends that the Parliament adopt a resolution on the Parliament’s commitment to the abolition of nuclear weapons.
This is a matter for the Parliament as a whole rather than the Presiding Officers and would require a resolution to be prepared and then put to the Parliament by a parliamentarian or group of parliamentarians.

Recommendation 22

The Committee calls on parliaments around the world to support similar actions to those contained in recommendations 18, 19, 20 and 21.
This is a matter for parliaments around the world to consider individually.
The special session on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation scheduled to take place at the 122nd IPU Assembly to be held in Bangkok in March 2010 will bring the issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation to the attention of parliaments from around the world.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-03-16,"—I seek leave to make a short statement on the 106th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I will speak briefly on the recommendations of the 106th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. We had a response from the government short while ago—a matter of only a couple of weeks—that addressed the recommendations of the report. I spent nearly a year working with the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on this report. It is a very good document. It canvasses the issues very well, including some very difficult issues that this parliament has struggled to get cross-party or cross-partisan agreement on for years, if not decades. I put to the chamber that it is quite a step forward to have all the major representation in the parliament come out with a unanimous report on an issue as divisive as nuclear weapons has been. It addresses not simply non-proliferation and the very real concerns that people have about nuclear states or nuclear threshold states like Iran, North Korea and Burma, which obviously pose grave security threats, but also disarmament. Disarmament is the sometimes forgotten article of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which proposed that the five permanent nuclear weapons states—I should not say ‘permanent’—and the other states that have obtained nuclear weapons in the past 60 years should put those weapons aside, dismantle them and remove them from strategic doctrines permanently. It is a very good study, and it addresses many of the issues that Australia is going to find itself having to contend with, including the obvious hypocrisy of being one of the largest suppliers of uranium in the world to many of the world’s nuclear weapon states. The fact that the report was able to come to such a set of recommendations is, I think, a credit not only to the chair and to the secretariat but to all members of the committee.
I want to address in particular recommendation 21 of the report. In the government response, for some reason recommendation 21 was that the parliament adopt a resolution on the parliament’s commitment to the abolition of nuclear weapons. That is quite an important way for this parliament to send a sign to the rest of the world as delegations from around the planet convene in New York at the end of next month for nearly a full month of talks on the five-yearly Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, an absolutely crucial conference. In the past, Australia has played, in fits and starts, quite a productive role in these negotiations through the work of the former Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons and, more recently, through Prime Minister Rudd’s announcement of the Australian co-chaired International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. We have played quite a powerful enabling role in recent times. We have 12 ‘lost years’, I would say, under the Howard government when we simply did more or less whatever the Bush Administration told us to. Thankfully, we have moved to a more nuanced position. We are looking after Australia’s strategic interests in a better way, even though we have not been as outspoken on the issues of nuclear weapons in Australia’s security policy, as we have seen a much bolder statement more recently from our ally in this matter, Japan.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2010-03-16,"—Prior to question time I was making a few comments regarding the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill 2009 and I will continue those comments. Where no industry specific regulation exists, consideration of general protection such as that contained in this proposed legislation should be considered. However the potential costs, uncertainty and other consequences highlighted by the submission to the inquiry should be addressed. Consideration should be given to the introduction of safe harbour provisions along the lines suggested by Professor Zumbo. Sitting above issues surrounding the specific application of the proposed unfair contract provisions is the benefit that will flow from other aspects of the introduction of the Australian Consumer Law, notably including the greater access to remedies that can flow from low-cost, state based dispute resolution forums that will be able to hear cases based on remedies previously only able to be used in expensive court based actions. To some extent, this may offset the need for specific action on unfair contracts, as remedies previously not utilised for this purpose may become available through greater use and judicial development.
The coalition will move a number of amendments, foreshadowed by my colleague Senator Joyce, that will go a long way towards addressing many of the concerns I hold in respect of this bill. In particular, I welcome the move to delete the provisions providing for the reversal of the onus of proof and the strengthening of the threshold from ‘likely to cause detriment’ to ‘likely to cause significant disadvantage’. I commend the amendments to the Senate and look forward to the passage of an amendment bill that will deliver all the benefits of the proposed Australian Consumer Law regime without many of the costs and problems that can rightly be avoided.

",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2010-03-16,"—We have all heard examples of where consumers have found themselves on the receiving end of a contract that they believe is completely unfair yet find themselves with no access to redress. A common example is the mobile phone contract with a term allowing the supplier to unilaterally vary the rates or charges imposed at any time without any notice to the consumer. There are many similar examples for consumers where they have not properly scrutinised the very fine print of a contract or find that they misunderstood the terms of a contract. On the other hand, businesses that operate across various state jurisdictions also complain that rights and responsibilities are duplicated across a wide range of legislative instruments and are incompatible across state borders, causing unnecessary complexity and expense. The Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill 2009 aims to address these concerns.
The purpose of the bill is to establish a national consumer law framework and to ban unfair terms in standard form business-to-consumer contacts. The bill has three distinct elements: (1) the creation of a new national consumer law and the implementation of new penalties for breaches of consumer law, (2) the implementation of national unfair contract law terms and (3) increased powers for ASIC and the ACCC to enforce these laws.
This is the first in a series of two bills which will introduce the Australian consumer law—ACL. These are complex bills and they interact with each other. The bill we are considering amends the Trade Practices Act to establish the ACL as a schedule to the act and inserts the unfair contract term provisions. It also inserts corresponding provisions for financial products and services into the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act. The second bill, to be introduced shortly, will implement COAG reforms in this area, including the transfer of the existing consumer law and related provisions of the act into the ACL.
Standard form contracts are those contracts that are entered into without any individual negotiation taking place. They are essentially take-it-or-leave-it arrangements for the consumer. These types of contracts are used widely for banking, financial services, utility services, internet and telephone contracts and gym memberships. Standard form contracts are not in themselves inherently unfair but in fact facilitate day-to-day transactions between businesses and consumers in an economically efficient manner. However, the take-it-or-leave-it nature of such contracts means that consumers can be left with clearly inequitable arrangements that they would not willingly enter into had they the ability to negotiate terms. It might be argued that, even if the consumer baulks at a contract, they are often in a position, as with gym contracts, where it is very difficult to negotiate exceptions to the contract. There is obviously, therefore, a need for consumers to be able to seek redress over unfair contract terms. Under this bill, a term is considered unfair if a supplier can vary any of the terms without consent or if the supplier can cancel the contract without the consumer having the same right to do so. If a contract term is found to be unfair, the term itself will become void; however, the contract as a whole will remain in effect.
This bill has been the product of a lengthy and exhaustive consultation process. In December 2006, the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, commissioned the Productivity Commission to investigate Australia’s consumer policy framework, including its administration. In April 2008, the Productivity Commission released the findings of its review of Australia’s consumer policy framework and called for an overhaul of the system. They particularly drew attention to the messy duplication and division of responsibilities among the state governments and the federal government, which increase the costs for businesses and lead to variable outcomes and inconsistent redress mechanisms for consumers as well as gaps and inconsistencies in policy enforcement.
The Productivity Commission advocated the introduction of a national consumer law and unfair contract terms. In March 2008, COAG agreed that its Business Regulation and Competition Working Group would develop an enhanced consumer policy framework in consultation with the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs. Based on the recommendations of the council, the working group recommended that COAG agree to a single national consumer law.
At a meeting in October 2008, COAG agreed to establish a new single national consumer law including a provision regulating unfair contract terms. ACL will provide consumers with a uniform and higher level of protection and see reduced compliance costs for business and improvements in consumer law enforcement powers. This was part of the broader COAG work towards the creation of a seamless national economy, which is clearly very important for productivity.
In February 2009, the Standing Committee of Officials of Consumer Affairs released an information and consultation paper entitled An Australian consumer law—fair markets, confident consumers which aimed to outline the process for the development of the ACL and encourage submissions seeking views on policy options and alternatives. Treasury received 102 submissions to the consultation paper. A further paper entitled The Australian consumer law: consultation on draft provisions on unfair contract terms was released in May 2009, providing an opportunity for feedback. This attracted a further 96 submissions.
On 24 June 2009, the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill 2009 was introduced into the House of Representatives and referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which I chair, for inquiry. The committee received 58 submissions in the course of its inquiry and found that many concerns raised regarding the bill had been addressed through the consultation process which began with the Productivity Commission investigation in 2006. One submission, from the Consumer Action Law Centre, to the Senate inquiry said:
Regardless of one’s views on the content of the bill, it cannot be said that consultation on national UCT—
unfair contract terms—
regulation for Australia has not occurred.
There is broad support for the harmonisation of consumer law. There are currently 13 generic consumer law frameworks operating in Australia. Throughout the consultation process, every inquiry has found that the system is costly for business and inequitable for consumers, that major reform is required and that measures directed against unfair contract terms should be a part of the new regime. The Law Council of Australia Trade Practices Committee, the Association of Building Societies and Credit Unions, the Business Council of Australia, the Consumer Action Law Centre and the Motor Trades Association of Australia all support the concept of a single national uniform consumer law. The coalition have raised some issues with this bill and have foreshadowed some amendments. I have not had an opportunity to look at them in detail, but I reiterate that there has been extensive consultation and extensive agreement between the states on this bill.
I now wish to address the target of some of the opposition’s objections: unfair contract terms. Subsection 3(1) of the bill provides that a term in a consumer contract is unfair if the term would (a) cause a significant imbalance in the party’s rights and obligations under the standard form contract; and (b) is not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the party who would be advantaged by the term. Terms that define the subject matter of the contract establish the up-front price payable under the contract or are required or permitted by the Commonwealth, state or territory are exempt from the unfair provisions. Although no contract terms are currently prohibited, the bill does give provision for the minister to prohibit certain contract terms and also exempt certain terms if necessary.
A number of examples of terms which might be considered unfair are listed in the bill. For example, any term that limits the right of one party and not the other to terminate or vary a contract may be considered unfair. These examples are often referred to as a ‘grey list’ and they only provide an indication of the terms that might be considered unfair. The Consumer Action Law Centre noted that this is consistent with best practice internationally and that a ‘general-plus-specific’ model allows for flexibility through the use of a general definition but also incorporates clarity and certainty in relation to known current problems as well as guidance in the interpretation of the general provision. The suggestion from the opposition that every contract could be submitted to the regulator for approval might enhance flexibility but would make an unwieldy process, although I will look at the specific amendment.
The bill also excludes certain contracts from the unfair contract term provisions. These are certain shipping contracts, which are already subject to a comprehensive legal framework under maritime law, and contracts which are constitutions of companies or managed investment schemes. However, insurance contracts are also currently exempt from the bill’s application, although not through any provision of the bill itself. Currently the Insurance Contracts Act prevents an insurance contract from being the subject of judicial review on the grounds that it is harsh, oppressive, unconscionable, unjust, unfair or inequitable. The effect of this section of the insurance act means that the unfair contract provisions of either the ACL or the ASIC Act do not apply to insurance contracts, as Senator Bushby canvassed.
During the Senate inquiry the committee received considerable evidence that opposed the exclusion of insurance contracts from the unfair contracts provisions. The Senate inquiry into this bill found that, currently, consumers are not provided with adequate protection from unfair terms in insurance contracts. However, since a review of the Insurance Contracts Act in 2004 significant work has been undertaken, including a draft bill released in 2007 to address unfair contract terms in insurance contracts. The minister assures me that that work is still continuing, that there will be some close review of what happens in relation to insurance contracts and that this will be released shortly.
The scope of the bill’s unfair contract term provisions is restricted to business-to-consumer transactions. The bill applies only to consumer contracts in which at least one of the parties is an individual. Contracts between businesses are therefore excluded from the provisions, except in respect of sole traders.
The government is currently reviewing both the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act and the Franchising Code of Conduct with a view to providing more effective regulation around unfair terms in business-to-business contracts. The franchising arrangements—for example, for newsagents, which Senator Joyce raised—are clearly, in my view, currently better dealt with under those two separate initiatives than under this particular bill.
During the inquiry, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee received some evidence, mainly from the banking and finance sector, that legislation preventing unfair contract terms should not be introduced. The argument was that a lack of a hard and fast definition regarding what constitutes an unfair contract term would lead to business uncertainty and potentially higher costs for the consumer. The claim is that the legislation will force businesses to reconsider all their standard form contracts and operate in an environment where they cannot be sure which terms the courts and the minister would declare ‘unfair’. I think this is Senator Bushby’s argument. This view was challenged by a number of witnesses who claimed that this ‘Chicken Little’ view of the world is taken by the banking and finance sector when any significant reform to the Trade Practices Act is considered. It was also noted that similar reform has been undertaken in the UK with similar claims of economic costs and business uncertainty being foreshadowed that have not eventuated. The requirement for the term to cause a ‘significant imbalance’ in rights and obligations between parties, as well as the opportunity to allow a term where it can be demonstrated to be necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the advantaged party, should provide adequate protection against vexatious litigation.
In conclusion, the introduction of a single national consumer law has been a work in progress since 2006. There is little or no doubt that the Australian Consumer Law will provide substantial benefits to Australian consumers and will result in cost benefits for business operation standard form contracts across jurisdictions. It is a substantial piece of legislation that has involved extremely extensive consultation and has incorporated a number of changes along the way to ensure it will operate as a simple yet effective piece of legislation.
Given the long lead time over which this legislation has been developed and the substantial consultation process that has been undertaken, it is difficult to see merit in any arguments surrounding business uncertainty. Consumers have been faced for many years with far greater uncertainty, given the lack of protection from unfair contract terms, and the negative economic impact on consumer confidence that has arisen as a result should not be discounted.
In summary, the social and economic benefits of this legislation cannot be underestimated. The bill has evolved through a broad, ongoing and rigorous consultation process where stakeholders have been given ample opportunity to be involved in the development of the terms of this legislation. It is part of a broader movement through COAG to a seamless national economy in which business and consumers alike will benefit from a simpler, transparent and more efficient system. It is an enormously positive step for the Australian economy, for Australian consumers and Australian businesses. I commend this bill to the Senate and commend the ministers involved for taking the bill through to this stage. Labor governments have traditionally been very concerned about consumer rights and have been very active in developing consumer rights legislation. I certainly hope this and the forthcoming bill will be accepted by the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-03-16,"—May I begin by saying that I applaud the government for its intent in introducing the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill 2009. There is no question that reform is needed in the area of consumer law and that a national approach is needed, as Senator Hurley has outlined in her very thoughtful contribution. But I believe that this bill should go further. I believe that this is an opportunity lost.
Whether it is a mobile phone contract, a washing machine purchased under a 12-month interest free loan, a subscription program or a gym membership, standard form consumer contracts—that is, contracts that are not individually negotiated—are often complicated, confusing and in many cases give greater power to the business or the larger party, the more powerful party, than to the individual consumer. In addition, consumer laws currently vary between states and territories, making it confusing not only for consumers but also for businesses.
This bill will create uniform consumer law legislation, and that is a good thing. However, I am concerned that there has been a significant weakening, a watering down, of existing state consumer protections primarily in the area of unfair contract terms. Victoria has been at the forefront of effective laws against unfair contract terms, so it beggars belief that the Victorian laws will be watered down under this bill. That is not a good thing for consumers, because I think the Victorian law was a template of good law in protecting consumers.
While this bill is designed to address unfair contract terms and includes penalties, enforcement powers and consumer redress options, I believe this bill in its current form does not truly meet its intent. Accordingly, I will be introducing a number of amendments which I believe will strengthen this legislation so that it is truly in the best interests of Australian consumers and provides assurances to business.
There is no doubt that questionable consumer contracts exist and all too often consumers are either left with no option for recourse or find that the process to seek reimbursement for losses is too costly to be worth while. It is too costly and time consuming because of the hassles involved in trying to seek redress where clearly the wrong thing has been done to the consumer. It is a messy process. Some of the unfair contract terms which exist, whether intentional or unintentional, are often mind-boggling loopholes that most consumers never see coming. For example, in July last year, Telstra announced that it would be introducing a range of fees that would, it said, ‘reduce face-to-face customer service and drive more customers towards online bill payments’. From September, a $2.20 charge was applied to anyone who opted to pay their bill in person, with cash. That is something that many constituents have approached me about. They thought it was inherently unfair, particularly senior citizens, those that do not have online access and those that like the idea of the human contact of going to their local post office to pay the bill in cash because they do not have a credit card, they do not have online access or they just want to deal in cash. They were prejudiced.
I raised this matter with Telstra’s CEO, David Thodey. I passed on those consumer complaints directly to him in the course of discussions about another piece of legislation. Can I say that Mr Thodey was quite receptive. Whatever views one may have of what is before the parliament in terms of Telstra, I think Mr Thodey has been a breath of fresh air in terms of accessibility compared to the previous regime in Telstra. I am very pleased that, as a result of the public outcry, Telstra scrapped this fee. I think it was the right thing to do for consumers and the smart thing for Telstra to do from a public relations point of view as well. But I do know that similar charges continue to exist with other companies and I think that is inherently unfair. To charge a person for choosing to pay their bill in person with legal tender is not fair. When I raised this issue, and I am sure others of my colleagues have, there were many calls to my office and I received a lot of correspondence expressing concern about that. These are the sorts of unfair contract terms that should never have been allowed to creep into contracts. I will be moving an amendment to address this during the committee stage.
Also concerning are the number of contracts that allow the larger party, the business, to modify or cancel contracts without notice; yet the same flexibility is not afforded to the consumer, resulting in an imbalance of power between the two parties, which is fundamentally unfair. Here we have an opportunity to have a national approach, one that is not only good for consumers but good for businesses. It removes that uncertainty and provides uniformity. There are unnecessary costs for businesses, big and small. This national approach is long overdue. Internationally, the European Union adopted its directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts in 1993 and was followed by the United Kingdom the following year. These overseas laws are tried and tested and have been positive for consumers and could be similarly positive for Australian consumers. I do not think we have gone as far as the United Kingdom and Europe have in terms of unfair contract terms.
I think a way forward in making it easier for consumers, better for consumers, but also fairer for companies, is to have a ‘safe harbour’ approach. If that was adopted for consumer contracts, we would find these sorts of unfair terms could be avoided from the beginning. Under the safe harbour approach, which I acknowledge is an idea that comes from Associate Professor Frank Zumbo from the Australian School of Business at the University of New South Wales and who is a tireless advocate for consumers in the trade practices field, businesses would be able to approach the ACCC to seek approval or authorisation of particular contracts or contract terms. In doing so they would be ensuring that their contract is fair and reasonably necessary to protect the interests of the larger party and the consumer. Further, it could lead to industry-wide contract terms so that all relevant businesses could adopt these clearly defined and approved contract provisions. It would be similar to a template—a template of good practice which can be ticked off once it has been signed off by the ACCC. It is not unreasonable for the ACCC to take that approach. While some may suggest that this would be too onerous for the ACCC, I would argue that this would prevent unfair contract terms at the outset rather than having to address the issue once a possibly unfair contract is in place across the country. It is preventative in its approach. The ACCC has considerable experience in reviewing contractual arrangements and could readily use that experience to review contract terms under a safe harbour process for the benefit of both businesses and consumers. Furthermore, it would be a voluntary option for businesses, which would be seeking approval of their contract to ensure best practice. I believe that many businesses would appreciate this opportunity.
This bill, in its current form, also fails to include amongst its protections small businesses, which are just as vulnerable to unfair contract terms as individuals. A sole trader or a family business is as vulnerable in many cases as an individual when dealing with large businesses. My understanding is that business-to-business contracts under $2 million were originally included in the first draft of this legislation, when Minister Bowen was the responsible minister. However, it was subsequently removed. I would be grateful if the minister could advise, when we get to the committee stage, the basis of that change in policy. There were changes from when Minister Bowen had this portfolio to now when Minister Emerson has the portfolio, and it seems to me that there has been an appreciable weakening of the consumer protection provisions. I believe that small businesses are subjected to many of the same unfair contract terms as individual consumers and should be entitled to the same protections under this legislation.
I have a number of concerns with this bill and will outline them in more detail when I introduce my amendments. While this bill is intended to protect consumers and give them greater opportunities for redress in instances where they have been unfairly treated, there are significant gaps in the bill. While it is intended to ensure the balance between the two parties to a contract is fair and does not favour one over the other, there are ways in which this bill can be improved. I applaud the government for  recognising that reform is needed in the area of consumer law, which organisations and entities such as the Consumer Action Law Centre and Choice have been calling for for many years—as has Associate Professor Zumbo. But for this bill to meet its intent it needs to be strengthened; otherwise, we have laudable intentions without the follow-through to give it more substance, to give it more teeth. That is why I will move amendments during the committee stage. I will not delay the second reading stage unnecessarily by outlining those amendments.
I will give an example: it is crucial that consumers—both individuals and small businesses with contracts less than $2 million—are able to fairly and easily seek injunctions and damages wherever and whenever unfair terms of contract with larger parties exist against them. Not only will this cause larger parties who issue unfair contract terms to think twice before doing so but also it will serve as a deterrent and, I believe, will add a level of protection to individual consumers. Furthermore, the current inclusion of the terms ‘detriment’ and ‘transparency’ which courts must consider add unnecessary tests upon the consumer and the ACCC when the courts already have a discretion to make these determinations. Those additional hurdles for consumers are a real weakening of the legislation. They go against the intent of the bill, which is to make it easier for the consumer to seek redress. After all, this legislation aims to make it fairer for consumers—not harder. My concern is that the bill in its current form is an opportunity lost to do the right thing by consumers and small businesses in this country. I support the second reading motion, but I do believe that there is scope to improve this legislation so that we can give the protections that individuals and small businesses deserve.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2010-03-16,"—I take this opportunity to thank senators who have participated in the debate today on theTrade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill 2009. On 2 October 2008, the Council of Australian Governments reached a historic agreement to create a single national generic consumer protection law to be called the Australian Consumer Law. This bill is the first legislative step to give effect to COAG’s agreement. It will implement key elements of the Australian Consumer Law, including a new national unfair contract terms law and new penalties, enforcement powers and options for consumer redress for the ACCC and ASIC. Attempts to create a single consumer law have been made in the past. Notably, in the early 1980s the Australian, state and territory governments agreed to create harmonised consumer protection laws. This initiative succeeded in creating harmonised laws for a time, but consistency was all too soon lost as individual jurisdictions amended and augmented their laws over time. COAG’s decision of 2008 differs from previous attempts at harmonisation in that it established an applications legislation regime. Amendments to the Commonwealth’s consumer protection law will automatically apply in all states and territories. In addition, all jurisdictions have agreed to be bound by the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law, which sets out the manner in which changes to the consumer law will be made in the future. COAG made this intergovernmental agreement at its meeting on 2 July 2009.
Consideration of this legislation is significant because we are asking not only that the Australian parliament legislate its content but, ultimately, that all states and territory parliaments adopt this legislation.
On 25 June 2009 this bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for inquiry and report. In the course of its inquiry the committee received 58 public submissions and held public hearings in Canberra and Sydney reflecting a wide range of interests in this legislation from business and consumers. This follows an extensive consultation process undertaken by the Productivity Commission in 2008 as well as by the government in February and May of 2009. The committee tabled its report on the provisions of the bill on 7 September 2009. The committee expressed its strong support for the bill and recommended that the bill be passed. I note that the coalition members of the committee have also recorded their broad support for the bill. I thank senators for their participation in the committee’s inquiry as well as the wider debate on this legislation.
This bill represents a significant milestone in achieving a lasting national consumer protection law. That said, the creation of a national unfair contract terms law, and the strengthening of the enforcement regime for the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act, are also worthy objectives in their own right. I am aware of the concerns that the proposed amendments to the unfair test and the unfair contract terms law could effectively turn the detrimental requirements into a separate test, and in a manner that negatively impacts on the consumer, by requiring that actual detriment must be proved. Contrary to these concerns the proposed amendment requires the court to consider whether application of or reliance on the terms would cause detriment to the parties disadvantaged by the term. This would involve a determination of whether such detriment does exist or would exist if the term was relied upon.
The ACL reforms will be completed via a second bill to be introduced in early 2010. The second bill will include a national consumer product and safety regulatory regime as well as enhancement to the existing consumer protection regime based on the best practice amongst state and territory laws.
We are about to have another minister take on the detailed consideration of these amendments, which I trust will be canvassed in great detail. I look forward to that occurring. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2010-03-16,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—


There is no doubt that it has been a very big week for my home city of Canberra.


First, it was the satisfaction and delight of vet another premiership (after some nail-biting final minutes) for Lauren Jackson, National Hirst, coach Carrie Graf and the mighty Canberra Transact Capitals—now officially, fittingly, the most successful team ever in the WNBL.


And then, over the last few days, the whole town has been abuzz with 97th birthday celebration excitement. While the Grand Event, on 12 March 2013, is still 3 years away, this has not stopped the ACT Government of Jon Stanhope, in close collaboration with the Rudd Government, ensuring that we all enjoy the subtle symphonies of the build-up. Anticipation is growing.


Last Friday, at a VIP breakfast, the Chief Minister formally announced the name of the Centenary’s native plant, a superb Correa cultivar, of impeccable breeding fines, to be known as the ‘Canberra Bells’.


At the same function, the Centenary of Canberra’s remarkable Creative Director, Robyn Archer, introduced us to the new and striking Centenary logo (the result of a creative collaboration between young designers across Australia and His Excellency, Mr Michael Bryce), and she also drew our attention to the bulging 2010 Canberra Festival program of recent weeks, as well as a selection of the innovative commemoration events to be rolled out in the coming 12 months—consciousness raising events to ensure we maximise the number of Canberrans getting actively involved.


The challenge, of course, for the ACT and the Commonwealth Governments is to pique the interest of as many Australians as possible throughout the country—to alert them to both the importance and the genuine relevance of the celebrations. The national significance of the events, and personalities, and history being celebrated.


I am confident that this will happen, but only if all of us, in the parliament and in Canberra, are motivated to play a part in building a deeper understanding of Canberra as the nation’s capital—primarily through its rich and utterly compelling history.


Fortunately, we have the luxury of a suite of Centenary years, 2008 to 2013, to make this happen. Time enough to get to know some of our most significant Federation founders, and their more momentous decisions—a number of which continue to profoundly affect us to this day.


Our over-riding goal should be to link the best of our best to the present and future.


I am sure that most of my fellow Senators have an inkling of, say, King O’Malley’s controversial profile as iconoclastic Minister for Home Affairs in Andrew Fisher’s second, impressively over-achieving Labor Government a century ago.


Perhaps you are also passingly familiar with the classic footage of Lady Denman, the Governor-General’s wife, atop the Foundation Stones podium, during that dusty autumn of 1913, pronouncing Canberra’s name, with the accent on the ‘Can’. Last Friday’s ACTTV Stateline program, catering explicitly to keen local-community interest, ran a few snippets of Raymond Longford’s historic footage of the Naming Ceremony.


But the brute fact, the shaming fact perhaps, is that, until recently, very few of us have been able to go much beyond a few isolated titbits of national capital history.


The Centenary years are thankfully changing all that. Many of us have been plugging more deeply into the history. We now have a working understanding of the protracted yet highly entertaining `Battle of the Sites’ saga when, 100 years ago, a host of Australian towns and cities aspired to be what one writer called ‘the treasure house of a nation’s heart’.


We now know that it was the option called ‘Yass-Canberra’ that won out in late 1908, and that it was Charles Scrivener, by all accounts the most brilliant surveyor of his generation, who was tasked with finding the specific location for the federal city within the ‘Yass-Canberra’ region.


Scrivener and his talented team got the job done with consummate professionalism during 1909, but the intended Federal Capital Territory—from 1938, the Australian Capital Territory—now needed its precise boundaries. It required, first, a gift of land from the NSW State Government to the national government. And it needed an appropriate mechanism to enable the gifted land to be governed by the Commonwealth—an Administration Act—which ultimately became legislation in late 1910.


The year 1910 in fact assumes a noble place in the larger national capital story, for it was almost exactly 100 years ago that the ultra-challenging
 
 border survey, to delineate the FCT borders, was commenced. In country that required he and his team to be crawling on all fours on occasion, up and down cliff faces, Percy Lempriere Sheaffe commenced the survey at Mt Coree, in the nearby Brindabellas, in late May 1910.


The survey evolved into an epic, 5-year adventure, yet even a cursory read of the original manuscript material underscores an issue for our Federation founders that is as relevant today as then: the crucial importance of water. Water dominated inter-government deliberations on the capital throughout 1909 and for most of 1910.


When Mr Surveyor Scrivener, as he was rather stuffily called, sent his Report to the Minister for Home Affairs in May 1909, the first sub-heading in the milestone document is simply entitled: ‘Water Supply’. Scrivener proceeds to go into the topic in near-encyclopaedic fashion, armed with every imaginable statistic related to the catchments of the Molonglo, Murrumbidgee, Queanbeyan and Cotter Rivers.


Scrivener’s Report soon became the catalyst for a busy exchange between the NSW Premier and the Prime Minister, as both men strove for advantage to ensure acceptable water supply for their respective constituencies.


It is hardly surprising that when the Fisher Government published the ‘Information, Conditions and Particulars’ for Canberra’s international design competition in 1911 that potential applicants were advised that ‘water supply must be of sufficient magnitude to place the question of volume at all seasons and purity beyond doubt’.


It is not hard to empathise with, and learn from, our forebears. Both the Rudd and Stanhope Governments, fully engaged with the substance of the irrefutable science in the 2007 Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, continue to ensure that water is a fundamental priority in the thinking for our inland national capital.


Accordingly, in the last few months there has been a succession of important announcements to progress the water agenda.


In November 2009, ACTEW and the Stanhope Government started construction of the Cotter Dam extension on the western outskirts of Canberra, easily the biggest building project in the ACT since the construction of the new Parliament House. The Cotter extension, a vital project for the ACT and surrounding regions, will make certain that residents of the ACT have adequate and safe drinking supplies—‘purity beyond doubt’, as the founders so memorably put it—even if climate change leads to longer and more severe droughts.


In December 2009, the Environment Minister Peter Garrett and I announced a $2.9 million project for the Australian National Botanic Garden;—honouring a carefully considered election commitment of the Rudd Government to construct a pipeline from Lake Burley Griffin that will deliver 170 million litres of non-potable water to the Gardens each year. It should be operational sometime next summer.


As Senators are aware, this is a project very dear to my heart both as a resident of the ACT and as a firm supporter of the seminal cultural role of the national ‘treasure house’ institutions in the education of our nation.


The beautiful Botanic Gardens, the living collection of which represents an extraordinary one third of Australia’s plant diversity, is a key part of the umbrella of national institutions in Canberra—an umbrella which was seriously under-emphasised, even undermined during the Howard Government years. Some were let run down, but none so seriously as the Australian National Botanic Gardens.


Fortunately, the winds of change are blowing for the better. It has been my privilege to host two forums over the last 12 months which have drawn government and public attention to the neglect. The new Director of the Gardens, Dr Judy West, has welcomed what she has called a ‘fantastic start’ to a new future.


One might use these same words to describe the situation at yet another cultural treasure of the national capital, the Albert Hall, which only last week celebrated its 82nd birthday amidst a gratifying surge of historically savvy community support. It has been well-documented that the Albert Hall endured a crisis period during the dying days of the Howard Government, when the National Capital Authority’s potentially disastrous Draft Amendment 53 proposed significant built development within the Albert Hall’s quality heritage precinct.


Community fury—direct, purposeful action—led to the eventual withdrawal of the ill-considered Amendment. It is one of life’s pleasures for me, driving to work down Commonwealth Avenue, to witness the elegant refurbishment work now going on at Albert Hall, courtesy of some $2.73 million in heritage funding from the ACT Government, topped up with an additional $500,000 in federal funding.


When King O’Malley, as Minister for Home Affairs, addressed the House of Representatives chamber on 9 November 1910, he had become an outspoken advocate of the Canberra option. He called it ‘a new Eden’, and recalled the first time he viewed the Limestone Plains from the vantage point of Mt Pleasant, the hill behind Duntroon.


With characteristic flourish, O’Malley said that ‘ ... Moses, thousands of years ago, as he gazed down on the promised land, saw no more beautiful panoramic view than I did ... the site of the Federal city, like that of Rome, is located on seven hills, and must remind travellers of that ancient Italian city which was the capital of the world’s civilisation. l shall not say that such will be the case with the Federal city’, O’Malley went on, ‘but 1 believe it will be the capital for many centuries of civilisation in this southern hemisphere’.


Phew. In the build-up to Canberra’s Centenary birthday, while Senators might not be prepared to go the full distance of O’Malley’s euphoric vision of the future, we have been entrusted as the latest generation of custodians to look after this city, the finest capital city-in-the-landscape in the world. Canberra’s Centenary birthdays are a timely reminder of the obligations of that custodianship—one that I hope all federal parliamentarians will relish. We all have a story to tell.
