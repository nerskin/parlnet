"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-05-11,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. Is the minister aware that the Reserve Bank confirmed in this month's statement on monetary policy that Japan's economy has been stagnating since April 1997—since the decision to increase the country's GST rate from three to five per cent? Isn't it a fact that Japan's series of income tax cuts in 1998 failed to kick-start the economy because consumers focused on the tax increase? Given the disastrous impact the GST increase had on the Japanese economy, on what basis does the Howard government assume its 10 per cent GST on virtually every good and service will not have a similar effect on the Australian economy?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Compensation</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-05-11,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. The point about Japan was that the income tax cuts failed to offset the particular problems with the increase in the GST which dented consumer demand. Do the Treasurer's comments that any added GST compensation would cause the economy to overheat mean that the government will not be providing any more so-called compensation, except of course to casino high rollers?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Compensation</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—Thank you, Senator Sherry, for that question. The disaster which afflicted the Australian economy occurred with Mr Keating's recession we had to have. It was Mr Keating's policies which drove the Australian economy through the floor, which raised rates of interest—
—Tell us about the GST.
—You asked about the Australian economy and I am telling you what happened in the Australian economy. The Keating experiment resulted at times in home loan interest rates rising above 17 per cent and going north. It resulted in an unemployment level of 11.4 per cent compared with about 7.4 per cent today. Senator, the Labor Party cannot teach this government anything at all about responsible management of the economy. It is well known that there are serious problems in Japan—serious problems which have been accumulating for a long period of time. So your attempt, Senator, to claim that this was a result of a GST is, frankly, not correct.
We are trying to carry the reform agenda onwards in the Australian economy. We are trying to move reform along a very broad front. We make no apologies for tax cuts. In your question you pointed to tax cuts in Japan as failing to stimulate the economy. Let me make it quite clear: this government makes no apology for cutting taxes. We would like to deliver to the Australian people exactly what we promised in the last election, which was, amongst other things, major tax reform, including some $13 billion of tax cuts to taxpayers.
The reforms we have in place will continue this broad thrust which has made Australia, according to one of the American economists, 
 one of the miracle economies of the world. That came about because this government was prepared to pursue a reform agenda, the vast proportion of which was resisted at every turn by the Labor Party. Senator, let me assure you that we wish to proceed at full speed with our tax reform programs, which include a GST and major tax cuts for individuals. We wish to proceed with our reform agenda as very well articulated by Senator Alston in telecommunications and by Peter Reith in industrial relations. This government is not afraid of reform. If the Labor Party cannot assist that process, we would like them to get out of the way and allow us to do the job.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Compensation</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-05-11,"—I ask Senator Ellison representing the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in accordance with the provisions of standing order 74(5), for an explanation of his failure to answer question on notice 231 placed on notice on 25 November 1998.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 231</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-05-11,"—I understand that there was an answer tabled this morning in relation to this matter. That was my understanding but I can say that the history of this matter is that the question arrived in the department shortly before the Christmas-New Year period when a significant number of the relevant staff took leave. When investigating the response it was found that the same question had been asked of the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Therefore, in order to ensure that the two responses did not repeat information it was decided not to include information relating to the employment function which had transferred to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.
Sorting that information out took some time. With the transfer of staff and responsibilities to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and the passage of time since activities under particular contracts had been completed, access to some financial records was delayed while relevant files were located and retrieved from storage. The department's financial computer systems have changed and some delays were experienced in gathering and verifying financial data from two computer systems.
There is no legal or common definition of market research and it was unclear as to whether some activities constituted market research. This involved consideration of many 
 more contracts to ensure completeness of the response. Many of the department's resources were committed to responding to similar questions taken on notice from Senator estimates sessions. I had made inquiries, as I had received notice from Senator Ray in relation to this matter, and I had understood that the answer to Senator Ray's question on notice 231 was going to be tabled. If that has not occurred today, I will undertake to have it tabled after question time.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 231</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech

That the Senate take note of the explanation.
I did not actually require that long explanation. The question may have been tabled. What your two colleagues did with a similar thing was just send it to my office as well as the Table Office. If that had been done, I would not even have raised it here today. If the question is under way, that is fine, but I do ask that in future, like most of your colleagues, you send it to the senator's office at the same time as you send it to the Table Office, and we then do not even have to go through this palaver.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today, relating to trade and the economy.
Tonight the Treasurer will be delivering the budget for Australia for the next year. One of the things we will not hear anything about is the abysmal performance of this government in terms of managing its trade account and the abysmal performance of this government in racking up levels of foreign debt that are now a record. Let us just go to three figures. Australia has the largest ever trade deficit in its history—over $10 billion of trade deficit in the year 1998. We have the largest ever 
 current account deficit. It was over $28 billion in 1998. And we have the highest foreign debt—defined as net foreign liabilities—of over $350 billion at the current level. That is to say, this government has brought in the trifecta: the largest ever trade deficit, the largest ever current account deficit, and the largest level of foreign debt in the history of this nation. We will not hear very much from Mr Costello tonight about answers to those problems, if the answer by Senator Hill in question time today is any guide.
We ought to consider this. Australia has been a sovereign nation for 98 years. In that time we have had 35 Treasurers. Peter Costello is the 35th Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia. He has done what none of the other 34 could do. He has managed, as I say, the trifecta: record trade deficit, record current account deficit and record foreign debt. When we went to the election in 1996 honourable senators may remember the Liberal Party debt truck rolling through the hills and breaking down in the Blue Mountains, claiming that the Labor government at that time was making sure that foreign debt was out of control. Foreign debt is out of control and it has sky-rocketed since those days under the very government that promised it would break the back of foreign debt. It has done so. Foreign debt is reeling out of control and is now a major economic problem for the country.
When we asked the government today what they are going to do about it, what did they say? They blamed Asia as the cause of their problems. What do they otherwise say? They say that they will not spend any money to help Australian exporters develop new markets in other parts of the world to overcome the problems. We are buying more than we are selling on our external account. We are importing more than we are exporting. Imports are going up and exports are going down. The gap is widening. It cannot continue without bringing major economic problems to the domestic economy.
Let me go through the figures on the trade deficit. Not only did the trade deficit for 1998 top $10 billion but also the trade figures released last week paint a very bleak picture. 
 In trend terms, the deficit for March was $1.4 billion, the fifth successive record monthly trade deficit ever, and exports fell and imports rose. But it gets worse. In trend terms, Australia has had a trade deficit for the past 22 months, since the middle of 1997. We have had a trade deficit since—remember these people—Geoff Prosser, John Sharp and David Jull were ministers. That is how long it has been going.
Let me turn for a moment to the balance of payments deficit. Australia's current account deficit in 1998 was over $28 billion. This represents an increase over the previous year, 1997, of 67 per cent. It is ballooning out of control. It cannot be blamed on growth either. The rate of the current account deficit to GDP is now five per cent higher than when the coalition came to office. The ratio of the current account deficit to GDP is steadily increasing. It has grown every quarter since December last year.
On foreign debt, our net foreign liabilities are now $350 billion. That not only is an all-time record but also is up more than a fifth from when the coalition was first elected in 1996. If tonight Treasurer Costello pretends that he has won the gold medal for Australia, he has in fact won the wooden spoon on the trade deficit, on the current account deficit and on our net foreign debt. There will be no cry tonight of `Gold, gold, gold, Costello!' It is the wooden spoon all the way.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade Deficit</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-05-11,"—It is very sad when you have to get up and respond to a former failed minister, now a tired spokesman for an opposition that have no policies of their own to advance and that have a record, whilst in government, of 13 years of abysmal economic performance. The sheer audacity of them, I have to say, is absolutely astounding. The leader under which Senator Cook serves was the finance minister of this country. For the two years that he was finance minister, the federal budget deficit racked up $24 billion worth. In other words, 25 per cent of the federal government debt that had been incurred from 1901 through to 1996 was incurred in the two years that Mr Beazley was the finance minister. Indeed, 
 Senator Cook was a senior minister in that government, and he has the absolute audacity to come into this chamber and try to lecture and hector us about economic performance.
The worst economic performance that any government could have is one million people unemployed. Senator Cook was the chief architect of government policy at that time under Labor. That is the worst social statistic that any country could have, and Senator Cook presided over that. Was there any mention of that today? No, because we have brought unemployment down, haven't we, to 7.4 per cent. That is the lowest it has been in the 1990s.
What about the budget deficit that Labor used to have? It is down; down to a surplus. The surplus is being used to pay off Labor's debts—the debts that people like Senator Cook racked up. They have the audacity to come into this chamber and try to tell us that somehow they have all of the economic answers. The reality is that, whilst Asia was booming, Labor was racking up budget deficit after budget deficit. Yet whilst we have been in government, Asia has been in crisis but we have been able to return budget surpluses. How have we done that? We have done that by sound economic management. As a result, interest rates have gone down, home loan affordability has gone up and small business loan affordability has gone up. As a result, employment opportunities have gone up and unemployment has come down. This is in stark contradistinction to all of those indicators whilst Labor was in government and especially while Senator Cook was parading as industry minister.
The Labor Party have a feeling that Australia is going to get another excellent Costello budget tonight so they are desperately trying to scratch around to find some sort of indicator that might take some of the gloss off the budget that will be delivered tonight. I am sure that the people who are currently in the budget lockup, from the media and elsewhere, going through the budget documentation will be more than satisfied that the budget being brought down tonight will deliver further economic recovery to this great country and will undo the damage done by Mr Beazley 
 and Senator Cook whilst they had charge of the economic management of this country.
It is the height of audacity and duplicity for Senator Cook—with the failed past economic performance over which he presided—to come into this place and try to hector and lecture us about economic performance. We were judged at the last election on economic performance and we were re-elected. In support of that mandate given to us, we will be delivering another excellent budget this evening. I say to Senator Cook: watch this space; come into this place tonight and listen to a wonderful budget speech.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade Deficit</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-05-11,"—The issue that we are taking note of from question time concerns Senator Cook's question to Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, about the massive trade deficit for March of approximately $1.4 billion. It is interesting to note that either Senator Abetz did not listen to Senator Cook's question, because it went to trade deficit, not a budget deficit, or—
—He did not understand it.
—That is right. Senator Abetz attempted to give us a lecture about budget deficits and not trade deficits. Trade deficit concerns imports and exports. Maybe Senator Abetz does not know what it is all about. That is the issue relating to trade deficits, not budget deficits. Senator Cook asked Senator Hill about a very serious issue which goes to the fundamental future of the economy of Australia: the trade deficit. We had the second highest trade deficit on record in March and an accumulated total to date of $35 billion, or approximately 6 per cent of the economy's output. This is at a time when the economy is growing strongly. It is interesting to note that on previous occasions when we have had significant trade deficits it has been as a consequence of a drought or at a time of recession. To have a trade deficit at this time, when the economy is growing strongly, is a problem. What is going to happen when the economy grows less strongly at some point in time?
This large deficit raises questions about the country's ability to repay debt. The Treasurer, 
 Mr Costello, continues to maintain that the best way of sustaining and underwriting our national debt is to have a surplus on the Commonwealth budget. To that extent Senator Abetz's comments were remotely relevant. The Treasurer asserts that he does not want to add to the blow-out of the budget deficit. I will return to that point a little later. What is interesting in the latest figures is that our exports were assisted by gold sales going up by $261 million to $9.3 billion. That is before the latest decline in gold sales. We all remember that the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, touched off a decline in gold sales. Since then I notice that the Swiss and now the British have been announcing a sell-off of gold, and we certainly will not see this improved export performance in gold in the near future. It is also interesting to note that imports rose by 9.3 per cent in the nine months to March but exports rose by just 0.2 per cent. We do not hear any more about the debt truck. Remember the debt truck that the Liberal Party in opposition used to drive around? It is in the garage, and I do not think we are going to see that truck for a long time.
What are the consequences of this massive trade deficit for Australia? The reality is that to sustain that debt we have to import capital. We have to import capital in ever increasing amounts because if we do not we cannot pay for our imports. The other particular problem we have is that we have a very low, and declining, national savings level. National savings is a relevant issue; not the budget surplus but national savings is the most important issue in relation to paying for imported capital. As we have to import so much capital to meet the trade deficit, there is only one way to do that: sell off Australian assets and transfer ownership of Australian assets overseas.
In the last few weeks the Reserve Bank of Australia has warned about the consequences of and all the hoopla concerning government budget surpluses. The big problem is that government surpluses and savings have been achieved at the cost of declining household savings. This government has transferred savings from the pockets of Australians to government savings. So you have a neutral 
 outcome in terms of total savings levels in this country, and in fact we have declining national savings. Interestingly, national savings are close to zero at the present time. For Australians to pay the ever increasing national debt, we will have to sell off our assets, increasing foreign ownership, as I have said. That is, of course, until Australian consumers run up to their debt limit, and I suspect that we are fast reaching that point. Add the impact of a GST and we will have a very unfortunate recipe for the economy when it slows.

"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1999-05-11,"—I want to redress in the time available to me those intellectually impecunious comments made by Senator Cook and Senator Sherry. They would have you believe that somehow the Australian economy is in decline. There are no words of encouragement by the two Labor speakers. Why wouldn't you have words of encouragement when the OECD says that the Australian economy is the fastest growing of all the OECD countries; when, of the G7 economies, Australia in 1999 is the fastest growing economy apart from the US and in the year 2000 will be the fastest growing economy of the G7 nations? Why didn't they say that? Why didn't they also mention that Mr Beazley, now the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, in the two years that he was finance minister racked up $23 billion of debt? We are not talking about $6 billion; we are talking about $23 billion in two years, in the last year of which, when he said there was going to be a surplus in the economy, he produced a $10 billion deficit—the infamous $10 billion black hole of Mr Beazley.
The opposition would also have you believe that we do not have the largest job vacancies on record in Australia right now, that we do not have low interest rates and that we do not have low inflation rates. Why weren't those things mentioned? The opposition want to destroy what is the fastest growing economy in the world, coupled to the lowest inflation. What other evidence do we have of the Labor Party wanting to destroy? No phoenix rises out of the Labor Party ashes; none at all. They want to destroy small business in the 
 same manner as they are trying to destroy this economy with their failure to pass the amendments to the unfair dismissal laws. They wanted to destroy the states, and they still do, by bypassing the states and having a plan to fund local government. They wanted to destroy the workplace by failing to pass workplace agreements. They wanted to destroy the mining industry in Australia, the backbone of Australia's economy, by failing to pass the Native Title Amendment Act and putting a lot of the people they purport to represent out of work. They want to destroy that. They want to destroy it in Western Australia by not passing complementary native title amendment bills.
—You wanted to secede.
—I remind the Senate—over and above Senator George Campbell's raucous outburst—that in fact the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, comes from Western Australia. Why does a Leader of the Opposition, who hungers to be Prime Minister of this country—God forbid—and who comes from Western Australia, not instruct his people to pass the native title bill and want to destroy the economy of Australia by not doing so?
—They wouldn't take any notice of him anyway.
—They don't take any notice of him. But that is the shame of the dearth of talent in the Labor Party: that you have to have a man who is so out of touch with reality that he fails to, or chooses not to, instruct his people to pass the state native title bills that have such a fundamental effect on the national economy.
—Senator, please do not reflect upon a member of either house or of any of the state parliaments.
Senator George Campbell interjecting—
—I have not done that yet, Madam Deputy President, but I thank you very much indeed for your advice, even though it was interrupted—rather rudely, I thought—by Senator George Campbell. We draw a distinction between the two Campbells, of course: the one on our side has some 
 talent; the one on the other side is a destroyer, incidentally. Maybe it is part of the psyche of the trade union movement to destroy in order to rebuild, and that comes into this place through people like Senator George Campbell. Let me quote what the International Monetary Fund said about the Australian economy. It commended:
. . . the Australian authorities for implementing sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms which have built the foundation of Australia's impressive record of strong growth and low inflation in recent years.
That is the International Monetary Fund. Can you find something wrong with that? Do you also want to destroy the International Monetary Fund? You want to destroy the GST. Why do you want to destroy the GST as well? Because you know that once the GST is passed in this place—even with amendments—we will be in power for years and years to come. If the economy is bubbling along so well now, you ain't seen nothing yet. When that GST is passed, it will give another shot in the arm to the best economy in the world.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade Deficit</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-05-11,"—I also want to address the answer given by Senator Hill to Senator Cook's question. I will remind the Senate that the question related to our foreign debt and the current account deficit, not to the raft of other issues that have been raised by speakers on the other side of the chamber.
It is interesting that, when we have a discussion or questions about the economy in this place, people on the other side are always keen to jump up and quote figures that might suit their argument. But when it comes to raising issues and questions about the foreign debt that this country faces, what have they said since 1996? Very little indeed. This is an issue that they put squarely on the agenda prior to the last election. They made foreign debt the central economic argument in this country in 1996. They built the debt truck; they took it around this country, saying to Australians that their standard of living was going to be destroyed because they owed $10,000 per person to the rest of the world for Australia's foreign debt.
Let us compare what they said in 1996 with what has happened in fact over the past three years. Let us look at what the Prime Minister said, in response to a journalist, when he launched the debt truck on 20 September 1995. The journalist asked:
Can you promise that foreign debt will be lowered in the first year of the Howard Government?
The Prime Minister said:
I can promise you that we will follow policies which will, over a period of time, bring down the foreign debt.
He was asked:
Over what time frame?
He said:
I can't put figures on it in months, I can't.
In response to a further question by the journalist:
Will that be your first priority if you win Government?
he said:
Our first priority as Peter Costello and I have made repeatedly clear, our first priority in Government economically will be to tackle the current account deficit.
Haven't they done a wonderful job in carrying out their priority? What is the foreign debt? In March 1996, when they took power, net debt was $191 billion. In December last year it had risen to $236 billion, a growth of some $50 billion in a period of something like 2½ years—a wonderful carrying out of their commitment to reduce foreign debt; a wonderful performance on their priority. But what is the current account deficit? It has now risen from 4.7 per cent of GDP in March 1996 to five per cent in December last year, another significant performance on the priority commitments that they made to the Australian people.
What did the Prime Minister go on to say that day in respect of the foreign debt? He said:
. . . we've run up that $180 billion over the last decade because of bad economic policies—
so he judged our economic policies on the basis of the foreign debt that we had run up—
which have allowed us over a . . . period of time to import far more than we have exported, and because of our low savings we've borrowed the 
 difference, we've borrowed from foreigners in order to buy the surplus imports, and that's why we have an enormous foreign debt that's feeding into our interest rate bill to our daily bills. The fact that in the last decade, the household debt in this country has gone from 45 to 65 cents of disposable income—it's one of the reasons why Australians feel a lot worse off . . .
Let us have a look at what household debt is today. The Prime Minister said it was 65c of disposable income in September 1995. In December 1998 it is 90.45 per cent of disposable income—a significant jump over the 2½-year period of this government. I think a most telling point was an explanation of the Liberal Party in respect of that truck back in September 1995—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade Deficit</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-05-11,"—If we look at a Bible reference—they were wise and far-seeing people in those days—a prophet was always one except in his own country and was always acknowledged as such. I think that is very much true of the perspective of the Australian Labor Party when they view the performance of the Australian economy. They are blind to what is happening in their own country, and a lot of the rhetoric we hear today is reminiscent of that particular phobia or that past approach.
Let us examine some of the articles appearing overseas that indicate how people overseas perceive Australia. I submit that they perceive Australia to be in a far healthier state, to be a more prosperous country, than what is portrayed here today. First of all, let us look at what the Singaporeans say, and I quote from the eminent Wall Street Journal of Wednesday, 28 April 1999:
Australia hasn't just avoided the Asian-Pacific downturn, it has roared ahead. While the economies of most of its Asian trading partners contracted last year, Australia expanded 5.1 per cent, surpassing the US's 3.9 pace and making it one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world . . . 1999 is likely to be the eighth consecutive year of growth.
That is certainly good news; the sort of diatribe we heard a few minutes ago is not. After a decade of unflattering comparisons with Asia's once booming economies, Australia is now basking in praise from the most unlikely sources, including the proud 
 Singaporeans who had looked down on Australians as their poor cousins.
Let us look at the performance of exporters, because it used to be said that Australia rides on the sheep's back. No more. The variety of Australian exports is expanding. We are going into new markets with new products. I come back to the eminent Wall Street Journal to see what it has to say:
Australian exporters, which deregulation and privatisation had forced to become more nimble, diverted their wares from sinking Asian economies to healthier ones elsewhere. When the South Korean market went sour, for example, Qantas Airways deployed aircraft on the more promising Indian routes. As Indonesia's economic crash hampered sales of live cattle there, Australian producers began wooing buyers in Mexico and Libya. All told, Australia's sales of goods to Asia including Japan slid six per cent last year in value terms from 1997 while exports to the US and Europe climbed 34 and 42 per cent respectively. The total exports of goods and services rose in 1998 by a modest two per cent.
We see there that overseas people view Australia in a very positive light.
Australia's propensity to save will increase quite significantly with the passage of a number of bills, hopefully this month or next month, when 80 per cent of Australians will have a tax rate of 30 per cent or less. With such a higher disposable income there is a greater propensity to save. Foreign debt is made up of a number of components. There is government debt, of which Commonwealth debt is a declining proportion.
I would like to draw the Senate's attention in this debate to an issue put forward by Jubilee 2000 which is asking some of the richer countries of the world to actually write off some of the debt of the Third World—those countries whose living standards are declining because of repatriation problems and the meeting of interest commitments. I commend that particular approach to all the wealthier countries around the world.
Undoubtedly, Australia's current account deficit has been affected by lower export prices. We are all aware of the pressure under which some of our exporters are placed. This has been reflected in share prices. There has been pressure from reduced prices for exports 
 of coal, iron ore and those sorts of things, but we have a strong domestic economy. (Time expired)

That the time for the presentation of the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector on the degree of industry concentration within the retailing sector in Australia, be extended to 30 August 1999.
I also seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  a short statement in relation to the notice of motion.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector was appointed on 10 December 1998.
The resolution of appointment provided for a reporting date of no later than 6 months after the resolution was agreed to; that is, 10 June 1999. 

However, membership of the Committee was not finalised until 15 February 1999 and the Committee did not hold its first meeting until 16 February, effectively putting the Committee two months behind schedule.
The Committee has received a large number of submissions. The first round of public hearings in capital cities commenced in April 1999 and indicated high level public interest in the inquiry.
Because of the current parliamentary sitting pattern, it is not possible to conduct further public hearings until July 1999, further delaying the schedule. It is proposed to hold these hearings in parts of rural and regional Australia.
Because of the importance of the inquiry, the complexity of the issues involved and the initial delay in getting under way, it is therefore necessary to seek an extension of time to report.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,3,1,speech
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-05-11,"—On behalf of Senator Gibson, I present the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office for 1999-2000. I also seek leave to incorporate the report in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The report read as follows—
Report on the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office for 1999-2000.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Auditor-General Act 1997, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has considered the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office for the 1999-2000 financial year.
The Committee is able to advise the Parliament that it is satisfied that the draft budget estimates submitted by the Auditor-General to the Committee on 24 March 1999 are sufficient to enable the Auditor-General to properly exercise his functions and powers under the Act, covering financial statements, performance audits, and audit services.
In his submission the Auditor-General noted that the ANAO's total cash budget appropriation in 1998-99 was $53.8 million and that no Additional 
 Estimates funding had been sought. 1998-9 budget allocations were used to fund strategically important projects such as restructuring, computer replacements and enhancements to the ANAO's Financial Management and Human Resource Management Systems.
The Auditor General told the Committee that there were a number of significant changes to the environment in which the 1999-2000 Budget and forward estimates were constructed, the most important of these being the implementation of an accrual budgeting framework for the Commonwealth to take effect with the 1999-2000 Budget. The ANAO has for some years been costing its products on an accrual basis and is well placed to move to an accrual based budget. The ANAO has also implemented, with effect from 1 July 1998, a new Financial Management Information System to support the revised financial management framework.
The implementation of accrual budgeting is accompanied by the introduction of an Outcomes and Outputs structure which will replace the existing program structures. The new framework places a particular focus on the outputs, or goods and services produced by agencies, and the links between them and the desired outcomes of Government activity. The ANAO's outputs are defined as follows:
1.	 Performance Audit Services
2.	 Information Support Services
3.	 Assurance Audit Services.
The key elements of ANAO's business as summarised in the Auditor-General's submission are:
.	 Running costs account for the significant majority of ANAO resources;
.	 Property operating expenses, covered by a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Finance, are included in running costs;
.	 under the accrual budgeting environment, the previous system of annual appropriations for agencies will be replaced by appropriations for Departmental items and appropriations for Administered items;
.	 for the ANAO, future appropriations will, for the most part relate to Departmental items. The Auditor-General's salary and allowances will continue to be funded by the special appropriation under the Auditor-General Act.
The total budget allocation being sought for 1999-2000 is $53.6 million.
In terms of output groups, the Performance Audit Services Output Group estimates were for $18.7 million, the Information Support Services Output Group estimates were for $1.7 million and the Assurance Audit Services Output Group estimates 
 were for $26.6 million. Although the Auditor-General understands that carryovers will not form part of the budget parameters beyond 1999-2000, it is proposed, in line with existing practice, to maintain a strategic reserve fund which is needed to assist in the management of the ANAO's business.
The process by which the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has begun to fulfil  its enhanced responsibilities under the Auditor-General Act, and the Financial  Management and Accountability Act has continued to evolve during this year. It is only by  the experience of deliberating on matters like the appointment of the Independent  Auditor, and the approval of ANAO's draft budget estimates that the practical extent of  the Committee's powers of scrutiny can be defined in a way which enhances the powers  of the Parliament to keep government accountable.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,1999-05-11,"—I present the report of the Select Committee on Information Technologies on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999, together with submissions, Hansard  record and minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In moving this motion, I report to the Senate that the report has only just been sent to the printer and copies are not expected to be available until tomorrow morning. However, an electronic copy of the report will be available on the Internet very shortly.
I present the report of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies entitled  Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  which looks at legislation to regulate online services. Schedule 2 of the bill makes a consequential amendment to the Crimes Act 1914. The committee held four days of public hearings and took evidence from 33 witnesses, resulting in more than 320 pages of transcript. The committee also received 104 submissions on the legislation covering industry, interest groups and the community.
There was overwhelming support from witnesses that what is regulated offline should also have a regulatory framework online. The legislation will operate as a three-way partnership between parents, government and industry. This partnership was put very succinctly by a representative of Young Media Australia, Ms Toni Jupe, when she told the committee:
We agree that parents ought to take a greater degree of responsibility but, as with other forms of media, we also believe that there should be a triangular partnership on this matter between the Government, industry and the community.
The legislation extends the existing system of classifying material from film and broadcasting to the Internet. Such consistency will 
 ensure that community standards are protected as widely as possible. It provides a clear legislative framework for the protection of all Australians from illegal and highly offensive material.
The committee believes the government's approach accommodates emerging technologies and recognises the dynamic nature of the electronic industry, recognising that what is not possible today may in fact be possible tomorrow. The range of witnesses who appeared before the committee reflected the vigorous debate which has been taking place within the Internet community about this legislation and this has mainly covered three broad themes: that the legislation in some way restricts freedom of speech; that it is imposing technical restrictions on the Internet which will slow access speeds and destroy electronic commerce; and that it dismisses the fact that the responsibility for protecting children from harmful Internet content should rest with government, parents and the industry.
Evidence received from both industry and community representatives largely addressed these concerns. Firstly, the Australian media and broadcast mediums already operate in a regulated environment. There is no absolute freedom of speech. A large amount of printed material is also subject to classification. This legislation simply extends the existing system of classification from film and television to the Internet. It will ensure that the community will be protected in as broad a sense as possible.
There was no evidence presented to the committee that paedophilia or sexually explicit or violent material should be freely available on the Internet. In fact, Ms Fiona Patten from the Eros Foundation told the committee, `If material is restricted to adults in any other medium, it should be restricted to adults on the Net.'
Concerns that the legislation imposes technical restrictions on the Net which would slow access speeds and interfere with electronic commerce were also resolved by expert industry witnesses. Mr Alan Jones, Chief Executive Officer of Clairview Internet Pty Ltd, told the committee:
One issue that was brought up in the CSIRO report that I found interesting was the comments of how e-commerce could be hurt by such blocking. Whilst it is true that blocking will hurt e-commerce sites that co-host pornographic material with their sites, I think the worry of it will be almost negligible.
The committee heard from Dr Philip McCrea, one of the co-authors of the June 1998 CSIRO report, that filtering is technically possible. He said:
When done by backbone service providers possibly packet level filtering would be the most appropriate. When done at the ISP level, then probably filtering against `black lists' would be the most appropriate.
Dr McCrea told the committee:
The second approach recognises that it is possible to provide some sort of filtering by an ISP. Our conclusion was that this is probably the most effective form of filtering.
Young Media Australia pressed upon the committee the need for parents and guardians to understand that this media is unregulated and something needs to be done about it. They said:
We feel that we represent the broad parent community that feels that it is not really across the more technical aspects of some of these issues, yet they are being told on a daily basis that virtually all the responsibility for doing something about the protection of their children from any harmful effects of the technology is entirely their responsibility.
This legislation does not remove the responsibility of parents, guardians or individuals to manage their and their children's use of the Internet. In fact, the committee agrees with this and welcomes the government's approach to encourage parents to utilise the existing filtering software and suitable search engines.
America Online presented evidence to the committee that, of their 17 million members worldwide, 53 per cent are families and of that group 82 per cent already use the parental control systems which America Online offers. Dr Ritz, America Online's business affairs director said:
We think that there is a very strong argument that these parental controls, if they are made easy, do work and parents can use them.
The government's approach to the resolution of children gaining access to inappropriate online material does not rely just on this 
 legislation because there is a community consensus that wider community education is an important part of the framework to regulate online services. The committee took the view that this form of education was equally as important as the package of measures put forward by the government. Of course at the end of the day, extensive community education does not represent a total solution to the problem of inappropriate material being available online.
The committee welcomes the establishment of the proposed community advisory committee, which will be an important adjunct to the ABA and will, in the committee's opinion, give this important element of the government's package the level of priority it deserves. The committee recognised that emerging technologies will always entail people finding ways around technical restrictions but felt that the overall success of the measures should take into account general compliance rather than simply measure universal compliance.
The committee has recommended that several areas of the legislation be further investigated and commented upon. These include the lack of a specific reference to technical feasibility in the legislation; the practical difficulties of complying with `take down' orders, for example, on non-working days; further explanation of the differing roles of states and territories with the Commonwealth; and the need to clarify the responsibility of Internet content providers. However, the committee recommended that the legislation be supported. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-05-11,"—The opposition wishes to place a few points on the public record concerning the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 , which is the subject of a report tabled today. The shadow minister for communications made 
 three key points in respect of the referral of this bill to the IT committee for investigation. Firstly, he said that the opposition supported a workable and feasible regulation of Internet content which placed realistic roadblocks in the way of children being exposed to content unacceptable by community standards. Secondly, he said that the government's announcement was duplicitous because it deliberately sought to create the impression that the government's announced measure would solve the problem of unacceptable content, when the reality is—backed by CSIRO advice and industry analysis—that it is not feasible to regulate such content as over 90 per cent of offensive content comes from offshore. Thirdly, he suggested in his press release that the sensible public policy approach to Internet content is to empower parents and schools, particularly by way of information about end use filter devices.
The bill was referred to the select committee, public hearings have been conducted and the committee is reporting today. Debate on the bill is listed on the Notice Paper to commence this Thursday in the Senate. A brief description of the legislation is appropriate so that we understand the matter that we are discussing. Firstly, the legislation seeks to regulate content on the Internet through amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act. Secondly, the legislation introduces a content rating regime for the Internet analogous to that in existence for broadcast and narrow cast technology and requires the industry to develop an industry code of conduct to address the issues. Thirdly, the legislation empowers the Australian Broadcasting Authority to oversee regulation and adherence to the code and to develop an ABA standard by 1 March 2000 if an industry code is not ratified by 1 January that year.
Fourthly, the legislation effects a process by which the ABA, on complaint about material, can require an Internet service provider to take down X or refuse classification rated material hosted onshore and to take all reasonable steps to prevent access to X or refuse classification rated material hosted offshore. In respect of R classified onshore content, the ABA must be satisfied that restricted access 
 arrangements—PIN, password or age—are in place and no proposal is made in respect of offshore classified R material. The bill specifies time frames for the take-down process and penalties for non-compliance. The bill does not apply to live Internet content such as news groups, chat channels or email.
Initial industry reactions to the legislation can only be described as hostile. Major criticisms have included the following: firstly, that content regulation is inappropriate for the Internet medium and, as a matter of principle, there should be no restrictions at all on Internet content; secondly, that the proposals in respect of offshore content regulation are unworkable; thirdly, that the proposals would place an onerous economic burden on Internet service providers; and, fourthly, that the proposals would reduce or destroy Australia's attractiveness as an Internet e-commerce jurisdiction.
Industry reaction to the detail of the legislation during the select committee hearings was hostile. In particular, detailed criticisms made at public hearings and via written submissions have included that a 24 hour take-down period for onshore content is far too short, that the penalty regime is excessive and punitive, and that the legislation does not expressly specify what `all reasonable steps' are required to be taken in respect of offshore content.
The opposition has considered a range of the submissions made to the committee, and we express publicly the following concerns. Firstly, the legislation is not being dealt with on its merits but is linked to a 1 July 1999 timetable which has caused indecent haste and inadequate and less than thorough consideration of the technical aspects and the merit of the bill. Secondly, we regard with sadness but with ongoing anger the duplicity of the government's presentation to the general public of the effectiveness of the regime to control offshore content. Thirdly, there is the unworkability of the proposals and the ease with which they can be bypassed by a range of individuals; and an acknowledgment, but not unthinking acceptance, of the narrow casting classification regime in respect of the Internet medium, together with an acknow 
 ledgment that this may well have to be revisited in the future, particularly in the light of whatever changes convergence of technology brings.
The Commonwealth needs to pursue international arrangements in respect of Internet content and regulation. We suggest that the real solution to the mischief at hand—being end use empowerment—is extensive education and information campaigns for parents and schools in respect of the Internet and end use filter devices.
When the bill comes before the Senate for consideration later this week or in the next fortnight, the opposition will be presenting a range of significant amendments. These amendments will provide, firstly, that the 24 hour take-down period be extended to 48 hours and apply only after a process of real and effective notification of a breach; secondly, that the proposed penalty regime be reduced; thirdly, that all reasonable steps be expressly defined to include end user empowerment, information provision and advice on culturally appropriate end use filter devices, and that such reasonable steps be technically feasible, commercially viable and cost effective; that the Australian Broadcasting Authority take into account the public interest in not requiring steps which would reduce national Internet capacity; and that the ABA also take into account the public interest in ensuring that Australia remains an attractive Internet e-commerce investment jurisdiction by not requiring measures which would unreasonably degrade Internet capacity or utility.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Report of Information Technologies Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-05-11,"—Before discussing some of the important conclusions that are in the Democrats' minority report, I would like to briefly touch on the process leading up to the tabling of this report before the Senate and to put forward concerns that have been raised a number of times. Indeed, the last speaker pointed out some of the opposition's concerns about the haste with which this process has been pursued.
Senators would be aware that the minister announced the government's proposals to regulate the Internet in mid-March, and it is still unclear as to whether or not the government intends this legislation to be its entire response to the recommendations of previous Senate committees which have addressed these issues. That is one area out of two where I agree with Senator Harradine's minority report—of what I have just read. He mentions that `privacy considerations are of utmost importance to our committee', and I would concur with that. Secondly, I think there are many outstanding recommendations from previous Senate committees which have not been addressed. I may not necessarily agree with some of those recommendations, but we are still waiting to find out if the government intends this as its entire response.
Turning now to the process, in mid-April the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 was introduced into the Senate. Two days later, on 23 April, the government moved that the bill be referred to the recently re-established Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies. I reiterate the concern of the Democrats and many others about the timing and manner of the government's investigation into this bill—it was unnecessarily hurried. While I do not doubt the urgency or the importance of the issue of Internet content regulation, I am concerned that, because the process was so speedy, it was not able to comprehensively address many of the issues raised by the legislation.
The Democrats have said many times that we are concerned that the reference of that legislation to the Senate select committee has been used a mechanism for justifying the legislation. There has not been adequate time to develop or pursue some of the more intricate, technical and other issues that were raised in those committee hearings.
The Democrats have carefully examined the bill and have prepared a minority report which addresses, we think, some of the significant issues that the government has downplayed. We want to make it quite clear that we believe the regime envisaged by this 
 bill is both unworkable and undesirable. We have two broad areas of concern with this legislation as it has been presented to the Senate. The first of these relates to the significant technical and operational concerns with the proposal which could render the regime unworkable.
The second concern relates to undesirable aspects of the legislation. These include the failure to address civil liberties concerning privacy and the freedom of speech and expression, the creation of broad discretions and uncertain law enforcement provisions, the different treatment of material in different media, the almost certain adverse impact on the Internet industry in Australia, the likely impact on the growth of the information economy in Australia, and the failure to address concerns about the likelihood of inappropriate and inadvertent blocking of materials and related issues.
The bill envisages different systems for content hosted in Australia and content hosted overseas. The primary reason for this distinction is obviously jurisdictional, but the distinction is invisible to most Internet users. I will address the provisions dealing with Australian-hosted content shortly, but I wish to draw specific attention to the technical problems involved in blocking content hosted overseas. Firstly, I note that even some of the world's most restrictive governments have abandoned attempts to engage in wholesale blocking of Internet content. Most recently, the Malaysian government announced that they would cease Internet censorship. In that country one of the effects of Internet censorship was to prevent the distribution of materials concerning political opposition.
The committee heard evidence from Dr Philip McCrae about the technical issues involved in blocking Internet content. He presented a report on the technical feasibility of blocking technologies, originally commissioned by the National Office of Information Economy. That report raised many serious concerns about performance degradation and the possibility that blocking schemes can be easily circumvented. Neither of these concerns can be dismissed lightly, certainly not in light of the evidence presented to the committee.
The bill also contains a number of undesirable provisions. Some of the more significant issues fall under the general heading of civil liberties—in particular, I am referring to restrictions on the freedom to publish and to view materials which may be legal in other media. Witnesses referred to the general chilling effect on Australian content creators, who are obviously going to be fairly wary of creating content when it is not clear which materials may or may not be restricted. Concerns have been raised that this bill would be likely to have a significant impact on the creation of all types of content in Australia. The Democrats do not believe that the government has fulfilled the onus to justify further restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of expression in Australia.
Serious concerns also arise from the broad discretions and somewhat arbitrary enforcement provisions in the bill—in particular, the so-called anti-avoidance provisions, which refer to the prohibition of substantially similar content. They would appear to require Internet service providers to be involved in almost editorial decisions about the content being hosted on their servers. The two-year rule, which prevents reclassification of materials for two years, could be used in conjunction with the anti-avoidance provisions and generic descriptions of material to prevent or prohibit excessive amounts of content.
The government has not addressed either the direct costs or the likely economic impact of the proposed legislation, which we find absolutely extraordinary. We have heard repeatedly from the government that it is friendly towards electronic commerce, yet it has remained silent on the economic implications of the proposals before us. We think it is outrageous to suggest that these proposals would have no economic impact, and there was very little evidence before the committee of the possible costs of implementing such proposals. But many witnesses indicated that the direct costs and broader economic impact were likely to be detrimental to the rapid growth of both Internet use and the information economy.
While recommending the use of blocking technologies as a compulsory part of the 
 content control regime, the government has failed to address some significant concerns with the operation of filtering and blocking tools. As I have indicated to the Senate on previous occasions, the problems of inappropriate and inadvertent blocking of materials must be addressed, and submissions to the committee indicated significant concerns with the blocking of materials relating to the safe use of drugs, safe sex, gay and lesbian issues, feminism, anti-hate speech sites and many other types of material, including political material. I seek leave to incorporate the last four paragraphs of my comments so I do not take the time of the Senate.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Indeed, recent analysis of one of the blocking technologies presented to the committee has demonstrated the inadvertent blocking of very large numbers of web sites hosted on the same servers as some less appropriate materials, in one case blocking access to the National Party web site.
It is crucial that the operation of content control in a liberal democracy is open and accountable. We certainly need to ensure that the value systems and the decisions made in blocking content are explicit.
These concerns, and others, have been addressed in the Democrats' report.
The Democrats would prefer an approach to the regulation of Internet content based on the empowerment and education of users. We would also wish to encourage an understanding of the responsibility of adults supervising Internet use by young people.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Report of Information Technologies Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-11,"—I will be quite brief because the previous speakers have covered much of the terrain I would cover, except to say, however, that it is quite untoward that, once again, the Senate is fast-forward on moves to ban sexually explicit material available to Australians without proper consultation with the community and without proper time for deliberation in this place.
It does not miss my notice that the government today is announcing a clampdown on so-called sex chat lines advertised in Australia and apparently under frequent use. What a coincidence that that is happening on budget day! I think that many Australians would want to have input on that as well. What we 
 are seeing here is a breakout of censorship, a rapid grab of the rights of Australians to see, hear or tune into material that they think is appropriate for themselves. Any society has to be concerned about the impact of material on young people, and I am second to none on that.
What I find particularly repugnant, however, is the increasing violence; in particular, the Americanisation of our culture—the bringing of the culture of violence into Australia without restriction. That is a far greater priority than what people may do, see or say about sexual explicitness, which is not of the same order. Here we have this move to be prurient about sexually explicit material and an outbreak of it at a time when we are moving to consider the GST and the sale of Telstra. I have no doubt that Senator Harradine will have more to say about this in a moment, but I think we have to call a spade a spade here. The government has this on the agenda because it is wanting to influence Senator Harradine's vote and Senator Colston's vote on the GST, on the sale of Telstra and on the general list of government priorities which we have before us before 1 July.
Whatever else one might think about this debate, that is not the right way to meet the priorities of Australians as a whole. There are very critical matters to be dealt with by the Senate which are being put aside to get through this censorship agenda. Very critical matters are being put aside by a government agenda to trade the restriction on what adult Australians might see or hear for its other agendas. As I said before, it is up to the government to be at least transparent about this. I again call for the government to release the minutes of the meetings which have been held between the Independents, the various ministers and, indeed, the Prime Minister in the preceding months so that we may see what the agenda has been. I doubt it is an agenda which has been overtly one of trading, although that is the result we are seeing in here.
I find it quite remarkable that there is such a licence for advertising sexual services and so on throughout the media in Australia— 
some of it illegal—to the gain of the big media empires in this country. There seems to be no crackdown under the law on those things, yet we have this move to censor what Australians might see or hear on the Internet or through other modalities.
—You want to clean up the Net, don't you?
—The problem is that there has not been proper consideration given to this. Through you, Madam Deputy President, to Senator Ferris: I do want to see Australia have good regulation of illegal activities. That is why my priority is, for example, to get up an inquiry into the impact of gambling on the Internet, which is going to be far more injurious to many Australian families than whatever non-violent material—sexually explicit as it may be—is available on the Internet. The priorities, however, are not around that way. We are dealing here basically with sexually explicit material. It should be getting far greater analysis and input from the Australian people than it is getting in the truncated, politically expedient program that we are dealing with here today.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Report of Information Technologies Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-05-11,"—First of all, I will deal very briefly with the last contribution. I feel rather sorry for Senator Brown. He has missed the point completely. He is either following or leading some of the narrow-minded, unintelligent members of the media by constantly suggesting that certain interests are to get my vote on this, that or the other. I challenge him and any of those small-minded members of the media to point to one case where I have not dealt with a matter completely on its merits. I am getting sick and tired of that sort of approach. I ignore it now, but I do not ignore it when it comes from a colleague who should have more responsibility than some of the unintelligent—I was going to say `ratbag'—reporters around the place. Mind you, most of the media are not into that, but some of them are.
If the government is trying to get my vote on this particular matter, it is really going about it the wrong way. I have for many years been interested in this particular subject, and I believe that other senators and other 
 members of parliament have also because it has been of concern to the people of Australia, particularly to parents. If enacted, this legislation will be an improvement on the current largely unregulated environment. Thus, I believe it does deserve the support of the parliament.
I do not stand here representing the commercial exploiters of the online industry—those who are trying to make a fast buck by the transmission of hardcore pornography and violence. That is what we are talking about here: those who are trying to exploit the online environment for their own purposes—that is, to make big bucks. I, and I believe others on the committee who are supporting this legislation, stand here for the ordinary people of Australia and, indeed, for the genuine online businesses.
The commercial online industry has for at least six years been aware of growing concerns within the community and in the parliament that an unregulated environment could be exploited by those transmitting extremely violent or pornographic material into Australian homes. It has done very little to address those concerns. However, the  Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  falls considerably short of recommendations made by the Senate committee and its predecessor. For example, the first recommendation of the committee in its November 1995 report was that it should be an offence to use a computer service to transmit, obtain possession of, demonstrate, advertise or request the transmission of material equivalent to RC, R and X categories. In essence, this was repeated in the committee's recommendation in June 1997.
The bill does not follow the recommendations with respect to either the content to be regulated or the method of regulation. The bill is designed to generally operate on the basis of industry codes or, in the absence thereof, standards, and on a complaints procedure to be supervised by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The question arises as to whether such a proven passive regulator as the ABA is the most appropriate institution to do this. Only time will tell.
An area which will need to come under close scrutiny is the ready accessibility of 
 graphically violent interactive online computer games. Available figures indicate their growing popularity amongst teenagers, children and young adults, and I believe that is a matter which is of considerable concern around the community. It cannot reasonably be denied that Internet service providers and Internet content hosts and creators have an obligation to the end users of their services. In my view, these obligations should include, amongst other priorities, the right of users to be properly informed as to content labelling and to the identification and removal of unsolicited mail. They are also entitled to expect technical standards of excellence and properly accredited filtering technologies, including within the carriage infrastructure. It may well be that Internet service providers should be licensed and that licence conditions should apply. That is not in this legislation, but surely, unless there is proper cooperation from the industry with this legislation, the only answer is to impose licence fees and sufficient fees which will enable the matter to be carried forward.
Issues of privacy are of very special interest to our committee, and last year the committee conducted a number of hearings on the issue of privacy. It was assisted by the views expressed and information provided by the industry and by users. The draft report from Senator Jeannie Ferris, our distinguished chairperson, is now being considered.
Finally, parents should not be lulled into a sense of false security by the passage of this bill. Clearly, parents and others responsible for children will need to exercise vigilance and be empowered to do so through a massive education campaign and free technological support. This, in conjunction with an effective regulatory environment when it comes, will ultimately ensure an environment in which computer use will grow and exploitation diminish.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Report of Information Technologies Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—I hope that Senator Cook is due in here shortly. I have a question to the 
 minister. Minister, we were concerned with the issues of gambling and casinos. There has been a great deal of press and media coverage, as you know, of this issue. It will be helpful for us all if you re-explained some of the fundamental principles that you have been spelling out with the gambling and lottery amendments.
The starting point for all of us is the document you have referred to several times: Tax reform: not a new tax, a new tax system, the ANTS document, on page 98. I will go through it all the way, so that you can understand our problem with it. In that document, you state:
Gambling and lottery activities will be included in the tax base.
That is very proper.
The GST will apply to the operator's margin of these activities, not to the prizes paid out.
The operator's margin, as I understand it, is the gross value or the gross margin of all transactions for the reporting period—in other words, not an individual transaction, as it would be at a supermarket checkout. In the case of the gambling casinos area, it is all the transactions for the reporting period. You then go on to say:
That is, the tax will apply to the difference between total `ticket sales' or bets taken by the operator of the gambling or lottery activity and the value of the prizes or winnings paid out.
That in retailing is often referred to as a net margin. It is gross take versus payouts, and you have net margin before costs. You then state:
However, operators cannot always adjust their prices because these are often set by the rules of the game or by State government legislation relating to levels of pay-out. As the States already tax gambling highly there may need to be corresponding reductions in State gambling taxes.
That is the next point. I think you have made it clear in your public announcements that it is the states which will individually and at their discretion take decisions in these matters. In other words, there is not a Commonwealth agreement with them on this issue, as there is in other areas. If I have misunderstood you, I would like you to come back on that one. You go on:
This will be possible because, under the proposed arrangements, the States will receive the proceeds of the GST, including the GST on gambling.
It is when we move to the issue at hand, which is the issue of high rollers and how their transactions will be dealt with, that we get into some difficulty. Returning to the first proposition—that is, that all transactions will be counted to arrive at the net margin—that means that, if you take 100 gamblers on the bottom floor of the casino and they are playing Keno, roulette, blackjack or whatever other gambling games there are, on each of those games there is a different margin. Minister, are you happy for me to continue?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—Could I made a brief comment in order to assist the debate? Thank you for your courtesy, Senator Murray. I have noted the questions that you have put down. The amendment before the chair is on no tax invoices for gambling supplies. Last week there was a great deal of public interest in this, but I think that what you are referring to actually refers to another amendment which has been moved in relation to gambling and which will come on later.
It seems to me that, in order to speed the journey—and I am not seeking to avoid the debate; in fact we have all had a lot of debate on this issue, and you have raised some points which I am happy to respond to—probably it is time to return to the amendment which is truly before the chair and discuss that particular amendment. When we get on to this issue on the margin and your concerns about high rollers, that is actually applicable to a different amendment. The amendment we are dealing with relates to tax invoices.
I would suggest to the chamber that it would probably help order the debate if we dealt with these matters in an appropriate sequence. Last week, because there was a degree of enthusiasm about it, I recognised that interest and the debate was allowed to continue. But now I would ask the Senate chamber, because we have a great journey to run with these amendments, and it seems more appropriate, Acting Deputy Chairman Watson, if we could essentially try to confine ourselves to the amendment before the chair. 
 The matters which you wish to explore can easily be raised under the appropriate amendment—which, as I said, comes later on down the running sheet.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—What I am seeking to do here, Minister, is to affect the climate in which all the gambling amendments will be reviewed. I am really continuing from the previous debate. The reason I do that is that if we can clearly understand the government's thinking with respect to the way in which these transactions are dealt with, I think it therefore enables what you would probably describe as relatively technically amendments in 6 and 7 to be dealt with within an understanding of the overall framework. So with the discretion of the chair—and I have just one question to complete my introduction—I would look for the indulgence of the Senate and the committee in terms of what has already preceded us to settle down some of these issues. That is my motive. If the chair is content with that, I will continue on that basis.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—No-one questions your motive or goodwill in seeking to do this. All I am saying is that we had a lot of debate on the last occasion we were all happily here. We also had a very extensive debate on this at Senate estimates in which a great deal of information was further tendered. As I said, I think these are separate issues.
We are dealing now with tax invoices. It is my preference that we deal with amendments in order. What I do not want to do is have a debate now on the so-called high-roller issue, which takes up another swag of time, then get to the amendment this actually applies to and then run the whole debate again. We have been in this chamber now for about 35 hours and we are rushing towards a record debate on a bill. It is pretty clear that we will exceed all other bills. I think we have to get a procedure in place. The public expects us to deal with this in a sensible fashion.
I am not resisting the questions, but my experience and your experience in this will always be that answers lead to further questions and suddenly we have absorbed another swag of time which does not relate specifical 
 ly to the somewhat technical amendment which is now before the chair. It was a courtesy that was extended last week. We all recognised that this was an issue that there was some public interest in, so the debate was allowed to run fairly free and wide. Having recognised that and then having gone into an estimates process where there was another very extensive debate, we should deal with this at the time when it is appropriate to deal with it under the appropriate amendment which has caused concern to you and some others. I put that forward simply as a matter of proper ordering of business, not to resist any comments or answers to questions which you are seeking.
—Senator Murray, the chair could help. The amendment referred to is on page 11 of the running sheet.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—I understand that, Mr Chairman, and I will of course be guided by the chair, but my last question really is absolutely germane to the way in which these amendments and subsequent amendments are to be judged. It seems to me that the government is proposing dealing with customers of casinos differently according to the class of the customer. What I mean by that, in a straightforward approach to tax, is that the government—if I understand them correctly, which is why I asked the question—have grouped all the customers together as one class of transactions to arrive at the net margin. But when dealing with the high roller it seems to me that they are proposing dealing with each individual transaction.
If I can draw the distinction with the supermarket, it would be equivalent to dealing with each person coming through the supermarket below $100 individually and then everybody above $100 you might be dealing with together. If I misunderstand the government, then I need to know so, because what I am seeking is that the same method by which customers of casinos are to be dealt with in tax terms applies regardless of the amount of money being bet. I think I fully understand the grouping provision of the ANTS proposal whereby you take, as I gave the example, 100 
 betting patrons together and you arrive at their net margin, regardless of the fact that that margin may differ because one is playing blackjack, one is playing keno and one is playing roulette. It is the overall take less the payout which means the net margin, but my understanding of the high-roller approach is that each individual transaction is to be dealt with so that this high-roller patron playing blackjack will be dealt with on his own and that high-roller patron playing some other game of chance will in turn be dealt with on their own. That is the straightforward taxation principle I want to be reassured on with respect to these and every other subsequent gambling amendment. That is why I bring it up now: because it is relevant, I think, to the way in which these amendments are to be judged.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—Let me make it clear that the government is not distinguishing between classes of gamblers. The rebates will be taken off the gross gambling margin and the casino will calculate only one gambling margin for its operations for a particular period. So I think your concern was that somehow this was going to treat high rollers in a different fashion. As I said, we need to work out what is the actual proper margin, and the proper margin is one which is less rebates which are paid. We can get into this in detail in the debate on the amendment which will be moved later. I hope that provides you with a degree of comfort in relation to the amendment which is before us.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-11,"—This is the first brace of gambling amendments to the package of GST bills. Minister, given the way in which the debate in the chamber has just gone—that is, procedurally—there seems to be an acceptance that we will deal with the high-roller amendments that the government proposes to the GST legislation when we arrive at them in the pack and not under this heading.
—That is not the way I would describe them, but I understand what you are saying.
—That is what I understood you to say, and it seems that that is a point of view that is accepted by at least Senator Murray. Before we move to the substantive nature of the amendments before the chair now, perhaps I should say something about the high-roller amendments which will put you in a position to answer questions when we do arrive at the other high-roller amendments.
I want to draw the minister's attention to a report in the West Australian newspaper of last Friday—I cannot distinguish the page but I think it is page 12. It has the headline `Court firm on casino GST stance'—that is, the Premier, Richard Court. I will quote selectively from the report. You will no doubt turn up the whole thing so I am not trying to mislead you with my selective quotes. Starting with the first paragraph, it states:
Burswood Casino will not be granted any State compensation if the Howard Government fails to get goods and services tax concessions for high-roller gamblers passed through the Senate, according to Premier Richard Court.
That is the opening paragraph. The report goes on to discuss the whole issue of what the state government will do and further states:
Mr Court told the Legislative Assembly he did not believe the GST would affect revenue received by the State Government from Burswood.
The article quotes Mr Court as saying:
""Now I appreciate that there are some difficulties in the way the legislation is going through the Parliament.""
He goes on:
""But in the balancing that takes place to make sure that the States have their revenues protected, we do not foresee any problems.""
When we come to the high-roller amendments, in chief—if I can describe them as that—the minister's explanation, up to this point, has been that if the Senate defeats the high-roller amendments it will be up to the state governments to make the adjustments. At least one state government, if the Premier is to be believed, is saying that they will not make the adjustment. I repeat what the state government said:
But in the balancing that takes place to make sure that the states have their revenues protected, we do not foresee any problems. 

That would suggest that they will not make an adjustment—that there will be no diminution to state revenues. The point of view—I will not describe it as a principle; I think that is a terrible notion—that the federal government has accepted from the Casino Association, when it lobbied the government to include these amendments, is not shared at state level by the West Australian state government.
I understood you to say, and I would have to check the Hansard record, that this was a matter of a federal-state agreement and that you assumed or you presumed that if it was not done at federal level it would be done at state level. I take this opportunity to draw your attention to it, Minister, because when we come to the high-roller amendments I will have a series of questions for you on that matter, and I do not want you to be caught unawares. They will be serious questions and we will be intent on pursuing serious answers to them when we get to that point.
I will proceed now to the amendments that are before the chair at the moment. One of those is government amendment No. 7—the seventh of 128 amendments to your own legislation, Minister, on the GST. Amendment No. 7 says:
. . . after clause 126-32, insert:
126-33 Tax invoices are not required for gambling supplies
(1) You are not required to issue a *tax invoice for a *taxable supply that you make that is solely a *gambling supply.
(2) This section has effect despite section 29-70 (which is about the requirement to issue tax invoices).
The government is proposing, should we assent, to insert those provisions into the bill at this stage. I understand how the government intends to apply a GST to gambling—that is, a GST is applied to the margin. The losses of the patrons of a casino are regarded as sales by the casino for that purpose, and you deduct the losses by the casino against the losses by the patrons to get the net advantage to the casino and then tax that.
Here we have a provision referring to tax invoices. If I am a $10 pokie player and I lose $10 on the pokies, an invoice will not be 
 issued to me. Under this law, it would be technically a sale worth $10 by the casino. I have lost it but, technically, it would be a sale by the casino of $10. How will you keep track of what the casinos are rebating high rollers under this provision for an invoice? Because the way it operates—I think this is a settled matter between us; it is not a disputed matter—is that a high roller, defined as someone who gambles $500,000 to $5 million a throw, gambles at whatever game of chance they choose. Where they win, they take their winnings and run. Where they lose, in order to keep their custom—presumably, so that they can win more—the casino rebates them part of their losses. Say they are flipping half a million dollars on a game of chance and they lose, that for tax purposes is regarded as a half-million-dollar sale for the casino and is taxed.
But where the casino then rebates them $300,000 to soften the blow and encourage them to keep coming back, that means the sale by the casino, the actual loss borne by the high roller, is $200,000, not $500,000 as was wagered. If you are not issuing each of those high rollers with an invoice, as in that case—it is a similar question now to Senator Murray's—how would you keep track of what the amount of rebate is that casinos are giving to high rollers and whether the government is in a position to make a social judgment about whether the level of the rebate is fair, given that it applies only to people in this category and not to anyone else?
—Or whether it is true.
—I take that interjection from Senator Murray, because it is to the point: whether the level of rebate is reported accurately and truthfully. How will the government be in a position to know, if it is just going to take the casino's word for it? What degree of transparency will be able to be exercised in this? To extend that question one step further, how will we in this parliament, and through us the people of Australia, know what amount of money could have been collected in tax because of the GST but was forgone by the government in recognising the practice of casinos to rebate high rollers in the manner in which they apparently do?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—First of all, let me say that you have flagged a number of questions that you want to pursue with us when we get onto the so-called high-roller amendments.
—What would you call them?
—They are not high-roller amendments; they are not designed to give any concession to high rollers. But rather than arguing on the political point you have raised, I just make it clear for the record that this is not a concession for high rollers. I take on board that you will be pursuing that. I have not read what Premier Court actually said, and I think I would want to read exactly what he has said.
—That is what I suggested.
—I think you recognise that as very reasonable. The point I would make, however, is that the states have signed on to an intergovernmental agreement by which, among other things, they are required to take into account, when setting their taxes, the amount of money which is raised by the GST. There is an intergovernmental agreement, to which Mr Court was a signatory, based on the assumption that there would be no revenue collected on gambling higher than the current arrangements so that, as the GST is imposed, there will be an adjustment in state taxes. I think that is now broadly accepted in this chamber. I will look at exactly what he said. You asked me for some background, and there is an intergovernmental agreement which Premier Court has signed.
The next issue you raised was the issue that Senator Murray was concerned about: separate invoices. The point I make there is that the casino will calculate only one gambling margin for its operations in a particular period of time. I think you understood me to say that, and you were quite correct if that was your understanding. The purpose of an invoice is to allow the recipient of a service to get an input tax credit. That is the purpose of an invoice. There are no input tax credits for gambling, so you would be issuing a bit of paper which really has no particular purpose, because you cannot get an input tax credit for it. Because of the way this was drafted, we 
 need to bring that clarity in. I do not think you are seeking an input tax credit for gambling, and it follows from that that you would also support our position that you do not issue an invoice, because the fact of the matter is that there is not an input tax credit and the purpose of issuing an invoice is for someone to get one.
You asked me how we can verify this issue. The casino, of course, will need to have records of their net margin. Similar arrangements are required under income tax law. Their records must be proper records, and the tax office has various powers to check that appropriate records have been kept. In a sense, it is similar to the current state arrangements. There is a comparative element there to the current state arrangements on the sorts of records which must be kept. They are subject, above all, to the normal audit requirements. I do not think there is anything that we are proposing here that is without precedent, but it recognises how the Income Tax Act works, it recognises that people have got to keep proper records and it recognises that they can be subject to audit. This is not anything which is strikingly new, but it clearly builds on the current system. As I said, because all the taxes on gambling at present are state taxes, essentially there are procedures in place to make sure that proper records are kept.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-11,"—So, as I understand that answer, to the extent that we will be able to see transparently through the paperwork to identify the level of high-roller rebate that is being paid by a casino, we will be able to see only the global amount; we will not be able to see particular casinos or particular players. We will not, for example, know whether a high roller who is a resident of Australia will get a lower rebate—because they are more likely to patronise that casino—than a high roller who is, say, a wealthy Asian business person who might be playing the casinos of Paris or London and whom the casinos want to attract to play in their high-roller room. We will not know whether that particular class of 
 high roller gets a bigger rebate; we will not be able to differentiate about this.
My point is that, because there will be no invoice per high roller, we will not know whether the rebates are standard to all comers in the high-roller room, differentiated to particular customers or different between casinos. It seems to me you could not identify that without an invoice, so to what level of transparency will we be able to go? On your other remarks: of course this is a debate that we will be having later, but it seems to me that, if Premier Court does not proceed in the way in which he has now indicated, the proceeds from the GST that you are providing to the state will be less or you will be cutting special purpose grants. But that is a matter for later on.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—Also with regard to item 7: Minister, would you indicate whether your amendment means that a casino must not or may not provide an invoice? In other words, if someone wanted an invoice, could they get one?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—I will answer your question first, Senator Murray; the last comes first in this. The reason we do not want to issue an invoice is that there is no input tax credit for it. We are not proposing to provide individuals with an input tax credit on this issue so we would not issue them with a GST invoice. In other words, this would be inconsistent with all the other invoices where people can claim an input tax credit. This would not be a matter where we would want to issue one simply because there is no input tax credit available.
I imagine that a casino could issue a receipt or anything else that it wanted to. If an individual wanted some records, I suppose that it is a matter for the casino to provide some records to the individual if he wanted them for his own purposes. But it would not be an invoice of the type which is defined in the legislation and would not have the same standing as an invoice which is defined in the legislation, because there is not an input tax credit for that person. So, if you are worried about whether the person has records, presum 
 ably he can negotiate with the casino as to what sort of receipt or anything else is appropriate.
In relation to your comments, Senator Cook, I have to say I am probably like you: I do not go to casinos, I do not gamble and I have no particular knowledge in detail of how casinos operate—but we can always seek information for you if it is germane to the argument that we are running here. The level of rebates at present is a matter for the casinos. You indicate that they may offer different rebates. I can always check that, but you have made that point. If you are correct, that is exactly what happens at present, and of course at present there is no wholesale sales tax on gambling or whatever. So the truth of the matter is that it is simply a matter for the commercial decision, I would have thought, of the casinos as to how they operate. They have to run their own business and they work out what rebates may be offered.
You suggested they may offer lower rebates to Australians and higher rebates to people from overseas. My point there is that this is essentially a matter for the casinos. It is a commercial decision, one which they make at present, presumably. To the extent that your argument applies in the future, it presumably applies right now. What we are going to be doing, as distinct from the current arrangements, will be to impose a GST on the gambling margin. I would have thought that would have given you some comfort.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—Minister, yes, of course we understand that there are no input credits available from gambling. That is the proper policy. My concern was really whether there was a prohibition on an invoice or a receipt being provided for a taxable supply that was solely a gambling supply.
My reason is as follows. It is relatively common practice for businesses to entertain visitors, customers or suppliers in casinos. You can picture the scenario of the sales manager of, say, an auto parts company being told by his boss to take three visiting suppliers to the casino. There would be a receipt available from the restaurant and there would be a receipt available from the bar but his 
 boss would expect him to come back with a receipt saying that he spent $1,000 on chips. That is all; I was looking to make sure there is no prohibition on the casino providing that receipt, even though it is solely for gambling purposes.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—If the casino wishes to provide a receipt, that is a matter for negotiation between the individual and the casino. If the casino felt that, in its relations with gamblers, it would provide a receipt, we would not stand in the way of that. What we are not issuing is an invoice of the nature defined in the legislation on which people may assume an input tax credit is available. I think that will answer your question. It is a matter for the casino and the gambler.
In relation to other matters that have been raised, my judgment—it is always a matter for judgment—on the concerns that Senator Cook has raised is that gambling is one of the most regulated areas of the economy.
—So it should be.
—Senator Woodley, I am making a point: there was concern as to whether there were enough controls in relation to gambling and I am seeking to give some comfort on that issue that was raised by Senator Cook. There may be other areas that are more regulated, but this would arguably be one of the most regulated sections of the economy. Subsection 126-10 of the bill makes it clear that a global GST amount is calculated for one tax period and rebates will be one element used to calculate the single global GST amount. I hope that provides some additional comfort.
Senator Murray was worried whether the gambler could get some record. My answer to that is that it is a matter between the gambler and the casino, but he will not get, as a result of this amendment, an invoice of the type defined in this bill and on which an input tax credit would be available.
In relation to Senator Cook's concerns, much of what Senator Cook raises—if it is accurate, and I have no reason to argue that; I have no special knowledge on this—occurs right now without a GST on the gambling 
 margin. Where there are varying rebates offered, as Senator Cook has asserted—again I have no specific knowledge—then that presumably occurs now.
Then there is the issue of how you deal with proper records and I pointed out again that it is regulated. Proper records are required to be kept by the Australian Taxation Office, which has audit arrangements. I gave further comfort by suggesting that this was already a very highly regulated section of the economy, particularly where states are concerned and the taxes are imposed by state governments.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—Minister, you are getting there, but you have not quite satisfied me and it is for this reason: at no time and in no sense should an Australian ever have to negotiate with a supplier a receipt or an invoice. I mean it for this purpose: every customer is entitled to have a receipt for payment. We must not even imply in this debate that it is an option for a casino not to supply a receipt if asked for it. If, in the example I gave you, the sales manager was given $1,000 by his boss to buy gambling chips, his boss would want to know that those $1,000 were spent on gambling chips. In customer law it is the right of every customer, whether going into a garage, a supermarket or a chemist, to make whatever kind of transaction and to demand and get an invoice for their own record keeping purposes. I am not suggesting for the purposes of generating a tax exemption. It is not a negotiation, it is a right that attaches to the customer.	 I presume you do not gainsay that right and your use of the word `negotiation' was a loose explanation. Certainly, any customer can ask for a receipt in paying over any amount for gambling supplies.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—We are not changing the current law. I am advised that, where there is gambling and the gambler seeks a receipt or whatever, there is no change to the current practice. What it does is prevent an invoice of the nature defined in the legislation being issued, which people may presume provides an input tax credit. We are not stopping whatever people are doing at present. 
 As I said, I have no particular knowledge of that, but this does not alter that arrangement. It makes it very clear that there will not be a GST tax invoice issued for what is technically called gambling supplies. I do not think anyone here would claim to be an expert in gambling.
—Senator Woodley is.
—Just the results.
—Senator Woodley, it is clear that you are not? Is that right? I think that is clear.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-11,"—I want to make progress, but I have one more question on this matter. Firstly, for the record and because you asked, I am not an habitue of casinos and I am therefore not an expert in gambling games. Every time I play poker for matchsticks I usually lose more than I win. Secondly, you said I asserted certain things about high-roller rebates. I think the accurate way of expressing what I did is to say that I `hypothesised' about them by way of asking you a question as to whether this is the case. Seemingly, you are not in a position to answer that question now, but when we come back to this debate maybe you will be because it is a germane issue.
Dealing with the subject under examination in the chamber from a counterfactual point of view, if I am by profession a high roller, a professional gambler, it seems to me that the profit I make on my gambling activities will be GSTable. In the definition of this bill, it seems that the profits I make on my gambling activities will be a taxable supply. The losses I make will be an input to my business and will be a deduction. If I am right on that, how will the tax commissioner know, without there being an invoice, that when I report my earnings I am reporting them accurately?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—Receipts are issued now. My advice from the tax office—the tax advisers—is that that is fine as far as the commissioner is concerned. It is one of those 
 records which the commissioner may well use. As I said, I do not think we are changing the situation as it largely applies now, except to the extent that we are now bringing gambling within the GST net. It is not within the wholesale sales tax net. It seems to me that people who may be a little concerned about this would have greater comfort under the proposal before the chamber than in the current environment; in other words, there is a further broadening of the tax base and, presumably, that adds to the tax office's knowledge about what is occurring in this area. This measure provides a further degree of comfort to people who may be worried about some of the questions which have been raised.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-11,"—For the sake of clarifying the record: the minister has made the observation at least twice now that what he is doing is introducing a GST to an area where there is not a wholesale sales tax—in this case gambling—as if this were some new reform. What the minister is doing is providing the revenue that he obtains from the GST on gambling, and from everything else, to the states and the states are compensating back to the casinos for that revenue. That is my understanding of what you are proposing to do. So you are not, in fact, taxing it at all.
—It is revenue neutral, in effect.
—Yes.
—Is that true, Senator Kemp?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—The intergovernmental agreement indicates that there will be no net rise in revenue—I think that is the correct way to express it—as a result of the imposition of a GST. As Senator Cook said, an adjustment is made in order to achieve the aim which is set out in the intergovernmental agreement. I make the point that this is being brought into a broader tax net. I would have thought that would have provided a further degree of comfort. As I understand it, at present it is state taxes that are imposed on gambling. I do not argue the point with 
 Senator Cook. We might finesse the wording in a different way but, as I understand the point that he is making, the intergovernmental agreement makes the position pretty clear. If an adjustment was required under the intergovernmental agreement, they would have to take account of the total tax which is being raised.

Before speaking to the amendments, I alert the chamber to the fact that, as a result of the negotiations with the states and territories and commitments undertaken under the IGA, the government is foreshadowing amendments to A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Bill 1999  and A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements—Consequential Provisions) Bill 1999 . Late on our last sitting day the Senate select committee provided its final report on the legislation, including A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 1999 . The bills were subsequently joined with the other ANTS bills which are now before the chamber. As the relevant bills are now before the chamber, I have asked the clerks to circulate the amendments that we propose which give effect to that agreement. I offer senators who wish to have a detailed briefing 
 on these amendments before they come up for debate an opportunity to do so.

Amendments 8 to 11 deal with periodic supplies and acquisitions where a supply covers a period proposed by division 156 and operates to apply to the GST over the period. For example, under an arrangement to supply a right to use something for five years, progressive payments are made during the period. The division operates so that the GST is paid as the payments occur, not in one lump sum with the first payment. These amendments will improve the operation of the division, making it clear that supplies such as leases are subject to GST as the lease payments are received by the lessor.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-11,"—Before going to the amendment, you took the opportunity, Minister, to advise the chamber that you will be releasing further amendments to the luxury car set of bills which comes within this broad ANTS package and that you are doing so as a consequence of the Senate select committee report. I am getting a vibe from you that I am not understanding this correctly. So that I understand: what is it you are exactly doing and what is it you are inviting us to be briefed on?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—We are inviting you to be briefed on the series of amendments which largely deal with giving effect to the Commonwealth-state financial arrangements bills. I mentioned the luxury car tax bill simply because that was one of the bills which was before the Senate committee. These amendments do not deal with the luxury car tax bill. They deal with the Commonwealth-state financial arrangements. I will be very surprised if people find too many hooks in this. I think a lot of premiers would be very keen for these to go through. I do not want to get into a debate about what premiers have actually said. All I am saying is that they have all signed an agreement and I think that they would want us to proceed with these amendments. I will facilitate any briefing that is required by the non-govern 
 ment parties to assist their understanding of the bill.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-11,"—Then I understand that it just refers to the inter-government agreement, not to the luxury car tax, not to the WET tax, which were the other parts of that inquiry. I notice you are nodding in confirmation. I have not looked at those amendments but I will and then I will decide whether I want a briefing. At the beginning of this committee stage, Minister, I did ask you the global question: does the government have any further amendments to bring forward? You have brought forward 128 amendments to your own legislation. We now have an additional number—I am not sure how many.
In your answer at question time—a rather enigmatic answer—in which you said that you would listen to the debate in the chamber and glanced in Senator Harradine's direction, I took you to mean that you might be persuaded to make further changes. I now ask you again: on top of the 128 amendments which the government has made and the ones it has now announced, does the government have in its mind to make further additional amendments which we should be aware of in order to speed this debate through?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—Senator, we believe the compensation package is fair. We have had a long debate in this chamber on that issue and the government is not proposing to change the compensation package. We listen to debates, and I underline the government's very clear position that this is a fair compensation package. We had a lot of debate in the second reading stage about that. I understand that not everyone in this chamber is in blazing agreement with me that this is a fair compensation package.
These amendments are to a bill which was not before the chamber when we had our initial debate, Senator. These bills were actually before a Senate committee. The government naturally waited until the Senate committee had reported and now the Senate committee has reported we are giving effect to the IGA and the overall amendments. 
 Senator, I have not ruled out other amendments, as you would be aware. In that context, we will listen to what people say but the government's position on the compensation package I think is pretty clear.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-11,"—I will leave that debate for another time. I am sure we will have it. The amendments now before us, amendments 8 to 11, seek to remove the words `on a progressive or periodic basis' from the relevant clauses and to insert in their place the words `for a period or on a progressive basis'. There are four changes. Minister, can you tell me: is there any difference of intent here or do you prefer the second set of words for some particular reason over the words that you initially put forward? Are we changing anything meaningful? Have you changed your intent, or is there another explanation for these changes in words?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—There is no change in intent. What we are trying to do is give effect to the issue which is before us—the periodic payments. My advice is that we had discussions with tax practitioners and they wanted additional clarity. So there is no change in intent and when you look at the amendments, they make sense. I know Senator Cook is opposed to a GST, but in the context of bringing in broad based tax reform, I think people will look closely at what the original intent was. This gives effect to that but deals with some of the discussions that we have had with tax practitioners in the field.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—It strikes me that this is almost a plain English change. Frankly, I am at a loss to see that it advances understanding from a tax practitioner's point of view. It strikes me as almost unnecessary. But I assume it is not, so I do not have any objection. I clearly understand your example of how a lease is to be dealt with, but it has been brought to my attention, and probably to the government's, that some business people would like to be able to move between tax reporting periods within a 12-month cycle. This is the kind of flexibility that people such 
 as farmers want—when they are expending large lump sums they would rather be in a very short reporting period so they can get the input credit immediately and when they move to a normal operation they would like to change their reporting period, and so on.
So my question relates to flexibility. Does the opportunity exist within the clauses dealing with progressive or periodic supplies and acquisitions for people such as farmers to move about within a 12-month period using different reporting periods and different reporting methods to suit their particular business needs? Or do you elect to operate within only one kind of reporting cycle every 12 months? That is my understanding of the legislation at present. I wonder whether this change you have put up signals a different approach or policy.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—No, Senator. The issue you have raised is a completely different issue. The length of the tax periods that an individual or business may report on, and whether it be monthly, quarterly or whatever, is a different issue. We are dealing with periodic payments—and payments made over a period of time are taxed in an appropriate way. But the issue of an individual's tax periods—and we can have that debate a bit later—does not relate to the issue which is now before the chamber.
This is not a controversial amendment; it is a technical amendment. It is fully in line with the intent of the legislation. The government is responding to the desire of tax practitioners for what they see as an extra degree of clarity, and we are happy to provide it. The issue that you have raised on the overall tax period—whether it be monthly, quarterly or whatever—is a different issue from the one we are now considering.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—I may not have expressed myself as well as I might have. Take the following example: a farmer buys very expensive equipment that is paid for in, say, three or five periodic payments on the anniversary of the acquisition—you are quite right: it does tie into the reporting period—and he would like to take advantage of the ability to get the 
 input credit in a short time frame. We see a mixing of the two problems of periodic payments and the reporting period when a transaction is spaced over a period of years. The example you gave was of a one-time payment, say, by a farmer for a combined harvester, but it often does not happen like that. We all understand that a lease is a periodic payment of whatever kind, but this is the acquisition of capital and other goods.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—Until the full GST is paid, you cannot get an input tax credit. I would have thought the purchaser of the harvester would be most unlikely to want to pay the full GST up-front before he had paid all the instalments or whatever.
—He would have to pay one-fifth.
—The periodic payments are allowed under this. The GST is related to the payments that you make. I can understand what you are saying: could you pay all your GST up-front on a small periodic payment? That is not practical, and that is not the intent of the legislation.

I do not intend to move that now. It is an amendment that I believe could be moved at any stage, and I would like to come back to that because we are still trying to make sure that it suits everybody's needs. But I would like to ask some questions of the government to clarify the situation as it exists, and as it will exist as a result of their amendment. First of all, who will be making the decisions as to whether a particular grant is to be characterised as a general grant, and therefore not subject to GST, or a specific grant, which amounts to the payment for goods and services?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—Essentially, there would be a self-assessment and, of course, the ATO would have the right to audit. Where people are unsure as to whether it is a general grant—which is the usual expression—or a specific grant for a particular service, as I said, there is a self-assessment arrangement, but there would be guidelines issued, clearly. If an individual or a company is unsure, they can seek a ruling to make sure that they have done the correct thing in their self-assessment arrangements.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-11,—I thank the minister. Who or what position in the Australian Taxation Office will make that decision?

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—The tax office would put out a ruling so that there would be guidelines which would be available to all. Of course, if people were still unsure, they could

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-11,"—I just want to clarify that. A ruling usually comes as a result of some sort of court challenge, doesn't it? I suppose, that is not necessarily so. You said that it will happen. So is the answer to the question of whether the government has developed and provided guidelines to organisations, `Not yet'? If that is the answer, when would they be likely to see these?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—The first thing is that, no, a ruling is not necessarily issued as a result of a court challenge. In fact, rulings are issued when there is a need for clarity in the case of the law. So rulings cannot be issued until the law is in fact passed, and the sooner we pass this the sooner the tax office will be in a position to issue the required ruling. The typical issue with a ruling is that normally a draft ruling is issued, and sometimes there is a discussion on that and then there is a final rule, but that does not apply in all cases.

These grants are made, I believe, when an enterprise submits a proposal as to the objectives it wants to achieve and there are certain reporting requirements.

But if you want an answer to a specific question relating to a particular grant, I will take that on notice. Obviously, one would have to examine all the circumstances which surround these things.

 situation is not really different. That is the advice I have received.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-11,—What is the situation when a government grant is given to an overarching body to distribute to other individuals or organisations?

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—I think you would have to look at the specifics. It is a bit hard to give tax rulings on specific issues which are run in that sense. As I said, there will be a ruling issued after the legislation is passed, so that will provide the essential guidelines for people in receipt of grants. Where they are unhappy with that, they can go back and seek a particular ruling which they feel relates to their particular circumstances. It is a bit difficult to give a tax opinion on the run in this sense, but the net out effects mean that there is no real difference between the two categories which you have postulated where one may have a GST applied and one may not.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-11,—I hardly think the minister's response about `net out effects'—which is obviously taxspeak—is going to make those organisations feel comforted if they do not know whether or not there is going to be a requirement to pay.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—Senator, if you have concerns we are always happy to provide an additional briefing. This sometimes saves time in the chamber—sometimes it effectively increases time in the chamber. From my experience and from the report-backs I have had, I think there is a need for the government to carefully explain to organisations how the system operates. I have had a lot of visits from organisations, and we have facilitated organisations getting detailed briefings from our officials. I do not suggest that there are 
 not some issues outstanding—and I think we are all aware of those—but I think there is now a higher degree of comfort amongst bodies about how the system currently operates.
You wanted an example. If the government gives a grant of $100,000 to a particular organisation and that is taxable, the government gives $110,000 and the organisation gets $110,000. It remits the GST, which is $10,000, and the net payment is $100,000. That is what we mean when we say `net out effects'. The government gets an input tax credit of $10,000 so the net cost to the government is $100,000. I hope that provides a degree of clarity. You might wish to read what I said in the Hansard, but I think that explains what I mean when I speak about the net out effects and why the end result is the same as in the other case where a grant is free of GST.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-11,"—My understanding of 10 per cent of $110,000 is not $10,000. It would probably be $11,000, would it not?
—It is tax inclusive.
—Once a decision has been made that a grant is not subject to GST, will the government be instituting protocols such as providing indemnification to cover recipients in the event that the Australian Taxation Office later determines that the grant is a payment for goods and services and is therefore subject to GST?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—Once you have a ruling, it is binding on the commissioner. If the commissioner issued a ruling and someone felt that the ruling did not cover their particular matter, they would maybe seek a specific ruling and the commissioner would be bound by that ruling. The commissioner will not vary his decision after he has provided a ruling on that matter.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-11,"—One of the reasons I was asking the question is: is the government aware of 
 the New Zealand case of Director-General v. DeMorgan (1996) 17 NZTC 12636, where it was held that, when the New Zealand government increased the GST rate from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent, the New Zealand Department of Social Welfare was not liable to pay an extra 2.5 per cent on any of its grants? As a consequence, the recipients of grants in this case—it was someone running a home for the aged—were liable to pay an extra 2.5 per cent GST with no extra grant money in lieu.
What commitment will the government give that, if the rate is increased, it would maintain the real grant levels for recipients? Would it not be more certain at the outset to deem all government grants outside the GST system or GST free? It seems like we are going to have a paper nightmare and that there will be a cost in simply transferring money from the government to the recipient and back to the government.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—The government has made a commitment that we are not going to increase the GST. I am not aware of the particular court case but, if the issue in that particular court case was that there was an increase in the GST, that would certainly not apply to what is before the chamber. The government's clear commitment is not to increase the GST, and there is a lock-in procedure by which any increase would have to have the agreement of a wide range of states and territories. You have raised the case and I will get my officials to look closely at it. If there is anything more I can add I will do that as soon as I have some additional advice.

We realise that in recent times the states have come to agreements about such things as high-rolling gamblers without any real knowledge or without it having been part of the original agreement, and that seems to have covered the government in changing their GST package. Has the government done any research or studies attempting to quantify the compliance costs for recipients, the Australian Taxation 
 Office and government departments in subjecting certain grants to the GST system? Has any calculation been done of the cost of the administrative ping-pong of this system of working out whether a person is subject and sending it back if they were not or paying them more on a certain calculated amount and sending it back?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—Senator Margetts, I think we are probably discussing your amendment now rather than mine. As I said, I do not resist the questions, but they do seem to generally apply more to the amendment which I think you are proposing to move than to the amendment which I have proposed. There are no specific studies, but the regulatory impact statement looks at this issue, and the ongoing cost is calculated at $130 per registration. I think we had this discussion a little bit earlier in the debate.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-11,"—I have a question on the example that Senator Margetts used. She referred to the Start program, which is the program that this government laughingly proposes to provide incentive for research and development. Leaving aside that editorialising, this is an important program. If someone from that program gets a grant of, say, $100,000, they are then obliged to undertake the research and development that was in their proposal, but they will get a grant of $110,000 in order to meet the GST requirements on that grant. Where does the extra $10,000 come from? Does it come from the global allocation to that program or are all programs to be topped up by 10 per cent so that the real value of those programs remains constant?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—As economists used to say, on the assumption of ceteris paribus—all other things remaining the same—the cost to the government or the particular department is the same because the department gets a credit where there is a GST component. Using the example of $110,000, through that sequence that I went through, ultimately a credit of $10,000 is given where a GST is 
 paid. As I said, on the assumption of all other things being the same, the cost to the government is the same.
—It goes back to the Australian Taxation Office and then to the states. Are you saying—
An adviser having responded—
—We have very enthusiastic staff. I think I will repeat that for the convenience of the Hansard . I do not know how Hansard  will deal with that. We have a very keen set of advisers here, Senator Cook. The department gets the credit. If it was passed on to the states or whatever, if there is a GST on the grant provided by the department, it is the department which gets the credit. The net cost to the government does not increase as a result of that GST.
—And the funding to the program does not go down?
—On ceteris paribus. Governments make decisions about particular programs. Governments will always do that, as they should. If you were in government or the Democrats were in government, you would have your own priorities about the sorts of programs you fund.
—It would be a bit different.
—I am just talking about how government operates. A government operates by setting, among other things, priorities amongst the amount of money it is prepared to raise. We are discussing a principle position as to how this would work out in fact, but we are also discussing particular programs. What I am saying is ceteris paribus—all other things being the same—the net cost does not increase. I hope that answers your question. I will be interested to see how Hansard  deals with the interjection.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—Minister, it has been a practice of the Treasury to use relatively youthful advisers. I notice you have someone with grey hair who has been attached to your staff at the back there. I say welcome to Senator Ferguson in his new role.
—He has been promoted to adviser.
—He is well informed now, so he is quite capable of giving advice.
—I would put him on the front bench if I were you.
—Yes, I notice that he likes to give advice to us, to the Labor Party and to everyone else as well. Minister, in response to Senator Margetts's question, you referred to the locking-in mechanism. My attention was drawn to an article in the Bulletin  of 11 May. As you know, the Bulletin  has been upgraded and rejigged. The article, which was on page 20, was entitled `Is it legal?', and it asked, `Is the GST constitutional?' It outlined three areas where the GST may encounter future legal hurdles.
It outlined the first as the price policing power given to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission; the second it outlined as the locking-in mechanism of the GST's 10 per cent rate—which is the thing you referred to—and it outlined the third as being provided by legal expert George Williams of the ANU, that it is unconstitutional for the parliament to attempt to bind a future parliament to require approval by the states to change a tax. The first issue it did not give a source for; the second issue is from the Parliamentary Library's paper of last week; and the third is a quite well-known legal expert. I wonder if you might be accused of misleading Senator Margetts in your response on the locking-in mechanism when certainly some advice which is publicly available indicates that that locking-in mechanism may in fact be invalid, illegal and ineffective.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—We have had quite a long debate on the constitutional issues concerned with this bill. In fact, that was almost the first issue which this chamber dealt with, and there was quite a vigorous debate stretching over a number of hours about that issue. Let me make it clear that the government is confident that the bills as presented to this chamber are constitutional. We would not have presented them in the chamber if we did not think they were constitutional. As I said, I do not accept the view that the bills are not 
 constitutional. Can I prevail upon your goodwill? We have had this debate, and could we deal with the amendment before the chair? Can I even suggest that it may be possible for us to deal with it before the siren sounds?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—Minister, I would not have raised the issue, but you raised it yourself in your answer to Senator Margetts. I would point out that the article actually quotes you. It said:
When Senator Harradine raised the section 55 problems in the Senate recently, the government stonewalled. Assistant Treasurer Rod Kemp would say only that the new tax was constitutional but refused to table any advice.
I think that is accurate. That is what you said. You said it repeatedly and you repeatedly refused to table any advice. I just let you know that you have not satisfied all senators on that issue.
Minister, returning to your amendment, I looked in the dictionary attached to A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998 for a definition of either `agency' or `government agency'. I did not look under `Australian government agency'. Is my understanding correct that an Australian government agency is one that is 100 per cent owned—I suppose I could use the term `owned'—by the government and is not autonomous but is subject to ministerial control and management? Could you in fact define for us what an Australian government agency is in terms of this tax provision?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-11,"—I have got rather technical advice. It is an agency which is part of what is termed the federal or state crown, and it comes under that technical way of describing it. It is regarded as an agency of government. But I may seek from my advisers an explanation which is more senator friendly than the one I have just given. I will seek, perhaps when the debate resumes tomorrow, to provide an explanation which answers the question in a way which people would perhaps be more aware of.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-11,"—Thank you for that response, 
 Minister. Through the chair, to assist the Minister, I am probably more interested in what the definition would exclude rather than include. I would like to know if it excluded ASIC or the ACCC—those kind of autonomous institutions—and how it would deal with Telstra, which is part owned and part not, government business enterprises and those sorts of things, if I could.
The amendment before us, as Senator Margetts has outlined, does pick up issues concerning how community organisations, who fulfil what were government functions, will compare with this. As the minister would probably be aware, community groups like St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare, Centacare and Unicare are all reporting big increases in demands for services, as funding to core government services is cut back. In other words, there has been a cost shifting from the government sector to the not-for-profit sector.
The issue, if I understood her correctly, that Senator Margetts was raising is that that is all very well but, if it also carries with it a further 10 per cent tax imposition, that gets even harder to deal with. I appreciate that, in the way that you have responded so far, you have sought to allay those fears and I think I have understood your responses in those regards.
But there are also other areas, such as Job Network—which we might deal with tomorrow when the debate resumes—where the Prime Minister has a stated policy objective of privatising much of those functions in turn, which might be considered welfare or government functions. How will they be affected by the policy and the amendment and the provisions of the bill that you have already covered? I flag that question mark to you.
I clearly understand from what you have said that, if a payment is made to a government agency for a service under an appropriation, it is GST free. That would seem to be eminently sensible. I cannot see why you would not want to do it. But, as Senator Margetts has picked out, if it is made to a community service organisation, an environmental organisation, a public health organisation or a not-for-profit employment provider, 
 it could in certain circumstances be subject to GST—and that would create major problems. If those problems are passable, I think we need to attend to how they could be avoided.
I should indicate that it is not our intention to oppose this amendment, but we will move our own amendment later on to make grant payments to charities GST free, so that it is absolutely clear that that is the situation. I do not think there should be any doubt on this matter.

I seek leave to make a statement relating to the 1999-2000 budget.
Leave granted.
—This is the budget for the last year of the Century. In putting together this budget, the government wanted to achieve a number of things:
*	 We wanted to deliver the election commitments we made last October.
*	 We wanted an economic framework which would help families by keeping home mortgage rates low.
*	 We wanted to deliver increased services to rural and regional Australia.
*	 We wanted to build the nation's educational and research capacity.
*	 We wanted to keep Australia strong—having come through the first two years of the Asian economic and financial crisis.
*	 We wanted to keep the budget in surplus.
We wanted to frame a budget which would set us up to enter the next Century much as we entered this one—a world leader in living standards, prosperous, free, and with all the potential of a dynamic young nation.
Madam President, this budget is right for the times. The Commonwealth Government, this year, budgets again to spend within its means.
Madam President, for the third year in a row, the budget will be in surplus—a surplus of more than $5 billion. And that means that this year, again, we can pay off debt.
In the last five years before the coalition was elected, Labor ran up Commonwealth debt by nearly $80 billion. We had to raise $9 
 billion in taxes just to pay the government's interest bill. The coalition put an end to that spiral of deficit and debt. This is the fourth budget I have presented on behalf of the coalition Government. In those four budgets, in net terms, we have not borrowed a dollar.
And we have repaid over $24 billion of Labor's debt.
If the Senate passes the government's legislation—legislation to implement policies we put to the electorate last October—by 2002-03, we could repay all of Labor's debt. And the Commonwealth Government could be debt free.
We could begin the next Century, as we began this one: No Commonwealth debt—a clean sheet—and no interest bill to pay. We would have the chance to lower taxes, and build better opportunities for our people.
The historic turnaround in the Commonwealth Budget was not done by pushing up tax, but by pruning expenses.
The budget I present tonight, for the fourth year in a row, proposes:
*	 No increase in rates of income tax.
*	 No increase in rates of company tax.
*	 No increase in rates of petrol excise.
*	 No increase in rates of wholesale sales tax.
The Economic Environment
Just under two years ago events beginning in Thailand led to the most severe financial crisis and economic downturn in our region in 50 years. Since then, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand—nearly all the countries of our region—went into recession.
Many thought Australia couldn't stand against such a severe regional crisis. Some predicted Australia would be dragged into recession and spiralling unemployment. But sound economic management and sound institutions protected our economy. It didn't go into recession. Our economy grew. In fact it grew faster than the countries of Europe and faster than the developed world, faster than the countries in America. And unemployment fell. In the past year, 180,000 new jobs were created.
Our inflation is as low as we've seen it in 30 years. Home mortgage interest rates are the lowest they've been in 30 years, and unemployment—while still too high—has fallen to its lowest level since the start of the decade.
But we would fool ourselves to think our problems are now all over. Our region is still in trouble. The world economy is still weak. Next year the government forecasts economic growth at 3 per cent—this is faster than most of the major economies of the world but a little slower than the very high growth of 4¼ per cent this year. Our current account deficit—widened by weak export prices and a strong consumer demand for imports—is forecast at 5¼ per cent of GDP. This is a little better than this year. But it means we cannot afford to be complacent.
The world economy is still a very uncertain place.
Just as the economic reform of three years ago gave us the strength to ride out the challenges of the last year, the reforms of today will determine how we ride out the challenges of tomorrow. If we want the growth, the living standards, and the jobs in the next decade, we must rise to the challenges of today.
And, of course, the reform of the Australian taxation system is our greatest reform challenge.
With a strong year behind us, new challenges now upon us, and with great opportunities before us, the government has carefully drawn up its initiatives and set its priorities for the coming year. Our economic strategy is responsible, fair and prudent.
It is right for the times.
Our priority is our election commitments. We are able to announce tonight how the government will deliver those commitments. And tonight we outline some exciting new initiatives for our country and our future.
Education
Madam President, we cannot, with certainty, predict all the challenges our children will face in the future. We cannot with certainty, 
 predict the work skills they will need for the jobs they will do—but we do know that the best possible way to prepare them is a strong education.
The Commonwealth, in this forthcoming year, will spend $4.8 billion on the education of primary and secondary children. The government is committed to ensure that all young people have access to a strong basic education and a quality pathway from school to further training, further education, and employment. A key government priority is to ensure that every Australian school child is able to read and write. This budget builds on previous initiatives by allocating $131 million over four years for literacy and numeracy programs in schools. For the first time, literacy and numeracy programs will extend to the middle years of schooling. Parents want their children to be able to read and write. We want to help schools do it. Funding of $78 million is being provided for a Quality Teacher Program to help teachers focus on professional development in literacy, numeracy, mathematics, science, information technology and vocational education.
Additional funding of $553 million over five years has been provided for Catholic systemic schools, implementing our election commitment made last October. This decision followed an independent assessment of the needs of this system conducted by the Non-Government Schools Funding Review Committee.
In this budget we are announcing a new formula for distributing recurrent funding to non-government schools. The new system will be based on the needs of the parents, taking into account the resources of the community that a school serves. It will provide a fairer and better treatment. It will boost funding for needy schools. The new system will be phased in to operate fully by 2004. Schools which could have been disadvantaged by the new arrangements will be protected. They will have their existing per capita grants adjusted in line with cost rises. This guarantee and the increased grants going to more needy schools will increase funding by around $561 million over the 2001-04 school quadrennium.
Madam President, if we are to educate our children for life, we must also educate them about the evils in our society.
The government rejects the inevitability of increasing damage to individuals and the community from illicit drugs. To date the government has committed to a range of new measures in the fight against drugs, as part of the National Illicit Drug Strategy. In this budget $80 million over four years is announced for interception, treatment and a National School Drug Education Strategy: to teach our children the dangers, and hopefully protect them from the scourge of illicit drugs. This budget also provides a further $221 million over four years to allow police to compulsorily divert illicit drug users from the criminal justice system to counselling and treatment. We do not accept that drug addiction cannot be treated. This budget provides funds to expand treatment services for drug users.
A Safer Community
The government will establish a National Crime Information System (Crimtrac) to build a National DNA Criminal Intelligence Database and a National Child Sex Offender Database. Crimtrac will provide access to the most up to date and efficient technology to store and retrieve information to help police stop crime and protect the public. The government will also be establishing a National Crime Prevention Program aimed at finding and promoting ways of preventing crime and violence in the community. To enhance an equitable and accessible system of federal law and justice, additional counselling and mediation dispute resolution services will be provided and access to justice for disadvantaged people in rural and regional areas will be extended. The Commonwealth will establish a new Federal Magistrates Service to deal with less complex Federal cases. A Commonwealth Law Courts building will be constructed in Adelaide.
Families
Madam President, the government has before the Parliament legislation to provide 
 around $2½ billion of extra family assistance each year.
Associated with the introduction of the new tax system from 1 July next year, over two million Australian families will qualify for additional assistance—at least $140 per child, and in a one income family with a dependent child under five, $490 per child.
This is in addition to income tax cuts now contained in legislation before the Senate. The government's legislation proposes to cut income tax for every Australian taxpayer.
In addition to the increased benefits provided to families as part of the government's tax reform—A New Tax System—from 1 July 2000, eligibility for Family Tax Benefit, Part A will be extended further than is contained in the legislation. The benefit will be payable for dependent young people up to the age of 21 years who are not receiving Youth Allowance, or if they are receiving part Youth Allowance, the benefit will be topped up for qualifying families to the maximum rate of $37.50 per fortnight.
The government's focus on helping families includes a range of specific initiatives including increased relationship support services, assistance to resolve family disputes, developing approaches to reduce domestic violence, expansion of children's contact services, a new suicide prevention strategy and support for carers of young people with disabilities. The government will implement a new youth homelessness early intervention program and provide increased funding for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program which provides transitional support and accommodation to help homeless people and those at risk from domestic violence.
The government's economic strategy is directed squarely at helping Australian families. The average Australian family with a mortgage is saving over $320 a month as a result of interest rate falls under this government. More young Australians can buy homes. More families can pay the mortgage to keep their home. Good economic policy is good family policy.
Health
The government is working to improve the health and medical care of all Australians. We are committed to a balanced health system with Medicare, a strong public hospital system and the opportunity for more Australians to take out private health insurance.
We are working with the States and Territories to ensure continued improvement in the efficiency and quality of services in public hospitals. To encourage private health insurance, from 1 January this year, every Australian taking out private health insurance is eligible to have 30 per cent of the premium paid by the Commonwealth.
To build on this initiative, and to further encourage people to take out health insurance, Lifetime Health Cover will be implemented from 1 July 1999. This system will allow registered health funds to charge different premiums, depending on the age at which a person first joined a health fund. People taking out cover early in life will pay lower premiums. The new system rewards early and continuous membership. The premium will be set at the age a person first joined, and once set, remains at a lower rate, relative to people entering at an older age. We want young people to make health insurance a habit. There will be a 12 month grace period from 1 July to allow those not yet insured to do so. If they do, they will be credited with the lowest possible joining age. In addition, special provisions will protect people aged 65 or more on 1 July 1999 by ensuring that they can take out hospital cover at any time and be credited with the minimum joining age.
In this, the International Year of the Older Person, the health care of older Australians is a particular priority. The budget provides funding of $228 million for an Enhanced Primary Care Package, targeted to older Australians and those with chronic conditions. The package is designed to better coordinate health services and to improve people's self-reliance and capacity to manage their own conditions. For example, the government will provide for voluntary annual health assessments for those Australians aged 75 and over. We will put in place a program to help prevent injuries to elderly people arising from 
 falls. Separately, $82 million has been provided to expand the provision of respite care for carers of people with dementia and other cognitive and behavioural problems. These measures are designed to support carers and by supporting them, to support those with disability.
The government will provide additional funding of $210 million over the next four years for hearing rehabilitation services, including the provision of hearing aids for eligible persons. The funding will enable a further 67,000 Australians to be assisted each year. While this will mainly benefit older Australians, a component of this funding will be directed towards the ongoing delivery of high quality hearing services to children and others with special needs.
The government will continue to work toward addressing the huge disparity in the health of our indigenous people. Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander primary health care funding is to be increased by $79 million over four years. The Army/ATSIC Community Assistance Program which provides environmental and health infrastructure delivered by defence personnel to indigenous communities will also be extended.
Rural and Regional Australia
The government is strongly committed to rural and regional Australia. We know the many challenges that country people face. So tonight, in this budget, there are a number of initiatives seeking to help strengthen the social and economic fabric of rural and regional areas.
We are working with Australia's primary industries to secure their profitability, sustainability and competitiveness. Part of this is the ongoing Supermarket to Asia Strategy to develop Australia as the food supplier to the region. To add to this, a new Food and Fibre Supply Chain Program will be established. These programs will open up markets for Australia's farmers. Resources are also being provided for the Northern Australian Quarantine Strategy and regional flood mitigation programs. The government will provide $32 million over five years to restore ground water pressure in the Great Artesian 
 Basin, a major water resource for the country, supporting pastoral and mining enterprises.
People living outside capital cities must have access to quality health care. During the 1998 election campaign, the government committed itself to a series of measures to improve rural health services in the short and longer term. This budget delivers on those promises. An additional 30 Regional Health Service Centres will be established in rural communities across Australia over the next four years. These centres will draw together health, aged care and other community services to a central location; based on community need, providing a mix of services to best meet local priorities.
And we know rural Australia needs more doctors. The government will spend $43 million over four years to pay retention money for long serving GPs as an incentive for them to continue practice in rural and remote areas. The government will establish a clinical school based in Wagga and a medical school at James Cook University in Queensland. We will establish a Rural Australia Medical Undergraduate Scholarships Scheme for rural students to train as doctors. Rural people trained as doctors are more likely to serve in rural Australia. We will establish a fly-in female general practitioner service for women in rural and remote areas who currently do not have access to a female GP.
To ensure that students from rural and regional areas have access to education, this budget provides a number of initiatives including increasing boarding allowance under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme and extending eligibility for the student financial loan supplement.
Two new Centrelink call centres will be established, in Maryborough in Queensland and Port Augusta in South Australia. The new call centres will tailor services to customers in regional and rural Australia.
As part of the social bonus to be funded from the sale of the second tranche of Telstra, the government will fund the establishment of up to 500 rural transactions centres at a cost of $70 million over five years. This means small rural communities can establish centres 
 that provide access to services, such as banking, post, phone, fax and Medicare from the one centre. This goes a long way to defeating the distance that makes it hard for rural and regional Australians to access services.
An efficient and integrated transport sector is vital to underpinning economic growth, creating investment and providing services to people in both urban and regional Australia.
The government has allocated an additional $195 million over four years to upgrade the National Highway System and roads of national importance. Increased funding is also being provided for bridge upgrades to facilitate the introduction of increased mass limits for heavy vehicles. These programs will enhance the efficiency of our road transport system, with consequential national and regional economic benefits. The Black Spot Program is also being extended for a further two years in order to make our roads safer and reduce the social trauma and human costs of road crashes.
Training and Employment
Madam President, one of the most significant structural changes introduced by this government was the concept of mutual obligation—the obligation of the community to the individual, and the obligation of the individual, in return, to the community.
That is why the government introduced the Work for the Dole scheme. It has been immensely successful.
The government is pursuing a wide range of labour market reforms to achieve sustained reductions in the level of unemployment. As part of an integrated approach to employment, the scope of activities that satisfy the mutual obligations of unemployment beneficiary recipients will be increased. Work for the Dole will be extended to those aged between 25 and 34 years who have been in receipt of unemployment payments for twelve months or more. Work for the Dole will also be expanded to Year 12 school-leavers in receipt of unemployment payments for more than three months. In total, this will involve a doubling of Work for the Dole places from 25,000 in 1998-99 to 50,000 by 2000-01.
Employers in rural and regional areas will be provided with an additional incentive payment of $1000 to progress new apprentices to higher skill levels in trades and occupations experiencing skill shortages.
To combat the severe employment problems faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the government will introduce the Indigenous Employment Policy. The package of additional initiatives to address the severe employment situation faced by indigenous Australians will double the funding for indigenous program initiatives from $25 million to $50 million per annum.
Frontiers in Science and Research
Madam President, advances in health care and quality of life in the future will come from new knowledge and new scientific breakthroughs. Australia has a proud history of science and medical research. Australian pioneers—the Howard Floreys, the Macfarlane Burnets, the Victor Changs—led the world. We want to build a culture that will bring forth new pioneers in the new century, who will expand the frontiers of knowledge and advance just like their predecessors.
In an historic commitment, the government has decided to invest an additional $614 million over the next six years into health and medical research funded through the National Health and Medical Research Council. No previous Australian government has ever given health and medical research such a high priority.
This will more than double the Council's existing funding level by the year 2005. A significant part of this investment will be for the development of an enhanced national medical genomics capacity, which will have the potential to look for ways to cure major illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. This capacity, along with other research initiatives the Treasurer is announcing tonight, will ensure that Australia can maintain its place at the cutting edge of biotechnology. This is a new frontier for innovative, knowledge-based industries in health, agriculture and many other related areas. Most importantly, this funding will enable our best and brightest to pursue opportunities in 
 science and medicine, here in Australia. In addition, new funding of $20 million over the next two years will develop enhanced physical facilities in Australia's leading health and medical research institutes.
This significant boost in funding for health and medical research flows, in part, from the recommendations of the Wills Review, the most comprehensive report ever undertaken into medical research. These measures will consolidate Australia's position in the top 10 OECD countries in terms of health and medical research investment.
Biotechnology will have a major impact on many commercial activities and has the potential to improve the lives of Australians through new medical treatments, safer and more nutritious food, reductions in the use of chemicals and more sustainable land use practices. We are going to assist the biotechnology industry to maximise its contribution to the Australian economy. This will be done through a one-stop-shop named Biotechnology Australia, supported by a Council of Ministers, to advance developments and harness discoveries in this area. The government will also establish the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, operating with existing mechanisms to ensure Australia has a nationally consistent system to regulate food, agriculture and therapeutic goods to develop public confidence and ensure public safety in reaping benefits from this cutting edge area of science.
To help ensure that Australia maintains its strength in scientific and industrial research and innovation, the government will maintain higher baseline funding for the CSIRO. Research infrastructure funding for universities will be increased and new science lectureships will be established. This complements the Strategic Partnerships-Industry Research and Training program for which additional funding has previously been announced.
Leading Financial Services
Australia's system of financial regulation leads the world. The stability shown in the banking and corporate sector, notwithstanding the Asian financial crisis, is evidence of how well placed the regulatory reforms have 
 proved. To enhance Australia's capacity to participate fully in the strong global growth in the financial services industry, the government has allocated $3.5 million in each of 1999-2000 and 2000-01 for initiatives to promote Australia as a centre for global financial services.
Australia's public finances are reported and presented on a world class basis. Our Charter of budget Honesty is now advocated internationally as a model for other countries. This budget is presented on an accrual basis for the first time. It allows us to properly budget for future expenditures. This puts Australia at the forefront of transparency in the conduct of fiscal policy.
Economic Outlook
Madam President, after two years of economic growth in excess of 4 per cent, growth of around 3 per cent is expected in 1999-2000. Growth over the year to the June quarter 2000 is expected to be around 3½ per cent. This is a remarkable achievement given the crisis in Asia and the slowdown in world growth. Economic growth in Australia will remain stronger than all the G7 economies and the average of the OECD countries and more favourable than most countries in the region.
In 1999-2000 we are expecting stronger growth in both exports and investment in plant and equipment as the international economy gradually improves.
Employment growth is set to be strong enough to keep intact the very significant gains this government has made on reducing the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate should remain around its current level. The outlook is for inflation to remain low, averaging 2 per cent in 1999-2000.
As exports and commodity prices respond to a gradual strengthening in world growth, the current account deficit will ease in 1999-2000 to average around 5¼ per cent of GDP.
Concluding Comments
Within the space of four budgets the coalition has positioned Australia for the next century. We now have very sound fundamen 
 tals: strong growth, low inflation, the budget in surplus and the prospect of completely eliminating Commonwealth net debt.
Our next budget will begin the story of the 21st century. By then we should have a new tax system—A New Tax System for the new century. A new tax system will fund and sustain our hopes and aspirations in health care, in education, in care for the old, and care for the young.
The next decade could be a special one for Australia—a step up in growth, in jobs, in our community infrastructure, in our services, for those in need, in our living standards, leading the region and, in many respects, leading the world.
Good economic policy will determine our capacity to meet these important social objectives. This is a budget for those objectives. This is a budget right for these times.
I commend the budget to the Senate. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the budget statement and documents.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement and documents.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-05-11,"—Tonight I would like to—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Would senators please leave the chamber or resume their seats.
—We'll leave.
—Perhaps Senator Abetz may learn something this evening if he stays. He suggests he may want to leave; that is fine. I rise tonight to discuss the issue of the labelling of genetically modified organisms. It is timely, and I congratulate the government for the idea in the budget that we will see the establishment of the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, which is a positive move in terms of recognising the importance of genetic technology issues to Australians. However, I wish to address the developing issue of genetically modified organisms and their labelling. It is a pressing concern of the Australian and international communities and it must be addressed by this parliament. It has serious implications for health, environmental trade and consumer rights to information.
Recently, genetically modified organisms have been recognised internationally to possess unknown health effects. In February this year the government of the United Kingdom declared an open ended moratorium on commercial production of genetically modified crops until such time as the government can be assured that they do not damage the health of consumers and the environment. The food minister, Mr Jeff Rooker, also announced earlier this month the introduction of new regulations requiring restaurants and cafes to inform customers of foods which contain GMOs. This extends European rules requiring retailers to label all foods that are GMOs—beyond the supermarket shelves to the hospitality industry.
The UK announcement also follows moves by Marks and Spencer to cease sales of foods containing GM ingredients and the supermarket chain Sainsbury's plans to eliminate GM ingredients from its own brand products—at present all but 50 products contain GM soy protein or DNA and these are labelled. Such international initiatives demonstrate that it is possible and cost efficient to identify GM ingredients in food and further more that it is actually in the interests of the industry to do so.
Such moves are long overdue in this country. A national government study by the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Technology determined, as long ago as July 1995, that 89 per cent—a huge majority—of Australian consumers supported the labelling of genetically engineered tomatoes. Only four per cent said they were against labelling.
At present, the majority of processed foods in Australia contain soy beans imported from the US of which 15 per cent are genetically modified and unlabelled. This is a real concern. Without labelling, consumers are unable to avoid those foods which may cause allergic reactions or conflict with ethical or religious considerations. This is not going to be resolved under the current ANZFA proposed A18 standard. The authority only requires labelling of GMOs which are not substantially equivalent to its conventional counterpart. However, `substantially equivalent' is too broad and does not adequately ensure consumer health.
—This will make front-page headlines tomorrow.
—Tests used to determine substantial equivalents do not detect unstable or multiple inserts of genes into an organism's genome, which could have unknown health and environmental effects. I am sorry that some senators opposite do not consider this kind of information important or exciting to them, but 89 per cent of consumers, when asked about genetically modified tomatoes, do think it is of concern. I am sorry that Senator Abetz is now on record as suggesting that it is not exactly front-page news.
Furthermore, tests for some kind of allergic reaction as stipulated by ANZFA cannot test for new proteins that may be produced through genetic manipulation processes, or new combinations of toxins that could cause allergic reactions. On this basis the A18 standard is deemed inadequate and, therefore, should be rejected. This was one of the findings of Australia's first consensus convention on the issue of genetic technologies.
The final report produced by the convention strongly recommended that all GM foods—not just those which are not `substantially equivalent'—should be labelled. The report overwhelmingly rejected the term `substantial equivalence' due to its narrow scientific application, and it promoted very strongly the idea of comprehensive labelling as the only way to ensure that individuals have full control of the health, religious, moral and ethical aspects of genetic engineering. I call on the Senate to recognise that and endorse the final report that the convention produced. I think it is one of the most comprehensive accounts to date of the Australian public's views on genetic technology and, in particular, GMOs.
Among its recommendations the report called for a new statutory authority with transparent procedures to hold responsibility for GMOs. That is why I sought to acknowledge the government's positive aspects in tonight's budget, despite the interjections by government members. I was actually commending them on something that they have done. I suggest that the people who were responsible for the report at the consensus convention will see that some of the ideas proposed in tonight's budget may go some way to alleviating concerns.
A further recommendation in the report was that environmental and health departments be integrally and proactively involved in developing strategies to address GMO applications. That is yet to happen. Another recommendation was that the regulation of GMO issues not be moved to the agricultural, fisheries and forestry portfolios or departments. We have heard whispers behind the scene that we could see a transfer of the responsibility for issues 
 such as this from health portfolios, where they belong, to agricultural portfolios.
If we are not mindful of environmental and health concerns and do not regulate comprehensively, we will lose consumer confidence and significant trade opportunities. According to a 1997 poll, 70 to 90 per cent of Japanese are in favour of comprehensive labelling of GM products. In light of this, we should be promoting ourselves as a clean and green exporter, rather than undermining our current trade advantage, as I believe the A18 standard will.
At present, Australia is the only country to guarantee non-GM canola. In January this year, the largest shipment of Australian canola to leave our shores was sold to oilseed crushing plants in Europe. Europe has become a major buyer of Australian canola due to our GMO-free canola supply. The 57,000 tonne shipment, valued at around $A26 million, is expected to lead a record shipping program for 1999 which is to total approximately 350,000 to 400,000 tonnes.
The importation of Australian GMO-free rapeseeds by the Japan Agriculture Co-op Association is another example of the potential trade benefits for a country such as ours if we are into comprehensive identification, preservation and tracking regulations. Australian trade with the association commenced in October last year and is expected to expand to 20,000 tonnes per year as consumer demand increases. By implementing a strong identity preservation regime in Australia, we can position ourselves as a clean, green exporter in the Australasian region and exploit our natural advantage as an isolated land mass, an ideal attribute to quarantine against genetic pollution.
At present, the Australasian health food company Sanitarium has installed a rigorous system which ensures that their soy milk is GMO free. This system guards against cross-contamination of, say, United States GM-free seeds through the export, production and manufacturing processes—to use the expression that ads use, from paddock to plate. The Sanitarium system demonstrates that identity tracking and preservation is actually possible and is advantageous to Australia's trade 
 position. We should be promoting our own clean, green soya in Australia, guaranteed by comprehensive identity tracking and preservation. These are things that most consumers involved in the genetic technology debate, certainly the consensus convention, have called for.
Australia needs clearly stated, compulsive guidelines. We need legislated rules regulating the use of GMOs and ensuring personal health, the health of our environment and our agricultural trade relations. We must reject ANZFA's standards for labelling and implement a real comprehensive and workable system, not a system like the A18 standard which pretends to label GMOs.
Finally, I would like to acknowledge the money that has been put forward tonight for some of the biotechnology advances, but warn that we still have no framework legislation in this country to guard against discrimination on the grounds of genetic information and nothing that actually protects genetic privacy.
—Why didn't you appear at the hearings?
—I look forward to the day when the government introduces a legislative regime on a state or federal level, a bit like the US is debating right now. I think it would be a very positive advance.
—Did you do any work on that? No.
—Perhaps senators opposite could spend more time looking at such issues instead of interjecting the whole time.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Genetically Modified Food</title>,Adjournment,15,1,speech

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-05-11,"—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
The following answer is based on advice from Airservices Australia, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI), the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DoTRS) and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) where indicated. The time period is taken to be the 1997/98 financial year.
(1) Airservices: For the year ending 30 June 1998 Airservices let 20 consultancies of $20,000 and above.
CASA: For the year ending 30 June 1998, CASA let 146 consultancies. 

(2) (a) BASI: BASI let one consultancy directly relating to aviation safety.
DoTRS: DoTRS let one consultancy relating to aviation safety.
(b) BASI: The terms of reference of the consultancy have been provided to the Table Office.
DoTRS: The terms of reference of the consultancy have been provided to the Table Office.
(c) BASI: A tender was called for the consultancy but because of the extremely specialised nature of the task the tender was restricted to those companies or persons who were considered capable of providing the service required. The following companies/persons were invited to tender:
-	 Southern California Safety Institute
-	 Risk Analysis Services
-	 R2a, Risk and Reliability Associates Pty Ltd
-	 Aviation Hazard Analysis Ltd
-	 Gwyn Associates
-	 Dr Steven Grey
-	 Dr Tony Cox
-	 Mr Pat Neilan
Following tender evaluation, the tender was let to Aviation Hazard Analysis Ltd on 17 April 1998.
DoTRS: Yes. Tenders were called from a shortlist of Expressions of Interest. The tender shortlist comprised:
-	 Deacon Graham James Consulting
-	 Halcrow Pacific
-	 Mitchell Madison Group
-	 Spencer Golding and Associates
-	 Tanner Menzies Pty Ltd
-	 The Allen Consulting Group
-	 Wes Willoughby and Associates
The consultancy was let on 14 January 1998
(d) There were no relevant consultancies in DoTRS or BASI that were let without a tender process.
(3) Airservices: Airservices procurement policy requires all purchases or contractual commitments over $100,000 to be provided through a formal tender process. Consultancies under $100,000 are not required to be subject to tender process. However, depending on the value, at least three 
 quotations are required from selected suppliers before the consultancies are decided. For further control the approval of consultancy expenditure is restricted to the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Managers as follows: Board  $250,000; Chief Executive Officer  $250,000; Executive and General Managers  $50,000.
No established list of preferred companies is used due to the diverse needs and wide scope of consultancies used. Where a confined enquiry is used, these have to be approved by the appropriate authority depending on the value of the consultancy as outlined above.
The details for Airservices tenders over $100,000 have been provided to the Table Office.
CASA: CASA's procurement policy requires all procurement of goods or services over $100,000 to be provided through a formal tender process. Exemptions to this policy may be approved by the Director.
By virtue of the above policy, consultancies under $100,000 are not required to be subject to a tender process. However, depending on value, at least three quotations are required before a decision is taken to engage a consultant. Exemptions to the three quotations can only be approved by the Director.
Financial Authorisations covering consultancy expenditures are as follows:
Director Unlimited under Civil Aviation Act; Assistant Director  $100,000; General Manager  $50,000; Other Managers  $10,000.
No established list of preferred companies is used due the diverse needs and wide scope of consultancies used. CASA did, however, utilise some Commonwealth standard PE Consultancy Lists for Information Technology-related services.
BASI and DoTRS: Not relevant as both used formal tender process.
(4) Airservices: A list of consultancies costing more than $20,000 containing the actual cost of each consultancy has been provided to Table Office. There have been no material variations to contracted cost.
CASA: The practice of varying the cost of a consultancy is an exception rather than a rule and can occur for a number of reasons which may result in a net increase or decrease to the contracted cost of the services. Where such variations occur, an amendment to the consultancy agreement would be required. In considering a variation, CASA officers must have regard to the Authority's stated procurement policy including value for money open and effective competition. A list of consultancies for the period considered that includes the actual cost of each has been provided to the Table Office. 

BASI: The contracted cost for the consultancy was 16,800 English Pounds. There was no variation to this cost.
DoTRS: The contracted cost was $32,200. The actual cost was $46,202. The variation was due to payment of allowances for travel, accommodation and other incidental costs.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia: Consultancies</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,17,1,answer
