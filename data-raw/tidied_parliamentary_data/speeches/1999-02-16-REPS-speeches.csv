"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—I present for the information of honourable members the second report on the deaths of Australian based journalists in East Timor in 1975, prepared by Mr Tom Sherman AO. I watched the report on the ABC's Foreign Correspondent  program on 20 October last year concerning the deaths of five Australian based journalists at Balibo in 1975. While not usually persuaded by journalistic crusades, I was struck by the account presented by the alleged new eyewitness to the deaths of the journalists. Having taken a transparent and open attitude to this matter over the years, I felt that further inquiry into this new account was justified and that I owed it to the families to see that all available information relating to the deaths of their loved ones was thoroughly examined.
I therefore asked Mr Sherman to look again at the deaths of the five Australian based journalists. Mr Sherman's brief was to evaluate any information about the deaths emerging from or relevant to the Foreign Correspondent program which was in addition to that covered in his first report. As the new information related to the deaths of the journalists at Balibo, Mr Sherman did not look again at the death of Roger East, nor was he was offered any new information on the death of Roger East.
As I did when I tabled Mr Sherman's first report in 1996, I emphasise that the govern 
 ment has been thoroughly transparent on this issue. At the beginning of the second evaluation I said that Mr Sherman would have full access to all material held by the government on this matter. Mr Sherman did ask for access to a variety of material, including relevant intelligence material and interviews with a number of former government officials who worked with this material. The government cooperated fully and respected Mr Sherman's independence at all times. Mr Sherman sets out his account of the information from government sources in chapter 5, and his conclusions about it are on page 139. The government is also giving favourable consideration to the publication of documents relating to this historical period and a final decision will be made in due course.
In his letter to me covering the second report, Mr Sherman states that he recognises the government may be concerned that his references to intelligence material disclose details of sources and methods relating to the gathering of intelligence. The government takes disclosure of such information very seriously, and we have therefore decided not to include in the tabled version of the second report some references which could disclose sources of intelligence. These references are a very small component of Mr Sherman's report, and their length is apparent in paragraphs 5.28, 5.29 and 5.30. While the government regrets having to take this action, it does not affect the conclusion Mr Sherman makes about the intelligence material or his overall findings about the deaths.
I thank Mr Sherman for the care and attention he has devoted to this important task. I want to express the government's appreciation for the manner in which he has discharged his responsibilities. The conclusions of Mr Sherman's second report are in chapter 8. Mr Sherman concludes that the Balibo 5 were killed at Balibo early in the morning of 16 October 1975, probably before 7 a.m.; by an attacking force consisting of both Indonesian troops and anti-Fretilin East Timorese under the control of Indonesian officers; in circumstances of continuing fighting between attackers and defenders or at least before the attackers had secured their objective.
Contrasting with the hearsay accounts of the deaths in the l996 report, the bases for these conclusions include the accounts of three individuals who claim to have witnessed at least one of the killings. I am not going to comment in detail on Mr Sherman's findings as the report speaks clearly enough for itself, although I would note that he concludes that the evidence available on the Balibo killings is quite inconsistent, particularly as to the circumstances of death.
Mr Sherman produced his report on the basis of information available outside Indonesia. The government asked at the highest levels of the Indonesian government that Mr Sherman be allowed to visit Indonesia in conducting his evaluation. The Indonesian government did not agree to this request, and we cannot compel it to do so any more than it can compel the Australian government to do something which we might or might not want to do.
Nevertheless, I have again written to my Indonesian counterpart, Mr Ali Alatas, asking him to pursue any further information which would throw additional light on the conclusions reached. In the letter I also ask again for any additional information the Indonesian government is able to provide us on the death of Roger East, whose killing was a concern of Mr Sherman's first report. I am happy today to table that letter along with the second report.
In its approach to the second report, as with the first, the government has remained concerned for the next of kin. Officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have provided copies of the report to the journalists' relatives and invited their questions and comments on it. The Australian government deeply regrets the deaths and remains willing to receive any credible new information about them. In this context, and as part of our transparent approach, the government would be favourably disposed to proposals for a parliamentary inquiry on this matter should the parliament wish.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>East Timor: Deaths of Australian Based Journalists</title>,Ministerial Statements,4,1
"Brereton, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-02-16,"—I rise to speak briefly in response to the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs concerning the second report of Mr 
 Tom Sherman into the circumstances of the deaths of the five Australian based journalists at Balibo, East Timor, on 16 October 1975. Unlike the minister, the opposition has not had the opportunity to conduct a detailed analysis that such a document requires. As a consequence, I do not propose to speak  about the detail of Mr Sherman's inquiry and findings. Suffice to say that I note his conclusion that the evidence available to him is inconsistent but leads to conclusions broadly similar to those he reached in 1996.
More than 2½ years ago, following the first Sherman report and the Indonesian government's refusal to reopen the issue, Prime Minister Howard said it was not clear what further action would be in the national interest. Although the government did not say so explicitly, the case was effectively closed. That, of course, was not the view of the relatives of the dead journalists, nor was it the view of groups such as the International Commission of Jurists, which developed a strong critique of the limitations of the Sherman inquiry, his analysis and his findings.
Then last year we had the revelations published in August by Mr Hamish MacDonald of the Sydney Morning Herald and the ABC Foreign Correspondent program in October that triggered the new inquiry. When the minister announced this further inquiry, I said it was unlikely to satisfy the families of the dead journalists. I understand that Mrs Shirley Shackleton has received a copy of this report only within the last hour. I think she could have received an advance copy in a much more timely fashion. I suspect that when the families do get to read the report they will not be satisfied. Indeed, it does not appear to take us very far forward at all.
I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has again written to his Indonesian counterpart, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, seeking cooperation from the Indonesian government in providing further information which would shed light on the deaths of the journalists. I do not think the minister has done so with much hope of a positive reply. Minister Alatas has already said that the Indonesian government considers the case closed and that 
 a further investigation would only open old wounds. In his letter Mr Downer expresses regret that Australia is still obliged to raise what he describes as unfortunate incidents.
What he should have said is that Australia cannot consider the case closed without a full account of the events at Balibo from the Indonesian side, including the role or otherwise of the present minister for information and others in the Indonesian military chain of command. He should have told Minister Alatas that it is not a case of reopening old wounds; it is a case of dealing openly and frankly with an enduring wound in the bilateral relationship, a wound which will not heal without full openness, transparency and fundamental accountability from the Indonesian side.
I also note the minister's statement that the government is giving favourable consideration to the publication of documents relating to this historical period. I have already made clear Labor's position on this matter. We support a comprehensive declassification of historical records relating to East Timor, in respect of not only the Whitlam Labor government but also the Fraser government. With regard to Balibo there should be a comprehensive release of documents which shed light on the Whitlam government's knowledge of the events prior to and after the killings and the Fraser government's subsequent investigation.
We now know from the documents revealed in the Sydney Morning Herald that Australian officials were aware in October 1975 and subsequently that Indonesian troops had entered East Timor and, indeed, that the attack on Balibo was orchestrated by the Indonesian military. Yet, in spite of this, the 1976 Taylor inquiry merely reported denials of Indonesian military involvement in the attack on Balibo. Mr Taylor, and other officials—including, presumably, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Peacock—knew that these denials were lies but they did not dispute them publicly and a seriously deficient and misleading report was tabled in this parliament.
Some 23 years on, today's report has not taken us very far in understanding what 
 happened at Balibo. We may never know the whole truth but no-one can say the case is closed. This has been a running sore in our bilateral relationship with Indonesia. Together with the broader issue of East Timor, it has been a cancer which has eaten away at the bilateral ties successive governments have worked so hard to build. It has been of enduring concern to the relatives of the deceased. A satisfactory resolution of the matter is very long overdue.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>East Timor: Deaths of Australian Based Journalists</title>,Ministerial Statements,4,1
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,1999-02-16,"—From the cradle to the grave, the GST will tax every Australian every day of their lives. It is not supposed to start until July 2000 but already we have evidence of its being applied. It is not yet law. It has not yet passed the Senate. It is not due in terms of legislation to take effect until July 2000, yet it is being applied to funerals in New South Wales as we speak.
Make no mistake. This is a death tax—nothing more, nothing less. We have a gentleman in Newcastle who is paying for a prepaid funeral an additional $304. This is real, this is happening, but what do we get in this House today? What sort of reaction do we get to this contract and the evidence of $304 GST applied at the full 10 per cent rate? We are told by the Minister for Aged Care—the compassionate face of the Howard government—that she posted a letter to the Treasurer. But has the Treasurer taken any action? Of course not.
Why has this occurred? Is it because the funeral director is unscrupulous or making profits? No, the Funeral Directors Association has been advised by the Australian Taxation Office that this can be applied. This occurred in January. They told the Funeral Directors Association that its members should charge the full 10 per cent GST.
Keep that figure in mind: not the three per cent that the Prime Minister mentioned, not the four per cent that the Prime Minister mentioned—the full 10 per cent without any of those cost reductions that we hear about from the government in this House day after day. No costs were passed through when this calculation was made. This very day, when the ATO hotline was rung, what were we told? We were told that they did not know what funeral directors should be charging, so they should ask their accountant. They might as well ask their accountant because the Prime Minister cannot tell this House. The Prime Minister cannot tell this House: what are funeral directors the length and breadth of this country supposed to do?
Just how arrogant and out of touch can this government become? If the Prime Minister spent some time in the real Australia—around Newcastle, for example—instead of going to Norfolk Island or living in Kirribilli, he would know that every Australian knows that the 10 per cent will be applied without many of the benefits of the pass-through that this government is talking about. The GST will be applied in full in most cases. The cost reductions will not be passed through. The inflation effect will not be 1.9 per cent. When it comes into effect funerals will go up more than the three or four per cent that the Prime Minister is talking about. The evidence that we have in this House today is the 10 per cent on the contract that I have just shown the House. That is the evidence.
What does the government's own detail, which was provided to the public, say? It says that if you enter into a funeral contract after 2 December 1998 the total amount paid is subject to GST unless the funeral is before 1 July 2000. That is what the Taxation Office tells people. We know what the hotline is telling people, but we cannot get a skerrick of 
 commonsense from the Prime Minister or from the Minister for Aged Care. AAP reported that, on 8 February, a spokesman for the Treasurer, Mr Costello, said:
Anyone asked to pay the GST upfront should contact local fair-trading officials.
Fair dinkum! We did not get that answer in the House today from the Prime Minister or from the Minister for Aged Care—that compassionate face of the Howard government. She posted it to the Treasurer.
What are the fair trading officials doing about something that is illegal? What action is going to be taken to get this gentleman's money back and protected? Hundreds of thousands of Australians are affected by the approach of this government. Do not blame the funeral directors. Blame the government. Blame the minister. Blame the Prime Minister. It is not the fault of the Funeral Directors Association that the government are out there with their hands in their pockets every minute of the day. If the funeral directors are confused, we know why. This is the diagram and the advice that the ATO hands out—a spaghetti diagram that you need three degrees to understand. No wonder this is going on. What is happening is that Australians are being ripped off day in, day out.
It is not just funerals. This government is sneaking money out of the pockets of families and the elderly in 100 different ways. They are taxing people every which way. With this tax every step you take, every breath you take, they will be taxing you: when you are born, when you have the christening, at school on the textbooks and the uniforms and, finally, not just on your groceries but when you die. We have the evidence in this contract in the House. The bill is not yet law and yet it has been applied at the full 10 per cent rate. That is the advice that the ATO gave to funeral directors. No wonder in this country there is very grave suspicion and very grave concern about the application of the GST.
We have been raising many of these issues in the House, and what do we get from the other side? Arrogant sneers. When we asked a question in this House about the application of a 10 per cent GST to the fees charged by marriage celebrants, what did we get?
—Arrogance!
—Arrogance. They are completely arrogant and out of touch. Go and explain to the 42,500 couples each year in this country that have a civil ceremony that when they get married you are going to charge 10 per cent which you will not be charging for a church ceremony. Go and explain that to them. Go and explain how much in touch you are with the modern family. This government claims they stand for family values when in every action they take, every step they take, they rip families apart: the 10 per cent tax on food, the 10 per cent tax on clothing, the 10 per cent tax on funerals, the 10 per cent tax on everything they do.
Let us look at the latest example which has been teased out of the government. The government proposes to input tax rents. That is, if you rent an apartment or a luxurious house at Kirribilli or a luxurious house or a mansion at Sanctuary Cove you are only input taxed. That is, you do not pay the tax on your rent. But if you live in a mobile home park or a long-term caravan park at Caloundra or Maitland the GST is applied to your rent. Why is it that if an executive rents a mansion in Vaucluse, Kirribilli—dare I say it?—or Sanctuary Cove, the GST does not apply to their rent, but it applies to the most vulnerable in the community living in mobile homes and caravan parks?
You will rue the day that you put that through this House. Studies have shown that 43 per cent of the people living in caravan parks and in mobile homes are on incomes of less than $300 dollars a week. They are paying the GST. If you earn a couple of million a year and you are living in your company's leased mansion in Vaucluse, no GST. If you happen to live in a retirement complex and you are not in the nursing home or the hostel but you share the dining room facilities with someone who is from the hostel or the nursing home, you will pay the full GST but they will not. You will set Australian against Australian in our retirement villages, in our mobile homes and right around the country with this unfair tax.
How does the government justify an average price increase of three to four per cent for 
 funerals—the figure that was quoted today by the Prime Minister? They say that, because the price of videos, televisions and other luxurious items are going down due to the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, prices will go down, all the benefits will be passed on and we will end up with this magic pudding inflation figure of 1.9 per cent. That is an outright lie. It is simply untrue. It is not credible. Australia does not believe it. It does not take a great brain to work out that there will not be a 100 per cent pass-through of all the so-called benefits; that the 1.9 per cent inflation claim is nothing but an empty dream or, more brutal, very cruel propaganda.
The savings will not be passed on in full for a whole lot of legitimate and illegitimate reasons, one of which will be profiteering. So the 100 per cent pass-through that justifies the 1.9 per cent inflation rate is nothing more than complete fantasy.
So what will the government do about it? We heard the stories over Christmas. Costello was going to send in the GST police; he was going to have $10 million fines; there were going to be GST police all over the country making sure that the 100 per cent pass-through came through. Well, we have had some pretty bad news, haven't we? They are going to employ 40 extra inspectors to police the 1.4 million businesses in the country that are supposed to be passing on the benefits of reductions in the prices of items like televisions and videos. What a joke! And these people will not even start operating until 1 July. There will be 40 extra staff to cover 1.4 million businesses. For every business to be checked in a 40-hour working week, every compliance officer would have to be able to spend just 4.1 seconds policing each business.
How many minutes and hours have we spent in this parliament trying to get an answer out of the government about whether a GST applies to weddings, funerals and nursing homes? And we have not got an answer. But somehow 40 extra staff will come up with an answer and make sure that we will get, in this country, 1.9 per cent inflation out of a 10 per cent GST. Anyone who goes to the supermarket knows that that is just a nonsense. People on this side of the 
 House actually go to the supermarket, unlike those on the other side of the House, so we know that the price of groceries has been outstripping the inflation rate for years. But they have come up with 1.9 per cent.
The other great fallacy concerning the Costello GST police is that they are only empowered to go and find out whether reductions from the abolition of the wholesale sales tax have been passed through. They are not allowed to go out and find where the other benefits have not been passed through. They are not allowed to go out and ask whether the benefits have been passed through as a result of a reduction in the price of diesel. The GST police will not be looking at that. They will be looking only at the pass-through following the abolition of the wholesale sales tax. They will not even be looking for anything like the most significant element of the so-called pass-through.
What we do know—and organisations like St Vincent de Paul know it only too well—is that the pass-through will not be there. Low and middle income earners will be slugged. There is one thing about this government—you see it when you look at what they have done to people in mobile homes, what they are doing with weddings and funerals, what they are doing to retirement complexes—and it is very simply this: this government is very, very weak in controlling the strong and very, very strong in controlling the weak. They have produced a package which is bloodless for some but very bloody for others. All these battlers will be paying the full GST to fund the tax cuts for all the millionaires over there. Over half the tax cuts go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. Less than half are shared out amongst the bottom 80 per cent of income earners. Doesn't that just sum up so much of what this government does in so many policy areas?
Of course, St Vincent de Paul have blown the whistle on them. This is what they said in their submission to the Senate inquiry:
The assumption that the abolition of WST will directly benefit all Australians is false. Very little of what low income earners purchase is subject to Wholesale Sales Tax (WST). 

That is all the GST police will be following around—if they have any time. The submission continued:
Even on products which do attract WST, there is no guarantee prices will drop.
Here is the rub:
Experiences in New Zealand and Canada and information supplied by the St Vincent de Paul Society in both countries confirms a failure to estimate the real impact of a GST. In both cases the actual burden has been much higher . . . The transfer of wealth from the poor to the wealthy contained in the current proposals is unjust, inequitable and un-Australian.
That is why we can conclude that this government is very, very weak in controlling the strong. Look at the reluctance, as demonstrated in this package, to do anything about tax evasion! And it is very, very strong in controlling the weak. It has to be strong in controlling the weak because the whole tax package will create a slush fund for the government's rich friends. This government has only one favourite minority. It is not the unemployed, it is not people living in mobile homes and it is not the aged—it is the wealthy. There is one favoured minority—the wealthy—and you can see it written all over their tax package. St Vincent de Paul concludes their submission by saying this:
.	 54% of low income earners (40% of Australians) are in deficit;
.	 low income earners spend about 27% of their income on food and a further 34% on essentials, utilities, clothing, etc.
That is 61 per cent on food, clothing and the essentials of life.
A further 30% is spent on housing . . . 
Australians spend a far greater proportion of their income on the necessities of life, and, for that reason alone, to apply a figure of 1.9 per cent to the compensation package is obscene. This is a government which will give $400 a year to a pensioner, $340 of which they would have got already. So it means the only GST compensation for a pensioner will be $60 a year. That is not even enough for a tin of pet food each week.
They are basically robbing low and middle income earners to give tax cuts to their rich mates. They want to produce a package which 
 will change this country, which will overturn long-held Australian traditions, as the St Vincent de Paul Society has said, and make us a much more unfair and unequal community. Shame on you!

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—We have heard it all again—all the ranting and the raving that went on during the campaign, all the same old arguments that were trotted out before the last election in an attempt to make Australians think there was no need for tax reform. But, of course, the good, sensible Australian people are far more sensible than the Labor Party gives them credit for. The good, sensible Australian people saw through the bombast and the rhetoric. They saw through the misleading statements you have again tried to perpetuate that there was going to be 10 per cent on everything. That, of course, is an outright lie, and the Labor Party knows it. It is the same sort of stuff they were defeated on at the last election when they thought they could just trot out the lies that they did in 1993 when there was perhaps seen to be less need for tax reform as a whole than there was in 1996. The whole point of the matter is that the Australian people saw the need for tax reform.
Why did we need tax reform? We spent a long time telling the Australian people in the last election why that reform was essential. Basically, it is because there is far too great an imposition on middle Australia, ordinary mums and dads with kids who are paying an enormously high marginal rate of tax, and there is no prospect of it being lowered—only a prospect of it being increased—unless we have tax reform. Therefore, this government took the very courageous step of saying it was necessary to introduce a GST to replace the wholesale sales tax: the ramshackle tax of the Depression era, the unfair and expensive to administer sales tax—the sort of tax that puts tax on toothpaste but not on a toothbrush, that puts tax on mineral water with bubbles but not on mineral water without bubbles, and a tax that is a heavy impost on the motor vehicle industry. It is a tax that is just ramshackle and out of date. We said that we would put in place a goods and services tax 
 which would be a tax at the rate of 10 per cent and that we would have the minimum number of exemptions because that made it simple to administer and simpler for businesspeople to administer on a three-monthly basis.
One of the things that we made quite clear was that where there was an overt and necessary need to declare something GST free that would be done. The shadow minister across the table said that he had not been able to get answers on the question of how the GST would apply, or was it not to apply, to segments of the aged care section of the community. We made it quite clear right from the beginning—as clear as crystal—that indeed nursing homes and hostels would be GST free; no GST would apply. We similarly made it crystal clear that there would be no GST on health and that there would be no GST on religious services.
The matter being debated today dealing with the question of funerals was originally raised by Mr Morris and I said to him to send me the documentation and I could have a look at it. If needs be I would send it to the Treasurer and the Treasurer would deal with it. Following that, precisely what happened is that I rang Mr Morris's office on a number of occasions through my staff and we did not get anything at all until we got a press release. We got a single-page example of a prepaid funeral agreement. That agreement showed that that funeral director had quite wrongly put 10 per cent on the religious service. This, of course, was totally in breach of what had been said in the GST package that religious services were to be GST free. Accordingly, I forwarded the document to the Treasurer, and it is being sent to the ACCC to be examined.
There is room for transitional arrangements; of course there is. When we say we are going to introduce a new tax system to start on a particular date in the year 2000, of course there is the need for transitional arrangements, and that is precisely what we have put in place. For those people who want to enter into those prepaid agreements they may do so, and they may make reasonable provision for what the GST may be. The Prime Minister said the other day that indeed it would be less 
 than 5 per cent. If you look at the information that was provided prior to the election, you will see that, with regard to the area of activity within the community known as personal services, which includes the funeral services industry, it was expected that tax reforms would result in a reduction in industry costs of 5.9 per cent, on average. So it is quite clear that the transitional period can make that sort of provision, but not on religious services, for the simple reason that we said that religious services would be GST free. As I said, it was referred for that specific reason.
When we come to look at the total tax reform package, what the Labor Party is doing, in cahoots with the Democrats, is to deny the Australian people their $13 billion worth of tax cuts. What that tax reform package is giving to ordinary mums and dads, who make up 80 per cent of the taxpaying population, is that no taxpayer will pay more than 30 cents in the dollar as top marginal rate. That is what is being promised. That is what the Labor Party, with all the fluff and bombast and phoney fury that we just saw from the member for Lilley, is trying to deny the Australian people.
There was broad based acceptance that this country needed tax reform. If you take a look at the figures, we have a current income in this country of in the vicinity of $144 billion. About half of that is raised from PAYE taxpayers, pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. We immediately transfer out of that $69 billion or $70 billion around $54 billion in transfer payments for social security and social welfare payments. If we are going to be able to go on and afford to pay for those things which we need in our community—because we believe that individuals are entitled to have a standard of living that comes with dignity and that is why we have those programs—and if we as a nation are going to be able to afford them, we need to reform our tax system so that we are no longer putting the burden on that middle income range of mums and dads with kids who are struggling to make ends meet.
When we first came into power, the first thing we had to do was get rid of that hidden 
 $10 billion black hole that had been left behind by Mr Beazley and his government of the day. We had to bring in cost-cutting measures in the most equitable way that we could so that we could put the country on a decent footing. We did it. We have brought down mortgage rates. We have put the fundamentals in this country in a sound position, and that has allowed us to be able to be a sound performing economy in a region where the economies of our neighbours have collapsed.
If we had not had a change of government and if we had not taken those strong decisions, this country's plight would be like that of our neighbours. The sensible Australian people saw that Mr Keating was not the man to lead us as a nation towards the next century. The people saw that the policies that we offered were sensible. They saw the things that we offered by way of compensation to offset the effect on people who will not enjoy the full benefit of tax cuts—the four per cent increase in pensions, not after the impact of the one-off inflationary effect of 1.9 per cent has been felt but up-front so that people can be cushioned against it. At every turn care was put into ensuring that equity lay in the tax reform package.
As we see in the Senate inquiries that are going on, there is an absolute attempt by the Labor Party and the Democrats to try and call witnesses which show doom and gloom and promote fear and loathing. That is the problem with an opposition that does not have any policies of its own. The only one it could offer at the last election was to increase the reach of the capital gains tax to affect those assets which have been grandfathered and were free of capital gains tax—the things that ordinary folk had inherited from their parents and the like.
The good, sensible Australian people saw that the opposition had nothing to offer, that its policies were bankrupt. And nothing has changed, except that we have had Mr Tanner and also the member for Werriwa come out and say, `Here is a plan we have; here are some ideas. Let's debate them.' But they are certainly not the ideas of the members of the frontbench of the opposition where they are 
 still looking at the trade union solutions, the trade union blight.
Opposition members interjecting—
—I think we've seen lots of evidence.
Opposition members interjecting—
—The member for Banks.
—The only thing that is dying around here is the trade union movement. That's dying. I guess that is why we have so many ex-trade unionists in here; they are about to lose their jobs otherwise.
The long and the short of it is that we have introduced a fair tax reform package. We have introduced it right across the board. We have made provision for transitional arrangements such as the question of prepaid funerals, a difficult issue but nonetheless one that was addressed. To use scare tactics, fear and loathing—as the opposition is trying to do—to try and make older people fearful, to try and make older people think that there is something that is going to be difficult for them to handle when there isn't is, quite frankly, disgraceful. They are the sorts of tactics that they use because they have nothing to offer themselves—no policies, no imagination—except for two people on their own who are now becoming pariahs in their own party for daring to go against the sort of rhetoric and bombast that is being used by the other members of the frontbench.
Mr Melham interjecting—
—The member for Banks will be silent.
—The policies that we have put in place will allow compensation for the tax reform to take effect by way of $13 billion worth of tax cuts, by relieving the pressure on ordinary mums and dads who are now being taxed as if they were rich. That was the legacy of the Labor Party. It did not care about ordinary folk or the pressures on them and the fact that they were creeping slowly towards paying the top marginal rate.
We have allowed for 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers to pay no more than 30 cents in 
 the dollar top rate of tax. That, I have to tell you, is a tremendous accomplishment. It is a vote of confidence by the Australian people in the policies of this government and a vote of damnation for the rhetoric of the opposition, who failed to convince the Australian people with the rantings and ratings that worked for them in 1993. The simple reason is that, when we look at the balanced nature of the tax package, it does in fact remove those imposts of income tax and gives people more choice as to how they spend their money, and it replaces the ramshackle wholesale sales tax, introduced in the Depression era as a temporary tax. It had outlived its usefulness by many decades. We found, very simply, that we had a winner. The sensible Australian people voted for this government. We are determined to see that tax package put in place and to see fairness return to our tax situation.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Funerals</title>,Matters of Public Importance,5,1
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-02-16,"—Yesterday, in response to my question about the cost effect on funerals of the coalition's GST flat tax, the Prime Minister said two things. He said that members of the Labor Party had falsely claimed the GST would increase the price of funerals by 10 per cent, and he surprised many of us by saying that the cost of funerals would increase by less than five per cent. Today, in response to a question from the member for Lilley, the Prime Minister said his latest advice was that the increase in the cost of funerals caused by the GST would be three to four per cent. Perhaps if we keep asking questions on this matter, the funeral industry will become zero rated!
As far as I am aware, this matter arose last week when the member for Newcastle took up the issue of a Newcastle funeral director charging 10 per cent GST on an existing prepaid funeral. As I understand it, the job of members of parliament is to raise issues raised by their constituents. I can quite understand why the honourable member was offended by the Prime Minister's implication that he, the member for Newcastle, had made a false claim.
The member for Newcastle was simply raising the contract that one of his constitu 
 ents had been forced to pay. The contract was charged at a full 10 per cent GST, not simply on religious services but on all the services. I urge the Minister for Aged Care, at the table, to go back and read the contract. She obviously did not understand it. Anyone who makes claims about expertise in small business, as the Prime Minister does, would understand that any theoretical advice he is getting about the reduction in the costs of funeral charges will not match up to the facts on the ground. Slippage, inadvertence or greed will mean that there are more likely to be contracts like the one cited by the member for Newcastle than the arcane modelling theories or wishful thinking being advanced by the Prime Minister's advisers.
The minister's claim today that the contract that the member for Newcastle had referred to was only on religious services is simply wrong. She should go back and have a look at it. This is not a problem of one `out-of-control' funeral director, nor are Australian funeral directors in general responsible for this problem. The coalition government is responsible for this problem. I have another prepaid contract from a leading South Australian funeral director who is already advising people seeking prepaid funerals that they can charge clients GST. As the member for Newcastle explained last week, the funeral directors are basing their actions on advice from the Australian Taxation Office. The advice explaining GST transitional arrangements was issued as a result of a statement by the Treasurer on 2 December 1998 that all previous transactions would be exempt from GST, whereas transactions entered into after that date would be taxable. The advice, which extends to six pages, specifically indicates on page 5:
If you enter into a contract after 2 December 1998 for a funeral, all the amount paid is subject to GST (unless the funeral is before 1 July 2000).
Of course, the problem is that people pay their prepaid funeral contracts not knowing whether they will die before 1 July 2000.
At the Senate GST inquiry held in Melbourne on 12 February, the funeral directors said, just as the member for Lilley stated in his remarks earlier, that they had been advised 
 by the Tax Information Hotline that their members should include the GST component now and should be charging families 10 per cent or more. Quite understandably, the Funeral Directors Association said they were concerned that they were being asked to collect a tax that had not yet been enacted, and the association counselled its members to ignore the tax office advice. The inquiry was told that the GST would apply to funerals that occurred after 1 July 2000, including those prepaid after 2 December 1998.
I have the Taxation Office's written advice here. For the coalition's information, it is Australian Taxation Office fact sheet No. TGST003. It says:
If you have entered into a contract before 2 December 1998 for a funeral, then any payments you have made or will make will be GST-free until the earlier of:
.	 an opportunity for review of the price arises before 1 July 2005, or
.	 1 July 2005.
If you enter into a contract after 2 December 1998 for a funeral, all the amount paid is subject to GST (unless the funeral is before 1 July 2000).
This is written advice, Minister, from the Australian Taxation Office—your Taxation Office, your government.
People in a time of grief want nothing less than to be haggling about whether they should be paying an extra government tax. This advice may put some people in the Kafka-esque situation that, if they prepay a funeral after 2 December 1998, but die before the implementation of the goods and services tax on 1 July 2000, their families may need to enter into negotiations with the funeral directors to reimburse the GST the funeral director has put aside for the government. It may be even more complicated. The moneys are prepaid and deposited in trusts. If there is any doubt about how widespread this problem is, the minister should be aware that there is $600 million in prepaid funerals in Australia.
This advice from the Australian Taxation Office is still on the Internet today—not yesterday; today. Nowhere in this advice does it say that funeral directors should reduce the cost to customers by savings or offsets to inputs. 
Moreover, according to the Adelaide Sunday Mail, not only is the Australian Taxation Office giving this advice but the Treasury confirmed that prepaid funerals would be back-taxed if the person died after 1 July 2000. Let me quote that article:
A spokesman for the Department of Treasury in Canberra said: ""If someone enters into a pre-paid funeral now, there's a good chance they'll die after July 1, 2000—
Isn't that nice?
and they'll be up for a GST charge"".
It is estimated the average family would be slugged an extra $500 on a standard funeral costing $5000. Some funeral directors had started including GST charges in prepaid funeral contracts.
The retrospective tax has outraged the funeral industry, with the Australian Funeral Directors' Association slamming the move as ""crazy"".
Crazy! There are powerful reasons, Minister, why the government should rethink this policy. They are best outlined by Mr John Ryan in his submission to the Senate GST committee. I will read a brief excerpt from his submission. It says:
. . . we have requested advice if the GST is applicable to the original agreed amount ($5,000), the amount paid to the funeral director by the financial institution ($7,500) or the market value of the funeral ($8,000). We requested confirmation of a statement from a representative from Treasury, who was originally unsure of the answer but finally stated that $7,500 was the appropriate amount, and determined to be full consideration for the funeral. Does this amount include the GST component or can a funeral director pass the GST on to the estate of the family? In practice, this second round of collection from the estate may be difficult and time consuming due to finalisation of the estate. This would have an effect on the total consideration paid for the funeral and the date on which the consideration was collected.
AFDA was advised by the Tax Information Hotline just as they outlined. The submission continues:
It has to be emphasised that this is a problem for our members NOW as they are currently writing prepaid contracts and require clarification as to how the contracts need to be worded and costed to be fair and equitable to all parties.
Our members need to be informed of the appropriate procedures NOW not in six to 18 months time.  

The old and unfunny joke about there being only two certainties in life, death and taxes, has now an even more painful truth to it. But what more could we expect from a government whose capacity to draft legislation is more reminiscent of Groucho Marx than of Sir Robert Garran?
The Groucho Marx clause in the GST legislation will allow the government to deem the value of any good or service according to their fail-safe clause. It is like the famous scene between Groucho and Chico. The government in the form of Chico, and Groucho, in this case an unsuspecting electorate, are negotiating a contract for an opera singer. Groucho cites the first clause to Chico: `The party of the first part will remain the party of the first part.' Chico responds, `I no lika that clause', and Groucho says, `Scrap that clause', and so on all the way down the contract.
—That's not very sound, is it?
—Minister, why don't you have a look at section 155 of the GST bill—as Robert Macklin, one of your former advisers and a highly respected prime ministerial press secretary, explained in the Canberra Times  last week? Because of the lack of time, I will be happy to table the document or I will send it over to you.
I conclude by saying that the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance and Administration need to take this matter out of the hands of the Minister for Aged Care. This shemozzle with the GST and funerals will occur with other services. The whole issue should be dropped. I seek leave to table the document.

"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—It is obvious that the opposition certainly does not have any policies when they have to resort to Groucho Marx to provide their policies. The Labor Party does not understand small business. This MPI shows just how little they understand about small business and how it works. They have no policies, they have no directions, so the only thing they can resort to 
 is scare tactics—scare the elderly, scare the vulnerable and don't worry about the facts and don't worry about what we as a government are achieving for Australia: the benefits to our economy, the benefits to small business, and the benefits from the decrease in unemployment.
Who sets the prices now? When we walk around the supermarket or go to the general store, who sets the prices now? There is no big watchdog there. No-one says that that particular item will be X dollars and cents. I know, because I ran a general store and we used to look at our costs—what it cost to run that business, what it cost to get that product onto the shelf to provide for the customers. When we worked out what it cost for us to provide that good, we then set a price which we felt was competitive and fair to the consumers in our community. That is what happens now; that is what will happen after the GST is introduced. Businesses will look at the cost to them—what it costs to get that particular good onto the shelf.
In many cases, those goods will be cheaper. The costs of transport, fuel, vehicles and running businesses will be less, so to get that product onto the shelf will cost less; so, in many cases, the cost to the consumer will be less. That is exactly what will happen in all industries because it is a competitive economy in which we live. If you go into one particular store and find a product that is far dearer than at another particular store, you will soon realise that that shop is not being competitive and you will go to the cheapest supplier of that good or service.
I have an example of how business operates now and how it will operate after the GST is introduced. This will apply to all businesses, including funeral directors and other businesses. I have here a letter which was written to me by a constituent during the last election campaign. That was a highly emotive election campaign which was filled with mistruths and outrageous scare campaigns from the Labor opposition which were not based on facts. This constituent, who is an electrical contractor, was so concerned that he wrote me this letter. He said:
Dear Jim
Just a short note regarding an ad being run currently on television by Kim Beazley, in short it refers in a derogatory tone that ""even a visit by an electrician to repair your stove will attract a 10% GST"", you may find the example below interesting, i.e. to call and replace a common electric hot plate in a domestic stove, this would be typical invoice.
He then shows that, under the current system, to supply one Stokes catalogue element the cost would be so much, the mark-up would be 25 per cent, the sales tax 22 per cent, and the minimum labour charge would be $45. The subtotal would be $134.47. So the total before GST was $134.47.
He then shows the costs with a GST. He sets out the price in the catalogue for the part, which would be $60.87—the same as before. The mark-up would be the same, at $15.21. There would be no sales tax at all. There would be the same minimum labour charge of $45. That would be a subtotal of $121.08. Add on the 10 per cent GST of $12.11 and the total would be $133.19. That means that it would have been over $1 cheaper with a GST to have the electrician service that part on your stove. This is the point we are trying to make. This is the point that we cannot seem to get through to the Labor Party because they see it as some cheap electoral advantage to run scare campaigns.
Opposition member interjecting—
—The member opposite interjects and says that we are talking about funeral directors. The example would be exactly the same. The funeral director has costs now that will be cheaper with a GST. The fuel costs, the vehicle costs, the costs of running his business will be cheaper. That will be reflected in the final cost of the product.
Protections will be put in place against people who may try to rip off the community with the GST. The government is aware that most small businesses will do the right thing, but there are always people out there in the community—luckily, a minority—who will try to profit from change. With the transition to a new tax system, there is at the moment legitimate community concern regarding the 
 possibility of consumer exploitation and excessive profit taking.
With the measures designed to counter this, the government will legislate to provide the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission—the ACCC—with special transitional powers to formally monitor retail prices. They have allocated $27 million in the budget to provide the ACCC with the resources to monitor those prices. One of the most important things to recognise is the fact that we live in a competitive economy. Our economy is based on free trade and competition. We are all consumers. We all go into the marketplace and buy goods and services.
The Australian community looks around for the best prices. We may get an electrician who says, `Fine, I can get away with adding 10 per cent GST on to my price. I can get another 10 per cent and put it in my pocket.' But there will be another 20 electricians in my community who will say, `I can now become more competitive. I can actually drop my rates and get more business because I am competitive.' That is what the whole economy is all about. But the Labor Party—full of union officials—do not understand what the economy is all about. If we drop the price of running businesses, we can make the cost of doing business cheaper and we can provide more competition for communities.
This is the last major reform that this government has to put in place to continue the reforms of the Australian economy. This economy has, I believe, been described as the miracle economy of the Asia-Pacific region. It is the fastest growing economy anywhere in the world. The Labor Party do not want to know this. They do not have policies to put forward. They just run with scare campaigns.
I get out in my electorate and I talk to the young people and I say, `Grab this opportunity with both hands and make the most of it.' We, as a government, have created opportunities for millions of young people in Australia that they have not seen. They suffered through 13 years of Labor, who dragged this country down. We have created the lowest interest rates in about 30 years. We have virtually no inflation and we have an economy growing at five per cent. We have small 
 businesses where optimism is at the highest levels that we have seen in a generation.
All the Labor Party want to do is try to hold this country back. They will not allow us to put our reforms in place; they will not allow us to get on with the job of making this country strong. That is what being in parliament is all about or what it should be all about. Instead of being negative and trying to block sensible reforms that the government is putting in place, they should be joining with us and supporting these reforms. A typical example is the unfair dismissal regulations that we put in place which the Senate now wants to reject. That is going to cost up to 30,000 jobs. The Labor Party want to block youth wages. They want to destroy the hopes of young people.
The Labor Party do not have any direction, they do not have any policies, so they have to resort to the disgraceful scare tactics of scaring the old and the vulnerable in the community by talking about the increased cost of funerals. Why do they not base their argument on fact and not on scare campaigns and lack of policies? The government is getting on with the job of making this country strong. The tax reform package is the last great reform that the government has to put in place to keep our economy moving forward. (Time expired)
—Order! The discussion has concluded.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Funerals</title>,Matters of Public Importance,5,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-02-16,"—I guess one would imagine that the government is hoping for third time lucky with the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998 . This is indeed the third time that I have spoken in the House on this issue. While I have had cause to compliment and encourage the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation on his capacity to get a move on with some of the superannuation bills that we need through this Parliament in a timely manner, I am afraid that he has been sold the dummy in relation to this bill. Labor and many others interested in superannuation issues have demonstrated that this bill, which gives employers control over where their employees' superannuation contributions go, is a flawed bill.
It lacks support from just about everybody who matters when it comes to superannuation. Let me indicate to the House at the outset that we are opposed to this bill and we will be moving substantial amendments to, at the very least, improve its operation. I ask the minister to seriously consider Labor's amendments. They are based on sound reasoning; they are based on a mountain of supporting evidence; they are based on argument from people who know superannuation and who know national savings policy.
I hope the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation will treat Labor's amendments with more respect than his predecessor, the Assistant Treasurer, who tended to engage in instant dismissal of our proposals without consideration, without debate and therefore putting us in the situation that we are in where this bill comes before the House for a third time. They say you learn from experience, that you learn from your mistakes, but not this government.
This bill was first introduced as schedule 5 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill back in December 1997. At the time, we pointed out that, because this was the biggest, the most significant and perhaps the most potentially damaging change to superannuation since the superannuation guarantee was introduced, it was worthy of its own separate bill. But the government did not listen and rammed the bill into the Senate.
It then realised that it would have to excise choice of fund when it became clear that the choice provisions were of major concern to all parties in the Senate, including indeed some of the government's own members. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) had the government's savings rebate in it which, as honourable members might recall, was the government's preferred mechanism for delivering Labor's co-contribution policy. It was indeed the centrepiece of the 1997 budget.
The savings rebate is dead. It lasted all of six weeks before this government abandoned it. So here we are again debating choice. It is worth mentioning that the background to this was Labor's superannuation co-contributions. At the time we came forward with the superannuation co-contributions policy, we had people like the Treasurer complaining bitterly that this represented abandonment of the l-a-w tax cuts. But what has this government done? First it did not deliver on Labor's co-contribution to superannuation, therefore damaging superannuation and retirement incomes. It converted them in part into the savings rebate and then abandoned the savings rebate after just six weeks. That money has now disappeared altogether into GST compensation. What a fraud that is.
The second time we debated these provisions was in May of last year. Again, Labor raised concerns about prudential regulation, commission based selling, default fund arrangements, education, year 2000 compliance, third line forcing, protection of members' retirement incomes and a host of other flaws with this bill. It was not just members of the opposition who raised these concerns but also superannuation experts and people involved in the savings industry.
Again, the choice bill went over to the Senate and sat there. The Assistant Treasurer could not get it on the list of bills to be debated. Probably he knew that he did not have the confidence of the Senate concerning this legislation. So here we are again. It may be third time lucky. Still the government does not get it. In its legislation it claims it delivers choice. It actually delivers potentially disastrous outcomes for retirement incomes and it does not have any support. So why does it continue with this flawed bill? Is it because it has given a promise to certain vested interests that it is going to deliver choice of fund by hook or by crook?
There is a mountain of evidence condemning the government's choice bill, just as there is a mountain of evidence condemning the Prime Minister's code of conduct, the standards he has set for this parliament, his record of keeping promises, and the like. That integrity and those promises are in tatters in the eyes of the Australian public, particularly the seven million workers who have superannuation accounts; for example, the low and middle income earners who have to pay the superannuation surcharge tax because they have not given their tax file number. Even if they have given their tax file number, they have to pay the administration fees and charges as a result of the clumsy, bizarre collection mechanism which this government has implemented.
The government claimed that it would not introduce any new taxes or increase any existing taxes. The Treasurer suggests that he has not increased existing taxes, yet his own officer—Mr Greg Smith—revealed before the Senate estimates committee last week that the government had increased an existing tax— 
 the contributions tax on superannuation. So the Treasurer's promises are in the same state of repair as the Prime Minister's.
One promise that the Prime Minister did not make to the electorate but has decided to implement all the same is a promise to completely undermine superannuation as a savings vehicle. This superannuation choice bill is part of that agenda. It is going to result, if passed—it will not be—in lower retirement incomes for thousands of Australian workers and consequently in lower national savings.
The last time I spoke on this bill, I pointed out that in the 1998 Budget Paper No. 1 at pages 2 to 5, we had some measurements of household savings ratios as a percentage of GDP. I pointed them out to the House because they are quite alarming. They indicate that for 1996-97 the household savings ratio was 4.7 per cent. The estimate for 1997-98 was 3¼ per cent and the estimate for 1998-99 is just 2¾ per cent. So household savings as a percentage of GDP are falling, not rising.
With public debt at the second lowest level in the industrialised world, just as it was when Labor left office, Australia does not have a public savings problem, but we do have, and have had for some time, a private savings problem. That private savings problem lies at the heart of our foreign debt worries, our structural problems with the current account deficit, and so on. Household savings are falling, yet the government has been making irresponsible decisions concerning superannuation, ringbarking Labor's superannuation tree and jeopardising our future retirement incomes, wealth and prosperity in the process. The single most irresponsible decision this government made was its abandonment of Labor's superannuation co-contribution scheme which would have meant we had a combination of employer, employee and government contributions growing eventually from the nine per cent which it is scheduled to be in the year 2002 to 15 per cent. That is enough, on Vince Fitzgerald's calculations, to ensure that future generations of wage and salary earners would be able to retire on an income of around 70 per cent of preretirement levels.
That would have given us a world's best solution to that universal problem of providing a decent retirement income for an aging population but would also have translated, during the period to 2020, into an addition to the national savings pool of the order of $400 billion. Instead of that, we got that ill thought out, valueless, half-baked introduction of the government's savings rebate, less than half the cost of the co-contributions scheme, but still involving over $2 billion a year in government expenditure. That savings rebate, as I said earlier, lasted a mere six weeks and the government has still done nothing to promote national savings levels in Australia.
The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation said last week, when we were debating the  Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  in the Main Committee, that the tax package is going to boost national savings. He would be somewhat embarrassed if he were aware that, on the same day he made that claim,  Treasury officials were conceding the exact opposite. If the minister were to check the transcript of proceedings in estimates, he would be embarrassed to learn that the assumption is merely in his imagination.
Treasury admitted that no modelling had been done on the impact of the GST tax package on the national savings. They said that they expected the GST tax package to have a positive influence on private savings but refused to commit to its impact on national savings. Why wouldn't they say anything about the impact of the GST on national savings? You would have thought that was a pretty important matter. They know that either the tax cut bribes which are funded from the budget surplus that are used for consumption spending detract from the national savings pool or that we are going to see the GST tax package having a negative effect on national savings, regardless of consumption expenditure.
So if the government's Treasury advisers, those who were most intimately involved in the formation of the tax package, Dr Ken Henry and others, will not say what the impact of the tax package will be on national savings, then on what basis is the minister 
 telling the parliament that a GST would boost national savings? So we want to hear from the minister whether he has any evidence at all to support that claim that the GSTtax package will boost national savings. No doubt the Treasury officials who attended estimates the other day would be interested to learn of that evidence.
One policy which is certain to have a positive effect on national savings into the future—reducing government outlays and improving standards of living in retirement—is superannuation. Labor strongly favours superannuation as our preferred savings vehicle. No other area of savings policy can be harnessed to that great macroeconomic task of increased national savings facing the nation in the way that superannuation can. The point needs to be constantly made that superannuation is a good investment for working people—that is, if the government will stop undermining its value, stop dipping into the honey pot, stop coming up with harebrained schemes that undermine public confidence in superannuation, like the choice legislation before the House.
Most Australians anticipate that the industrial relations retirement savings will leave them with 60 per cent of their previous earnings. But a study done by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia shows that, with the nine per cent phased superannuation guarantee contributions and individual contributions, the end superannuation benefit after 35 years would be about 45 per cent of a person's average weekly earnings and 50 per cent after 40 years of savings. So the ASFA says that contributions not of nine per cent but of 15 per cent of an individual's salary throughout that person's career would be required to reach the 60 per cent target, and higher contributions are needed if the individual works for less than 40 years, as indeed many people now do.
ASFA's figures show that the only way to increase an adequate pool of savings for retirement, the only options you have, are through a substantial increase in the contribution of individual workers, or an increase in the federal government's nine per cent superannuation guarantee, or a reduction in super 
 annuation taxes and/or a better interface with Social Security to encourage voluntary savings. And ASFA, in particular through its chief executive officer, Philippa Smith, makes these important points in its blueprint for a national retirement income policy.
In terms of the level of the employer contributions required to generate retirement incomes of the order of these targets, ASFA considers that nine per cent of earnings will not be sufficient in most cases, that additional employer or employee contributions and/or government contributions and/or more favourable tax treatment are going to be needed if community expectations about incomes in retirement are to be met. That is the situation that confronts us as we examine this legislation.
Not only have the government failed Australians by abandoning Labor's superannuation co-contribution; they have also failed Australians by introducing the superannuation surcharge, which continues to be a major debacle. We had officials in Senate estimates hearings last week confirming that some 2½ years after the government introduced this policy the Australian Taxation Office is still to send out superannuation surcharge tax assessments to over 250,000 Australian taxpayers who did not provide their tax file number. What an extraordinary thing. Two and a half years later, over 250,000 taxpayers have not received those assessments. Undoubtedly, many of them are going to turn out to be low and middle income earners who will be assessed as having a surcharge tax liability because they did not give their tax file number to a super fund.
The choice legislation follows on the surcharge debacle. We have the government using public resources, creating untold uncertainty within the superannuation industry, creating uncertainty among working Australians and uncertainty among employers. Frankly, the government's treatment of superannuation makes the nursing home debacle look like a model of sound public administration.
—Rubbish.
—The minister interjects, but nothing I guess can make the 
 nursing home debacle seem like a model of sound public administration.
—Ask Warwick Smith.
—Indeed. Australia has a world-class retirement income system, notwithstanding the damage that this government has done to it. This was recognised by the World Bank. Back in 1994 it produced a report on retirement incomes policies, and it continues. The rest of the world is looking at Australia as a world's best practice model.
So why does the government want to change it? Basically, the government wants to undermine industry funds. Government, with the ideological blinkers on, believes that unions benefit from superannuation at the expense of, for example, some of the government's friends who want a slice of the superannuation action. That view is quite wrong. As no less a person than the former head of the MTIA, Mr Bert Evans, has pointed out, industry superannuation funds are not union funds; they are jointly operated on behalf of members by trustees representing both employees and employers. Industry superannuation funds operate on a not-for-profit basis. They have returned market leading investment returns to members. They have the lowest fees and charges in the marketplace. They are there to look after the members and the members' interests. Compared to banks or other vested interests who are trying to reap returns for shareholders, the industry funds are only there to look after the members' superannuation for the benefit of the members.
In our view, for the government to be deliberately seeking to undermine these funds is outrageous. People are sick of governments fiddling with superannuation policies. We in the opposition have learned that lesson. The government, however, has not. It has constantly changed superannuation since it came to office, to the detriment of confidence in the system. It was the former Liberal Party Federal Director, Andrew Robb, writing in the Bulletin before the last federal election, who really gave the game away for the Liberal 
 government and what this choice of funds bill is all about.
In his article, Mr Robb made all sorts of unsubstantiated assertions about union super funds—we can only assume he was referring to industry funds—and how they allegedly contribute funds to the Labor Party. Mr Robb is quite wrong, but he was not going to let the facts get in the way of a good story during the election campaign. Perhaps that is why he does not continue to be used by the Bulletin as a columnist. Whatever the reason, Mr Robb revealed the government's true agenda when it comes to choice of superannuation fund—a flawed agenda which this parliament should not support. For the sake of decent retirement living standards for working men and women in Australia, I urge the government to reconsider its choice of funds position.
The assault on superannuation does not stop with choice of funds. We have seen the government endeavouring to abandon award superannuation—to take away superannuation as an allowable award matter. That would mean that workers on low incomes—below $450 a month in some cases such as hospitality workers or textiles, clothing and footwear employees—will literally lose the three per cent superannuation payments and so on that they had been previously entitled to under their awards. It also means that, instead of having monthly or three-monthly payments from awards, you will get only the yearly payment that you are entitled to from the superannuation guarantee. Workers will be worse off as a result. Over the course of a working life, that could amount to around $16,000, or a couple of years worth of pension payments. So far as we are concerned, that is a substantial issue, and we are not supporting the government's moves.
Although the government is not prepared to admit it, removal of superannuation as an allowable award matter will also give the government a de facto choice of superannuation policy without any of the protections that workers currently have under the award system. As if that was not enough, the government has tried a sneaky way of getting choice of funds through, because it knows it has not got parliamentary support for its bills. 
 The government applied to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to vary awards by removing references to the superannuation funds. This was an attempt by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business to sneak his policy in through the back door—something the parliament knows that that minister is all too prone to do, as demonstrated by his involvement in the Patrick debacle and as demonstrated by his attempts to get the unfair dismissal issue through via regulations rather than through proper legislation in the parliament.
We have also seen the government endeavouring to increase the threshold for opting out of superannuation from $450 a month to $900 a month. This is a move that we also oppose. We think it will have a detrimental effect on workers with low incomes because they will have no access to superannuation in retirement. We have also seen the government endeavouring to undermine the Public Sector Superannuation scheme, closing off the scheme that Commonwealth public servants could join—to the detriment of Commonwealth public servants. That is also marketed as choice, although how the government expects to be taken seriously about choice when it closes off options available to public servants is remarkable.
On the issue of choice of fund in the public sector, I wonder if the minister is aware of what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration said during the debate on these couple of bills as they passed through the House. These bills are scheduled to be debated in the Senate this Thursday.
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—The minister ought to be aware—it is worth listening to, Minister—that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr Peter Slipper, let the cat out of the bag by revealing that the government's Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill will force defined benefit funds to close. I refer the House, and in particular the minister at the table, to what the member for Fisher said:
. . . the provision of choice does not sit well with an open defined benefit superannuation scheme. Under choice, if members could transfer in and out of a defined benefits scheme the members would be able to play arbitrage against the fund, which has the potential of significantly increasing the cost of the scheme.
So what the parliamentary secretary revealed was that this government's choice of fund legislation will effectively force the closure of all the defined benefit funds.
According to figures we have from the APRA, there are around 1,124 defined benefit schemes with 2.86 million fund members holding over $131 billion in assets. That is the extent of defined benefit funds in this country, and yet the parliamentary secretary said:
. . . the provision of choice does not sit well with an open defined benefit superannuation scheme.
That slip was one more nail in the coffin of the choice of fund bill. Already we have seen the major industry bodies calling on the government to review its choice of fund bill in favour of investment choice. Once the members of defined benefit funds realise what is in store for them, opposition to the bill will strengthen further. 
Let me point out to the House that the ASFA conducted a survey of fund secretaries back in November last year. It asked them about the government's proposed changes and the impact on their particular funds. The overwhelming majority of them indicated that the impact would be neutral, poor or unacceptable. Hardly any of them rated the proposal as good. When they were asked which change would most benefit fund members—choice of fund, which essentially is the government's model, or member investment choice, which essentially is the opposition's model—of the enterprise funds, 93.8 per cent preferred member investment choice. Of the public sector funds, 100 per cent preferred member investment choice. Of the industry funds, 93.8 per cent preferred member investment choice, and, of public offer funds, 100 per cent preferred member investment choice. You can see very clearly that the overwhelming majority of superannuation funds believe Labor's model to be superior.
There is no doubt that this government has undermined confidence in superannuation. The government has not been able to win the argument concerning the removal of superannuation from awards, and it has not won the argument concerning choice of fund either. When it occasionally enters into the argument, it says that choice of fund is going to drive down the cost of superannuation. All the evidence suggests otherwise. A survey of 354 superannuation funds by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes reported that the government's choice of fund model would lead to increased costs for fund members. That survey stated that 87 per cent of funds believe that choice of fund will increase fund administration costs by some 10 per cent and, alarmingly, about 10 per cent of the funds surveyed thought that costs would increase by up to 50 per cent.
We had the same view expressed by the witnesses to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation at their inquiry into choice of superannuation. All the witnesses from Towers Perrin, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and C+Bus Industry Fund said that superannuation funds' costs are going to go up after the introduction of choice, particularly in the areas of marketing, administration and legal costs.
It is also something that is going to disadvantage employers. They are going to score increased administrative costs. Even the government acknowledges this: when you look at the explanatory memorandum, you can see that that concession is made. That, from a government that has been promising small business a 50 per cent reduction in red tape.
The opposition remains convinced that the government's model will do nothing to improve the retirement incomes of working Australians. We do not think that people are in a position to make informed choices. We think they will be forced into products that are not appropriate for them and we intend, during the consideration in detail stage of this debate, to move a range of amendments that we think offer employees real choice of superannuation fund, not forced employer choice, which is what the government is offering. 
Our alternative model will provide for employee choice rather than the government's employer choice. It is a phased, two-stage approach, with the first stage allowing for member investment choice within funds. So funds with more than 50 members would have to offer them a minimum choice of three investment options based on low, medium and high risk return ratios or, if you like, capital backed, balanced growth options. This already happens in many industry and public offer funds and is referred to as `member investment choice'.
We are also concerned that, although the government's model talks about choice and says that employers must offer four different choices, there is no guarantee that those choices will not in practice be identical. So we want to make sure that employees get genuine choice. The second stage of our model does this: it allows employees to override award provisions that specify a superannuation fund, with the agreement of the employer. Employers and employees who negotiate a certified agreement or an Australian workplace agreement would be taken to have exercised choice, so they would not be able to opt out of those agreements. But, apart from that, we would have regulations drafted governing standard disclosure provisions applying to key feature statements offered by funds directly to employees, and we would have a simple comparison of fees, charges and fund earnings. In the event of a dispute between employer and employee, the Industrial Relations Commission would act as the independent arbitrator.
We will be moving amendments to this bill that are designed to give effect to our choice of fund model. If they are not successful, we are going to seek to amend the government's bill to make it less likely to undermine retirement incomes. That is not an idle concern on our part. It is a concern based on experience in Great Britain, for example, where workers were inveigled into choosing second-rate and third-rate retirement income products and, in some cases, they lost their savings altogether. It is a concern based on experience in Chile, where unfettered choice led to workers being persuaded to change from fund to fund on a 
 year by year basis with what amounted to bribes, gifts of various kinds—inducements—in order to change the fund to which they belonged. That is clearly to the detriment of superannuation and retirement incomes. Any way you look at it, superannuation is a form of deferred gratification. What was happening in Chile was instant gratification. We are not going to support that.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—In supporting this Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998 , without amendment, I propose to answer three questions: why it is being introduced, how the amendments are proposed to operate and when its provisions will take effect.
As to why this bill is before the House, the government is committed to increasing national savings, both public and private. The need to boost national savings is inherently linked to a thorough and effective retirement income policy. Without an increase in national savings, increased investment only comes at the cost of a higher current account deficit. Higher levels of a current account deficit are of major concern. Unemployment, for example, cannot be reduced on a sustainable basis without adequate investment. Unless additional savings are available, including from the public sector, the current account deficit cannot be reduced over time. The balance between domestic saving and investment will relieve constraints on economic growth and increase the standard of living for Australians, including the growing proportion of the population in retirement.
There is no doubt that Australia, like most other economically advanced countries, is about to experience significant demographic shocks. There have been many projections as to the demographic change that will take place in the first few decades of the new millennium. These projections all highlight the need to develop a retirement income policy that is sustainable. The demographic changes underscore the increasing need for Australians to make adequate provision for their own retirement. A rapidly ageing population, with the implied shortage of workers and the rapid increase in the number of 
 retirees, can have profound implications for the private sector and the amount of economic growth that can be expected in the future.
It may well be because of the age and service pensions that individuals have privately saved only modest amounts for their retirement. Even if new recipients of the age or service pensions are more likely to be just part rate, the cost to government of providing such pensions is still forecast to grow to some $18 billion in 1999-2000 as the retirement age population increases. Increases in life expectancy also threaten the retirement security of those who have saved on their own by forcing them to stretch their retirement savings over a much longer period of time and, of course, the private sector provides incentives for older workers to retire early.
From one perspective, we can attribute the ageing of Australia to a triumph of affluence and major advances in medical technology that have increased life expectancies and the quality of life for the aged. I believe it was President Clinton who suggested, in his 1998 State of the Union address, that a person born in 1998 might live to see the beginning of the 22nd century, that is, to live to the age of 102. Without changes to the current United States laws, these persons, for example, would be able to retire at age 62 and receive 40 years of benefits.
It is not necessary to project into the 22nd century to highlight the issue—it is an issue for us now. The question is: how does society pay for its good fortune in having a population that lives longer? This government is committed to a retirement income policy that provides encouragement for individuals to achieve a higher standard of living in retirement than would be possible from the age pension alone, but that also ensures that all Australians have security and dignity in retirement. This is being achieved in a number of ways, including by encouraging people who are able to save for their retirement to do so, particularly through superannuation.
The bottom line is that if we do not increase savings—if we do not provide choice to employees to enable them to make informed decisions as to where their contributions should be directed to take account of 
 their particular circumstances and to tailor their superannuation arrangements to suit their individual needs—in the long run the age and service benefits will fall far short of requirements. If current practices are sustained and there is no choice, efficiency or competition within the superannuation sphere, the public and private costs imposed by an ageing and longer living population will absorb a higher and higher share of our economic resources for the foreseeable future.
You could argue that all you need to do is increase the rate of economic growth and so increase the supply of resources available to the retiring baby boomers. This approach would increase the supply of savings to enhance investment and productivity growth, but we must accept that private saving has been trending downwards for the past few decades and we need to address why this is happening and how to reverse it.	Promoting equity and individual choice are features of the government's approach to retirement income policy. This bill implements one of the key initiatives in the 1997-98 budget and involves reform to give employees greater choice over the superannuation fund or retirement savings account to receive superannuation contributions made on their behalf by their employer.
The facilitation of greater choice of funds will enhance competition between superannuation funds and retirement savings account providers. This does lead to improved returns, more efficiencies and a reduction in fund administration charges. I am yet to understand how the opposition can suggest that it is going to increase fund administration charges over the long term. Fund choice enables employees to derive the benefits from a greater level of competition and the bill is designed specifically to significantly reduce the administrative burden on the employers by allowing flexibility in how choice is offered whilst still ensuring that employees have an effective choice of funds.
This bill is part of a number of changes designed to encourage private savings and improve Australia's retirement income system. Australia is not alone in facing this great challenge as it moves into the 21st century. 
 As I said, the elderly population will live longer, on average, and the numbers of elderly will rise. We must keep in mind the share of the budget to be spent on all other societal needs. This government's proposal has as its underlying purpose the increase in competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry. This will lead to improved returns on superannuation savings and thus increase the level of private savings.
I was not in this House on the previous occasions that this matter was debated, so I have no problem in turning to the question of how the bill will amend the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. The purpose of the amendments is to give employees greater choice as to the superannuation fund or retirement savings account into which a superannuation contribution is made. Where an employer makes a superannuation contribution which is not in compliance with the choice of fund requirements, the employer may be subject to a higher superannuation guarantee charge and the amendments provide employers with a range of options under which they could comply with their choice of fund requirements.
Choice works in the employee's favour. The opposition should give employees the credit for being able to choose from the offer of choice. Essentially, a new part 3A in the SGA Act will set up the choice of fund requirement. An employer will meet these requirements where they provide superannuation support or make contributions to funds chosen by the employee in accordance with the provisions. When there is no employee chosen fund at the time of the contribution, the employer may make a contribution to a default fund in order to satisfy the choice of fund requirement.
In summary, the contributions are made in compliance with the choice of fund requirements if they are contributions to a chosen fund or a default fund, contributions to unfunded public sector arrangements, contributions made under or in accordance with an Australian workplace agreement, contributions made in respect of an employee where the contribution is made under a state industrial award, contributions made under prescribed 
 laws made before 1 July 1999, contributions made before 1 July 2000 in respect of existing employees as at 1 July 1999 who continue to be employed—so the choice of fund requirements effectively apply to new employees from 1 July 1999 and existing employees from 1 July 2000—contributions made to the CSS or PSS before 1 July 2000, and contributions made in respect of existing employees where the employee ceases employment before 1 July 2000.
So, leaving aside the above—employees who are covered by workplace agreements and employees who are members of an unfunded public sector scheme, state award contributions or contributions for the benefit of an employee to a particular fund under prescribed law, and the more general circumstances—an employer will need to make contributions on behalf of an employee to either a chosen fund or a default fund.
The rules about chosen funds are as follows: only eligible choice funds may become chosen funds of an employee; a fund is a chosen fund if the employee has selected it in accordance with the choice processes which are set out in the act; a fund becomes a chosen fund two months after the employee provides the employer with written notice—or the employer may agree for the chosen fund to start earlier in time—and a fund becomes a chosen fund two months after an employer has accepted a written nomination from an employee for a particular fund to become a chosen fund. Of course, there are circumstances outlined when a fund ceases to become a chosen fund.
The bill also sets out the times when there will be a need for a default fund for an employee, and essentially that is during such times as are reasonable to allow the choice process to occur and the employee to choose a fund. So that is taken into account. What is also taken into account is the situation where an employee does not have a chosen fund and does not choose one when given the opportunity to do so. So, in effect, it is a matter of last resort.
The bill particularises default funds to the extent that they can either be the last fund or funds which the employer contributed in 
 compliance with the choice of fund requirements and to which the employer is still able to contribute on behalf of the employee. This can include defined benefit schemes or any eligible choice funds selected by the employer set out in the offer of choice to the employee. The chosen fund provisions and the default fund provisions complement each other in terms of the commencement of a chosen fund or the cessation of one without there being another chosen fund. That answers the question of how.
The next question is: when does an employer have to offer a choice? I have indicated to some extent when there is a chosen fund or default fund, and that effectively dictates when an employer must make an offer of choice to an employee. One of the new sections details the obligations for employers in the sense that it sets out what must be done by the employer to avoid having a period where there is neither a chosen fund nor a default fund for an employer. And, as I said, the outcome, if an employee makes a contribution during this period, is that the employer may be liable to pay extra superannuation guarantee charges.
As to the offer of choice, employers may use a number of options to do this: offering the choice of four funds or RSAs, providing an unlimited choice offer or negotiating a workplace agreement which includes superannuation arrangements. If an employee proposes a fund as a chosen fund and the employer accepts that fund for the employee, there is no need for the choice of fund offer and it is up to the employer as to whether they use limited choice offer or unlimited choice offer for each employee. It is up to the employer to use one method for all employees, or one method for some and another method for others. That would depend very much upon each employee's particular circumstances. There is a separate offer and acceptance of choice of fund by the employer of each employee, and choice works in the employee's favour. Again, I beseech the opposition to give employees the credit for being able to negotiate their own arrangements—workplace and superannuation. Give them the credit for 
 understanding the implications of a particular choice.
Under the limited choice offer an employee may select a chosen fund from a choice of at least four eligible choice funds, at least one public offer superannuation fund, at least one RSA or capital guarantee fund and one of either a standard employer sponsored fund, an exempt public sector superannuation scheme and an industry based superannuation scheme. That is genuine choice. Under the unlimited choice offer, an employee may select an eligible choice fund as the chosen fund.
The bill details the information which must be included in the offer and when and how an employee must respond to the offer. There are transitional laws relating to new employees and existing employees. Employers can continue to use the existing earnings base to calculate superannuation guarantee obligations even when employees choose to change funds. One other aspect of the bill which is worth noting is that it protects employers from the liability to compensate any person for loss or damage arising from anything done by the employer in compliance with the choice of fund requirements. So, if an employee selects a fund in compliance with the choice of fund requirement and the fund subsequently does not perform to expectation, the employer is not liable to compensate. But, of course, the employer is liable if they act outside compliance with the choice of fund requirements. Then there are the consequential amendments to the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.
The choice of fund arrangement is designed to give employees greater choice in and control over their superannuation savings, which is in turn designed to give them a greater sense of ownership of their savings. It allows them to choose the savings vehicle most suitable to their needs. The outcomes from implementation of this legislation—funded choice providing the competition—will ensure that superannuation arrangements are able to contribute to national saving over the longer term. As we come to terms with the dimensions of the problem of our chan 
 ging age demographics, that is a significant matter.
The opposition raised the issues that occurred in the United Kingdom and, of course, overlooked the number of significant differences between the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom and within Australia. There is a key feature statement which will be given to each prospective member of a fund under the choice of fund measure which will require full disclosure of fees and charges, including commissions, paid to a financial adviser or associates. This will allow employees to become aware of any circumstances of the adviser in terms of selling the product. As I said, employees should be given credit for being able to understand the implications of choice.
For the reasons outlined, and certainly so that the superannuation arrangements are able to continue contributing towards national saving over the longer term, I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—My colleague the member for Curtin has ably outlined some of the mechanics of the superannuation choice legislation and also its rationale. I want to direct the attention of the House to some of the remarks made not by members of the government but by independent commentators and by those giving evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on choice of fund, which reported in May of last year.
Choice seems to be a concept which strikes terror into the hearts of members opposite. They tend to take an intrinsically paternalistic view of their constituency, a kind of Big Brother approach which regards the vast mass of working Australians as basically lacking the competence or the will to take responsibility for their own financial future. That is not a view which those on this side of the House share. We have a view of working Australians which is a very optimistic view; a view grounded in respect for the ordinary working man or woman; a view grounded in possibility, in hope for the future, in a belief that they in fact are the men and women who have made, and will continue to make, this country strong.
On the subject of choice, I want to begin with the philosophical or intrinsic value of choice in government policy generally. I note the remarks of Leo D'Angelo Fisher in the Bulletin of 13 October 1998:
For most Australians, choice, control and flexibility are not benefits normally associated with superannuation. Since the introduction of the compulsory employer-funded Superannuation Guarantee Scheme six years ago, superannuation has been about someone else's decisions. Money is invested in predetermined refunds on employees' behalf towards a vaguely understood future of a financially self-reliant retirement. But change . . . is afoot. And the change is about choice.
That is a welcome change, a change that has perhaps been a long time coming but one which we in this chamber ought to encourage. On the question of choice, I note the evidence to the Senate committee provided by Mr Ken Lockery, who is the principal of consulting actuaries Towers Perrin. On the subject of choice, he said:
From our perspective, employee choice of superannuation fund is the sort of individual freedom of choice that one can readily associate with a democratic society such as that that we enjoy in Australia.
It may be foreign to the ALP head office in Sussex Street, which is used to dictating terms to ALP branch members, but we in the government take the view that Australians, to the greatest extent possible, ought to be able to make their own choices. Mr Lockery went on:
Furthermore, individuals are more likely to value and take an interest in something where they have an element of choice or control. For those reasons alone one could justify the introduction of a system giving far greater control of the choice of superannuation fund to individual employees.
That is a key element of this reform. It is not just an institutional reform; it signals a cultural change. Further evidence before the Senate select committee came from an exalted former member of this place, who stated:
Having instituted a compulsory environment for the collection of superannuation, the next step in the process is to say to people, `If the government is going to require you to contribute to your retirement income, surely it is not unreasonable that you should have some say as to where those funds go.' 

That would not seem unreasonable to people who believe in the virtues of commonsense, but apparently that virtue does not hold universal appeal in this place. Choice is critical to individuals' taking ownership of their own future and feeling a greater sense of connection with their savings, and that has an important practical consequence.
The consequence is that it causes Australians to begin to look earlier at the question of whether they have made adequate provision for their own retirement. This is a serious problem for us in this country. For too long we have taken the view that retirement is something you direct your mind to when you get to it. The problem there is that by then it is too late. I note the comments of Tony Feely, author of the BIS Shrapnel report Imminent retirees: A lifestyle study. In that report he notes that 65 per cent to 85 per cent of the population is unhappy with its preparedness for retirement and that most do not focus on the issue of financial self-reliance until four or five years out from their retirement. `From that point, they become groupies of retirement seminars, and voracious readers,' he says. But the problem is that, by then, it is too late.
By requiring employers to offer choice for new employees from 1 July of this year and for existing employees from 1 July 2000—and by the corollary of requiring employees to make a choice—this bill will direct the mind of the employee to the question, `Have I made adequate provision for my own retirement?' It is this secondary consequence of the bill, the cultural change, which I regard as its most important innovation. It was here that Stephen Child, Senior Manager of Technical Services with the Commonwealth Bank, testified before the Senate committee. He said:
. . . we firmly believe that, unless an environment is created where choice can be exercised, individuals will lack the motivation to understand the importance of retirement savings and how best to achieve their objectives for retirement.
This bill is powerfully and practically presenting employees with the motive to take control of their own financial future. From a purely clinical public administration standpoint, that is important for exactly the kinds of reasons 
 that the member for Curtin referred to. We simply cannot afford a mind-set in this country that says, `We work until we retire and then we take the benefit of a guaranteed pension at 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings.'
That sort of entitlement simply cannot be sustained in the face of the demographic changes which previous speakers have referred to. I note, for example, that in addition to President Clinton's remarks in his last State of the Union address the demographic fact is that one girl in three born in Australia today can expect to live to the age of 100. That is a startling demographic revolution when you think that in this century we have added 20 years of life expectancy for the average Australian. It is an unbelievable achievement in the vast spread of human history that in one century we can add 20 years of life expectancy for the average Australian.
The actuaries and the biologists tell us that in the next century we will add another 10 to 15 years of life expectancy. That means that average Australians can look forward to 40-plus years of retirement, and it is that fact that compels us in this place to take those forward looking steps that are necessary to ensure that the country is prepared to meet the retirement income needs of that vast group of Australians.
I return to this question of how we create the sense of urgency in employees, how we help them direct their minds to this question, where clearly to date we have not been doing enough. The member for Wills correctly referred to the inadequate levels of private savings in Australia today. It was FitzGerald in his seminal inquiry into savings in 1990 who observed that we were at about 17.5 per cent of GDP as our savings ratio but that we needed to move to between 22 and 23 per cent. In the eight years since FitzGerald handed down his inquiries, we have actually only improved the savings ratio as a proportion of gross domestic product by about 1½ to two per cent. So we are still about four per cent behind, and that does not include the deficiency that has added up in the last eight years. 
We go then to this question of motivation and of culture. That was referred to by Rosemary Vilgan, the Federal President of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, in her testimony before the Senate committee. She said that under the government's choice provisions:
. . . ownership by the members of their superannuation benefit, we believe, is likely to increase. That is, their sense of belonging and their understanding of their superannuation benefit is likely to increase. We believe there will be some benefits from competition in the industry and also that there are people in funds now which are not suitable for them, and those people should be allowed to leave those funds.
I will return to the second point in a moment, but I just underscore her belief, as the President of the Association of Superannuation Funds, that there is a sense of belonging and understanding of the superannuation benefit which is likely to increase. This dynamic beyond the efficiency and competition benefits was referred to in other evidence before the committee. John Maroney, who is from the Investment and Financial Services Association, said:
. . . the introduction of choice could have beneficial effects beyond compulsory minimum superannuation guarantee contributions and lead to greater voluntary contributions once people have a greater understanding of how much they really need to put away to save for an adequate level of retirement income.
What Mr Maroney is saying is that this bill will change the culture of Australian employees and that change of culture will have a positive impact on individual and thereby national savings. That is what we have to do. We have to get individuals thinking about it now so that they do not have the problem that BIS Shrapnel referred to, that Tony Feely referred to, of getting to the end of their working life and suddenly thinking, `What am I going to do about retirement?' This bill will cause them to start thinking about it on 1 July of this year and 1 July of next year, and that is a sort of revolution which we in this House ought to firmly get behind.
The member for Wills made some allegations, some darkly muttered conspiracy theories, about this government's motive for introducing this bill. I want to turn to some of 
 the public comment on those allegations, not from me or members on this side but in this instance from Daryl Dixon, who is one of the economics writers for the West Australian newspaper. He said on 13 May of last year that these sorts of concerns:
. . . have been used more to create a climate of fear than to describe the actual consequences of the introduction of the Government's legislation.
Mr Dixon said:
Freedom of superannuation choice, particularly among the range of funds prescribed in the Government's legislation, is required to protect employees from their employers, particularly the big employers who believe that they know best about how their employees should be covered for superannuation.
Again we see this twist of fate where Labor is, if you like, siding with the big employers against the interests of the working man and woman. Mr Dixon went on to say:
A great deal of the opposition to freedom of choice has come from employers with defined benefit funds, who have a vested interest in controlling their employees' superannuation funds. As legislation, the freedom of superannuation choice as proposed by the Howard Government contains a commendable prescription of funds for employees to consider.
It has been suggested by the member for Wills that this legislation is designed as an attack on industry funds. I note that industry funds constitute less than 10 per cent of the total superannuation fund pool, roughly $24 billion out of the $360 billion of available funds. I suggest that it is hardly worth the trouble of drafting a piece of legislation to target 10 per cent of those funds. I note as a commonsense response that the bill in fact compels employers to provide a choice of the industry fund if one is available. Rather than discriminating against the industry fund, the bill enshrines the principle that the industry fund must be offered as one of the four choices if such a fund is available. As Russell Mason from the William Mercer organisation says in the Business Review Weekly  of 20 April 1998:
If industry funds are performing reasonably well, members will stay with them. Those that adapt, those that look to the needs of their members, will grow. Others will fall by the wayside. And it is not 
 a question of size—there is no relationship between size and performance.
What you see is not a Big Brother, paternalistic, dictatorial policy on the part of this government. What we are offering employees is choice. We are saying, `Look, if your industry fund is spinning like a top, working like a dream, delivering the sorts of benefits that you expect, stay with it, and more power to you. But if in fact it is not delivering those benefits then you ought to be free to choose, you ought to be free to move, you ought to be free to put your money in a fund which is offering better performance.'
I note that in the other place Senator Allison further endorsed that proposition when she said:
But of course there are duds. Workers do need to be able to exit industry funds that are not performing.
Further, industry funds are not sufficiently portable. There remains the problem that moving from one industry to another too often results in moving from one industry fund to another.
What you see is not some sort of dark strategy of undermining one sector of the industry; what you see is a practical reform endorsed, in this instance, by Senator Allison as a need. She cites the startling statistic, in support of that proposition, that in a nation of eight million workers we have 18 million superannuation accounts.
In this age of increasing mobility in the workplace—and for that we ought to give credit and praise to the minister for industrial relations for his pioneering reforms to introduce greater flexibility into the labour market—it is no longer a case of people expecting to have cradle to the grave employment with one organisation. We in this generation have the opportunity to move from one industry to another and that is an opportunity which more and more Australians are taking up. We have to be able to move the person without having to create a new superannuation account, because one of the problems that causes it is this very large number of very lowly capitalised and inefficient funds. This change will allow us to produce a much more efficient industry.
In the couple of minutes remaining to me, I want to talk briefly—having touched on this question of culture, motivation and ownership—about the question of efficiency. I note that there was compelling evidence before the Senate committee on this subject. Tony Aveling, Acting Chief Executive of the Australian Bankers Association, said:
Lack of member choice is an important reason why competition and efficiency in this marketplace are not as strong as they should be. Allowing member choice of fund will increase competition between funds, it should enhance efficiency, and it will put downward pressure on costs and encourage rationalisation of the industry. This is important when saving for retirement, as a reduction in cost translates into higher returns, the benefits of which should compound.
So this initiative, this bill, is about higher returns to individual employees. Furthermore, on the question of efficiency you have the remarks that were offered by Mr Lockery, whom I cited earlier. He said:
. . . it probably is fair to say that we have definitely seen in the marketplace a lot of people looking at how they can improve their fund with the advent of choice coming. That is the offset to that. That is the case of somebody—particularly, say, employer sponsored funds—saying, `How can we make our fund more attractive to members? What can we do better?' In that sense, the mere threat of choice, if you like, is actually having some positive benefit in the marketplace. . .
This is a well considered reform. It is a reform that is timed for the moment. It is directed to the mind of the employee to give greater motivation, greater ownership, greater efficiency and higher returns to individual employees. It is an appropriate piece of legislation at the dawn of the next century, the next millennium, when, as the member for Curtin so rightly said, national savings must be at the forefront of our minds.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—in reply—I would like to thank everyone for participating in this debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998 , including the member for Wills, who made a fairly predictable contribution to the debate.
—It is my third time.
—As he points out, it is the third time that this bill has been debated before the House of Representatives. I would particularly like to thank the member for Curtin and the member for Parramatta for their contributions to this debate. A number of points that they raised focused on consumer choice. That is very much the focus of many of the things that the government is seeking to do or has done in its term in office. It is about giving consumers greater choice about where they should place their money, whether it be through investment or expenditure.
It is about consumer sovereignty—giving consumers sovereignty over their money, over the way that they spend their money, over the way they invest their money and whom they invest with. The choice of super funds legislation is focused on that consumer sovereignty. That is the focus of competition policy, that is the focus of consumer affairs and that is the focus of our tax package which is now before the Senate. It is about giving Australians greater choice.
The member for Wills suggested that my comments about the package before the Senate contributing to an increased level of national savings were incorrect. I challenge that. If you are providing $13 billion of tax cuts to Australian consumers—and to Australians generally, of course—you are, by that very nature, increasing national savings. If you are running surplus budgets, you are, by definition, increasing national savings because the government is no longer going out to the market, going to Australians and borrowing money from them to pay for our day-to-day debts. That is where the tax package before the Senate contributes to a higher level of national savings.
The second part of the equation is competition. Competition brings out the very best in a marketplace. I think even now the Labor Party would be prepared to cast aside the old rhetoric and agree—and be mindful of the fact that the Labor Party began the whole national competition policy program with the initial review under Fred Hilmer—that competition does deliver better results for consumers. There is a range of areas that prove that. You 
 just have to look at the level of competition in telecommunications at the moment to witness the fact that people—consumers—are the beneficiaries of greater competition. In this case, one of the most significant savings activities of individuals in the workplace is going to be their superannuation and we are saying that they, as consumers, investors and savers, should be given the choice of where their super goes.
And it is self-evident that we are going to see greater competition in the superannuation industry which will deliver better results for the people who are saving the money—the employees, the workers, of Australia. They have an inalienable right to determine where their savings should go because they are the ones who are going to have to live off those savings. We are giving consumers a choice about where their savings should go. We are empowering the people who are doing the yards to save money by giving them greater choice.
During this debate I have had the opportunity to consider a publication put out by Merrill Lynch, called Global Economic Trends. They point out that Japan will have the highest proportion of its population aged 65-plus by 2010. In Japan, 21.5 per cent—over one-fifth—of the population will be over 65 in 2010. In Australia, the number of people over the age of 65 is going to increase from 12.4 per cent, which it is at present, to 14.3 per cent by the year 2010—the baby boomer generation. That means that we are going to have more people over the age of 65 by 2010 than Canada, the United States, Poland, Russia, Argentina, Taiwan, Korea, Chile, Thailand, China, Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela and a number of other countries. That says that we need to start to increase our national savings.
So I urge the opposition to, in the first place, support the taxation package before the Senate. That is the first step. The second step is for the opposition to support empowering consumers—support any initiative which will give greater power to consumers to determine the fate of their savings. By supporting this bill we are in fact empowering consumers—hardworking, dedicated Australians, saving 
 their money through superannuation—by giving them the opportunity to decide where their hard-earned savings should go. That is a very crucial part of the policy platform of this government and that is why we are reintroducing this bill. We will be opposing the amendments. We have seen them before; they are no different. We will oppose them in consideration in detail. We look forward to this bill going to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-02-16,"—The Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  is an omnibus sales tax bill which deals with a number of separate areas 
 relating to implementing announced exemptions for space launch vehicles, payloads and other goods intended for launch into outer space, or to be brought back from outer space. It deals with remedying weaknesses in the provisions to prevent evasion of sales tax in the computer industry. It deals with Olympics related exemptions and seeks to close a loophole in the temporary importation provisions.
I will speak to each of those matters in turn. The first one is the space industry exemptions. In order to encourage the development of the Australian space industry, Ministers Costello and Moore, the Treasurer and the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, on 23 June last year jointly announced sales tax exemptions. In the course of the 1998 election campaign Labor pledged to honour those arrangements.
The following types of space equipment will be exempt from sales tax: space launch vehicles which can or are intended to be able to carry a payload into or back from outer space, payloads or other goods that a launch vehicle is to carry into or back from outer space, goods marketed as or for use as parts for any of the goods above and goods for use exclusively as raw materials in constructing or repairing space launch vehicles, payloads or other goods to be carried into or back from outer space.
I understand that these measures are necessary, as importation of the relevant equipment would otherwise attract sales tax liability, thereby threatening the viability of the proposed commercial activity. The cost to revenue is not quantifiable. However, it is argued that there is, in fact, no practical revenue cost associated with the measure as the activity would probably not take place without the exemption. This measure, we believe, will assist industrial development and, as such, we support it.
The second area is computer industry arrangements. To counter significant sales tax evasion, specific arrangements have been introduced for computer and related equipment. The Taxation Office advises that these are generally working well, however there 
 have been some deficiencies identified which this bill seeks to remedy.
The amendments cover three specific areas. First, aligning the description of goods with the revised customs tariff clarifications, which are technical amendments only. Secondly, increasing the maximum penalty for false declarations thereby increasing the disincentive to make such false declarations. That is an increase from $2,000 to $5,000. Thirdly, closing a loophole where goods falsely claimed to be exported—hence tax free—which are really sold for domestic use are covered by the arrangements. These proposals improve existing anti-avoidance arrangements and should be supported.
The third area is Olympics related exemptions. The amendments will provide an exemption from sales tax for accompanied baggage and personal effects and unaccompanied baggage and cargo imported by or on behalf of non-Australian Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic family members and delegations and participants in the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Paralympics and associated events. The exemption is not extended to goods for sale, alcohol or tobacco products, items of equipment which are more appropriately handled under the temporary importation provision including, in particular, high revenue potential items such as vehicles and digital communications equipment.
This proposal is similar to the exemption arrangements applying to official visiting international persons, for example, foreign military personnel. The tax office advises that the enactment of a separate regime for Olympics related imports is supported on administrative simplicity grounds; that there will be so many people involved that use of the temporary importation provisions would be too cumbersome. The measure is supported by the relevant ministerial council. It has the support of the New South Wales government. It is worth saying that the issue of special entitlements for Olympic officials is, in the present climate, a sensitive one, but these are not measures which would allow rorting of the Australian tax system and the measure is supported.
The fourth area is the temporary importation provisions. The 1997 budget contained an announcement to clamp down on exploitation of a defect in the temporary importation provisions. These provisions allow tax-free import of goods if they are to be subsequently exported within 12 months. However, a deficiency exists where the goods are subsequently reimported into Australia. The bill proposes to enact the 1997 budget measure to close this loophole. The proposed date of effect is from the time of the announcement, that is, 13 May 1997. While this policy ought to be supported, we are not comfortable with supporting legislation which is retrospective by almost two years. The tax office admitted at a briefing that the revenue effects of not making the provision retrospective would be negligible. I think the only example that they came up with relating to this provision was the importation of sailing vessels. So, while supporting the measure in principle as it is an anti-avoidance measure, Labor will propose that this provision be prospective in operation, that is to say from the date of the introduction of the bill. Accordingly, we will be moving an amendment which will change the commencement date of the provisions regarding temporary importation from 13 May 1997 to 10 December 1998.
This legislation refers to the sales tax regime and makes changes to the sales tax regime. The government has before the parliament proposals which would do much more than make these sales tax regime changes at the edges that are referred to specifically here. What it is, in fact, proposing to do is replace the wholesale sales tax regime in its entirety with the goods and services tax. It is my view and the view of other Labor representatives that this change will have very adverse effects on the Australian community.
The subject of the matter of public importance debate this afternoon was the effects of a GST on prepaid funerals. The effects on prepaid funerals as outlined in the matter of public importance debate are so dramatic I was reminded of the novel Catch-22 and the character Yossarian who decided that he was going to live forever or die in the attempt. I was encouraged to remember that by listening 
 to what is happening to prepaid funerals even before the GST legislation makes its way through the parliament.
I want to spend a little while discussing the issue of the GST's impact on charities. This is something that has been brought to my attention by a number of charities in my own electorate. The concerns that they have expressed are, I think, pretty substantial indeed. I want to draw to the attention of the House the concerns of Yooralla which operates, amongst other things, a special school for the disabled in Glenroy in my electorate. They have written to all Victorian MPs concerning the proposal of the federal government to change the wholesale sales tax regime and replace it with a GST. The letter talks about its impact on people with disabilities, the charitable sector and particularly the Yooralla society.
I point out that Yooralla is one of Victoria's largest disability support service providers and it touches the lives of up to 30,000 Victorians a year. It runs, as its letter sets out, a lean operation, and yet it provides services of unquestionable quality. Consequently, it is much valued by those whom it supports in its network. The costs of its programs are hugely more than its government funding revenues and the fragility this creates means that it is in no position to absorb the consequences of poor policy making at this time. Unfortunately, Yooralla goes on to say that replies to its past correspondence to government largely have been noncommittal or tend to restate the federal government's policy position asserting that, as a charity, Yooralla will be better off with a goods and services tax in place.
—I do not want to interrupt the member for Wills and I am sure we all have a great admiration for Yooralla, but this is a fairly specific piece of legislation and I am not quite sure of the relevance of what he is saying.
—Yes, although the title of the bill is fairly wide-ranging, I do think that the honourable member for Wannon has a point. Perhaps the honourable member for Wills could relate his comments more to the Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 .
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—As I was saying before the dinner break, the correspondence from Yooralla points out a number of issues. They say that the government has insufficiently considered the cost to an individual of having a disability and consequently has designed an inadequate compensation approach. They say that the government's intention to create competitive neutrality between the charitable and private sectors is based on flawed thinking and mistaken ideologies. They also say that capping the present fringe benefits tax concession will create a new cost burden on Yooralla that will jeopardise current levels of service.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I am reluctant to take a point of order but I take the same one that I took just prior to the break and that is the question of relevance. These are fairly specific bills and I do not think, much as we all admire the work of Yooralla, it has any relevance to these bills.
—I must say that I did not quite hear what the member for Wills said in his opening statement but this is the Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) and, although that is fairly wide, I think the honourable member for Wills should keep his comments more specific to the bill under discussion.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your guidance. I must say it is pretty distressing that a government that is prepared to spend $19 million of taxpayers money to present its view, at taxpayers expense, of the GST wants to come into this parliament and prevent the views of charitable organisations such as Yooralla, the Helping Hand Association, St Vincent de Paul and Anglicare being put in this place. I think that is pretty poor form on the part of the government to take points of order of that type.
The point I made by way of introduction to the correspondence from Yooralla was that this legislation is making changes to the sales tax legislation. In fact, as people in the House will be aware, the government has a broader agenda which involves dispatching the sales 
 tax legislation full stop and replacing it with a GST. It is against that background that I want to plead the case for the sales tax legislation, based on the impact that the changes will have on a number of organisations which operate in the charitable area, and which do very good work in that area and which are very concerned. They have gone to a lot of trouble to put their concerns to me and I dare say to many other members.
I have a specific interest in their concerns because of the fact that Yooralla is based in Glenroy in my electorate and the Helping Hand Association is based in Coburg in my electorate. St Vincent de Paul also has operations in Coburg in my electorate. So on that basis I have been concerned about some of the issues that they have raised. Yooralla indicates that administration of a GST will create additional costs for them which, again, will place current levels of service in jeopardy. They also say that to apply a GST to—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I take the same point of order again. We are talking about sales tax and the honourable member for Wills is going straight back onto GST, which has nothing to do with this bill.
—Yes. I do think there will be time in other bills that are coming up this evening for the honourable member for Wills to debate this. As I understand it, having looked at the bill, this is quite a narrow bill dealing with exemptions to do with the Sydney 2000 Olympics, the computing industry and the commercial space launch industry. I have to agree with the honourable member for Wannon that we are going fairly wide if we are going to have talk about the GST. There may well be opportunities on some of the other bills that are coming up this evening for the honourable member for Wills to elaborate on the area that he is now discussing. I ask him to come back to the fairly narrow confines of this bill.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your ruling. I do reiterate my concern that, effectively, the government is seeking to gag debate on the very important concerns being expressed by charities concerning these provisions.
As I indicated to the House by way of introduction, the four measures which the government is proposing in this bill are supported by us. But we have expressed the concern in relation to the temporary importation provisions that the government, having announced back on 13 May 1997 that they were proposing to close the loophole, took until December 1998 to introduce the legislation. We think this raises problems of legislation by press release, and we do not think it is good enough for the government to say back in May 1997 that they are going to do something and to then take until December 1998 to act on that. That is far too tardy in our view.
Given the advice that we have had that the amount of revenue which is at stake here is negligible, so that there is not really a question of cost to taxpayers involved, we think it is appropriate that there ought to be an amendment to make the date of operation of this legislation 10 December 1998 rather than 13 May. I will be moving that way when the bill comes into the consideration in detail stage.",REPS,<title>SALES TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—I rise to support the Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 . I note that the opposition, through their spokesman, the honourable member for Wills, also support the bill. I must admit that I am somewhat confused as to why he wants to move this amendment, because it is quite common practice of governments of both sides of the parliament to announce sales tax changes, and tax changes, et cetera, from the date of announcement. To suggest that, by amendment, he wants to somehow change that date by something like two years does leave me somewhat confused when it is totally contrary to the practice that the previous government had and to practices that this government has had. It is a long-established practice. I ask that the member might reconsider that amendment because I do not think it does anything to help this debate. To me, he is going to prolong the debate.
As you rightly pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a narrow bill with some amendments. It does cover in the main part 
 exemption for space objects and exemption for goods imported by those associated with the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. It has two other minor amendments in it as well. The significance of the measure to exempt from sales tax space launch vehicles, payloads and other goods which are or are intended to be launched into or brought back from outer space follows from the government's announcement on 23 June 1998 that satellites, space launch vehicles and associated equipment will not bear sales tax. It is very clear that the objective of this policy of bringing in sales tax exemption for space launch vehicles and so on is to facilitate the establishment of a viable commercial space industry in Australia and, of course, to establish access to the expanding world demands for satellite launches and satellite launch facilities.
Clearly these are the sorts of areas that we in Australia should be encouraging development of. I believe that Australia has a very good record that goes back many years of involvement in the space industry, and I think it is long overdue that we encourage further development of that space industry. We have a very well-developed infrastructure and we have a very technically proficient work force. That, coupled with our ideal geographical location, makes us a perfect place for further investment in the space industry. I believe that by having this sales tax exemption we give a very clear signal to that industry that Australia is open for business and we want to encourage people to further develop in that area.
We talk about the technological benefits but there will also be employment benefits with the construction and operation of space launch facilities. There will be employment opportunities, and those employment opportunities are likely to be in regional areas, again adding to growth in the area. There is, for example, one project that we hope will really get off, and that is the Kistler aerospace project, which will be at Woomera in South Australia. We believe that this sales tax exemption will allow that aerospace project to take the first step in preparing infrastructure for launch operations in Australia. It is worth noting that the Kistler facility will be the first major 
 space launch facility to be built in Woomera since its heyday as a space test facility in the 1950s and 1960s, when we had many UK rockets like the Blue Streak that were launched from Woomera. That put Australia on the map in many ways. We would hope that with this development we can re-establish what should be a very significant and leading technology industry in Australia. Clearly it will also have a medium- to long-term benefit, and for that reason we believe it is also very important that we do support the development.
It is interesting to note that this project is focusing international attention on Australia as a world player in terms of cutting edge technology and the future of global communications. Obviously the space program will have a very significant role in the whole area of global communications. I think the government deserves support and commendation for attracting this investment. It is a substantial investment. We believe that it is in part the exemption of space launch vehicles and satellites from sales tax that will enable the project to proceed. I believe it is progressing very well.
At the heart of Kistler's Woomera operations will be the United States built K-1 launch vehicle. After a series of test flights, Kistler plans to launch its first commercial payload later this year. The K-1 is planned to be the world's first fully reusable commercial launch vehicle and represents leading edge, cost-effective satellite launch technology. In other words, this is a very exciting development for Australia and I think it is something that all Australians should be very proud of.
After the launch, both stages of the K-1 return to Woomera, landing safely with the assistance of parachutes and airbags. The vehicle is then reconditioned for reuse up to 100 times—it really does have quite a long life and will carry a lot of payloads. It obviously represents major cost advantages over expendable launch vehicles. 
A key component of Kistler's ongoing launch program will be the rapidly expanding market in low earth orbit communications satellites. I might add, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, that people like you and I who repre 
 sent regional areas well know the importance of improving communications for people in regional and country areas and the important role that low earth orbiting satellites are going to play in that. With the growing number of satellites which are planned to be launched from Woomera, I believe that there could be further review of the legislation to take into account the fact that it does restrict the sales tax exemption to vehicles that are being launched into outer space.
It is also important to realise that the launch of these satellites will play a very significant role in improving communication links for the global information superhighway. It is absolutely critical that Australia is at the forefront of these developments, because it is clear that in the next century those who are involved in the information superhighway are going to be very much at the forefront of economic development in the world. So it is very important that the space activities are based here in Australia, both in terms of their financial value and their utility value. Already Australia spends about $600 million annually on satellite systems, but mostly this is spent overseas and we do not have the guarantee that the local industry will derive benefit from and involvement in such programs that it should be able to.
Australia is a big user of satellites, having made large overseas expenditures on Aussat satellite procurement and Intelsat and Inmarsat access. We have long purchased Intelsat and Inmarsat satellite system access, but our industry has not participated in their spacecraft or component assembly contracts. Other nations provide us with meteorological and remote sensing imagery and navigational satellite services, but there are no certainties over the continuation of service or the future costs, so this program is extremely important to Australia.
It is clear that the government space programs in many Asian countries have enabled regional industry to become not just users of commercial satellite systems but suppliers too. While China and Russia remain the only current commercial launch service providers in the region, with Japan and India not far behind, other interests propose rocket flights 
 from Australia. So it is not just for local benefit; it is going to have benefits for neighbouring countries and obviously will be a major export industry in that respect.
A recent estimate of the potential investment in Australia from competing proposals for rocket launchers is in the region of $1.85 billion. In other words, we are talking big dollars here. Not only in terms of dollars, as I have just mentioned, but in terms of the technology and putting Australia at the cutting edge, this is a very important program. With the opposition supporting this, we are likely to see this continue to grow. That is why this bill is important in getting the incentives for it to grow.
It is also important that, with the anticipation of the sales tax exemption of space launch equipment, this will remove a significant financial barrier to the development of a commercial space industry in Australia and it will encourage further investment in the space industry. So we are not just talking about the immediate developments, such as the Kistler project at Woomera, but talking about the expansion that this is likely to bring as Australia starts to develop not only the infrastructure but also the expertise in this space industry.
It is also important to note that space capability is a potential catalyst for creating new and valuable spin-off technologies. These include bio-engineering, robotics, optics, materials, software, electronics, power cells, ground control systems, data processing and advanced manufacturing technologies. In other words, we are now entering the era of global voice communications via handheld phones using satellites. With that, Australia really does have a need to be a player in all aspects in that program.
As well as that, of course, with the Australian terrain, it is very important to note that the improvement in communications will help rural areas. Also, with the remote sensing industry in transition from being dependent on government funded programs to being privately owned, we believe that the first privately owned satellite, Orbital Imaging's Orbview-2, being launched in August 1998, in turn will 
 lead to further developments and further expansions of this satellite industry.
At the beginning of 1998, all but two of the satellites providing earth observation data to non-military customers were government owned, but more than half of the 30 new satellites to be launched in the next four years are going to be privately owned. Again that shows the importance of this legislation in encouraging that development. It is also important to note that one such venture in this area is the Australian Resource Information and Environment Satellite Program, which is to fly a hyperspectral imager for mineral exploitation, resource mapping and environmental monitoring. Clearly, the sales tax exemption from this bill is going to help clear the way to raise the money for these developments.
This has tremendous importance not only for our space development but also for our environment and our land rehabilitation. Right now, with some Commonwealth support, some important salt mapping is being done in my electorate, which I think is going to attract national significance as the results become available and show that these developments are indeed going to have tremendous benefit for our environment as well as for other areas. I want to confine my words to that particular aspect of this bill. I think it is very important and I welcome the support of the opposition, albeit with one qualification. I believe that this bill is important and should be passed.",REPS,<title>SALES TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-02-16,"—The Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 , which is before us tonight, shows that the existing sales tax system is really quite adaptable, that it can be adapted to changing circumstances and to new circumstances as they arise. It is an omnibus sales tax bill that deals with a number of areas: (1) implementing the announced exemptions for space launch vehicles, payloads and other goods intended for launch into outer space or to be brought back from outer space; (2) remedying weaknesses in the provisions to prevent evasion of sales tax in the computer industry; (3) Olympics related exemptions; and (4) closing the loophole in the temporary importation provisions.
We are debating tonight the merits of an amended sales tax system, which is supposedly an inefficient system, compared with, ultimately, the alternative of a goods and services tax. I want to speak briefly on the efficiency implications of what we are debating. The sales tax system is regarded by those opposite as an inefficient system. The one that they want to replace it with, from 1 July next year, is regarded as efficient, but we have in fact heard expert evidence from Professor Peter Dixon of Monash University, who said in his report to the Senate GST inquiry:
The long-run resource allocation gains flowing from the proposed tax changes will be negligible.
That was on page 2 of his report. The proposed system will in fact cause Australia to go back to capital intensive mining industries and other industries whose long-term prices are declining and to switch away from labour intensive industries, such as tourism and education exports, whose long-term prices are rising. That is why we actually get a decline in efficiency and living standards from those proposals.
On the question of efficiency, there is a matter of simplicity. We have heard a lot of criticism of the existing sales tax system that we are debating tonight on the basis that it is complex, but I draw your attention to something that was raised earlier today by the member for Melbourne Ports. He sought to table this provision from the new legislation. For the benefit of honourable members I would like to read this. It is section 165-55 and it says:
For the purposes of making a declaration under this Subdivision, the Commissioner may:
(a) treat a particular event that actually happened as not having happened; and
(b) treat a particular event that did not actually happen as having happened and, if appropriate, treat the event as:
(i) having happened at a particular time; and
(ii) having involved particular action by a particular entity; and
(c) treat a particular event that actually happened as:
(i) having happened at a time different from the time it actually happened; or 

(ii) having involved particular action by a particular entity (whether or not the event actually involved any action by that entity).
That is the proposed legislation—the GST legislation. It would be very difficult to justify a claim that that is less complex than the existing legislation.
We have heard from the Prime Minister's preferred modeller on this efficiency issue as it relates to the sales tax system that we are debating tonight. When he had a look at the efficiency of the proposed replacement for that system, the GST package, he downgraded his estimates of the benefits of that package by 40 per cent to a tiny 65c per person per week. There was a debate on the 7.30 Report about the question of whether 65c a week represented big beer or small beer. Professor Dixon said it represented small beer; Mr Murphy said that it was not really small beer but it was not really big beer either. I would have to say that 65c a week is not even one beer.
—I must interrupt the honourable member there. As was pointed out before, big or small beer, this is a very narrow piece of legislation dealing with sales tax, the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the commercial space industry. I have let the honourable member range fairly widely for some time, but I really do feel now that I must bring you back down to the very narrow confines of this bill. As I understand it, there will, perhaps, be opportunities in the debate on the other bills that we will be dealing with later this evening to range a little more widely. As I brought an earlier speaker back, in fairness I must bring you back to the narrow confines of this bill.
—The reason that I am talking about these criteria of efficiency, revenue raising ability, simplicity—which is related to compliance costs—and equity is that they helped form my views as a parliamentarian on the merits of the legislation before us tonight. If this legislation goes through, we will have amended legislation which is amended sales tax legislation. In making my own judgments as a parliamentarian about that I have to consider these criteria and how the amended legislation looks com 
 pared with possible alternatives. That will influence the way I will be voting on this issue, and may well influence the way that other parliamentarians vote on this issue.
On the question of efficiency, I see no evidence before us that this amended legislation would be less efficient than the proposed legislation on the goods and services tax. We have, amongst the criteria that I have been talking about, the revenue raising ability of the amended legislation. On that very issue there has been considerable debate. We are being told that the amended legislation is incapable of meeting Australia's future revenue needs. That proposition has been tested objectively again by independent experts and I seek leave to have the graphs portraying that evidence incorporated in the Hansard. The graphs show the revenue raising capacity of this amended legislation compared with the alternative that the government has been considering. I seek leave to have those graphs incorporated.
—Is that the table you showed me?
—Yes. I showed the minister those graphs beforehand and I do not see what he would have to hide or what difficulty he would have in having these graphs incorporated in the Hansard . They are relevant to the legislation because we need to make a decision on whether this legislation as amended is capable of generating Australia's future revenue requirements.
Leave not granted.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, normally a fair licence is given in speeches in the second reading debate, but as you pointed out earlier, Mr Deputy Speaker, on this occasion the honourable member was not addressing the issues relating to the bill. It would be inappropriate for me to give leave when the proposal that he is putting forward is a diagram relating to GST revenue and not to the specifics of the bill. So even though I previously agreed to give leave it would now be inappropriate following your earlier statements.
—Obviously the minister and the rest of the government are showing a 
 great deal of nervousness about this. I would like to explain the reason I sought leave. I understand and accept the ruling. The graphs show the revenue raising capacity of the sales tax legislation as amended by this legislation. That is highly relevant and it is obviously something that is very much worrying members opposite and the Treasurer because the Treasurer, having been asked to produce these very same projections, has refused point blank. He has refused to show and tell the Australian people why the sales tax system is not capable of generating Australia's future revenue needs. This graph demonstrates that very neatly. As a result of the unfortunate objections of the minister I will be making these graphs widely available to the public. It is a pity that we are unable to do that through the people's parliament.
I now go to the same problem that we are encountering in making decisions on legislation such as this. We have found that, when we have asked the Treasury for basic information on the sales tax system compared with alternatives, it is not making it available. I would like to refer to a number of documents that the Treasury has which it has refused to release—certainly the Treasurer has refused to release them. They are: `Draft on economic impacts of tax package', `Draft briefing on employment', `Confidential tax reform briefing for the Prime Minister and Treasurer: ""How will the new tax system help employment?""'
On each occasion, the Treasurer has refused to release these documents to the public on the basis `that the disclosure of this document would inhibit the candour of policy advice'. Policy advice is obviously going forward to the government on this sort of legislation and on alternatives which the government is not prepared to make public to the Australian people. What has it got to hide? If the government is adopting this secretive attitude towards tax legislation, then I think Australians should be very concerned.
I urge the minister to talk to the Treasurer to get his approval to release these secret documents. Australians need to know the robustness of the existing sales tax system—which is what we are debating here—and its 
 capacity to provide economic efficiency compared with the alternative, and its capacity to provide revenue into Australia's future. On each of these issues, the government is silent.
It is astonishing that the government has not asked Treasury to do, and nor has Treasury done, any modelling of the employment impacts of the tax package, of the impacts of the tax package on living standards or on gross domestic product, or any longer term impacts of the tax package on revenue. How can we have a proper debate on this legislation and on the new proposed alternative tax system if the requests have not been made to Treasury to provide this information? I suspect that the reason for that is that Treasury has said to the government, `Please don't ask us those questions because you will not like the answers, and if we have to give you the answers they may be subject to FOI'—as these documents were, and the government has refused to provide that information.
I think this is basically a betrayal of the trust of the Australian people on the part of the government. It has said that this legislation we are debating tonight, legislation that would be amended by the amending bill, which it is proposing to throw out completely—the government wants to amend it today and repeal it in its entirety on 1 July 2000—is no good. We asked, `Where is the evidence that it is no good? Where is the evidence that it is incapable of collecting Australia's future revenue needs?' The government said, `There is none—we do not have the evidence, just take us on trust.' That is what it said to the Australian people before the election—`Take us on trust.' The government showed us all these cameos about how everyone is going to be a winner from the GST package, but when we have asked for the basis of that information we have found from the Treasurer and from Treasury that they have modelled none of this. Their argument is: just take us on trust.
This a very big decision that the parliament has to make. In making that decision, as I said, it is important for us to test how robust and how good the existing tax system is. Instead, we get arguments about the government's amending legislation, saying that the 
 legislation is ramshackle, falling apart and is 1930s legislation, but the government will not and cannot provide the evidence for that. It is very unfortunate that tonight we have been refused leave to get that information tabled by default, because Treasury refuses to do the work.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I am loath to step into this debate on this occasion, but the member is clearly talking outside the scope of the bill before the House. Clearly, he is talking about the debate in relation to the tax package in the Senate, and submissions and modelling done in relation to that package. This is a very specific bill. You said it yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I urge you to pull him back to the bill being debated in the House.
—But you will also note, Minister, that the member, as I understand it, is making a contrast between the bill which is before the House and other legislation dealing with taxation. As long as he continues to make a contrast between those two—this legislation that we are dealing with and other legislation—he is in order, but he must continue to make that contrast between the two. While he is doing that, he is in order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on another point of order: I am sorry, but we are talking about the commercial space launch industry in Australia and the Olympic and Paralympic family members and delegations, and certain goods relating to that. I fail to draw any relationship between what the member is talking about and space objects and the Olympics.
—As I said before, I stand by the decision I made before. I made a point of very carefully listening to what the member has been saying and, although he has been touching on other issues, he keeps bringing it back to this legislation. He is making a contrast between the legislation that we are debating—the legislation that is being proposed—and other forms of taxation. He is in order doing that. Before, when he was not talking about that, he was out of order and he came back to the point, and he is now making a contrast. That is my ruling.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for that ruling. Continuing the comparisons, the compliance cost of this amended legislation is one of the criteria by which we will make our decisions on how we vote on this issue. When this legislation is amended, there will still be 75,000 businesses in Australia paying sales tax. When this legislation is repealed, effective from 1 July 2000, there will be 1,500,000 businesses paying goods and services tax and caught in the GST net. I am told that it is very good that we have these 1.4 million extra businesses caught in the GST net. The Prime Minister's preferred modeller, Mr Chris Murphy, in his very recent submission to the GST inquiry, said:
For businesses with computerised accounts, the effect on compliance costs of the changes to indirect taxes . . . should be minimal. For other businesses, ANTS can be expected to speed the shift towards computerised accounts that is already occurring in the absence of ANTS.
He is saying that it is a really good thing that 1.4 million new businesses would be doing tax paperwork, because it will speed up their computerisation. I think that is scandalous, but of course that is the sort of thing that we can expect from the Prime Minister's preferred modeller.
The final criterion by which I will be making my decision on this legislation is the criterion of fairness. The sales tax legislation, as amended, will still have different rates of tax for different commodities; and the general principle is that the higher rates of tax apply to non-essential items. The sales tax system that will be amended as a result of this legislation exempts fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, butter, milk, bread, services like haircuts, electricity, public transport, funerals and so on. If the GST is fair, why do we need a compensation package? What is fair about the top 20 per cent of income earners getting more than 50 per cent of the tax cuts?

"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—The Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  deals, as the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation has said, with two relatively specific things, the exception from sales tax of two 
 areas. One is the equipment that is required to be brought into Australia by the so-called Olympic family in order for them to participate in the Sydney games and, thereafter, to be re-exported—hence the exemption from sales tax. The other area is certain equipment required for what is broadly called the space industry—in particular, space launch vehicles, payloads and other associated equipment. On the first area I mentioned, the Olympic exemption, I note from the explanatory memorandum that the details of precisely what is to be exempt will be later decided, or the parameters will be drawn, by regulation. Is that not so, Minister?
—Yes.
—Thank you. With regard to drawing up those parameters, I would simply urge the government to do all it can to confine the exemption to athletes, officials, and the teams themselves. Please, for everyone's sake, do not allow any of those abominable people that style themselves as members of the IOC to sneak in any of their cutlery or crockery—their Wedgwood, Royal Doulton and so forth—that they will have to bring with them to serve their needs. Or perhaps, I suppose, that is for us, the taxpayers of New South Wales, to provide for them. I hope not.
On a more serious note, the exemption granted for equipment associated with the space industry is of more interest to me, because I think back to when I was a child of approximately the same age, perhaps, as the minister and the shadow minister at the table. When we were children, the idea of space travel was very much in the realm of fantasy. It was the Space Family Robinson, Lost in Space—the idea of exploring unknown areas, flying through the galaxies—Star Wars, Star Trek, Mr Spock and all that.
These days it is different. These days it is about practical applications, and is pretty much about science and, more importantly, about the diffusion of knowledge that is gained from exploring space, especially scientific knowledge in areas such as bio-engineering, robotics, optics, materials science and advanced forms of manufacturing. It is interesting that only seven or eight months 
 ago Senator John Glenn went back into space again, the oldest human being to do so—not so much as an act of sentimental grace accorded to him as for him to participate in medical experiments.
The important thing for us, in granting this exemption and hoping to encourage more such space exploration from Australia, is that we—the citizens, the corporations, the academics and whatnot in Australia—get whatever access we possibly can to that knowledge. For us, there are particular areas that are very important to our national interest: things like the remote-sensing of earth, which is very important, given our large landmass and the need we have to exploit our natural resources. Of course, communications technology—for a country whose population is as widely dispersed as ours is—is more than simply a matter of commercial advantage perhaps; it is often a matter of life or death for people living in remote parts of Australia.
I very much support the notion of granting an exemption in order to encourage this industry. Normally I would be the last person to advocate picking winners in this sense, but there is commonsense behind this because, if you bring this equipment into Australia physically, and you launch it into the stratosphere or further, plainly in anyone's words that is an export, and so of course it ought to be exempt.
Another notion behind it, too, is that we are asking people to forgo revenue. In that sense, you might compare it—as the previous speaker did, with great latitude—to other notions of forgoing revenue. If you want to encourage the development of an industry like the space industry, particularly one so capital intensive, then clearly the next logical step in the chain of reform is the abolition of Australia's capital gains tax regime.
In an environment where the world is now in a cycle of deflation, where global pressures are driving tax rates down and making the competition for capital all the more ferocious, a country that taxes capital gains at 47 per cent for anything over $50,000—or $70,000, if that is to be the case after the taxation reform—is plainly not seriously interested in attracting capital. When you look around the 
 global economy at the moment and acknowledge the presence of this deflation you can attribute it to various causes. Some people attribute it to a technological advance. I think of it more as the confluence of two forces: the death of ideology and the releasing into the capitalistic economy of many millions of people who earn their incomes certainly in jurisdictions with very low valued currencies, but beyond that it is also a question of allowing them access to more and more technology.
In effect, there are hundreds of millions more productive people now participating in the global economy and many of them have access to personal computers, for example. That sort of technology, which renders them all the more efficient and all the more competitive with us, creates what you might call an infinite elasticity of supply. Where you have that sudden rush of new supply, it leads naturally to price destruction or deflationary forces. I saw it myself in Japan where, with a very heavily regulated distribution system and, indeed, high barriers to imports, as the deregulation of those barriers took place and products flooded in, there was price destruction in particular sectors—textiles, clothing and footwear and other things like that.
At the moment where you can take a particular service or a good and say that in 12 months time it is more than likely this will cost less than it does now, then plainly you will delay your consumption of that good. The same goes for investment. It was not so long ago that Siemens spent $US100 million building a semiconductor plant in the North of England at a time when the price of the DRAM chips that it was supposed to manufacture was between $15 and $20. Soon thereafter—12 months or so later—the price fell to beneath $10 and that plant was shut, mothballed.
You can see the same sort of thing happening with both consumption and investment. There is a classical theory of economics which says that there should be a fair value profit for a firm. If the profit is too high, if it is above normal profit, then other firms will enter that industry and the profit will come down to something like equilibrium. Vice 
 versa, if the profit goes too low, firms will leave that industry, competition will decrease and the price will come back up.
At the moment, and I think for the foreseeable future, especially with the diffusion of Internet commerce, barriers to entry are falling as fast as we have ever seen them. So normal profit is tending towards zero; that is to say, profit which firms used to be able to capture by virtue of the barriers to entry in their industry are now being delivered to consumers. Profits are being handed back to consumers in the form of lower prices. So firms such as Amazon.com and other large online sellers are not actually making an operating profit because they are handing it back to the consumer. They are using their presence to deliver other sorts of services. Hopefully in the future, although they are on a very high price earnings ratio now, they will one day be in the black.
Where you have an enormous increase in the supply, you thereby make people distrust prices. Whether it be the price of an investment or the price of something they want to consume, it becomes all the more difficult to attract investment. Given Australia's relative physical advantages for the space industry, by virtue of our relatively small population and small amount of accumulated capital we ought to be all the more competitive in trying to attract capital from offshore to fund enterprises in the space sector. So, while I welcome the exemption granted in this bill to the space industry, I think we have to go a lot further. In particular, we have to deal very bluntly with our capital gains tax regime, which is surely working to deter a lot of investment in industries such as the space industry with which this bill deals.
Lastly, I do not think I can find another adjective to describe what I think of the IOC, so I will say no more about it. I welcome the exemption granted for kayaks, paddles, yachts and all sorts of racquets, for the shotguns which the clay target shooters will bring and for the bows and the arrows which the archers will bring. But really, for heaven's sake, if the government can do what it possibly can to confine the exemption to the true Olympians, the participants in the sporting competition, 
 then I think the taxpayers who are forgoing the revenue will be very well served.",REPS,<title>SALES TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—in reply—I thank the members for Wills, Wannon, Rankin and Wentworth for their contributions to this debate. The Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  contains four changes to the sales tax law, of which two are anti-avoidance measures. One of the proposed changes will encourage the development, as the member for Wentworth eloquently pointed out, of the commercial space launch industry in Australia by exempting from sales tax space launch vehicles, payloads and other goods intended to be launched into outer space or to be brought back from space.
A second measure will ensure that sales tax does not apply to certain goods brought into Australia by non-Australian Olympic and Paralympic family members and delegations and participants in Olympic, Paralympic and associated events in 2000. Last year, the government introduced amendments to the sales tax law to prevent sales tax fraud in the computer industry. This bill will strengthen those changes and the sales tax law relating to the temporary importation of goods will also be amended to close a loophole. I commend the bill to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-02-16,"—This is the fifth omnibus taxation bill for 1998. It covers four separate areas relating to reforming the tax penalty arrangements, alteration of aligned remittance dates, introduction of running balance accounts, and tax avoidance in relation to foreign tax credit schemes. These initiatives are being undertaken in preparation for the introduction of a goods and services tax. It is the view of the opposition that a goods and services tax is neither necessary nor appropriate. And the sorts of measures that are included in this bill can stand independently of a goods and services tax, even though the government, as 
 I say, is introducing them in preparation for the introduction of a GST.
Other members of parliament and I have received many representations about the damage which a GST will cause. For example, I have had representations from Yooralla and a number of other charitable organisations working with people with disabilities in my electorate. Yooralla indeed has an office in Glenroy operating a special school for disabled people. Their correspondence to me has stated that if the government proceeds with its tax reform agenda it will have a very adverse effect on people with disability, people in the charitable sector, and particularly the Yooralla Society. They point out that Yooralla touches the lives of up to 30,000 Victorians each year, runs a lean operation, yet provides a service of unquestionable quality—consequently it is very much valued by those whom it supports and their networks. They also point out that the costs of their programs are much more than their government funding revenues and that the fragility that this creates means that they are in no position to absorb the consequences of poor policy making.
They say that the government has told them that people with a disability will be in front if the system is amended as the government is proposing. However, they have written taking issue with that and indicating their view that, firstly, the government has insufficiently considered the cost to an individual of having a disability and consequently has designed an inadequate compensation approach; secondly, that the government's intention to create competitive neutrality between the charitable and private sectors is based on flawed thinking and mistaken ideologies; thirdly, that capping the present fringe benefits tax concession will create a new cost burden for Yooralla that will jeopardise current levels of service; fourthly, that administration of a GST will create additional costs for Yooralla, which again will place current levels of service in jeopardy; and, fifthly, to apply a GST to fundraising is to place these programs at risk for a miserly gain. To apply a GST on Yooralla's membership dues, they say, is perverse, illogical and of highly dubious benefit to the state.
They go on to say that there can be no dispute that people with disabilities have to spend more on a daily basis to get themselves up to life's starting line on the same terms as everybody else. This has nothing to do with expenditure on food or clothing but is a recognition that many people with disabilities do not have the same luxury of choice that most citizens take for granted. They give a number of everyday examples:
.	 The tram that some take to get to work might have to be taxi for a person with a disability, at ten, fifteen or twenty times the expense.
In recognition of the extra costs involved, most of us use a milk bar only for casual or emergency purchases. For a person with disability, the store around the corner could be the only option.
.	 A person with disability wanting a holiday may need to take an attendant carer along. If this is the case, it would be at his or her own expense.
.	 Going to the January or June sales is a great way for the average householder to save money on larger budget items, but the thought of a wheelchair negotiating Myers on Boxing Day simply beggars the imagination.
The point they make is that:
. . . the higher cost of living borne by people with disability means that any consumption tax is, for them, regressive, becoming more so according to the severity of their disability.
They say that:
Notwithstanding the various exemptions from GST that the Government is proposing for people with disability, there can be little doubt that they will be more heavily taxed than the average citizen, because of their peculiar and unavoidable consumption patterns.
They also express concern about the issue of competitive neutrality—that ideology which demands that charities and commercial ventures operate on a level playing field. As they point out:
Charities use surpluses for the public benefit. To restrict the opportunity to create those surpluses is to reduce the potential extent to which the communities' needs can be met.
As ACROD (the National Industry Association for Disability Services) has stated in its submission to the Senate Committee considering GST and Tax Reform: ""charities are not essentially in competition with business, but, in a broader sense, in competition with Governments in serving public needs. What is required is not tax neutrality with business 
 but overall neutrality between charitable and Government provision of public needs.""
So the natural competitors, in a sense, of charities are governments rather than commercial enterprises, but governments do not bear the cost of the tax. In this circumstance, if you are going to make it harder for charities to operate, the only loser will be the community.
Charities, unlike governments or businesses, have nobody on to whom they can pass their additional costs. Therefore, they have to reduce services. It is people with disabilities who benefit from those services, and therefore we indirectly penalise them through the new tax charge. By taxing charities such as through capped fringe benefits tax and in various other ways, we have further tilted the playing field against them rather than in any way levelling it for others.
Those very serious concerns that Yooralla have expressed have also been expressed by other organisations in my electorate. I received a copy of correspondence of 10 February from the Helping Hand Association for the Intellectually Disabled of Coburg and Districts to the Prime Minister. Firstly, they expressed concern that they have written to the Treasurer previously some months ago but have not received a response from the Treasurer to their concerns. They go on to say:
. . . it is also hurtful to hear and read comments by Government members that the tax proposals will have a favourable impact on people with disabilities and on service organisations.
This is not true, and they urge the Prime Minister to study the ACROD submission to the Senate inquiry, which clearly puts the case for such organisations. They highlight some of the major points from the submission:
.	 Contrary to assertions from the Treasurer, the tax reform package as it stands does not make charitable organisations better off, it makes them worse off.
.	 ACROD does not . . . support the current proposals . . . because of their adverse impact on people with disabilities, their families and the organisations that serve them.
.	 The fringe benefits tax exemption should remain, but with a cap of 30% together with a requirement that all benefits go to the organisations. 

.	 Unconditional GST-free status for charities should be implemented by a GST-free certificate system similar to the existing sales tax exemption certificate system.
.	 The need for retention of tax concessions for the sector needs to be viewed in the context of known figures for unmet need.
.	 The Government's emphasis on competitive neutrality between charities and business is misconceived, as charities, like Government, serve the public good. Governments are free from tax, so also should charities be.
That is the view being put by the Helping Hand Association for the Intellectually Disabled of Coburg. Having visited their premises on a number of occasions, I am aware of the quality of the work that they do in providing the best possible opportunities for some of our most disadvantaged citizens.
Similar concerns have also been expressed by St Vincent de Paul. They advised the Senate inquiry that the GST will have a disastrous effect on low income earners. St Vincent de Paul is a dedicated and caring provider of support for hundreds, indeed thousands, of low income people in Australia. Terry McCarthy from St Vincent de Paul told the Senate inquiry:
The expenditure pattern of low income earners is vastly different from that of the wealthy. Low-income people spend all their money on essentials. The poor have no discretionary income.
The GST will also directly affect St Vincent de Paul's charitable works. The society distributes some $6 million a year worth of food vouchers, which will automatically be worth some 10 per cent less. The submission also highlighted St Vincent de Paul's belief that the GST would place many of their services, such as refuge accommodation, care and support services, food banks and the like at risk.
It is increasingly clear that the inflationary impact of the GST will be very much higher than the 1.9 per cent figure extensively advertised by the government prior to the election. Indeed, St Vincent de Paul believes that the inflationary impact on low income earners, because of the proportion of their income spent on goods and services, will be in the order of 10 to 11 per cent. That would result in sole parents with one child being 
 $11.72 a week worse off and self-funded retirees being $13.16 a week worse off under a GST. Once again, this is an organisation that is doing essential work amongst the less well-off in our community, and I think their views need to be given a great deal more weight than they have been so far.
Finally on this aspect, I draw the attention of the House to correspondence we have received from Anglicare Australia. They indicate their concern that:
. . . the imposition of the GST on food will represent a harsh new tax on the poor and people on low incomes.
They go on to say:
Anglicare also believes that fund raising should not be taxed as it is effectively a tax on people's generosity and volunteer effort. Anglicare agencies and local parishes benefit greatly from the fund raising efforts of individual Australians yet their efforts in fundraising will be liable for the GST. While donations are GST free, the time and effort people put into fundraising, such as a cake stall, will be taxed. Cakes are sold at or even above market prices and so will be GST liable. Yet cake stalls are an important source of funds for Anglican welfare agencies.
Let me say that that is the case for many other charitable and sporting community groups as well. The correspondence goes on:
Just three of our Anglicare agencies for which figures are available estimate they will lose $55,000 a year to the government through the tax on fundraising.
Anglicare Australia has also identified substantial GST compliance costs for its agencies as well as steep increases in their salary bills if the new FBT exemption arrangements are introduced unchanged. One larger Anglican aged care provider with 700 beds in 26 facilities estimates the increase in costs will result in the loss of 8.73 beds or 6.82 full-time jobs as a result of the FBT changes alone. Anglicare supports the inclusion of salary packaging benefits on Group Certificates and agrees there should be a cap but believes the cap should be 30% of the gross remuneration package.
They conclude by expressing concern that:
. . . the tax reform package penalises Church and charitable organisations while giving windfall gains to profit making concerns.
They express those concerns and seek changes to the legislation accordingly. The first three proposals in the two bills before the House are related because they allow significant 
 streamlining and simplification of the administration of, and compliance with, taxpayer obligations under taxation law, particularly for employers.
The Taxation Office is likely to become more efficient and effective in collecting outstanding tax debts, and this ought to make tax compliance simpler for employers. As I indicated at the outset, these initiatives are being undertaken in preparation for the introduction of the goods and services tax, but they are significant and worthy initiatives in their own right. I think they demonstrate Labor's election position: that significant administrative and compliance simplification is possible without a GST. So, if we look at them, the first item is changing the tax penalty arrangement. At the moment we have myriad different penalties involving late payment for various types of taxation. Those penalties are necessary to ensure that taxpayers do not have a financial incentive to fail to pay their tax when the debt becomes due.
What the bill is doing is replacing the existing late payment penalty provisions with a tax deductible general interest charge, or GIC, on outstanding tax debts. That GIC will enable a common single rate of interest for all tax types where a correct payment is not received by the due date. It will enable the abolition of complex and punitive culpability elements that apply for the late payment of some taxes. It will enable simpler tax accounting and collection arrangements that should position the Australian Taxation Office to better assist taxpayers to minimise any escalation of amounts outstanding. I also note that, because the GIC is technically a tax, and hence under section 55 of the constitution a separate imposition bill is necessary, there is a separate imposition bill before the House.
The bill will introduce a penalty for failing to notify the commissioner of an obligation to remit a source deduction or sales tax. It will introduce a penalty for failing to give the commissioner an annual reconciliation statement of source deductions made, and it will make a number of consequential amendments. The new GIC, together with the failure to notify on the reconciliation statement penalties, will generally apply from 1 July this 
 year. The interest charge for unpaid sales tax and source deductions will apply to amounts payable before that date. However, this will not disadvantage taxpayers as the interest charge being proposed is lower than the current rate that would otherwise apply.
The revenue impact of the changes cannot be quantified. With greater automation of the penalty systems, the incidence of the imposition of late payment penalties is expected to increase; however, the penalties generally would be levied at a lower rate.
The policy objective of this measure is to replace the existing late payment penalty provisions in various acts for which the Commissioner of Taxation has general administration with a single tax deductible general interest charge on outstanding amounts. Such a regime ought to be transparent and easy to administer. A further objective is to encourage withholders who cannot remit deductions by the due dates to notify the commissioner of the existence of liabilities and to make sure withholders send in their annual reconciliation statements of deductions.
The proposals are designed to address problems with the current penalty regimes which were identified by the Small Business Deregulation Task Force and as such Labor is supporting them. Many of us, as local representatives, would know examples of taxpayers who have incurred debts and then got into the situation of penalty interest and those debts accumulating and, in the case of some small businesses, really making it difficult, if not impossible, for the business to continue. The step that is being taken here ought to be supported.
There is also the alteration of remittance dates. Currently, medium and small business are required, for example for PAYE, PPS and RPS, to pay taxes deducted on a monthly and quarterly basis respectively. The deductions made during a month or quarter are required to be paid not later than the seventh day after the end of that month or quarter. Sales tax is payable 21 days after the end of the period. The new arrangements proposed in the bill align most remittances with the current sales tax obligations and are designed to integrate with the proposed new quarterly GST, which 
 Labor obviously opposes, and pay as you go, which we have indicated support for. For those payment dates they are proposing 21 October, 21 January, 21 April and 21 July.
Alignment to the 21st of the month for monthly and quarterly PAYE, PPS and RPS remitters is in anticipation of the government's tax package arrangements which it says will apply from 1 July 2000. Under those arrangements, most businesses will complete a single compliance statement once a quarter and make one quarterly payment. A couple of things ought to be said about this. First, when the government announced it as part of its tax package it was greeted with considerable fanfare—an end to provisional tax; a wonderful thing. Based on what has been said for it, Labor has indicated support. I have, however, heard some expressions of concern in the small business area and I have spoken to the honourable member for Canning, who has small business experience and who will participate in this debate. This is an area where small businesses may want to express a view about how it will impact upon them.
The second point that ought to be made here is that a movement to pay as you go tax is completely independent of GST. It can be done through legislation such as this without any need for a GST. I think that bears out the position we took during the course of the 1998 election campaign.
The third measure referred to in the legislation is the introduction of running balance accounts. The bill will be introducing a system of running balance style accounts to account for and administer debts under the sales tax, PAYE, PPS and RPS arrangements for the year commencing 1 July 1999. Those reserve balance accounts amendments will enable four separate RBAs to be established for a taxpayer's sales tax and other debts. It will allow those debts to be aggregated into one outstanding balance for each of the tax types. It will enable the commissioner to recover the RBA deficit as a tax debt and will provide the commissioner with a discretion on the application of tax debts to a running balance account and the application of payments and credits against tax debts.
These amendments are the first phase in a program to establish running balance accounts to account for and monitor the majority of a taxpayer's outstanding debts after 1 July 2000. Currently these are all administered separately. There is no system or legislative ability to aggregate all tax debts. The objective of the running balance account measure is to provide the legislative framework for a taxpayer accounting system to monitor a taxpayer's different tax liabilities and apply a daily interest charge to a running balance account deficit.
This should give us a simpler tax accounting and collection arrangement, assist the ATO and enable it to better assist taxpayers to minimise any escalation of amounts of outstanding tax debts, enable the ATO to provide a comprehensive statement of a taxpayer's outstanding tax debts at a particular time and give an automatic calculation of the general interest charge on the running balance account deficit. This ought to be a more efficient process and, as a first step towards this, we are going to get four separate running balance accounts in relation to sales tax, PAYE, PPS and RPS. This gives us better integration of the existing tax system. Again, there is no need for a goods and services tax to achieve these reforms; and Labor will support this proposal.
The final measure in the bill refers to tax avoidance concerning foreign tax credit schemes. Schedule 2 of the bill amends the anti-avoidance provisions contained in Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act to enable these provisions to apply to schemes designed to acquire or generate foreign tax credits. The tax office has advised us in briefing that these schemes are beginning to be detected and, hence, is advising that legislation is necessary to protect the existing tax base. The schemes are essentially the same in nature as those involving franking credit trading, which is dealt with in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). I am not quite sure why Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) has come in ahead of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), but Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) deals with problems involving franking and credit trading. What 
 you have is taxpayers entering into arrangements which generate little or no taxable income and certainly no economic loss, but significant foreign tax credits which can be used to offset tax otherwise payable on foreign source income. Once again, Labor supports this proposal.
The issue of tax avoidance comes before the House on a regular basis. As I say, there are tax avoidance measures in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1998 , as there are in this bill, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1998.It is interesting to read in the Australian reports about the tax office's ongoing concerns with tax avoidance. Just a couple of weeks ago there was a disclosure of a confidential Australian Taxation Office report warning:
. . . leading corporations and their network of financiers and advisers had ""snatched"" control of the tax system from the Government and the ATO. ""That is the real world of today's self assessment [system for lodging tax returns], where the power is with the corporates and the external network, not the statute [the Government] or its administration [the ATO]—a situation that needs to be reviewed, if not reversed.""
That document was still being considered by the tax office more than a year after it was first discussed. I think it gives quite a lot of insight into the concerns being expressed within the Taxation Office about their capacity to effectively deal with tax avoidance.
The first question it raises is the practical question of whether the large companies really are running the show. The second question is, of course, whether this Prime Minister and this Treasurer really ought to have been doing more in their tax package and in their treatment of taxation issues generally to tackle tax minimisation schemes being used by the government's own supporters in business and in the legal and accounting professions.
It is also clear that the tax office is experiencing some difficulties in simply getting hold of the facts of various taxpayer situations, and there is an ongoing problem with the taxpayer practice of using lawyers to hide or delay access to business information. The tax office wants to see the material to decide if the correct tax is being paid. Companies 
 and high income earners are replying, `No, this is commercial-in-confidence. It's covered by legal professional privilege.' They are refusing to disclose that sort of information to the tax office. From my point of view, that simply is not good enough. I think that all Australian taxpayers are entitled to an assurance that each taxpayer is being dealt with on the same basis; that the tax office knows exactly what their financial affairs are. They should not be able to say, `Well, these aspects are my financial affairs. They're the subject of legal professional privilege and I don't have to tell you, the tax office, what my taxation arrangements are.' I think that is a most unsatisfactory situation, and I hope that the government is supportive of the tax office concerning this matter.
These bills indicate, as other pieces of legislation before the House indicate, that a GST is not necessary to solve our taxation issues. They indicate that the government is able to deal with them if it has the will. If it is prepared to deal with them, it can do so. By way of contrast, a Senate inquiry into the GST has proved—I think beyond any doubt—that the GST is bad for the economy, bad for jobs and unfair to families and communities. So, despite the Treasury's claim, `We've done a lot of modelling,' before the Senate committee, they have confirmed that we have had no modelling of the macro-economic impact of the tax package, no modelling of employment, no modelling of wage effects and no modelling of GDP.
We have seen a hole blasted in their proposal that inflation will rise by a mere 1.9 per cent. The Treasury admitted to the Senate committee that the impact will be at least 3.1 per cent, and even then they are not taking into account compliance costs which will be faced by business inevitably being passed on to consumers and transitional provisions which deny tax relief for motor vehicles. In addition, Treasury are not taking into account the fact that benefits as a result of the abolition of indirect taxes will not fully be passed on to consumers.
We also saw plenty of evidence before the Senate committee that a GST will be bad for jobs. We also saw evidence before that 
 committee that it will be unfair to families and to communities in ways that I indicated earlier in my remarks. In particular, it will have an impact on charities which do such important work in our communities. Having said that, the opposition will be supporting the legislation before the House.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1998  has four main objectives. Firstly, the bill simplifies the current remittance obligations for most Australian business by aligning the remittance dates for medium and small PAYE, PPS and RPS taxpayers from the seventh to the 21st of the month. Secondly, the bill replaces the current late payment penalty arrangements with a consistent and commercially realistic general interest charge on outstanding amounts of tax. These new penalty arrangements incorporate new failure to notify and late reconciliation statement penalties. Thirdly, this bill introduces a system of running balance accounts to account for sales tax, PAYE, PPS and RPS debts for the year ending 30 June 2000. Finally, the bill introduces measures to deal with the abuse of foreign tax credits.
The measures contained within this bill herald important reforms to Australia's taxation system, simplifying the remittance obligations and reducing compliance costs for most Australian businesses. These measures build on the government's commitment to taxation reforms—reforms we were re-elected to implement.
In relation to the alignment of payment dates, under the current arrangements, medium and small remitters are required to pay deductions on a monthly and quarterly basis respectively. Deductions made during a month or quarter are required to be paid no later than the seventh day after the end of that month or quarter.
Under the new arrangements outlined in this bill, the payment dates for most remitters will be aligned with the new quarterly GST and pay-as-you-go payment dates of 21 October, 21 January, 21 April and 21 July. Aligning the payment dates for monthly and quarterly PAYE, PPS and RPS remitters to the 21st of the month will harmonise all taxation pay 
 ment dates for the new tax system due to come into effect on 1 July 2000.
These reforms will substantially reduce compliance costs for small businesses because most small business will only have to remit tax every quarter, rather than every month. These changes have arisen as a result of the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force and they are designed to alleviate the paperwork and compliance burden imposed on Australian business. That is something that I had a hand in implementing. I am delighted that many of the recommendations of the task force have been picked up in this legislation. I am also impressed that the member for Wills has given the government credit for picking up those important elements for small business. That is something that Labor failed to do in their 13 years in office.
Talking about interest charges, I can well remember that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when small businesses ran into terrible problems with their tax obligations, the penalties and interest charges that were imposed on many of them really hit them for six and many never recovered. They did not know where they were. Not only that, they did not know what their liabilities were so they could try to recover from those debts. This legislation will give far greater certainty to those businesses.
The bill replaces the late payment penalty provisions with a tax deductible, general interest charge on outstanding tax debts. This measure realigns the Australian Taxation Office's business system to reflect the account management practices of major financial institutions. An important shortcoming of the current system is that penalty calculations are not well understood by taxpayers. This problem is further compounded by the inconsistent penalty rates and calculations that exist across the different taxes and between classes of taxpayers. These amendments will rationalise, simplify and align late payment penalties with market interest rates, and this will assist taxpayers to better manage their taxation liabilities under various laws.
The current late penalty rates do not reflect market interest rates, and the lack of commer 
 cial reality in the penalty rules prevents the ATO from assisting taxpayers to minimise any escalation of outstanding debt to the Australian tax office. The general interest charge will establish a common single rate of interest for all tax types where a payment is not received by the due date. In so doing, the bill abolishes the complex and punitive culpability elements that apply for the late payment of some taxes. More importantly, the bill allows these debts to be aggregated into one outstanding balance for each of those tax types.
Under the existing system, when a business incurs a penalty, it is difficult to sort out the amount owed if the late payment has occurred across a range of tax areas. It is currently difficult for a business to determine the penalty, the interest charged on the outstanding debt and the rate of interest charged. For example, currently there are about a dozen different rates of interest that apply to penalties and late payments and they range between 16 and 20 per cent.
The changes contained within this bill rectify these problems by ensuring that taxpayers receive regular statements from the ATO to provide a comprehensive statement of their outstanding liability at a particular point in time, showing the details of their outstanding tax debts and penalties. The bill also enables an automatic calculation of the general interest charge on this outstanding liability. This will enable businesses that incur penalties to evaluate their position and manage their debt more effectively. In almost all cases where the general interest charge is imposed, there will be a reduction of between three and 23 percentage points in the existing penalty rates.
In cases where businesses do run into trouble, for whatever reason, the running balance account amendments introduced by this bill apply a consistent general interest charge to any outstanding tax debts. This tax deductible general interest charge will initially be administered through four separate running balance accounts to be established for a taxpayer's sales tax, PAYE, PPS and RPS debts. This is an important step towards the creation of a single running balance account 
 for all tax debts when the new tax system comes into effect on 1 July 2000.
This is a sensible reform because the present taxation laws cover up to 14 different tax areas, each of which can give rise to separate tax debts. These tax areas are currently managed through several different computer systems, and that is not including the calculation of superannuation liabilities. Under the existing system, where a business falls behind in their monthly obligation to pay sales tax and remit PAYE, PPS and RPS deductions over a year, it could involve something like 48 separate primary debts. When those debts are overdue, they are currently recovered as separate debts, each with its own late payment penalty.
Under the running balance account amendments in this bill, those 48 primary debts referred to above will be aggregated within the four running balance accounts and be represented as four separate recoverable debts. These will ultimately be represented as one recoverable debt from 1 July 2000. So if a business runs into trouble, their tax statement will enable them to understand the penalties and late payments involved.
The introduction of a running balance account will also enable simpler tax accounting and collection arrangements that will position the ATO to better assist taxpayers to minimise any escalation of the amounts outstanding. This represents a more streamlined process than individually calculating the general interest charge for each primary component of debt which contributed to the running balance account balance. This bill also introduces a penalty for failing to notify the commissioner of an obligation to remit a source deduction or sales tax and failing to give the commissioner an annual reconciliation statement of source deductions made.
In relation to foreign tax credits, this bill closes a tax loophole that has enabled taxpayers to avoid tax through the acquisition of foreign tax credits through schemes that have been designed with the sole purpose of obtaining a tax benefit.
In conclusion, the changes brought about by this bill will be transparent, commercially based and easy to administer. They will 
 encourage withholders who cannot remit deductions by the due date to notify the commissioner of the existence of liabilities to ensure withholders send in their annual reconciliation statements of deductions. The creation of running balance accounts will streamline Australia's taxation system and the general interest charge will replace the cumbersome late payment penalty arrangements with a simpler `interest on outstanding balance' system. Finally, the tightening of the tax law will combat the abuse currently encountered with foreign tax credits.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Gerick, Jane, MP",ALP,1999-02-16,"—As a former small business person, I am pleased to support the changes to the payment dates for taxes from monthly to quarterly, which will lessen the burden of paperwork and red tape for small businesses to deal with. For the past nine years the business I have owned needed to complete paperwork only for PAYE employees. The paperwork needed to do this is not much, and the need has reduced dramatically over the years with the use of computers.
In the early days of the business, our group tax bill was payable quarterly. A few years later it changed to a monthly expense. This was a change we welcomed, as it certainly helped with the cash flow of our small and beginning business. Cash flow is a problem for most small businesses, and this change may well have a negative impact on a number of small businesses. While there is logic to the argument that the same amount has to be paid and the money can be put aside monthly, the small business people I speak to say that this is more a dream than a reality.
Could the minister confirm that there has been extensive consultation with small business groups as to the impact of this change of payment date? A number of small business owners I know and have contacted have not joined the local chamber of commerce groups because of the cost involved and instead belong to smaller community groups. Have these small community groups had a chance to comment on the proposed changes? I have today spoken to a number of small business owners who were unaware of these proposed amendments and there was concern that the 
 government had not informed them or consulted with them. A number were very concerned at the effect the changes would have on their cash flow and expressed the hope that there would be an option given to them as to which payment method was chosen. A number of small businesses only need to pay PAYE tax and their normal income tax at the end of the financial year. This proposed alteration means that all small businesses will need to change their method of PAYE tax payment, even though they only have to make this one payment. Will there be an opportunity for small businesses to elect which payment method best suits their business?
Small business is the biggest employer in Australia and it is important that the changes being implemented are going to benefit rather than hinder. The amount of paperwork required to make the current payments will blur into insignificance when compared to the demands that compliance with a GST will make on the average small business. Retailers form part of the small business group which will most benefit from these changes. As they need to fill in a multitude of forms and quite often need to use an accountant to ensure that they comply, their costs will be reduced significantly. The West Australian Retailers Association has welcomed the changes for its members. From experience, I would much rather have to prepare the current paperwork without having to spend up to $5,000 to get ready to comply with a GST and then know that I would be spending many extra hours doing the paperwork required with the GST.
While big business groups are supportive of a GST, the small business people who are not currently responsible for collecting a sales tax will find the new impositions costly both in money and in working hours. Small businesses are going to face a huge burden as the unpaid tax collectors for Treasury if the GST is implemented. The alignment of payment dates will make it somewhat easier for small businesses to complete the required paperwork. However, it is only a drop in the ocean when compared to the additional responsibilities and requirements they will face as a GST tax collector.
The most important lesson from this is that the alignment of payment dates does demonstrate that it is possible to lessen the load of paperwork on small business people and to make improvements to the taxation system without needing to impose an unfair tax on the whole country—a tax which will not help all small businesses and certainly will be most unfair on those who can least afford it. I am pleased to see that attempts are being made to lessen the demands of paperwork being made on small businesses in Australia.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—in reply—I would like to thank the member for Canning, who is obviously the self-appointed spokesperson for small business on the other side of House, primarily because she is the only person who has ever had any experience in small business on the Labor Party side of the House. I congratulate her for speaking on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1998 , and I wish that a few of her colleagues had joined her in speaking on this legislation. When there is one voice, one lonely sole voice, in caucus defending the interests of small business, we know it will be the member for Canning, because no-one else has any experience in small business. I would also like to thank the member for Forrest for his contribution. As a former minister for small business, he has an intimate understanding of the importance of small business for the Australian economy. I would like to thank the member for Wills for his support for this bill.
In conclusion, I would like to summarise the merits of the changes made by this bill. This bill introduces new charges and penalty arrangements for outstanding amounts of tax accompanied by a system of running account balances. The tax penalty arrangements provide a uniform, tax deductible, general interest charge and replace a number of existing penalty arrangements. The new running account balance system will eventually allow the ATO to maintain all of a business's tax liabilities in a single account. Small and medium businesses will benefit from the alignment of remittance dates to the 21st of the month. This gives them an extra 
 14 days to remit withheld amounts to the tax office.
This bill includes an anti-avoidance measure targeted at foreign tax credit schemes and is consistent with an international crackdown on such arrangements. The anti-avoidance provisions of part 4A of the tax law will be amended to render some foreign tax schemes ineffective. I commend the bill to the House.

"Morris, Allan, MP",ALP,1999-02-16,"—This is in fact the first opportunity I have had to address the House in the 39th Parliament and I would therefore like to express my appreciation to the people of Newcastle for their confidence in my continuing representation of them in this place.
Honourable members will recall that the election of October 1998 had a slight hiccup in our part of the world. In fact, it was a rather tragic fact that one of the candidates died a day before the ballot, which required the election to be postponed. At some stage I will refer this matter to the parliamentary committee that considers elections because I think the processes set in train by that event were extremely difficult for the whole community. Given the fact that people had voted in the October election, there was a fair amount of confusion as to what their status was in the subsequent election held on 23 November. There was also confusion as to what things were set in train as to who would call the election and how that was to progress. There was therefore a period of uncertainty and, certainly, delays.
It would seem to me that in such circumstances there should perhaps be a capacity in the legislation for the Electoral Commission to reissue the writs, rather than having to wait for the ministerial council, the Governor-General or somebody else, or some other machinery, to act. In some countries, of course, people do go ahead with elections and I think that is rather macabre.
I pay my respects to Mrs Westbury and her family in terms of the unfortunate circumstances they were placed in and, of course, the Democrat party was quite devastated by the loss of its candidate. But the fact is that there was an extensive cost involved and that a great deal of planning goes into elections by the commission and by all those who participate. I suggest that the parliamentary committee should consider whether or not what is currently in place is appropriate. Perhaps it should be reviewed and it might, I would suggest, call for submissions from the public at large.
It happened once before in recent times: in the electorate of Dickson in 1993. It happened 
 fairly early in the campaign, so the election was set down well in advance—I think a fortnight later—whereas in the case of Newcastle it was some seven or eight weeks later, which meant all the cycles and all the confusion. In Dickson people had time to be warned. In the first election in Newcastle last year, many Novocastrians voted twice: they voted in both the lower house and the upper house either by postal vote or by prepoll or on the day itself because they were voting absent somewhere else. The returning officer at the polling both where they were voting did not know about the cancellation. So they voted in the House of Representatives in the first election, which had already been cancelled. So that sense that they had voted already was very strong. It partly accounts for the fact that eight per cent of the people who voted in the first election did not vote the second time. That does give an indication of the dimensions of the problem, despite quite an extensive campaign by the commission to make people aware of that. Once they had voted they thought that was the end of it and put it out of their minds and got on with their lives.
You will recall that that election was nine months coming. It was signalled in January when we were warned about a double dissolution on Wik. We were signalled every second week that there was going to be an election soon—it was going to be in May, then June, then July, then before the Queensland election, then after the Queensland election. We had election fever for eight or nine months. It is understandable that people wanted to put it behind them, given that they had had nine months of titillation by the Prime Minister as to what to expect.
—I wouldn't call it that.
—I accept the comment from the member for Banks. Perhaps it is not the appropriate word, but certainly people having voted in October felt that that was the end of it. The machinery that we have does need to be reconsidered and renewed.
This is a new parliament; there are many new faces. I do regret I missed those early weeks because that is the time when one first 
 becomes familiar with who else is here. Even though I came down for some of the sitting days and to the opening, it was not the same as being in the chamber and hearing a lot of those first speeches. It has also been fascinating to watch the new ministers and ex-ministers. So I am still catching up on what has happened to whom and how and where.
We still have some fascinating topics running. I see that GST is still on the agenda. And we are still talking about mandates. The government suggests that winning a minority of the vote enables them to claim that they have the support of the majority of Australians. I have not quite worked that out yet. Perhaps I am still recovering from the election. I have not quite worked out the mathematics or the logic of that.
I note also that the more things change the more they stay the same. The cuts to Centrelink are biting deeper and harder. The Centrelink staff in the area of Newcastle are being torn between their loyalty to their political masters, the government—because they are servants of the government of the day—and their sense of duty towards their clientele, a duty which they are not able to fulfil because there are not enough of them. They are insufficiently resourced and certainly overworked. They also know that much of what they are required to do is grossly unfair.
Some things have not changed since October. Since I last spoke in this place back in July from recollection, a new year has started and a new round of people are looking to better educate themselves and finding that the changes to Austudy brought in over recent years have made that much more difficult. They are finding also that Austudy overpayments from three and four and five years ago are suddenly resurfacing and they are being told that what was agreed to two or three or four years ago is no longer the case.
We are seeing the very familiar face of the government's immigration policy. I had a recent case which was quite heart wrenching. A man who had been here for 31 years developed cancer late last year and sought to have his children whom he had not seen for 31 years come to see him before he died. They were not able to do so and he died very 
 quickly. Their applications were refused. His friends and workmates promised him that they would get his children here for his funeral. They could not. They were refused. I think the reason from the embassy in Belgrade was that the son, who was from Bosnia, was unable to prove `sufficient incentive to return to Bosnia'. I cannot for the life of me fathom why he would want to stay here, with no money, no language, no job, no friends, no family and a government acting in that kind of way. Why on earth would anybody want to stay here? But because he could not prove enough incentive to return to Bosnia his father's funeral went ahead—much delayed while this went on for weeks and weeks—without him. So this man's workmates, who had worked with him for many years and who had promised him on his deathbed that they would have his children to his funeral, feel an intense sense of failure because they were unable to fulfil their promise. And they thought they lived in a country that talked about a fair go, family values and decency.
So the more things change the more they stay the same. Over the last few years we have become used to this harsh face of Australian governments—the demonising of victims and the blaming of those who are in need of support for their problems. Those amongst us who are most in need of us all caring for them are being seen as not worthy of care—whether they are the young with Youth Allowance and Austudy, the old with nursing homes and the aged care system or simply families under stress.
I raised in this place last week a matter which was further canvassed earlier today. I wish to come to that in a moment because it does indicate that this parliament will not be that dissimilar to the last one in one sense. This government has talked now extensively and expensively with taxpayers' funds about the thing they call tax reform. We understand now that we are going to have this tax reform, as it is called. Of all the misnomers that one sees, this is perhaps the greatest. We are going to have a new tax system and a new tax itself—this so-called GST.
On 29 January, a constituent of mine from Mayfield was the first—but perhaps others 
 have paid it—to pay the new tax when he paid for his funeral and that of his wife. People who pay for funerals in advance do so very carefully. They are very conscious that when they depart this life they want to make sure that their affairs are in order. They do not want to leave behind debt or uncertainty. They want to know that their departure arrangements are the ones they chose themselves, are appropriate and will be completed. Whether you choose to have a church service or a crematorium service, or whether you choose to be buried or cremated, many people like to make those decisions themselves and put the procedures in place to allow that to happen.
This gentleman did this. At the time, he was advised that the GST was coming and that he could pay it. He was told that if the tax did not come in, the money would probably be refunded. He went ahead and paid it. On becoming aware of this some weeks ago, I started to make investigations. I came across what will become the norm—the ATOassist information service. It provides details of the new tax system. The TGST003 document, which is in the ATOassist site on the Internet, points out that, for prepaid funerals:
If you enter into a contract after 2 December 1998 for a funeral, all of the amount paid is subject to GST (unless the funeral is before 1 July 2000).
That advice is accurate as at 2 December 1998, so it is current. It was there a fortnight ago and the same advice is still there today. It does not say `discount the honorarium for the clergyman'. It does not say that the doctor's cremation certificate—which sounds to me like a medical exercise—is exempt, but we do not know whether or not it is.
Anybody who is making those arrangements—a funeral director, a building society which holds the money, or a consumer who is looking at making those plans—on reading that advice would be led to believe that the tax is applicable on the full amount. It actually says that all of the amount is subject to GST. It does not say `part of the amount'. It does not even mention hidden taxes, let alone the honorariums for clergymen or the doctors' cremation certificates. Are they taxable under the GST? Who knows?
I suspect that in the months ahead we are going to see literally hundreds and thousands of cases just like this, whether it be prepaying for a wedding or an airline ticket which you exercise after the event. How does the airline work out what the price will be six months later? How does the funeral director work out what the GST should be paid on? What happens if the person dies before July? What happens if there is no money in the estate for the extra taxation? Would the person be buried? No, of course they would not because the contract has been breached. So those who seek certainty in their departure arrangements can no longer find it.
Whether it is a wedding, a funeral, a holiday or an airline ticket, literally thousands of transactions are going to be caught up in this. If, with the example we have so far—and this is the first example we have—the quality of the advice in the ATOassist web site is indicative of how the government is going to implement this new tax system, we had better start saying a few prayers right now because we are going to need an awful lot. If the alacrity with which they respond is similar, then it is going to be even worse. The Taxation Office was first made aware of this three weeks ago. The media in Newcastle started asking questions about this three weeks ago—a week before parliament resumed. Yet today, if you look up that document on the ATOassist web site, you will find that the advice is unchanged.
To all the people who were told that we were going to have a new simple system I say, `I am sorry, but you were conned—you ain't. You are getting a very complicated system that even the government does not understand.' The answers we have had in this place and which have been given to the media for weeks have been confusing. You could have a bash at the funeral director and blame him for it, but it is not his fault. Is it the tax office's fault? No-one knows. What is the correct information? No-one knows. The Prime Minister said today that it might only be three per cent, but how does anybody know? If this is the quality of the tax advice we are going to have, then every day in this 
 place for the next year and a half there will be confusion, chaos and contradiction.
As I said at the start, this is my first speech in the 39th Parliament. I opened it by thanking the people of Newcastle for their continuing confidence in me. I would like to extend that appreciation to my workers and supporters who worked for two elections—and that is no mean task—and who worked enormously hard. It was a fairly gruelling experience for all of us, as it was for the community with the uncertainty of it all. The electoral officer and his staff in Newcastle did a sterling job in conducting two elections extremely well. Mr Jones's professional standards are absolutely impeccable and ones which the Electoral Commission should be proud of. I would also like to extend my appreciation to my family—particularly to my wife and children—for their support and assistance during that time.
Some things change but still stay the same. I find down here that there have been a few changes. We have some new rules, apparently. Certainly, on my side of politics, it has now become common, it seems, for people to make public critiques of each other's speeches. I look forward to a critique of mine sometime; I look forward to having my colleagues offer some public advice as to my confusion or intellect or otherwise. I look forward to enjoying that.
I think it is important to reassure our supporters that the ego dimensions of colleagues on both sides of the House appear not to have changed. Ministers' egos seem to have inflated slightly more. It is also important to reassure my dear friend the member for Watson that he is not forgotten out there. The people of Newcastle still remember him and they reminded me quite regularly during both of my campaigns of his success in negotiating compensation benefits. It is reassuring to know that, even though some issues are very old, people still seem to have very long memories.
It is with some trepidation and some apprehension that I approach this 39th Parliament. It will be a parliament of change. But I also have this strange idea that it will be remarkably similar to the previous parliament. From 
 my point of view, from my community's point of view and from the country's point of view, quite frankly, we cannot afford more of the same.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1999-02-16,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1998-99 , Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1998-99  and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99 . As the member for Newcastle has alluded to, the appropriation bills certainly do come around every year. It is interesting to note that this apparently is an historic occasion for the parliament as it will be the last time that the appropriation bills will be prepared on a cash based annual appropriation. When the budget is brought down in May 1999, it will be prepared on an accrual basis consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit. It is good to see that the government is moving forward and picking up new practices with a stronger focus on what is known as current input focus and funding for the full price for agency outputs for expenses estimated rather than merely estimating cash payments to be made.
I listened carefully to the member for Newcastle in his contribution and I will just make a few observations. The issue of mandate apparently is troubling him. I suppose that always troubles the opposition when they are not sitting on the treasury bench. They somehow try to convince us that they have the mandate. If we intend having responsible democratic government but the government cannot be formed in the lower house, I do not know on what other basis you can have a mandate. Clearly, the Howard-Fischer government has a mandate. It fought a very determined campaign on tax reform, along with other issues. I am at a total loss to see the justification for this diatribe that there is no mandate.
I am always puzzled, and I always find it quite remarkable, particularly when listening to financial discussions in this place, that the Labor Party always manage to put a negative spin on just about everything that the government attempts to do. They always seem to focus on the concept that there is a bottomless pit of money, that somehow you can focus on, 
 say, a three per cent increase for a funeral under a new tax system. They never quite get around to having properly balanced debate, from tax cuts to a stronger economy. You do need employers, you do need small business, you do need a business structure and you do need a public sector which is efficient. I would like to hear much more from the Labor Party, in a much more measured and widespread discussion—I know the member for Werriwa and the member for Melbourne are engaging in this debate—about how they intend to move this country forward.
The great achievements of the government are of course fairly well documented. In question time each day it is with some pleasure that I am reminded of the progress of the government. It does not seem that long ago that we dealt a fairly major blow to our deficit. We have seen significant drops in our interest rate and we are seeing significant confidence in this country, which is in contrast to other regions in the world.
We have seen in the Morgan and Banks survey, where about 3,500 employers were surveyed, that Australian employers are very optimistic. More than one-third expect to put on people in the next three months. It is the highest level of business confidence recorded since the survey commenced. In December 1998 alone, there were 54,000 new jobs. They are pretty impressive figures, with an unemployment rate sitting at 7.5 per cent.
In South Australia, it is interesting to note that the number of overseas migrants choosing South Australia expanded by 40 per cent last year. Business investment grew by 24 per cent and business confidence was up by 14 points compared with a national increase of nine points. That is, as I understand it, from the National Australia Bank survey.
The South Australian economy is growing at the fastest rate in the country. It is estimated at 4.5 per cent in 1998-99. Retail sales for the last quarter of 1998 were almost double the national average. South Australian exports have already risen by 5.1 per cent in the first five months of 1998-99. So there are some very positive indicators in our national economic performance.
In terms of the path ahead for the government, we have the Senate committees looking at the government's tax proposals. The Treasurer, the Prime Minister, the executive and senior ministers have exposed very well the weaknesses particularly in the Democrats' position. Today we had the leader of the Democrats in the Senate suggesting that they would not be ready to vote after what would be, at the end of June 1999, a record allowance of hours for debate, a record time for Senate committees ever in the parliament of Australia over 100 years. We have the farcical situation where the Democrats are suggesting that that is not enough time. As far as the Labor Party goes, as the Treasurer reminded us today, why would they even bother with a Senate inquiry? They are going to vote against it anyway.
As to the ALP's interest in employment—employment has been the issue very much of the 1990s—it is interesting to observe the Labor Party as they try to justify their disallowance of the unfair dismissal laws. They know and this side of the parliament knows that employers are concerned about that. Employers need the confidence to employ, and to deny 50,000 people an opportunity to work because of this legislation which they intend to disallow in the Senate is just beyond belief. The youth wages issue has been well canvassed. I will not proceed any further on that because it had very broad ranging debate in this place last week.
Can I just look back over the last decade in my part of the world, that is in the electorate of Grey, which is 92 per cent of South Australia. I understand that with the redistribution I will end up being responsible for even more of that part of the world—that is for the commissioners over the next few weeks. If we go back a decade or so, we are reminded of the 20 per cent-plus interest rates. At the same time as we were suffering one of the worst drought periods on record, the Labor Party withdrew drought assistance. At a time when we had record low commodity prices, led by then Premier Bannon and the federal minister of the day, the Labor Party removed what is now known as the farm management deposits—then known as the income equalisa 
 tion deposits. That is well documented. Anyone can check the record.
What really strikes me, looking back over that period, is that at the same time that that was happening and the economic management was such that it was just putting more and more pressure onto the regions—I will not talk about the increase in fuel taxes and other issues—we had then Premier Bannon asleep at the helm with totally insufficient oversight which saw in a very few months, a year or two after that very tight period in my part of the world, the greatest financial disaster that my state has ever seen. The State Bank lost something like $4 billion which, I think, is of world record proportions on a per capita basis. It is little wonder that people of South Australia still worry very much about the Labor Party.
The other thing which the Labor Party was doing at the same time was vigorously opposing the great new mine at Olympic Dam, which now, 10 to 12 years on, has seen an investment coming to $4 billion. So on the one hand we have this totally incompetent economic management, we have the greatest financial disaster and we have denial of wanting to see the greatest single investment in South Australia in the last 50 years. I take this opportunity to challenge the Labor Party to look to Australia's future, to come up with the policies—we do not mind our policies being exposed to the most rigorous debate—which will be able to deliver what we have delivered in the last three years: balanced budgets, low interest rates, low inflation and growing employment opportunities.
We have well mapped out our future agenda into the next century. I can do no more than appeal to the Democrats, to the Independents and to the Labor Party: stop this humbug of blocking our tax reform package. As the Asian crisis has shown us, this is a time of great difficulty in many parts of the world. Yet through our philosophy and through our policies, we have been able to deliver the best opportunities that Australia has seen, I would suggest, for at least 25 years.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"O'Byrne, Michelle",ALP,1999-02-16,"—The appropriation bills, as we know, deal with the 
 way in which governments allocate funding resources. A government's attitude to the community is clearly identifiable when you look at the manner in which it approaches budget time. Unfortunately, what we have seen with this government is policies and decisions that have dramatically reduced choices and services for ordinary Australians. The government should not feel any pride in the manner in which it has treated particularly regional Australia.
We have seen attacks on child care, health, young people, unemployed people, education, research, development and our regional areas. It seems that no-one in our community has been spared the savage cuts of the Howard government. I would like to be able to say that the government has been unaware of the consequences of its budget cuts, but I am afraid that is just not the case. This government has embarked willingly and some might even say gleefully on a campaign that it terms `reform' but that most Australians realise is vicious attacks on the basic elements of their community and vital services.
The Launceston General Hospital is the major hospital within the electorate of Bass, and I am continually disappointed by the number of people who, through no fault of their own, are on long waiting lists for treatment. The medical and support staff at the hospital provide caring and professional services to the community. It is just a shame that the federal government will not fund this excellent hospital as it should.
The impact of cuts to the health budget are felt, often painfully, by the community. And when funding shortfalls occur it is people that suffer. The previous state Liberal government in Tasmania claimed that the Howard government had reduced state health funding by $15 million. Nationally, over $1½ billion has been ripped out of hospitals and Medicare since 1996. This funding reduction has had the recent impact of increasing the waiting lists for category 3 elective surgery at the Launceston General Hospital. When category 3 elective surgery is delayed, the underlying medical conditions often worsen and become hugely expensive and more painful to treat. A decrease in early elective surgery will always 
 result—as I am told by professionals—in an increase in expensive emergency surgery.
With waiting lists rising and beds closing, it is a disgrace that the federal government has not signed a Medicare agreement with Tasmania. It is even more appalling when you consider that the federal government made an offer to the previous state Liberal government but that this same offer has not been made to the present Labor state government. The failure to provide security and funding to Tasmanian hospitals is a disgrace. By the government not extending this offer to the present state government, the hospitals in Tasmania are being denied almost $15 million, and that money is sorely needed.
By not honouring its offer, the government has forced the Australian Medical Association into suggesting that nursing home and hostel admissions be `freed up' so that the elderly who are treated in public hospitals can be moved out after only 48 hours. The stress that this would cause elderly and infirm people is something that all of us should endeavour to stop.
We are also under a real threat that we may lose our medical school status. The Prime Minister needs to be made aware that the continual playing of petty political games with the health needs of the Tasmanian community will not be tolerated by the public. It would take more time than I have allocated to health in this speech to fully explore the impact of health cuts in Tasmania. But members opposite can be assured that at least in the electorate of Bass the community is well aware of the responsibility of the Howard government for health funding shortfalls.
One of the primary roles we have as a society is the care of our children. Yet this government has walked away from the provision of a high quality, affordable and accessible child-care service. In Tasmania we have a disproportionately high number of community based centres. In fact, about 70 per cent of our centres are community based child-care centres. The community based child-care centres in Tasmania say that they have lost an amount of around $1.4 million in funding. Tasmanian centres who responded to a survey conducted last year identified that 55 
 per cent of those centres had reduced staff because their numbers were falling. Increased fees are the direct cause of reduction in the numbers of children in care. Fees have increased dramatically, in one case by as much as $40, and this increase is being borne by families, most of whom can ill afford it. The National Association of Community Based Children's Services survey said:
Centres have had no choice but to increase fees and cut staff. Staff cuts have seriously undermined the quality of care.
For low income families, child care has become a luxury. The government's alleged savings from the child-care funding are in fact hurting the people of Bass, especially women, because it is women who in the majority of cases are still on the lower wage and who make the decision to leave the work force in order to care for children. Instead of being confident that if they go to work they will be able to afford child care, many women are now needing to assess whether they can economically survive in the work force. The government should be committed to equal participation in the work force.
There are some simple changes that the government has claimed as savings, such as paying child-care assistance as a rebate instead of in advance, that have created additional burdens on low income people. Areas such as George Town, which is within my electorate, are doubly disadvantaged through limited access to Medicare offices. The nearest Medicare office to George Town is in Launceston and for working parents to find the time during the week to claim the rebate for their child care must be almost impossible.
Last week a gentleman from George Town contacted my office, because he had a minor administrative problem with his child care rebate. By `minor administrative problem' I mean that his address was wrong. It took him five hours on the telephone to resolve this issue. If it takes that much time to fix something as simple as a change of address, how do people go about fixing larger problems or querying the methods and processes utilised? Not only are these low income people forced to make an outlay before receiving any 
 government assistance but they are further disadvantaged by the process for claiming the child-care allowance. I would like to believe that the government is unaware of these realities, but it appears that it just does not care about the impact of its policies on ordinary Australian families.
But the attacks on the basic components of life do not end here. As Australians one thing that we believe we should be able to rely on is effective job assistance. Last year we saw the end of a 50-year institution in the demise of the Commonwealth Employment Service. We saw the demise of our obligation as a nation to provide free employment assistance to all of our unemployed people. We saw a callous and malicious process of moving people off the unemployment lists—not into jobs but into some kind of limbo, a place where this government can tidily wash its hands and say it has done something about unemployment. Well, it has. It has hidden the true nature of the crisis. It has taken away a valuable service to the community and left us with an organisation which is neither properly funded nor properly respected.
In May of 1996 in the CES office in my electorate there were 63 staff. There are now 11 people trying to deal with the unemployment needs of that region. We lost eight CES offices in Tasmania. Despite the claims of the government, services to unemployed people have not got better. We heard yesterday that 81.5 per cent of callers to Centrelink cannot get through. That is not just unemployed people, that is families who are being penalised. Not being able to talk to a Centrelink worker has caused anxiety and stress. The problem is exacerbated in those regional areas that have no Centrelink office, such as George Town where the unemployment level as of September 1998 was 15.9 per cent. Centrelink staff are already overworked. Yet they are expected to soon adopt a personalised client service, whereby they will see a particular client for the life of their involvement with the agency. There is a very real concern that this will lead to the personalisation of government policy and add to the stress already experienced by staff.
The government have also recently announced their intention to increase the workload of Centrelink offices throughout this country through incorporating an assessment of the literacy of clients. This is yet another burden on staff struggling to meet the existing client needs in a professional and caring manner. Staff working for the agency are struggling to deliver the quality of service they are committed to providing within existing resource structures.
Another Howard government initiated attack on meaningful employment has recently been brought to my attention. This involves the Howard government's last minute changes to traineeship and apprenticeship guidelines. Having advertised the programs to be offered for the upcoming year to potential trainees, apprentices and potential employers, the guideposts changed at the last minute. This has resulted in many previously eligible persons being ruled out of consideration, because if you already have a qualification, regardless of the nature of that qualification, you are no longer eligible for training assistance.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1999-02-16,"—On the day Bishop Carlos Belo was in Melbourne—on the day Tom Sherman released his second report on the deaths of the Balibo 5—if ever there was a matter of public importance relevant to today and the Australian public, it is East Timor. Tonight Bishop Belo told the ABC's 7.30 Report  of a woman in one of the traumatised villages, who told him they wanted one thing—peace.
Bishop Belo advises a long and cautious transition with international supervision and assistance. Yesterday a group of parliamentarians were told by Fretilin foreign affairs spokesman Mari Alkatiri that the major need is now. Trauma and post-torture counselling 
 is urgently required. So too, according to Mr Alkatiri, are doctors and medical supplies. Obviously these cannot be safely delivered until there is stability and peace in the province.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs meets President Habibie next week. We must not enter those talks with dollar signs haunting our judgment. We are an independent and powerful nation in the region, and it is time we started acting in a manner befitting our status. Most Australians, I am sure, would be ashamed at the way successive governments in this country have placed appeasement ahead of justice and freedom for the East Timorese. For heaven's sake, let us consider their cost in non-dollar terms over the last quarter of a century—over 200,000 dead, and tens of thousands more physically and emotionally scarred for life.
Bishop Belo said tonight that there was scarcely a family that had not lost one of its members. It is vital that the armed factions are disarmed as soon as possible. To wait is to court more bloodshed, especially now Indonesia's leaders talk of independence by the end of the year. A vacuum could be disastrous and our vacillation would be rightly condemned. It is not up to me or the Parliamentarians for East Timor or anyone else to tell this government what it should do. That message is coming clearly from those most affected—the East Timorese.
Tonight on SBS News the Minister for Foreign Affairs is reported to be expecting to attend independence celebrations in East Timor by mid-next year. His office is reported as saying, `Anything could happen.' Does that mean that we are going to wait until `anything' happens, or will we ensure we play a leading role in controlling what happens? There may be differences in emphasis about the time line for independence. Bishop Belo talks of 10 to 15 years before full independence, with international help in the interim. Jose Ramos Horta speaks of five years. Xanana Gusmao spoke of 10 years—or he did when autonomy was an option. His Fretilin colleagues said yesterday that Indonesia's recent statements suggest autonomy prior to independence is no longer an option.
Whatever the time line to independence, the work starts now. The need to disarm is now. The need for assistance is immediate, and the major responsibility, I would suggest, is ours. The leadership should be ours. Of course we should make Portugal and Indonesia stand to account. Of course they and the European Union, the Americans and the UN should help, but condemnation will not deliver peace. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated in his letter to Ali Alatas on the deaths of the five Australian newsmen that it is Australia's duty to request the Indonesian government make inquiries to establish the facts regarding the killings and to bring to justice any responsible party.
Unfortunately, justice has never been a partner in any of Indonesia's actions in East Timor. But the deaths of the Balibo 5 will not have been in vain because they have helped enormously to focus the Australian conscience even more on East Timor over these past 24 years and helped drive home to Indonesia the futility of its repressive colonialism. But the deaths that have been in vain are the 200,000 plus East Timorese who have been slaughtered these past 24 years. Anyone seeing the photographs of atrocities against East Timorese displayed in this House last year could no longer doubt the brutal tactics employed by Indonesia in its futile attempt to crush the spirit of this tiny country.
This was the spirit that fought another invasion more than 50 years ago and helped save the lives of many Australian diggers. We have a well trained army, navy and air force. Let us use them in a benevolent way to help deliver peace. Let this government, as a first step, announce as soon as possible our intention to commit our armed forces again to East Timor as part of a peacekeeping force. Let that commitment be the first necessary signal to the people of East Timor that there is help at hand to deliver what that old lady in the village told Bishop Belo, `We don't care if we're poor, we just want peace.'",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>East Timor</title>,Adjournment,16,1
