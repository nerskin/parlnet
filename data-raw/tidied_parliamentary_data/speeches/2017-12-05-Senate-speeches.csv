Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:31):  The idea from the movie Groundhog Day is something that I think is a modern trope that everybody understands—where you have to keep going over the same thing, and eventually, sometimes, the lesson gets learnt. So, it's an act of hope, I suppose, that I come into the chamber this afternoon to say, 'We need to talk about superannuation.' We need to keep talking about superannuation to this government because, when it started, they didn't understand it, and through the progress of the years, they've tried to impede its growth and development over and over.


Yesterday, we saw them really trying to have a go at Industry Super, which is delivering a two per cent to three per cent better result for its members than the banks are doing with the superannuation that they look after in the retail sector. We saw them wanting to attack that. And here we are again, and I'm going to have to do it all over again because this government—the Liberal-National coalition—do not understand what the people in the gallery and across this nation understand, which is that superannuation is a very important investment for Australians. We understand it. We know how important it is. They shouldn't be treating it like a little piggy bank that they can raid whenever they get the opportunity. As soon as they get into government, they go after superannuation. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 is another attack on superannuation, and it reveals, once again, that this is a government that just doesn't get it.


Back to the history—superannuation is a Labor idea, implemented by a Labor government all that time ago under Paul Keating. Let me tell you, I grew up in the western suburbs, in the working-class suburbs. My father was an Irish immigrant. He ran a small business. He employed lots of people. There was not much talk about superannuation in our house. I didn't know what a public servant was. Superannuation wasn't something that we knew. But Paul Keating did. And as a leader in the Labor Party, he put a marker in the line of the history of this country and said, 'We are going to build a superannuation system that will support Australians, who will be able to retire with dignity.' Australians who didn't have great wealth already, Australians who were just going to work hard all their life, look after their families, contribute to their community, pay their tax—those Australians. The real ones. The ones on whose back this country has been built. They're the ones that Paul Keating was standing up for with his visionary view of what could happen if we actually did invest in superannuation.


The government from the beginning completely opposed this. They had all sorts of claims: the economy would collapse, small business would never survive and we'd ruin jobs and the future of the nation if we instituted superannuation. But here it is, down the track, and every Australian today—even young people who are starting on their first jobs, hopefully in a retail situation where they join the union, the SDA, and start to contribute to their superannuation—with a $2 trillion set of funds in superannuation are in a vastly different position than they were when this government decried superannuation in the first instance.


We started off with a small amount. Incrementally, we got up a little higher. Labor wanted to get to 12 per cent. As soon as Tony Abbott came in, that whole incremental increase stopped. When you change the government and you put this lot in, it changes your economic future in a very bad way if you're an ordinary working Australian. And they'll come up with all these little distracters, gifts and cute arguments, and they'll pretend that they're great economic managers. But I'll tell you who they're great economic managers for: people who've already got a hell of a lot of money. They're great economic managers for the banks. They've stood and waited for the banks to tell them, 'Okay, we're ready for a royal commission, and this is what we'd like it to look like.' That's the sort of government this Liberal-Nationals government is. Instead of doing the right thing by Australians, they pull a con job as often as they can.


That is why Labor of course does not support these bills that are before the house right now. I know that people across this country are concerned about the affordability of housing. Well, let me tell you, in the last period when Labor was in government we built over 20,000 houses. We still haven't caught up on what John Howard had taken away. The minute they get in, they cut investment in housing. And we've got this same attrition of housing access and housing affordability under a government that continues to claim economic credentials that it simply doesn't have. These bills that we are debating today will do absolutely nothing to reduce pressure on housing affordability—unlike what the government is signalling in the bizarre title of this bill. This is what it's called: the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill. Well, that's the first deception. With this legislation they're not doing what the title suggests. And that's what you get: you get this sort of front. But you've got to be a bit smarter than that. Don't accept what they say, because behind that front is always an attack on the life of ordinary hardworking Australians—the people the Labor Party stands up for.


Alongside not addressing housing affordability, with this piece of legislation they're looking to ruin another bit of our world-class superannuation system. These bills show that the government doesn't understand the purpose of the superannuation system, as I said in my opening remarks. This bill will do one thing. It'll undermine Australia's superannuation system, and Labor cannot and will not support it, because it's only the Labor Party that will always fight to protect your superannuation. For men and women, Labor is the party of universal compulsory superannuation. We decided that it was an important thing. We invested in it, we made it happen, we legislated for it, we've protected it, we've grown it and we've nurtured it, until we were in the position that we are, with a sound and solid superannuation system. There's more work to do to make it better. But every time this government gets in, they try to whittle it away, and this is another example of an attempt to whittle it away.


We know that Australia's housing affordability issue is something that wrests the mind of every Australian, whether you're a young person who says, 'I wonder if I'm actually going to be able to afford a house like my parents,' or whether you're a parent who says: 'I'm so proud to be an Australian, I love this country, I'm so glad I grew up here and I'm really happy that I was able to afford a house, but what about my kids? Will they have a chance? Will their children have a chance?'


Grandparents are saying, 'This is not the kind of situation that I thought I'd see in my country.' Instead of really addressing the fundamental problems we have around housing with carefully considered strategy, we have this government of dysfunction, disunity and chaos cobbling up misnamed bills and pretending to do something good for the Australian people. 


The Labor Party has led the genuine debate about affordable housing. We've committed, in opposition, to important negative gearing and capital gains tax reforms—critical to keeping the pressure down on prices and making sure that people can afford a home, and ensuring that the taxation system shouldn't support people who have multiple opportunities to grow their wealth through many, many houses while young people in our country can't get their foot on the ladder to buy their very first house. The Labor Party is committed to making the taxation system fairer and to helping ensure ordinary Australian men and women can afford to buy a house and can have financial security for their families not just at the time they purchase a house but at the time that they grow their wealth over the course of their life and by the time they retire. That's what superannuation is about. It's about making sure that every Australian is in a position to retire with dignity. Before Keating made that happen, that was not the case in this country. 


Instead of addressing the housing affordability issue, the government is exploiting the taxation structure of the superannuation system through this bill, and its exploitation goes against the purpose of superannuation. We all know that the superannuation tax structure is quite generous. It offers incentives through the tax system as an important way to encourage Australians to save for their retirement, and that is particularly important in a system where contributions are compulsory. There's a flat and generous taxation structure on the superannuation system, and it's meant to create an incentive so that people save for their retirement understanding that the dollars that they put in are taxed at a lower rate than they might be paying on their actual wages. The government argues that the purpose of super is to provide income in retirement to substitute or supplement the age pension—that's in the government's objective statement on the bill. But we, in Labor, see this superannuation system as much more important—much more than just that one goal. Older Australians who've worked all their lives should retire not in poverty; they should retire with financial security and, above all, with the dignity of savings that they've accumulated over time that have been invested wisely, that have grown their wealth, so they can make the choices they want to make, they deserve to make, in their retirement. 


The taxation structure facilities that will allow that are ones that Labor supports—but not this bill. We know that most of those people in the top tax brackets gain the most benefit from taxation structures around superannuation. With that background, how is opening up the super system to people to put more money in it going to help those who cannot afford a home? The title 'the first home super bill' is a complete misrepresentation. It will not help young people on low to middle incomes in Australia purchase a home. In fact, researchers who look at the impacts of government decisions on superannuation have argued that it could lead to exactly what we don't want to occur—an increase in house prices, putting more pressure on families and also putting more pressure on the age pension. Instead of focusing on the structural issues that are facing our superannuation system, we can see through this bill that the government remains focused on repurposing or redesigning the system, ignoring its ultimate purpose for the Australian people. The current superannuation system is facing some challenges. It needs work to make it fit for purpose for our time. 


One of the big problems we face—I want to put this on the record today when I know many of my colleagues are wearing white ribbons as we talk about women, about equity for women and opposing domestic violence—is that there's a huge gender gap. We have to make sure that women in retirement are safe, that if they need to they can make choices to leave unsafe relationships. That is a real issue that the government should be dealing with, and I wish I were in here talking on a bill addressing that problem. But we're not going to see it from this government. We're going to see something dressed up as something else and we're going to see an erosion of good policy for ordinary, hardworking Australians.


The facts demand reporting here. We know that women, on average, retire with around half the superannuation of men. That's just not acceptable. They do a lot more than half the work in many, many situations—certainly around the house. That remains the evidence we see: full-time working women doing many more hours of housework at home than their partners. Of course, those opposite will say, 'Well, they can just rely on their partner.' But that is a comment from another time. That is not the Australia that I've brought my daughters up to be a part of, as equal participants in creating the knowledge, the community and the wealth of this nation. Women are entitled. There are 50 per cent of us; it should be fifty-fifty. That's not the case in superannuation. In fact, older single women are one of the fastest-growing cohorts of people living in poverty. The Labor Party believes that financial independence is a critical goal that we must strive towards for this group of Australians.


The gender pay gap is a factor of interrupted work patterns and insecure work for women. Those are the things that cause the gap. It has been caused in part by cultural norms around what a woman's 'proper place' is. It cannot be into the future, but it's something that we're dealing with at this point in time—the legacy of that attitude. Until we have a proper change in cultural attitudes towards women and men in the workplace and with regard to superannuation, we should focus on ensuring the superannuation system works for all Australians—not just those working full-time, who are predominantly men; not just those in high-paying jobs, who are predominantly men; and not just those in continuous employment, who, sadly, are predominantly men. Things can change. Things will change. Paul Keating instituted superannuation. What a change that turned out to be! But we've got to set our sights on the right goals, not the sorts of goals that this bill seeks to achieve.


One union that is so often maligned by those opposite but is standing up and fighting for ordinary Australians is the SDA. Time and time again it's spoken about the need to ensure the gender gap in retirement is eradicated. With around 60 per cent of its members being women working in the retail sector, it is very well placed to fight for the rights and equity of those women. One of the things that unions do—unlike the ridiculous caricature of unions that we constantly hear from the other side—is invest in the intellectual work of putting together submissions to the important work that this parliament does. They put on the record what's happening to working people. The SDA did this work. It got together a submission to the Standing Committee on Economics in which it recommended that superannuation actually be paid on paid and unpaid parental leave. They said:


Women's participation in both paid employment and unpaid caring responsibilities must be genuinely acknowledged and reflected in meaningful policy outcomes to ensure that women are not relegated to a life of poverty and distress in their retirement years.


I don't know how anyone in this chamber—whether they are a clerk working here; the Deputy President; one of the staff in the advisers' boxes, who are here supporting us; the person doing the Hansard; or a person in the gallery—could disagree with that. We actually believe in egalitarianism in this country. But, instead of doing something about that, the government are sitting here trying to take away the capacity of superannuation to deliver a decent, dignified retirement for all Australians. They're not dealing with the gender equity gap; they're just turning a blind eye to it. Mind you, it's pretty easy to turn a blind eye to it when you've got hardly any women in your party. That's another difference between the government and the Labor Party. Unlike this government, the Labor Party believes in pursuing proactive policy settings in superannuation that equitably maximise retirement incomes and seek to address the structural labour market disadvantages that women face. When you're in part-time employment, when you're not guaranteed employment, when you take leave to have children, that pulls you back. We need to do something about that, we need a vision for that, and we're not going to see it from those opposite.


Labor also believes in the necessity of superannuation to fund decent retirements for people who are challenged by the changes of automation and technology. We need to embrace the advantages of innovation when it grows our economy. We need to make sure that the technological changes that are part of our time create new roles and great jobs for the men and women of Australia. We know that, to make that happen, we have to invest in education. That's not what we're seeing from those opposite. They're not saying, 'Let's skill up, let's increase the wealth of the nation.' These guys are saying: 'Let's raid the piggy bank of superannuation, because the people are too dumb to figure out that, if they put the money away now, it'll affect them in retirement. We'll get away with this. We'll look like we're doing something about housing.' That's how cynical this bill is. They're attempting a little swiftie: 'Don't worry, the Australian people won't notice.'


I'm sure the Australian people are beginning to wake up to the fact that they cannot trust this government. This government lacks unity. It's eating itself alive. The Nats are fighting against the Liberals. This government has no vision for superannuation and has never had a vision for superannuation for the people from Curran Road, Blacktown, where I grew up, where no-one talked about superannuation. People are talking about superannuation now, because Labor put it on the agenda, and I reckon they're smart enough to figure out that this government doesn't give a toss for ordinary working people and their superannuation needs. This bill is another example of the fact that this Liberal Party, under Malcolm Turnbull, just doesn't get it.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:51):  Thank you, Senator O'Neill, for that very enthusiastic discussion of the benefits of superannuation in our country. I'd be the first one to join with you in acknowledging what former Prime Minister Keating did when he was Treasurer. I think superannuation has a very strong and sound place not just in our financial system, where it provides future investment opportunities in important projects, but in the benefit it has given ordinary Australians like my parents. I was born and bred in a working-class part of Perth, in Perth's northern suburbs, and am proud to say that my parents still live in their home of the last 40-odd years, with a very modest extension that allowed their two elder sons to not have to share a room anymore. These are the lived experiences of Australians. We know that providing Australians with affordable housing choices is a critical work program of any Australian government, and I'm pleased that this coalition government, led by Malcolm Turnbull, is doing exactly that. Giving Australians affordable housing choices and addressing other housing issues has been front and centre in the work of this coalition government and of Treasurer Scott Morrison, supported by the assistant minister, Michael Sukkar.


In the brief time available to me this afternoon I will share with the chamber what the government is seeking to do with these pieces of legislation and how the government proposes to do that. While the contributions of other senators with regard to the historical policy development in this area and broader economic areas provide interesting content for senators like myself to listen to, I think it is important that we focus on the current situation and how that informs our future policymaking. I'll speak briefly about that, drawing on some of the comments that the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer made in the last fortnight to the Australian Property Investors conference and also focus a little on the important issue of supply. I'm one of those people that believes discussions around housing access necessarily involve a discussion about the supply of land available for future housing stock. In addition to that I will talk about some commentary that has been made by the Reserve Bank of Australia in a submission to the House of Representatives inquiry into homeownership.


It doesn't matter what particular economic debate it is that we have to face in this chamber; it necessarily requires us to make decisions or choices about what sort of information we are going to rely upon in order to inform our decisions. We heard from Senator O'Neill that she puts a lot of faith in the informed or researched views of some elements of the trade union movement. I'm not saying whether that's right or wrong. I'm just reminding people that when we come to debate particular issues in this chamber we bring our own world view. 


For my own part, I prefer to trust the judgements and historical evidence that have been accumulated by organisations like the Reserve Bank of Australia. I rely on the information that's brought forward in public debates and discourse from the Reserve Bank for a number of reasons. I do think that they have a corporate knowledge around these issues that is built on access to very substantial evidence that other stakeholders don't necessarily have. 


I regard the Reserve Bank as genuinely independent. It would be very hard for anyone in our country to argue that it is not independent. Perhaps more importantly, when we think about who the custodians of the future economic management of our country are, some people will say, 'That's definitely Malcolm Turnbull, because he's the Prime Minister,' and some people will say, 'That's definitely the Senate chamber, because they're parliamentarians and they're interested in the economic future, and they want to win elections and get the support of constituents.' I argue that it's trusted institutions like the Reserve Bank of Australia, which will be there when Senator Smith moves on, when Senator Duniam moves on and, indeed, when Malcolm Turnbull is no longer the Prime Minister. Trust in the corporate knowledge, trust in the judgement—the very informed and, I'd say, considered and cautious judgement—of institutions like the Reserve Bank of Australia is certainly something that guides my views on these issues. 


I'd like to share with the chamber and put on the public record a number of comments that the Reserve Bank of Australia made in a recent submission to the House of Representatives inquiry on homeownership. Its submission starts by saying:


The Bank recognises the importance of housing to the people of Australia. 


There'll be little or no argument in regard to that. It says:


Shelter is a fundamental human need, and purchasing the home one lives in is usually the largest financial investment a household will make. The affordability of suitable housing is, appropriately, a central concern of government policy …


So what we're dealing with here today is not just any bill, any piece of legislation. It goes to the heart of what is a core concern for every Australian—a core responsibility of every Australian government—and that is to make housing choices available to Australians. 


I want to share with you three points that were made in this particular Reserve Bank submission. The first point is what is happening to aggregate homeownership in our country. The second is to provide some context to the commentary we heard last night when we were debating this bill, and when Senator O'Neill did this afternoon, about the appropriateness of the taxation arrangements regarding housing and how they compare internationally. The third put this in the most important context: what is the demographic change that's been happening in our country not just for the last few years but over the last decades? How does that inform government decision-making and whether or not government decisions are properly accommodating the demographic change and, as best they can, trying to understand what that demographic change might look like in the future? 


If I turn briefly to the first point, the aggregate homeownership issue in Australia, the submission says:


The aggregate home ownership rate in Australia has been broadly steady since the 1960s. Prior to that date, the rate was much lower. The home ownership rate for typical first home buyer age groups has drifted down over several decades. The pace of decline has not increased noticeably recently, but the underlying drivers of the decline might have changed. These trends have been roughly offset by the ageing of the population, so that the overall home ownership rate has been stable.


That's interesting, because if you listen to some of the commentary in this place, but also the commentary more broadly, you would think that the homeownership rate in our country has been declining, or significantly declining. The RBA makes the very important point that aggregate homeownership in our country has actually remained stable. I put that point on the public record because I think it is important. If you listened to some contributions, you would think issues around housing and affordable access to housing are in a dramatic state of change. That's not true, and I use the aggregate homeownership point to demonstrate that there is a tremendous amount of underlying stability in our housing arrangements in Australia. But that's not to excuse the fact that demographic change—the ageing of the population, for example—is not an important issue and is not having a bearing on how we consider these issues into the future, and that is not to diminish the very, very important issue of homelessness in our country. 


Secondly, could I make a point in regard to the taxation arrangements in Australia and how they compare internationally. The Reserve Bank of Australia's submission makes this point: 


Housing, particularly owner-occupied housing, receives preferential taxation treatment in many countries, and Australia is no exception.


That's a true statement, and over the course of last night and this morning we've had people reflect on the appropriateness or otherwise of that taxation treatment. The submission further states:


Australia’s taxation system is also relatively generous—



but, before people get too excited, let me finish the quote—


to small investors in buy-to-let property compared with some other countries, because investors can deduct losses from their investments against wage income as well as other property income, and because capital gains are taxed at concessional rates. However, there are some other countries where the tax preference for investor property is even stronger than in Australia.


I make that point to remind people—and I will be the first to admit, perhaps a little dangerously: I do think taxation arrangements regarding homeownership in Australia are worthy of more detailed discussion. I'm going to put that right out there. Let's hope no-one's listening! I do think that—that's my honest opinion. But, more broadly, I make that point because I think it's important that we understand that, while on the surface of it, if you listened to some of the contributions last night, you would have thought that Australia had an overly generous taxation arrangement in regard to homeownership, that's not true. Yes, Australia does have a generous arrangement, but there are arrangements in other countries and other jurisdictions that are even stronger than Australia's. 


The third point I would like to reference is the comment the Reserve Bank of Australia made in regard to demographic change, and I think this is the most important one. I think of my parents' experience, marrying in the late 1960s and raising three children in the early 1970s, my father being a policeman for 35 years and my mother having the choice to stay home and raise three very young children in Perth's northern suburbs. In respect of their homeownership, as young parents they bought a very, very modest home in Perth's northern suburbs—a state housing commission home. It had two bedrooms; now it's got three. It was in what was then the urban sprawl in Western Australia. I remember very fondly, having come down from Port Hedland before I started primary school at the local school, driving up a deserted street, and there was our house—I think it was the second or third one in the street. I think about that experience compared to my sister's experience as a young parent raising two children in Perth's far northern suburbs and the choices they made—they are both working—about the sort of home they moved into. If you listen to my parents, my sister and my brother-in-law decided to opt for a much larger house on a much bigger block. I say that just to demonstrate that community attitudes change, and we know they change; we only have to look at our own family's experience. But I digress. 


I will share further comments made by the Reserve Bank of Australia in its submission to the House of Representatives inquiry on homeownership. It said:


Demographic change has been an especially important driver—


when considering homeownership issues in Australia. It continues:


In particular, the pronounced trend towards later marriage and family formation over the past 40 years or so would be expected to have reduced ownership rates. For example, the median age at first marriage for women rose from 20.9 years in 1974 to 27.9 years in 2010.


It goes on to some other commentary and reflection with regards to the immediate postwar experience. Then it goes on to say:


Whatever the cause, a trend to later marriage is likely to have resulted in deferred home purchase among younger people. Over recent decades there has also been an increase in the prevalence of single-adult households, particularly single-parent households, in part driven by significantly higher divorce rates since the 1970s. This trend is also likely to have weighed on the home ownership rate, as single adult households have a much lower tendency to own their own home.


In prefacing my contribution this afternoon, what I sought to do was reinforce the fact that, for my own consideration, I trust institutions like the Reserve Bank of Australia to give us the most impartial, nonpartisan view of the current dynamic with housing and this issue so that Australian governments can set policy direction; highlight the fact that demographic change is very, very important when considering what sort of legislative response we should have; add the arguments of the Reserve Bank to make the aggregate homeownership situation in Australia clear—we know from the evidence that it is stable and it is not in a state of serious decline, as some have tried to suggest; and put the taxation arrangements in their proper context, including how they fare compared to other international jurisdictions. 


I know my colleague Senator Duniam wants to make some brief remarks on this legislation as well, so I might just—




Senator Duniam:
  Don't let me hold you up.




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you, Senator Duniam. I might just make these last—



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  I'm waiting for an interjection from my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson. 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  We fell asleep!




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you very much, Senator Whish-Wilson. I'm happy to wake you up now! To put the legislation in context, I think it is important to think clearly about what the government is seeking to do and how it is seeking to do it. From the outset—and this won't be new news to senators in this place—the government is trying to create the right incentives around ownership of homes and housing choices for our country, and, importantly, to improve housing outcomes across the whole housing sector. This includes improving housing outcomes for first home buyers; improving housing choices and outcomes for those who choose to rent or are forced to rent; improving housing choices for older Australians who are looking to downsize—I think this is probably the one area where a better understanding of demographic change and the rate of that demographic change will inform government policy settings quite critically; and providing affordable and community housing to ameliorate the suffering that is caused by homelessness. Of course, we know that homelessness has many causes. Certainly, lack of access to home and shelter is important, but we know that there are mental health considerations and other sorts of things. Senator Whish-Wilson, I'm happy to share with you my own family's experience with homelessness, but that is for another time. 


We know that Australians deserve accommodation and housing choices, but at all times this reflects the changing lifestyle decisions that Australians make for themselves—the demographic change. In our own life cycles, as we move from being a young person to having a young family to having an established family and then to ageing, we know that those accommodation and housing choices necessarily change. Senator O'Neill talked about our superannuation system. It is a system that I am big enough to agree is a significant and important addition to our financial security, both as individuals and as a nation. I absolutely endorse that. These decisions the government has taken are informed and carefully constructed. Some would say they are modest, but I would say they are well designed and fine-tuned to make sure government is staying abreast of the housing needs of Australians, but also mindful of the fact that demographic change is driving a reconsideration of our attitudes around housing, and that is very, very important. So, with those few remarks, I will take my seat.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:17):  by leave—I move Liberal Democratic Party amendments (1) to (3) to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 on sheet 8317 revised together:


(1) Page 2 (after line 11), after clause 3, insert:




4 Review of operation of amendments



(1) The Minister must cause an independent review of the operation of the amendments made by this Act.


(2) The review must:


(a) start as soon as practicable after 18 months after Royal Assent; and


(b) be completed within 6 months.


(3) The Minister must cause a written report about the review to be prepared.


(4) The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the day on which the report is given to the Minister.


(5) The report is not a legislative instrument.


(2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (after line 7), after subsection 138-10(2), insert:


(2A) If the Commissioner determines that you have suffered a financial hardship, you are taken to have satisfied paragraph (2)(a).


(2B) The regulations may specify the circumstances in which the Commissioner is to determine that a person has suffered a financial hardship for the purposes of subsection (2A).


(3) Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (lines 16 to 19), omit section 138-15, substitute:




138-15 Review



If you are dissatisfied with:


(a) a *first home super saver determination in relation to you; or


(b) a decision the Commissioner makes not to make a determination under subsection 138-10(2A);


you may object against the determination, or the decision, as the case requires, in the manner set out in Part IVC.


The government's First Home Super Saver Scheme allows taxpayers to make one withdrawal in their lifetime from their voluntary superannuation contributions to purchase their first and only home. Item 2 of my amendments provides an exemption to the requirement it be a first home. The exemption will apply if the tax commissioner determines that the taxpayer has suffered financial hardship, the circumstances of which can be determined by regulation. I envisage that regulations would refer to circumstances where a taxpayer has limited savings, is currently renting and had an interest in a home many years ago in a cheaper real estate market or when a taxpayer was in a relationship that has since broken down. Taxpayers will still be limited to one withdrawal of their voluntary superannuation in their lifetime and it must be for their only home. This amendment will help people who are struggling to leave the rental market and buy their own home in the face of high property prices. The fact that they once owned their own home, possibly some decades ago, does not make their struggle any less stressful.


Item 3 of my amendments allows taxpayers to object if they are dissatisfied with a decision of the commissioner ruling that the taxpayer has not suffered financial hardship, and item 1 requires a review of this bill's First Home Super Saver Scheme and downsizer reform. My view is that taxpayers should be able to withdraw more of their voluntary superannuation contributions in more circumstances. I would also hope that it would recommend that more people can put more of the proceeds from the sale of a house into superannuation. I commend my amendments to the Senate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:19):  The government will support these amendments, firstly in relation to the statutory review of the scheme. Undertaking a review of the scheme is consistent with best-practice regulation. Independent review would provide the opportunity to determine whether the scheme is meeting the needs of first home savers and operating as intended. Further, in relation to access for people who have suffered severe financial hardship, allowing those who have suffered a serious financial setback to access the scheme gives them access to the same concessions as first home savers. As such, people are effectively starting over again. It is appropriate that they be treated as being in a similar position. Requiring the commissioner to have regard to any matters specified by regulation allows the government to set clear parameters around who is eligible to use the financial hardship rule. This will ensure that access to the rule can be appropriately targeted.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:20):  Labor will not be supporting these amendments. The amendments, while well-meaning, are an attempt to make the First Home Super Saver Scheme workable. Labor has a fundamental opposition to this legislation. This is, again, about this government seeking to undermine the superannuation system in this country. The government has legislation in the parliament that sets up an objective for superannuation that relates to retirement income. So, on one hand they're saying that superannuation is about retirement income, yet in this bill they want it to be for saving for a home.


This legislation contradicts the objective that this government is putting forward. No wonder we've heard nothing from the government recently on the objective of superannuation legislation. We will not support the First Home Super Saver Scheme legislation or attempts, however well-meaning, to improve this legislation. Unless this government deals with capital gains tax and negative gearing, young people who are trying to buy their first home will always be at a disadvantage against wealthy individuals who use capital gains tax and negative gearing to give themselves an advantage over young first home buyers. Young first home buyers are actually subsidising the investors who are going in there and using the tax loopholes to give themselves an advantage against first home buyers.


If this government were half serious about the issue affecting young people trying to buy their first home, if it were half serious about trying to deal with the ballooning prices in our major cities, then it would deal with capital gains tax and negative gearing. Billions of dollars of our money is going to investors to subsidise them, against young people trying to buy a home—over a 10-year period about $32 billion of taxpayer subsidy to rich investors, lining up weekend in weekend out against young home buyers who are trying to buy their first home. If the government were half serious about this it would deal with inclusionary zoning such that developers making billions of dollars out of developments would be required to provide a ratio of units or homes to people who need help for community housing. Do you ever hear them talk about that? No, you don't.


This is a government that doesn't have a clue about housing. This is a government that doesn't have a housing minister. This is a government that is so confused about how you deal with this issue that it just can't come up with any legitimate proposals to deal with it. This is a government that got rid of the National Rental Affordability Scheme that was on track to provide 50,000 affordable homes to Australians across the country. This is a government that says they'll introduce a bond aggregator. We agree about introducing a bond aggregator. But they are so dumb, they are so incompetent, that, although they say they will introduce a bond aggregator, they are doing nothing about the yield gap for low-income people—the yield gap that would need to be dealt with to allow the community housing industry to invest in housing for low-paid Australians.


Let's just deal with this issue of superannuation for a minute. We are talking about helping young people with their superannuation savings, but the average balance for a young person between the age of 18 and 24 is $6,789. That's what the ATO says the average balance is. So young people need to be putting money into superannuation for their future. That's the key issue in superannuation. If you are between 25 and 29, you've got a balance of $20,504. The reason these amounts are so low is that this mob across the chamber—this mob who are so concerned with their internal politics, are fighting each other, have a weak Prime Minister—are so consumed with their internal problems that they can't focus on the real issues for Australians: the cost of living, electricity prices, housing, education, homelessness, health. These are the issues that any government worth its salt would be dealing with. But this mob is totally incapable of dealing with those issues.


Those opposite are saying that if you put more money into your superannuation you'll get a tax advantage. When wages are stagnating, when workers can't get a pay rise and they are battling to put food on the table, how is this an answer to housing affordability? It is not. When you get Senator Cash on her feet—not so much lately, but she has been on a regular basis—attacking workers' rights to collectively bargain and increase their wages, attacking the trade union movement that helps drive wages up in this country, then no wonder we've got wage stagnation. These are big issues, and this government has got a very small view about the approach that should be taken, part of which is its attack on the superannuation system. 


We've got something like 500,000 Australians in either mortgage stress or rental stress—in other words, over 30 per cent of their income is going to pay their rent or pay their mortgage. You don't hear this government talk about that. They come in with piddling little schemes like this that have got no credibility, no focus on dealing with the big issues of housing and homelessness, and it is just clearly a demonstration of how out of touch this government is—not only the government but the Prime Minister of this country. It's all right for the Prime Minister, living in absolute luxury on the shores of Sydney Harbour, to talk about how people are doing it tough. He has never known what it's like to do it tough. He has never known what it's like not to be able to pay your mortgage, not to be able to pay your rent. This bill will not deal with those issues. 


For all of the good faith that Senator Leyonhjelm brings with his amendments to try and resolve the issue, the amendments are meaningless. The crossbench need to understand that this government is incapable of negotiating with the states and dealing with housing and homelessness in an effective way. The states are walking away from this government because they know that it hasn't got a clue; they know that it doesn't have the policies to deal with housing and homelessness in this country. They know that the government is leaderless. They know that the government doesn't have the policies that go to the key issues. They know this is a government that wants to give $65 billion to the big end of town—to big business—in tax cuts, while workers' wages are stagnating and when they want to put more tax on ordinary working people.


This government is an absolute rabble. It's an absolute disgrace. It's falling apart at the seams. It doesn't have the answers that ordinary Australians need from a government to deal with housing and homelessness. The state Liberal-National governments don't have confidence in this government, nor do the government's own members. The public doesn't have confidence in this government. To come here and argue that this is the way to deal with housing and homelessness and getting young people into their first home demonstrates how incompetent the government is on the economic issues that are affecting ordinary Australians in this country. The government needs to focus less on infighting and more on what is in the interests of Australians in this country so that ordinary Australians can look forward to pay increases and being able to pay their bills, put food on their table, send their kids to school and—maybe, once in a blue moon—have a holiday. But all this government wants to do is cut penalty rates, attack the trade union movement and come up with nonsensical positions like this to try and deal with housing and homelessness. It is an absolute disgrace.


No wonder the public is walking away from this government in droves. No wonder the public has no confidence in it—the government has no confidence in itself! The Liberals are fighting the Nationals, the Nationals are fighting the Liberals, and the Liberals are fighting each other. There is no continuity in this government. There are no broad policy parameters. They don't know what they stand for. They are an absolute disgrace as a government. If this is 'grown-up government', as they said when they came into power, they've failed to demonstrate it; they're still in kindergarten, this mob. In fact, kindergarten kids are better behaved. Kindergarten kids know they've got to get on with each other. This mob don't. This mob don't know how to run a government. They are totally incompetent and out of touch. To come here with nonsensical propositions like this and say, 'We are doing something about housing prices' demonstrates what a bunch of tricksters they are.


They try and trick the public day in, day out. All they're interested in is the big end of town that puts money into their election coffers. All they're interested in is making sure the banks get off without a royal commission for years, and, when the banks finally give them permission to run a royal commission, they have terms of reference that will make sure the banks are not put under any pressure. They have a time scale in the royal commission that ensures the banks will not be put under any pressure, because it's a deal between the government and the banks. The terms of reference were worked out between the banks and the government only 24 hours before they announced the royal commission that they were saying they wouldn't have.


How can you believe this government on anything? How can anyone have confidence that this government is acting in the best interests of first home buyers? How can anyone believe this government ever acts in the interests of the community? It simply wants to attack unions, workers and those who are falling through the cracks in society—the weak people who don't have an opportunity to get a job. The government's social security amendments are ridiculous; they're all about attacking the weakest and most vulnerable in our community. This mob does not have a clue. This amendment will not resolve the problems. But One Nation will cuddle up to them and vote for it. One Nation do nothing for those who are down and out in this country. One Nation attack the unions. They are their best mates in this place—One Nation and the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party have even sold out the National Party to cuddle up to One Nation. They are an absolute disgrace and don't deserve to be in power.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-12-05,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (13:35):  I just want to put a few facts straight. It's quite interesting to listen to the comments of the Labor Party, as if they're all for the battlers. I don't take sides in this house, whether it's the government side or the opposition side. My job in this house is to bring accountability for the people of Australia. It's quite interesting to hear that Senator Cameron and the Labor Party are not backing this. It's basically a savings for first home buyers so that they can, as a tax deduction, as well, to them, put it into their savings account, into their superannuation, so that they can actually draw on that money to then buy a house, if they wish. I think it's a wonderful idea. It's going to encourage people to save for their first home. It will help them tax wise, as well.


This has nothing to do with any other superannuation program or any other issues that the government may want to put across with their superannuation. This is about helping people to be able to save to buy a home—their first home. As Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments address, if you've had a house previously you're not going to be stopped from buying a second one further down the track if you face financial difficulties, or if you've been through a divorce or for whatever reasons. I think that's commendable in the amendments Senator Leyonhjelm is putting forward, which we will be supporting.


When Senator Cameron says, 'They don't care about the housing market and big investors, and they're not looking after them,' let me draw him back to what Minister Chris Bowen and the Labor Party did. For any foreign developers in this country—and we have so many Chinese over here, plus other developers; but they are mainly Chinese, with all the high-rise buildings going up in Melbourne—they actually changed the laws to say that, instead of 50 per cent of the property having to be bought up by Australian homeowners, the whole lot can be sold to foreign investors.' Oh, they're worried about the battlers! They were worried about Australians owning their own homes! No, they didn't. On top of that, there was no stamp duty paid on those units. So this is Labor worrying about Australians owning their own homes. They changed the laws so that all of that development could be sold to foreign investors.


Since the government have been in here—and I supported them—that has been changed. Fifty per cent of those development sites must be sold to Australians. You also talk about how they're doing nothing for anyone else. With the foreign investment that's happened in this country, especially in buying up our prime agricultural land, it was okay under Labor. They could buy anything up to $240 million. So they allowed the foreign investors into the country. It was under the coalition—I think it was under Prime Minister Abbott—that it was reduced to $15 million. I think it's still over the top, but at least they reduced it. So where was Labor on supporting our prime agricultural land? Nowhere to be seen.


Another thing is they talk about looking after everyone. The reason for the high cost of living—for which I will have a go at both Labor and the government—is high immigration. Until you actually reduce the immigration numbers coming into this country, our housing will continue to go up and up. We cannot provide the amount of housing that we require for our own Australians and also allow for foreign investors, plus the immigration levels.


You talk about pay cuts to hard-earning workers. But it's alright for the union to take these hardworking Australians' union fees to pay people to work on polling booths for a day at $400 a day. Where are all those union fees going? What about the Craig Thomsons who use the moneys from workers' union fees to pay for prostitutes or whatever? So don't you talk about workers.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator HANSON:
  I remember a motion was put here in the parliament—moved by Senator Cory Bernardi and supported by One Nation and, I believe, Senator Jacqui Lambie—that there'd be not a cut but a freeze on politicians' wages until the budget was in surplus. There were six on this side agreeing to it. Where was Labor? Where was everyone else? On that side. So you weren't prepared to take a freeze on your wages.




Senator Cameron:
  You've made your money with the Electoral Commission.




Senator HANSON:
  This is Labor, really worried about the battler out there.




Senator Cameron:
  You've made your money.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senator Hanson, resume your seat for a moment, please. Order on my left! Senators are entitled to be heard in silence. Senator Hanson.




Senator HANSON:
  Thank you very much, Acting Deputy Chair. So it's all right for Labor to say they're out there for the battlers and everything else. No, they're not. You don't lead by example. You actually say a lot of things that aren't true. You talk about the rise and then don't address the electricity costs. Let me tell you that it's Labor in Queensland who have seen electricity prices rise by 200 per cent. It is because the powerlines and poles are owned by the state government—Labor. Forty-nine per cent of the power bill goes into the coffers of the Labor government. One Nation wanted to drop the price by 20 per cent. It could be dropped by 20 per cent, but, no, they're putting billions of dollars into the coffers. It's actually $1.5 billion a year out of the pockets of mums and dads and pensioners and businesses. You speak to your colleagues in Queensland, if they get back into government, and say that, unless they reduce the price of electricity, a number of businesses are going to go under: a fertiliser company; Boyne Smelters are going under; and there's another big business in Rockhampton that makes springs. They're actually struggling to pay their power bills.


You talk about jobs. What did you do to increase apprenticeship schemes when you were in government? Absolutely nothing. And it was under Labor that the 457 visa holder numbers increased in Australia. You brought people into the country who shouldn't have been here taking up jobs that should belong to Australian people. So don't you sit there and criticise. This superannuation bill is going to be very good for those people to be able to save their money—



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator HANSON:
  and they can have the opportunity to buy their first home. Why don't you support that?




Senator Cameron:
  I'm criticising you—your racism.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Order! Senator Hanson, please resume your seat. We need some silence on my left. The senator is entitled to be heard. Senator Hanson.




Senator HANSON:
  Thank you very much. When you hit the bone, it really hurts, doesn't it? They can't cop it. They want to dish it out to One Nation all the time. One Nation are here and we will support good legislation. When the Labor Party decide to put up good legislation—well, they won't until they're on the other side of the benches; they've got to get from that side to the other side—I'll consider supporting their legislation. They don't even attempt to put up commonsense amendments to try to help the legislation; they just knock it on the head. So, everyone out there who wants to own their own home, forget about it because Labor is not supporting you. They're too busy looking after their union mates and the delegates who end up in this place and on the benches in here, and then they forget about the hard workers out there. 


The whole thing is: this is a good proposition; it's a good bill to help people get into their own homes. But we've got to start looking at the immigration level coming into Australia. We've got foreign students. We've got about a million in the country who are buying their own housing. This is having an impact on affordable housing. You've got state taxes and stamp duty which are also having an impact on it. There are many reasons for this. This is a good bill for superannuation to help people get into their own home. I support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments to this and I support the government on their bill.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (13:44):  I'm really not sure what Senator Hanson's contribution, especially towards the latter end, had to do with housing, homeless, trying to reduce the cost of housing or helping young people get into a house. It was typical of Senator Hanson. She just gets up and doesn't know what she is talking about. She hasn't got a clue. It is typical One Nation. They have to bring in racism and immigration into the argument, because they've got nothing else going for them. It is either climate change denial, racism or attack the unions. They cuddle up to the coalition. That's all One Nation does. They may as well be a branch of the Liberal Party. They vote with the Liberal Party at every opportunity they get. Look at the votes in this place. They vote with the Liberals on every issue. On any issue that harms working people and any issue that looks after the big end of town One Nation are in there.


The hypocrisy of Senator Hanson coming in here and talking about anyone taking money off the government. Have a look at how much money One Nation and Senator Hanson have milked out of the electoral process over the years. She has become a millionaire through that process. She doesn't know what a battler is. She doesn't care about battlers in this place. Senator Hanson only looks after Senator Hanson. 


Senator Hanson would destroy the trade union movement and would destroy workers' capacity to bargain. What would that do to young people getting into their home? I can tell you that when I was on the tools, when I was a blue-collar fitter, my penalty rates and overtime gave me the opportunity to save for a home. Yet what have they done? They have voted against these issues. One Nation were so embarrassed they had to vote against the penalty rate cuts, but prior to that they had been supporting cuts to penalty rates constantly. They were constantly supporting cuts to penalty rates. It just makes my blood boil when I see someone who has milked the system—like Senator Hanson, for every cent she can get out of the system—have the gall to come in here and criticise anyone else. It is an absolute disgrace.


All she is doing is cuddling up to the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party cuddle up to her. They cannot get around there quick enough to throw their arm around her. They can't get around there quick enough to cuddle up to Senator Hanson and One Nation, even if that is at the expense of the National Party, your party, Mr Temporary Chairman O'Sullivan. We have seen them cuddling up to One Nation: 'Forget about the traditional coalition. Forget about the National Party. Let's cuddle up to One Nation.' That's what they do.


They haven't got a clue about how to deal with the key issue, which is how we deal with housing and homelessness in this country. When was the last time you heard a senior minister in this government talk about housing and homelessness? I'll tell you when. It was at the last budget when they put up a grab bag of policies that would not make one difference to housing affordability in this country. They put up a grab bag of policies and the experts who looked at it said that you would need an electron microscope to see what difference this would make to housing prices. 


This mob care about only the banks. They care about only the big end of town. They care about only the people who are putting money into their pocket to run elections. That's all they do. If you want to see how they deal with housing and homelessness, look at New South Wales. In New South Wales developers were constantly feeding money into coalition election campaigns. When the law was changed to ban donations from developers, what did they do? They met the developers in Newcastle in the back seat of the developers' Bentley and got brown paper bags stuffed with $10,000 to push into their election coffers, breaching the law.


This mob don't care about getting young people into homes. This mob are more interested in getting money from developers and builders. If they actually cared about housing and homelessness, they would have done something over the last four-and-a-bit years. They're into their fifth year of government, and they've done nothing of any substance to help working-class people get into a home. All they've done is stand back and watch house prices going through the roof and young people being pushed out. What we are seeing now is young people having to take accommodation that they would never have been forced into years ago. They want to save on rent, so they go down the housing ladder and they push unemployed people and the working poor out onto the streets.


When we see the results of the census on housing and homelessness, I bet that housing and homelessness will have increased exponentially in this country. Yet we never hear the government talking about these issues. They come here with these nonsensical pieces of legislation that will not deliver on housing affordability and will not assist young people get into their homes.


They've come up with a bond aggregate. The Treasurer, Mr Morrison, during the last break, headed off to the UK, to London, supposedly to look at what a bond aggregator could deliver. It was a nice little trip over to London. He was probably having a look at where Senator Brandis would live when he goes off to London. Mr Morrison was over in London supposedly looking at what's going to happen in the context of a bond aggregator. Labor didn't need to go to London to find out how a bond aggregator worked, because experts have been out here telling us how a bond aggregator works in the UK. We've had housing forums here where expert after expert has taken us through how a bond aggregator works. But the Treasurer had to go off to London during the holidays to have a look at this. What a load of nonsense! He didn't have to go to London at all. The experts from overseas had been here—and we've got our own Australian experts in this area.


The bond aggregator, which might help reduce costs for the community housing industry to provide housing for low-income people, social security recipients and the working poor, is still not enough to fund homes for poor people in this country. You never hear this mob talk about that, because they're not interested. In their five years in government they have not brought one piece of substantive legislation on housing and homelessness to this parliament. All they've done is cuddle up to the developers and the builders to make sure that they get money from the developers and builders to fund their next election campaign. That's what this mob are about.


They don't care about working-class people who can't get a house. They don't care about older women who end up with no income and no substantial superannuation and end up on the streets. They don't care about that. I've never heard a speech from them on that in all the time I've been here. They don't care about young Australians who have been in out-of-home care, end up leaving out-of-home care at 18 and end up on the streets with no experience, no job and no security. As a number of the NGOs have said to me, they end up being groomed by some of the hard heads out on the streets—young women being groomed out on our streets. Do you ever hear a coalition politician talk about that? No, you don't. What do you hear them talking about? You hear them talking about destroying the trade union movement and attacking the capacity of workers to bargain and get a decent wage to save for a home. That's what you hear out of this mob.


Senator Cash is on her feet in this parliament, day in and day out, attacking the trade union movement, attacking the working-class and attacking workers' capacity to bargain. That's what we get from this rabble of a government—this government that hasn't got a clue; this government with a weak leader; this government with a leader who won't even stand up for his own principles, won't stand up for his own values, and capitulates to whoever stands him up. That's all we get from this government. We don't get any action on the interests of working people in this country. They're too busy wanting to hand over $65 billion to the big end of town in tax cuts and hope that the trickle-down effect will work.


The trickle-down effect didn't work in America under Ronald Reagan, and it certainly won't work here under Prime Minister Turnbull. He just capitulates to every right-wing piece of ideology that he can. And, on the way through, all he's doing is protecting his own backside to make sure that he stays in parliament as the Prime Minister as long as he possibly can, avoiding an election and avoiding any capacity to deal with the real issues for working people in this country. One Nation is taking over as the major influence on the Liberal Party, with the National Party capitulating to this. They are bystanders while Pauline Hanson's One Nation takes over as the coalition member determining what policies Prime Minister Turnbull will deal with.


This is an absolute disgrace of a government. They don't deal effectively with health issues, they don't deal effectively with education, they don't deal effectively with the infrastructure to get people from point A to point B and they don't deal effectively with the economy. They go from increasing the GST to handing over taxation to the states—that lasted for a couple of weeks. They don't have any competent, intellectually based, economic policy. All they do is come in here, attack the trade union movement and simply mislead, as Senator Cash has done on five occasions. All they do is set up these supposedly independent organisations—which are stacked with Liberal Party staff so that the Liberal Party's position is the position that is determined by these 'independent' bodies—to attack their political opponents, to attack ordinary working people in this country and to attack the trade union movement. They are an absolute rabble and an absolute disgrace, and the sooner they're kicked out the better. (Time expired)

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:31):  The idea from the movie Groundhog Day is something that I think is a modern trope that everybody understands—where you have to keep going over the same thing, and eventually, sometimes, the lesson gets learnt. So, it's an act of hope, I suppose, that I come into the chamber this afternoon to say, 'We need to talk about superannuation.' We need to keep talking about superannuation to this government because, when it started, they didn't understand it, and through the progress of the years, they've tried to impede its growth and development over and over.


Yesterday, we saw them really trying to have a go at Industry Super, which is delivering a two per cent to three per cent better result for its members than the banks are doing with the superannuation that they look after in the retail sector. We saw them wanting to attack that. And here we are again, and I'm going to have to do it all over again because this government—the Liberal-National coalition—do not understand what the people in the gallery and across this nation understand, which is that superannuation is a very important investment for Australians. We understand it. We know how important it is. They shouldn't be treating it like a little piggy bank that they can raid whenever they get the opportunity. As soon as they get into government, they go after superannuation. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 is another attack on superannuation, and it reveals, once again, that this is a government that just doesn't get it.


Back to the history—superannuation is a Labor idea, implemented by a Labor government all that time ago under Paul Keating. Let me tell you, I grew up in the western suburbs, in the working-class suburbs. My father was an Irish immigrant. He ran a small business. He employed lots of people. There was not much talk about superannuation in our house. I didn't know what a public servant was. Superannuation wasn't something that we knew. But Paul Keating did. And as a leader in the Labor Party, he put a marker in the line of the history of this country and said, 'We are going to build a superannuation system that will support Australians, who will be able to retire with dignity.' Australians who didn't have great wealth already, Australians who were just going to work hard all their life, look after their families, contribute to their community, pay their tax—those Australians. The real ones. The ones on whose back this country has been built. They're the ones that Paul Keating was standing up for with his visionary view of what could happen if we actually did invest in superannuation.


The government from the beginning completely opposed this. They had all sorts of claims: the economy would collapse, small business would never survive and we'd ruin jobs and the future of the nation if we instituted superannuation. But here it is, down the track, and every Australian today—even young people who are starting on their first jobs, hopefully in a retail situation where they join the union, the SDA, and start to contribute to their superannuation—with a $2 trillion set of funds in superannuation are in a vastly different position than they were when this government decried superannuation in the first instance.


We started off with a small amount. Incrementally, we got up a little higher. Labor wanted to get to 12 per cent. As soon as Tony Abbott came in, that whole incremental increase stopped. When you change the government and you put this lot in, it changes your economic future in a very bad way if you're an ordinary working Australian. And they'll come up with all these little distracters, gifts and cute arguments, and they'll pretend that they're great economic managers. But I'll tell you who they're great economic managers for: people who've already got a hell of a lot of money. They're great economic managers for the banks. They've stood and waited for the banks to tell them, 'Okay, we're ready for a royal commission, and this is what we'd like it to look like.' That's the sort of government this Liberal-Nationals government is. Instead of doing the right thing by Australians, they pull a con job as often as they can.


That is why Labor of course does not support these bills that are before the house right now. I know that people across this country are concerned about the affordability of housing. Well, let me tell you, in the last period when Labor was in government we built over 20,000 houses. We still haven't caught up on what John Howard had taken away. The minute they get in, they cut investment in housing. And we've got this same attrition of housing access and housing affordability under a government that continues to claim economic credentials that it simply doesn't have. These bills that we are debating today will do absolutely nothing to reduce pressure on housing affordability—unlike what the government is signalling in the bizarre title of this bill. This is what it's called: the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill. Well, that's the first deception. With this legislation they're not doing what the title suggests. And that's what you get: you get this sort of front. But you've got to be a bit smarter than that. Don't accept what they say, because behind that front is always an attack on the life of ordinary hardworking Australians—the people the Labor Party stands up for.


Alongside not addressing housing affordability, with this piece of legislation they're looking to ruin another bit of our world-class superannuation system. These bills show that the government doesn't understand the purpose of the superannuation system, as I said in my opening remarks. This bill will do one thing. It'll undermine Australia's superannuation system, and Labor cannot and will not support it, because it's only the Labor Party that will always fight to protect your superannuation. For men and women, Labor is the party of universal compulsory superannuation. We decided that it was an important thing. We invested in it, we made it happen, we legislated for it, we've protected it, we've grown it and we've nurtured it, until we were in the position that we are, with a sound and solid superannuation system. There's more work to do to make it better. But every time this government gets in, they try to whittle it away, and this is another example of an attempt to whittle it away.


We know that Australia's housing affordability issue is something that wrests the mind of every Australian, whether you're a young person who says, 'I wonder if I'm actually going to be able to afford a house like my parents,' or whether you're a parent who says: 'I'm so proud to be an Australian, I love this country, I'm so glad I grew up here and I'm really happy that I was able to afford a house, but what about my kids? Will they have a chance? Will their children have a chance?'


Grandparents are saying, 'This is not the kind of situation that I thought I'd see in my country.' Instead of really addressing the fundamental problems we have around housing with carefully considered strategy, we have this government of dysfunction, disunity and chaos cobbling up misnamed bills and pretending to do something good for the Australian people. 


The Labor Party has led the genuine debate about affordable housing. We've committed, in opposition, to important negative gearing and capital gains tax reforms—critical to keeping the pressure down on prices and making sure that people can afford a home, and ensuring that the taxation system shouldn't support people who have multiple opportunities to grow their wealth through many, many houses while young people in our country can't get their foot on the ladder to buy their very first house. The Labor Party is committed to making the taxation system fairer and to helping ensure ordinary Australian men and women can afford to buy a house and can have financial security for their families not just at the time they purchase a house but at the time that they grow their wealth over the course of their life and by the time they retire. That's what superannuation is about. It's about making sure that every Australian is in a position to retire with dignity. Before Keating made that happen, that was not the case in this country. 


Instead of addressing the housing affordability issue, the government is exploiting the taxation structure of the superannuation system through this bill, and its exploitation goes against the purpose of superannuation. We all know that the superannuation tax structure is quite generous. It offers incentives through the tax system as an important way to encourage Australians to save for their retirement, and that is particularly important in a system where contributions are compulsory. There's a flat and generous taxation structure on the superannuation system, and it's meant to create an incentive so that people save for their retirement understanding that the dollars that they put in are taxed at a lower rate than they might be paying on their actual wages. The government argues that the purpose of super is to provide income in retirement to substitute or supplement the age pension—that's in the government's objective statement on the bill. But we, in Labor, see this superannuation system as much more important—much more than just that one goal. Older Australians who've worked all their lives should retire not in poverty; they should retire with financial security and, above all, with the dignity of savings that they've accumulated over time that have been invested wisely, that have grown their wealth, so they can make the choices they want to make, they deserve to make, in their retirement. 


The taxation structure facilities that will allow that are ones that Labor supports—but not this bill. We know that most of those people in the top tax brackets gain the most benefit from taxation structures around superannuation. With that background, how is opening up the super system to people to put more money in it going to help those who cannot afford a home? The title 'the first home super bill' is a complete misrepresentation. It will not help young people on low to middle incomes in Australia purchase a home. In fact, researchers who look at the impacts of government decisions on superannuation have argued that it could lead to exactly what we don't want to occur—an increase in house prices, putting more pressure on families and also putting more pressure on the age pension. Instead of focusing on the structural issues that are facing our superannuation system, we can see through this bill that the government remains focused on repurposing or redesigning the system, ignoring its ultimate purpose for the Australian people. The current superannuation system is facing some challenges. It needs work to make it fit for purpose for our time. 


One of the big problems we face—I want to put this on the record today when I know many of my colleagues are wearing white ribbons as we talk about women, about equity for women and opposing domestic violence—is that there's a huge gender gap. We have to make sure that women in retirement are safe, that if they need to they can make choices to leave unsafe relationships. That is a real issue that the government should be dealing with, and I wish I were in here talking on a bill addressing that problem. But we're not going to see it from this government. We're going to see something dressed up as something else and we're going to see an erosion of good policy for ordinary, hardworking Australians.


The facts demand reporting here. We know that women, on average, retire with around half the superannuation of men. That's just not acceptable. They do a lot more than half the work in many, many situations—certainly around the house. That remains the evidence we see: full-time working women doing many more hours of housework at home than their partners. Of course, those opposite will say, 'Well, they can just rely on their partner.' But that is a comment from another time. That is not the Australia that I've brought my daughters up to be a part of, as equal participants in creating the knowledge, the community and the wealth of this nation. Women are entitled. There are 50 per cent of us; it should be fifty-fifty. That's not the case in superannuation. In fact, older single women are one of the fastest-growing cohorts of people living in poverty. The Labor Party believes that financial independence is a critical goal that we must strive towards for this group of Australians.


The gender pay gap is a factor of interrupted work patterns and insecure work for women. Those are the things that cause the gap. It has been caused in part by cultural norms around what a woman's 'proper place' is. It cannot be into the future, but it's something that we're dealing with at this point in time—the legacy of that attitude. Until we have a proper change in cultural attitudes towards women and men in the workplace and with regard to superannuation, we should focus on ensuring the superannuation system works for all Australians—not just those working full-time, who are predominantly men; not just those in high-paying jobs, who are predominantly men; and not just those in continuous employment, who, sadly, are predominantly men. Things can change. Things will change. Paul Keating instituted superannuation. What a change that turned out to be! But we've got to set our sights on the right goals, not the sorts of goals that this bill seeks to achieve.


One union that is so often maligned by those opposite but is standing up and fighting for ordinary Australians is the SDA. Time and time again it's spoken about the need to ensure the gender gap in retirement is eradicated. With around 60 per cent of its members being women working in the retail sector, it is very well placed to fight for the rights and equity of those women. One of the things that unions do—unlike the ridiculous caricature of unions that we constantly hear from the other side—is invest in the intellectual work of putting together submissions to the important work that this parliament does. They put on the record what's happening to working people. The SDA did this work. It got together a submission to the Standing Committee on Economics in which it recommended that superannuation actually be paid on paid and unpaid parental leave. They said:


Women's participation in both paid employment and unpaid caring responsibilities must be genuinely acknowledged and reflected in meaningful policy outcomes to ensure that women are not relegated to a life of poverty and distress in their retirement years.


I don't know how anyone in this chamber—whether they are a clerk working here; the Deputy President; one of the staff in the advisers' boxes, who are here supporting us; the person doing the Hansard; or a person in the gallery—could disagree with that. We actually believe in egalitarianism in this country. But, instead of doing something about that, the government are sitting here trying to take away the capacity of superannuation to deliver a decent, dignified retirement for all Australians. They're not dealing with the gender equity gap; they're just turning a blind eye to it. Mind you, it's pretty easy to turn a blind eye to it when you've got hardly any women in your party. That's another difference between the government and the Labor Party. Unlike this government, the Labor Party believes in pursuing proactive policy settings in superannuation that equitably maximise retirement incomes and seek to address the structural labour market disadvantages that women face. When you're in part-time employment, when you're not guaranteed employment, when you take leave to have children, that pulls you back. We need to do something about that, we need a vision for that, and we're not going to see it from those opposite.


Labor also believes in the necessity of superannuation to fund decent retirements for people who are challenged by the changes of automation and technology. We need to embrace the advantages of innovation when it grows our economy. We need to make sure that the technological changes that are part of our time create new roles and great jobs for the men and women of Australia. We know that, to make that happen, we have to invest in education. That's not what we're seeing from those opposite. They're not saying, 'Let's skill up, let's increase the wealth of the nation.' These guys are saying: 'Let's raid the piggy bank of superannuation, because the people are too dumb to figure out that, if they put the money away now, it'll affect them in retirement. We'll get away with this. We'll look like we're doing something about housing.' That's how cynical this bill is. They're attempting a little swiftie: 'Don't worry, the Australian people won't notice.'


I'm sure the Australian people are beginning to wake up to the fact that they cannot trust this government. This government lacks unity. It's eating itself alive. The Nats are fighting against the Liberals. This government has no vision for superannuation and has never had a vision for superannuation for the people from Curran Road, Blacktown, where I grew up, where no-one talked about superannuation. People are talking about superannuation now, because Labor put it on the agenda, and I reckon they're smart enough to figure out that this government doesn't give a toss for ordinary working people and their superannuation needs. This bill is another example of the fact that this Liberal Party, under Malcolm Turnbull, just doesn't get it.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-12-05,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:51):  Thank you, Senator O'Neill, for that very enthusiastic discussion of the benefits of superannuation in our country. I'd be the first one to join with you in acknowledging what former Prime Minister Keating did when he was Treasurer. I think superannuation has a very strong and sound place not just in our financial system, where it provides future investment opportunities in important projects, but in the benefit it has given ordinary Australians like my parents. I was born and bred in a working-class part of Perth, in Perth's northern suburbs, and am proud to say that my parents still live in their home of the last 40-odd years, with a very modest extension that allowed their two elder sons to not have to share a room anymore. These are the lived experiences of Australians. We know that providing Australians with affordable housing choices is a critical work program of any Australian government, and I'm pleased that this coalition government, led by Malcolm Turnbull, is doing exactly that. Giving Australians affordable housing choices and addressing other housing issues has been front and centre in the work of this coalition government and of Treasurer Scott Morrison, supported by the assistant minister, Michael Sukkar.


In the brief time available to me this afternoon I will share with the chamber what the government is seeking to do with these pieces of legislation and how the government proposes to do that. While the contributions of other senators with regard to the historical policy development in this area and broader economic areas provide interesting content for senators like myself to listen to, I think it is important that we focus on the current situation and how that informs our future policymaking. I'll speak briefly about that, drawing on some of the comments that the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer made in the last fortnight to the Australian Property Investors conference and also focus a little on the important issue of supply. I'm one of those people that believes discussions around housing access necessarily involve a discussion about the supply of land available for future housing stock. In addition to that I will talk about some commentary that has been made by the Reserve Bank of Australia in a submission to the House of Representatives inquiry into homeownership.


It doesn't matter what particular economic debate it is that we have to face in this chamber; it necessarily requires us to make decisions or choices about what sort of information we are going to rely upon in order to inform our decisions. We heard from Senator O'Neill that she puts a lot of faith in the informed or researched views of some elements of the trade union movement. I'm not saying whether that's right or wrong. I'm just reminding people that when we come to debate particular issues in this chamber we bring our own world view. 


For my own part, I prefer to trust the judgements and historical evidence that have been accumulated by organisations like the Reserve Bank of Australia. I rely on the information that's brought forward in public debates and discourse from the Reserve Bank for a number of reasons. I do think that they have a corporate knowledge around these issues that is built on access to very substantial evidence that other stakeholders don't necessarily have. 


I regard the Reserve Bank as genuinely independent. It would be very hard for anyone in our country to argue that it is not independent. Perhaps more importantly, when we think about who the custodians of the future economic management of our country are, some people will say, 'That's definitely Malcolm Turnbull, because he's the Prime Minister,' and some people will say, 'That's definitely the Senate chamber, because they're parliamentarians and they're interested in the economic future, and they want to win elections and get the support of constituents.' I argue that it's trusted institutions like the Reserve Bank of Australia, which will be there when Senator Smith moves on, when Senator Duniam moves on and, indeed, when Malcolm Turnbull is no longer the Prime Minister. Trust in the corporate knowledge, trust in the judgement—the very informed and, I'd say, considered and cautious judgement—of institutions like the Reserve Bank of Australia is certainly something that guides my views on these issues. 


I'd like to share with the chamber and put on the public record a number of comments that the Reserve Bank of Australia made in a recent submission to the House of Representatives inquiry on homeownership. Its submission starts by saying:


The Bank recognises the importance of housing to the people of Australia. 


There'll be little or no argument in regard to that. It says:


Shelter is a fundamental human need, and purchasing the home one lives in is usually the largest financial investment a household will make. The affordability of suitable housing is, appropriately, a central concern of government policy …


So what we're dealing with here today is not just any bill, any piece of legislation. It goes to the heart of what is a core concern for every Australian—a core responsibility of every Australian government—and that is to make housing choices available to Australians. 


I want to share with you three points that were made in this particular Reserve Bank submission. The first point is what is happening to aggregate homeownership in our country. The second is to provide some context to the commentary we heard last night when we were debating this bill, and when Senator O'Neill did this afternoon, about the appropriateness of the taxation arrangements regarding housing and how they compare internationally. The third put this in the most important context: what is the demographic change that's been happening in our country not just for the last few years but over the last decades? How does that inform government decision-making and whether or not government decisions are properly accommodating the demographic change and, as best they can, trying to understand what that demographic change might look like in the future? 


If I turn briefly to the first point, the aggregate homeownership issue in Australia, the submission says:


The aggregate home ownership rate in Australia has been broadly steady since the 1960s. Prior to that date, the rate was much lower. The home ownership rate for typical first home buyer age groups has drifted down over several decades. The pace of decline has not increased noticeably recently, but the underlying drivers of the decline might have changed. These trends have been roughly offset by the ageing of the population, so that the overall home ownership rate has been stable.


That's interesting, because if you listen to some of the commentary in this place, but also the commentary more broadly, you would think that the homeownership rate in our country has been declining, or significantly declining. The RBA makes the very important point that aggregate homeownership in our country has actually remained stable. I put that point on the public record because I think it is important. If you listened to some contributions, you would think issues around housing and affordable access to housing are in a dramatic state of change. That's not true, and I use the aggregate homeownership point to demonstrate that there is a tremendous amount of underlying stability in our housing arrangements in Australia. But that's not to excuse the fact that demographic change—the ageing of the population, for example—is not an important issue and is not having a bearing on how we consider these issues into the future, and that is not to diminish the very, very important issue of homelessness in our country. 


Secondly, could I make a point in regard to the taxation arrangements in Australia and how they compare internationally. The Reserve Bank of Australia's submission makes this point: 


Housing, particularly owner-occupied housing, receives preferential taxation treatment in many countries, and Australia is no exception.


That's a true statement, and over the course of last night and this morning we've had people reflect on the appropriateness or otherwise of that taxation treatment. The submission further states:


Australia’s taxation system is also relatively generous—



but, before people get too excited, let me finish the quote—


to small investors in buy-to-let property compared with some other countries, because investors can deduct losses from their investments against wage income as well as other property income, and because capital gains are taxed at concessional rates. However, there are some other countries where the tax preference for investor property is even stronger than in Australia.


I make that point to remind people—and I will be the first to admit, perhaps a little dangerously: I do think taxation arrangements regarding homeownership in Australia are worthy of more detailed discussion. I'm going to put that right out there. Let's hope no-one's listening! I do think that—that's my honest opinion. But, more broadly, I make that point because I think it's important that we understand that, while on the surface of it, if you listened to some of the contributions last night, you would have thought that Australia had an overly generous taxation arrangement in regard to homeownership, that's not true. Yes, Australia does have a generous arrangement, but there are arrangements in other countries and other jurisdictions that are even stronger than Australia's. 


The third point I would like to reference is the comment the Reserve Bank of Australia made in regard to demographic change, and I think this is the most important one. I think of my parents' experience, marrying in the late 1960s and raising three children in the early 1970s, my father being a policeman for 35 years and my mother having the choice to stay home and raise three very young children in Perth's northern suburbs. In respect of their homeownership, as young parents they bought a very, very modest home in Perth's northern suburbs—a state housing commission home. It had two bedrooms; now it's got three. It was in what was then the urban sprawl in Western Australia. I remember very fondly, having come down from Port Hedland before I started primary school at the local school, driving up a deserted street, and there was our house—I think it was the second or third one in the street. I think about that experience compared to my sister's experience as a young parent raising two children in Perth's far northern suburbs and the choices they made—they are both working—about the sort of home they moved into. If you listen to my parents, my sister and my brother-in-law decided to opt for a much larger house on a much bigger block. I say that just to demonstrate that community attitudes change, and we know they change; we only have to look at our own family's experience. But I digress. 


I will share further comments made by the Reserve Bank of Australia in its submission to the House of Representatives inquiry on homeownership. It said:


Demographic change has been an especially important driver—


when considering homeownership issues in Australia. It continues:


In particular, the pronounced trend towards later marriage and family formation over the past 40 years or so would be expected to have reduced ownership rates. For example, the median age at first marriage for women rose from 20.9 years in 1974 to 27.9 years in 2010.


It goes on to some other commentary and reflection with regards to the immediate postwar experience. Then it goes on to say:


Whatever the cause, a trend to later marriage is likely to have resulted in deferred home purchase among younger people. Over recent decades there has also been an increase in the prevalence of single-adult households, particularly single-parent households, in part driven by significantly higher divorce rates since the 1970s. This trend is also likely to have weighed on the home ownership rate, as single adult households have a much lower tendency to own their own home.


In prefacing my contribution this afternoon, what I sought to do was reinforce the fact that, for my own consideration, I trust institutions like the Reserve Bank of Australia to give us the most impartial, nonpartisan view of the current dynamic with housing and this issue so that Australian governments can set policy direction; highlight the fact that demographic change is very, very important when considering what sort of legislative response we should have; add the arguments of the Reserve Bank to make the aggregate homeownership situation in Australia clear—we know from the evidence that it is stable and it is not in a state of serious decline, as some have tried to suggest; and put the taxation arrangements in their proper context, including how they fare compared to other international jurisdictions. 


I know my colleague Senator Duniam wants to make some brief remarks on this legislation as well, so I might just—




Senator Duniam:
  Don't let me hold you up.




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you, Senator Duniam. I might just make these last—



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  I'm waiting for an interjection from my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson. 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  We fell asleep!




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you very much, Senator Whish-Wilson. I'm happy to wake you up now! To put the legislation in context, I think it is important to think clearly about what the government is seeking to do and how it is seeking to do it. From the outset—and this won't be new news to senators in this place—the government is trying to create the right incentives around ownership of homes and housing choices for our country, and, importantly, to improve housing outcomes across the whole housing sector. This includes improving housing outcomes for first home buyers; improving housing choices and outcomes for those who choose to rent or are forced to rent; improving housing choices for older Australians who are looking to downsize—I think this is probably the one area where a better understanding of demographic change and the rate of that demographic change will inform government policy settings quite critically; and providing affordable and community housing to ameliorate the suffering that is caused by homelessness. Of course, we know that homelessness has many causes. Certainly, lack of access to home and shelter is important, but we know that there are mental health considerations and other sorts of things. Senator Whish-Wilson, I'm happy to share with you my own family's experience with homelessness, but that is for another time. 


We know that Australians deserve accommodation and housing choices, but at all times this reflects the changing lifestyle decisions that Australians make for themselves—the demographic change. In our own life cycles, as we move from being a young person to having a young family to having an established family and then to ageing, we know that those accommodation and housing choices necessarily change. Senator O'Neill talked about our superannuation system. It is a system that I am big enough to agree is a significant and important addition to our financial security, both as individuals and as a nation. I absolutely endorse that. These decisions the government has taken are informed and carefully constructed. Some would say they are modest, but I would say they are well designed and fine-tuned to make sure government is staying abreast of the housing needs of Australians, but also mindful of the fact that demographic change is driving a reconsideration of our attitudes around housing, and that is very, very important. So, with those few remarks, I will take my seat.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (15:02):  by leave—I seek to provide some further information to a question asked of me by Senator Rhiannon in question time yesterday. I've advised Senator Rhiannon of this additional information. Senator Rhiannon asked a question about the Defence contractor Aurecon engaging in a summit in relation to PFAS contamination. I note, for the record, that there were a number of errors in the question that Senator Rhiannon asked. Firstly, Aurecon Australia is engaged as the lead consultant for PFAS investigations at HMAS Albatross and HMAS Cerberus only, not RAAF Base Williamtown, as Senator Rhiannon stated. That environmental investigation at Williamtown was undertaken by AECOM.


Defence understands that the individual to whom Senator Rhiannon referred in her question yesterday was an employee of Aurecon New Zealand who presented at a summit that was hosted by the Victorian EPA in April of this year. That summit was attended by EPAs from Australia and New Zealand.


I note for the record that, in relation to contracting, a number of companies that do work for Defence are multidisciplinary firms. They have a diverse range of in-house capabilities, such as project management, environmental management, heritage cost planning and airfield pavement design. Defence has approximately 150 capital facilities projects under way in various stages of the project life cycle. It's not uncommon for companies to provide many different service on a number of different projects at the same time. However, it is unusual or rare for one company to provide more than one service on one project. Defence maintains a due diligence client side project management function, including the role of managing the project manager contract administrator. That role is Defence's agent for further contract administration of other project consultants and contractors. In that capacity, Defence is given oversight of all key project decisions, variation claims, payment claims and so on.


In her first supplementary question, Senator Rhiannon said that Aurecon was responsible for waste management at many RAAF bases. I note that that is incorrect. Aurecon Australia is not the provider of waste management across the Defence estate.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-12-05,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ketter today relating to the proposed Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry.


The question that I asked Senator Brandis related to the issue of the banking royal commission and the incredible about-face that this government has taken in respect of this particular issue. This Prime Minister, for more than 600 days, argued that a banking royal commission will do nothing. There are so many examples of what this Prime Minister and this Treasurer have said over the past 12 months or so to try to avoid the cause of a banking royal commission.


Back in September of last year, we saw the Treasurer describe the Labor approach of having a royal commission as 'a crass populist approach'. The Treasurer, in April of last year, described the call for a royal commission as 'a cynical exploitation of people's genuine concerns and the politicisation of their pain by the opposition'. This is the sort of contortion that this government now has to go through to distance itself from what it has said in the past on a royal commission. In a question time in September of last year, the Prime Minister indicated:


A royal commission can do nothing … It cannot change a law, it cannot change a regulation, and more importantly—most importantly—the compassion you seek to offer to your constituent cannot be fulfilled by a royal commission, and you know that …


So these are the sorts of comments that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have made over the past 12 months to avoid the need for a royal commission. The Prime Minister has also said:


… a royal commission … will enrich the legal profession … take many years and end up, no doubt, recommending the types of measures that are already in this year's budget.


Well, this year's budget came up with a cracker: having the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which is the Prime Minister's attempt at trying to take—and I quote him—'real action' on dealing with the consumer complaints about the banking system. We will be debating that bill a bit later on, but it's quite clear that that bill essentially, on the one hand, is a repackaging of the ombudsman services that we currently have without any new powers being provided to those schemes and, on the other hand, is actually a step backwards because we're abolishing the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. So, rather than real action, this is a step backwards in the fight to protect consumers against the ravages of the greed of the banking system. The Prime Minister has said in the past, 'We're not having a royal commission; we're taking action.' Well, these most recent comments and this amazing backflip stand in stark contrast to the comments that this Prime Minister has been making over the past 12 months.


Today in question time, Senator Brandis indicated that the reason for the about-face was, to use his language, the 'very wild' comments that have been made publicly about the banking system, which he said were the real risk to stability. This is reminiscent of what he has said earlier in the week, and it's quite clear that this government is acting at the behest of the banks. The banks have dictated to this government the terms of reference on this royal commission and the time frame. The time frame is specifically designed to avoid an in-depth analysis of the real issues. When this Prime Minister says that it is regrettable that we're going to be having this royal commission, I'm just flabbergasted by that as a senator who's participated in the economics committee's inquiries into financial scandals involving the major banks. We went through that and listened to the pain of those people who have had their lives destroyed, their finances destroyed and their family arrangements left in tatters. Yet this Prime Minister says that the stories of those people do not matter.




Senator Brandis:
  He didn't say that; that's not true.




Senator KETTER:
  That's what he said: those issues don't matter. Those are not the compelling reasons that we are having a royal commission. The reason they're doing it is that the banks have asked for it. (Time expired)

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-12-05,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:10):  I know what Senator Macdonald, who is sitting beside me, is thinking. Senator Macdonald is thinking exactly the same thing I'm thinking: Australians have the right to be confused when they hear about the position of Labor senators this afternoon. After all the barking from Labor senators and others in the community about the need for a royal commission, you would have thought, with the government having delivered a royal commission, that they would have been in this place applauding and saying, 'This is a responsible and necessary thing to do', because that would have been the consistent position. If Labor had come into this place supporting the royal commission, that would have been consistent with the sorts of things they've been saying for many months with regard to the need for a royal commission. But, of course, Labor are not consistent. Labor are not consistent on this issue, and they're not consistent on other issues.


It's been clear to me and others that the community and customers of banks require that their issues are better addressed, including with regard to some of the decisions that banks are taking, how banks treat customers and how banks are balancing the competing interests of looking after shareholders and shareholder value in our banking system while at the same time responding to the very genuine concerns and needs that customers of banks have raised themselves.


This is Tuesday of the last sitting week for the year. We only have one more question time tomorrow and then another question time on Thursday—and I know that Senator Macdonald shares my interest in making sure that that is the end of the parliamentary sitting period for this year so that we can get back to our communities and get back to northern Queensland, in Senator Macdonald's case, and Western Australia, in my case. I thought Labor was off to a very good start in question time this afternoon when Senator McCarthy talked about personal income tax cuts. You would have thought that the government talking about and making plans and preparations for personal tax cuts for Australians would be a good thing and would be the sorts of things that people in this place would stand up for and endorse—but no; Labor senators tried to suggest that the government putting its mind to personal tax cuts was a bad thing.


I would argue that personal tax cuts are not only necessary for Australian families; they are actually timely for Australian families. When you reflect upon the success—




Senator Carol Brown:
  You’ve run out of puff, Dean!




Senator SMITH:
  Sorry, Senator Brown, I didn't hear that.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  To the chair.




Senator SMITH:
  When you look at the success of the government's economic performance, as detailed in the final budget outcome document that was released in September this year—the prudent financial management that is demonstrated in the outcomes of the last budget that was released in September 2017—you can see that the government is making necessary steps to save taxpayers' money. What's the right thing to do when taxpayers' money is being saved? Those savings should be returned to taxpayers and their families and to businesses themselves.


So I would have thought that this afternoon Senator McCarthy would have come into this place and said, 'Yes, media reports about personal tax cuts for Australian families and businesses next year are a good thing', because that would have been the consistent position. But that is not what we've seen this afternoon. A royal commission, which I think many in the community would agree is a necessary step, has been delivered, has been announced. But Labor senators in this place want to suggest that somehow that is something we should be embarrassed about and that it is something that is not worthy.


As we finish the year 2017, the challenge for Labor is to start to recalibrate its thinking, because 2018 is going to be about the economy. It is going to be about the economy. We know that the government already can tick off media reform; it can tick off childcare reform; it can tick off school reform; it can tick off industrial relations reform; it can tick off the issue of same-sex marriage—it can tick that issue off because, because fingers crossed the matter will be resolved in the House of Representatives before the end of the week—and then this government and the opposition should unite in making sure that economic interests and economic concerns are front and centre. Why? Because we know—Senator Macdonald and I know—that as we travel around communities, especially regional communities, people say to us, 'cost of living pressures'. That is your challenge for 2018.

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2017-12-05,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (15:15):  There have been many occasions over the past few months when the most appropriate theme music for this coalition parliament, run by an inept and ill-suited Prime Minister, has been the circus theme music, and I'm sure we all know that. But let's take a closer look at the Prime Minister, who last week backflipped with the agility of a circus performer, because, let's face it, that's what he has made this parliament, a total circus. He is a Prime Minister who has been dragged kicking and screaming into establishing a banking royal commission. Much like the highwire act, where people gasp at the daring fortitude of a circus performer—and I'm not suggesting for a moment that the Prime Minister is that, because I'm thinking he has probably failed and fallen to the ground—the Prime Minister has the banks in the dress circle seats watching and waiting for his every move.


The Prime Minister is celebrated by some as someone who understands business. I think he is mostly celebrated by himself, because when one has a look back through his business dealings, one can see he is really an eastern suburbs fast-buck artist. He took a clip through a number of his friends' business dealings: his dealings with OzEmail; his turn as a CEO of a mining company in Russia in the '90s—and one can get the Parliamentary Library, of course, to give you a full explanation of what happens in mining circles in the former Soviet Union, and how one does business in that environment. 


The other analogy is that the Prime Minister is really like Hiro Onoda. Perhaps people aren't really familiar with Hiro Onoda. He was the Japanese soldier who was persuaded to come out of hiding at the end of the Second World War—three decades after the war had finished, where he had been hiding in the Philippines jungle. Hiro Onoda came to be seen by some as an example of the extraordinary lengths to which some Japanese soldiers would go to demonstrate their loyalty to the then emperor in whose name they fought. Much like the Prime Minister, who wouldn't recognise the sense of having a banking royal commission, the banks saw the sense of being able to draft the terms of reference themselves. The terms of reference of course do not contain the word 'bank'. If one was online one would add after that: 'LOL'.


Let's take a closer look at some of his friends in the banking world. On 28 October 2015, Andrew Robb appointed Alastair Walton as a senior trade commissioner and consul general to Houston. On 23 June 2017, the foreign minister appointed him as the replacement for Mr Nick Minchin as Australia's consul general in New York. I should explain that Mr Walton worked with the Prime Minister at Goldman Sachs JBWere, and Mr Walton has made some very interesting statements about the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's aptitude for his task of being Prime Minister. Firstly, Mr Walton calls the Prime Minister a very close friend. But he has this to say, 'In banking you're saying to clients: ""Here's this transformative transaction and here's what it can do for you.""' Alastair Walton ran Goldman Sachs's investment banking business in Australia after Mr Turnbull left the firm in 2001. Bankers know, 'how to sell change', he said. According to Mr Walton:


They also need to cope with the less glamorous aspects of politics … It's the branch meetings, being nice to everybody, working out who is in the factions … Bankers aren't trained to do that. Most would be utter failures.


And I think the jury has well and truly come in on the Prime Minister's aptitude, or lack thereof, for dealing with people.


Of course, Goldman Sachs JBWere have also thrown in quite a lot in donations to the Liberal Party. They've given $64,000. They've given another donation of $50,000, which was noted 'as approved by Terry Campbell and Paul Sundberg'. Another was for $3,000, which was noted as 'cheque request by Alastair Walton for donation' and made out to 'Wentworth conference'. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:20):  First of all, I congratulate Senator Ketter on his appointment as deputy whip. I find Senator Ketter a decent and honourable person. Certainly, he will add some lustre to that seat on the other side. So congratulations.




Senator Brandis:
  That's because he went to Villanova College.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It might be that he went to Villanova. It might be because he was with the 'shoppies'—or whoever. But I do congratulate him. I'm pleased that Senator Ketter, in proposing this motion, spoke about a policy issue—one that I disagree with him about. I'm sure Senator Ketter is intelligent enough to have heard and understood the Attorney today, yesterday and last week explaining about the banking royal commission, but he chooses to continue to misrepresent the facts, and I will come back to that.


I am disappointed with the other speaker from Labor on this debate, Senator Kitching, who I had started to develop some professional relationship with. Senator Kitching, can I just say to you: be careful where you go in making baseless personal allegations against people like Mr Turnbull, a self-made millionaire, who—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, please resume your seat. Senator Kitching, a point of order?




Senator Kitching:
  Just for accuracy sake: they're from the AEC.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That's a debating point. Continue, please, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Turnbull, a self-made millionaire, has worked very hard for everything he has. Once Senator Kitching and the likes of her start on this course of action, we might start talking about Offset Alpine and the association with many Labor members of parliament. We might talk about coalmines that were given away by Labor members of parliament in New South Wales to their unionist mates, with considerable sums of money changing hands. We may start talking about direct bribes paid to a Queensland Labor Party minister.




Senator McKim:
  You're both as bad as each other. So what's your point?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I'm warning Senator Kitching—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind senators that comments across the chamber are disorderly. Thank you, Senator Macdonald; please continue.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, Bill D'Arcy, Keith Wright—the list goes on, Senator Brandis. All I'm saying to someone relatively new like Senator Kitching is: be careful where you go on this. You expect this from people like Senator McKim, from the Greens, who simply can't help himself. But I just warn senators against embarking upon this sort of approach. If you have a policy attack, fine.


Getting back to the subject of Senator Ketter's motion to take note of the answer he was given by Senator Brandis, Senator Brandis has explained this and Mr Turnbull has explained this—it's not our preferred position. All of the quotes that Senator Ketter used in the past are accurate regarding those. I've said that myself, not that that matters at all. It isn't the way we want to go. I've often said that these royal commissions just put money in the pockets of already wealthy lawyers and give journalists a two-year free go without having to do a lot of work. They don't achieve much. The government has, by contrast, already implemented a lot of legislation which will address some of the real problems with the banks.


But, in talking about this policy issue, I noticed how different Senator Ketter's question was to the approach of Senator Cameron and Senator Kim Carr, two of the loudest members in this chamber, who clearly exemplify what we understand about bullying at union meetings. You'll notice they always pick on a female senator, one who, I might say, takes the fight up to the corrupt unions, continuing to expose the CFMEU and other unions for their absolute corruption and their criminal activities that are before the courts all of the time. The Labor Party hates this, and so Senator Cameron, Senator Carr and a few others embarked upon a program—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, could you resume your seat, please. I just remind you that the taking note was from Senator Ketter, to take note of answers from Senator Brandis. I accept that you did say you would get back to the royal commission. I was listening intently. I'll just remind you that, whilst it is a broad-ranging debate, it is around the royal commission.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You weren't listening carefully, because I just did return to that and I said what I thought about the commission. But you've distracted me, for the few seconds I've got left, from talking about the ungracious attack on Senator Cash by Senator Carr and Senator Cameron—they know she is the one who will continue to expose the Labor Party and the unions for the criminal associates they are.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-12-05,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:26):  I rise to also take note of the answers to the questions posed by Senator Ketter regarding the banking royal commission. The banking royal commission is something that one side of politics has been totally consistent on since before the last federal election. The cause of a banking royal commission is something that federal Labor has been taking up for some time. We did not need a disastrous vote in the Queensland election, such as we saw from the LNP, to prompt us into action. In fact, Labor has moved around 23 times, in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, to establish a banking royal commission. On each and every one of those occasions, the Liberal and National parties voted together to block it from going ahead. I think there is no policy area—and there are many you can choose from—that demonstrates more clearly the weakness and ineffectiveness of the National Party representatives that come down here from Queensland, supposedly to stand up for people in regional Queensland, than this one.


Every time that Labor pushed for a banking royal commission and put forward a motion to establish one, either in the Senate or in the House of Representatives, not only did the Liberals vote it down but who voted with them on every single one of those 23 occasions? It was the National Party representatives from Queensland. That's how committed they've been to establishing a banking royal commission—each and every time they voted with Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, to block these attempts from going forward. It's not really that surprising because we've seen exactly the same behaviour from them on a multitude of issues. Every time the Prime Minister and his Liberal Party colleagues have voted to grant tax cuts to business and to millionaires—sending billions of dollars to the top end of town—the Nationals have voted with them. Every time they've voted for cuts to health care, including in regional Queensland, the Nationals have voted with the Prime Minister. Every time the Liberals have voted to cut penalty rates in regional Queensland, the Nationals have rolled in and handed over their votes. The disaster that is the rollout of the NBN across regional Australia—you never hear anything from the National Party, criticising it or putting forward ideas to fix it. They just stand in line, time after time, to support their Liberal Party masters. Again, there is nothing that demonstrates that more than the banking royal commission and the failure of the National Party to take any action to deliver this until very recently.


The reality is that the National Party only started ratcheting up any pressure on this government about a banking royal commission when they got an absolute shellacking in the Queensland election a week and a half ago. Right across regional Queensland, the LNP's vote absolutely collapsed to a point where, for example, in the electorate of Capricornia, the LNP ran third or even fourth in every state seat encompassed by the federal electorate. The same can be said of other regional seats held by National Party representatives, like Flynn and Dawson. That's why we've seen the National Party jump into action: not because they care about regional Queenslanders who are getting ripped off by the banks, not because they want to actually demonstrate their independence from the Liberal Party; the only reason they have acted is that they are terrified they are about to lose their own jobs here in Canberra because regional Queenslanders have woken up to them.


Now the government wants credit for having set up the banking royal commission. We know the only reason they did it was that the Nationals finally discovered their spine and their own mates in the big banks decided to back in a royal commission. They knew the end was in sight. They had to give up the fight against a banking royal commission. They put through the letter to the Prime Minister saying, 'Okay, we'll have a banking royal commission,' and, literally within an hour or so, the Prime Minister was out there giving the banks what they wanted—a royal commission on their terms.



It's interesting. Obviously over the last week we've seen an incredible amount of disunity within the government about the banking royal commission and other issues. But, even after the National Party got their way and got the banking royal commission that they had failed to support Labor on on 23 occasions, the disunity continued. I noticed an article by Paul Kelly in The Australian on 1 December which quoted a cabinet minister referring to the bill put forward by Senator O'Sullivan that was going to establish a banking royal commission. The unnamed cabinet minister described Senator O'Sullivan's bill as 'a train wreck of thought bubbles'. The disunity in the government is still rife. They have no respect for each other. They cannot govern Australia. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-12-05,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:31):  Yes, it is. I want to put on the record that I have never historically supported a royal commission into the banking sector, because traditionally the banks—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I beg your pardon, Senator Bernardi. If you'd just take your seat, I think Senator McKim has a point of order.




Senator McKim:
  Yes, I do, Deputy President. Could I just ask for clarification? By my count, there have been five speakers on this motion and normally you would then put the question and allow me to rise to take note of—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, I clarified with Senator Bernardi. I was going to put the question. I asked whether it was on the same matter. He clarified to me that, yes, it was. We have a speakers list here and the last speaker is from the crossbench, which Senator Bernardi is a member of. Please continue, Senator Bernardi.




Senator BERNARDI:
  Whilst I don't support a royal commission into the banks, I understand that the government has chosen to do it for politically expedient motives. But there is a very important area that I think the government should explore. When most people want to borrow money or access funds, they go to a bank. They play a legitimate role in our financial system. However, I'm deeply concerned that there are some people who occupy these Senate benches who think it's okay to go to a billionaire benefactor associated with the People's Republic of China and the Chinese government in order to access funds to pay for their bills. If you want a royal commission that is going to make a meaningful difference to Australia, Australia's body politic and its way of life, it shouldn't be into the banks; it should be into the whisper, the stench, the migration of corruption into our body politic and the agents of influence from foreign governments who are openly and wilfully seeking to influence the politics in this country.


We know on the record that there is a compromised individual on the other side of this chamber who has been compromised by agents of influence from the Chinese government. That is a travesty for this body politic. It is a travesty that those on the Labor side seek to cover up Senator Dastyari's involvement and engagement in undermining our national security issues. He thinks it's okay to have his $1,600 or $1,800 travel bill picked up by an agent of influence from the Chinese government. That is where a true royal commission into money needs to come from—not the banks, which operate in a sanctioned way and operate within a legal framework, notwithstanding they may have some failings. It is in this shadowy underworld where agents of influence from the Chinese government are not only seeking to compromise politicians in this place but seeking to compromise our educational institutions and seeking to compromise the major political parties.


I congratulate the government on their moves today in seeking to redress some of these influences. But I do want to put on the record that, when I read that the Attorney-General had offered security briefings to major political parties about political donations and the potential for compromise, I wrote to him as a crossbencher, of a very modest political party, seeking a briefing on what we could do to prevent that. Some months have passed, and I regret the Attorney-General hasn't even sought to respond to my request. I can only presume that he knows there is no undue influence within the Australian Conservatives or he knows that it is simply the major parties that have a problem with being compromised by foreign agents—but whatever. 


If the government are serious about this, and if the Labor Party are serious about trying to identify where our financial system is going wrong, look no further than those who are on the take, those who get their bills paid by agents of influence from the Chinese government, or they get their marching orders and their scripts and they go and have Chinese-media press conferences, undermining not only Australia's national sovereign position but their own political party's position, or they go around to a compromised Chinese billionaire's house and warn him that he might be under observation or surveillance by one of our national intelligence agencies. 


This is where the real scandal is in our financial system. This is where the real scandal is in our body politic. You can score all the cheap shots you like off each other, but until you address the elephant in the room—and that is Senator Sam Dastyari—then we are pushing it uphill. I can tell you that now. While Senator Dastyari sits in this place, you cannot be sure that what he is saying is his own words; it could be scripted words from the people who are pulling the strings. If you want to clean up the financial system, if you want to clean up the body politic, you will cut the financial ties to the People's Republic of China. That is critical; that is pressing; and we should have a royal commission into that rather than one into the banks. (Time expired)

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:29):  In respect of the government's repsonse to the Community Affairs Reference Committee's report, Care and management of younger and older Australians living with dementia and behaviour and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD), I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I note that the government has taken more than 3½ years to respond to the 18 recommendations, with the report from this inquiry being tabled back on 26 March 2014. It's refreshing to finally get a report that the government has responded to, given that there are now more than 10 aged-care reports, reviews and strategies on the minister's table at this very moment. But, when you look at the government's response, none of the 18 recommendations are fully supported by those opposite—11 recommendations are noted, one recommendation is not supported at all and six recommendations are supported but only in principle. This is an interesting government response to this report.


In 2017 there were an estimated 365,100 people in Australia living with dementia. This is expected to increase to almost 900,000 by 2050. Labor, on the other hand, has been proactive on this important issue. On 21 November this year the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, spoke at the University of Sydney about the challenge of dementia. Labor knows that this is an urgent issue. A recent NATSEM report estimated that dementia costs Australia over $14 billion a year. The same report found that even a five per cent reduction in the number of people with dementia over the age of 65 could lead to savings of $120.4 billion in less than 40 years. One in three Australians born today will eventually be diagnosed with dementia. This year, for the first time, dementia is now the leading cause of death for Australian women. Within the next five years it will be the leading cause of death for all Australians. With statistics like these, we urge the government to do more when it comes to Australians living with dementia.


The government now has a responsibility to provide quality services for older Australians and this includes people living with dementia and their families and carers. This report is another example of the government abrogating its responsibility when it comes to the aged-care portfolio. Given this government cannot fully support one recommendation in this report, is it really an indication that those opposite again will not act when it comes to caring for those Australians living with dementia?

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-12-05,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:32):  I take note of the government's response to the Care and management of younger and older Australians living with dementia and behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD)report. Senator Polley has just articulated that this report was tabled on 26 March 2014. This was a very significant and very important report because we found that people were being poorly treated, that people with complex behavioural issues and psychiatric issues associated with dementia were living with restraints, both physical and chemical, that they were in poorly designed facilities that did not accommodate them and that there were poorly trained staff who did not meet their needs. It was a very distressing, unsatisfactory situation.


I chaired this inquiry. For a while after we tabled this report some aged-care providers actually rang me and said: 'How can we fix this? What can we do? Where would you suggest we go to get some help?' There are places where people can get support for addressing issues around dementia, particularly for people who are living in residential care, but it requires training, for a start. We actually visited the excellent training facility in Melbourne of Dementia Australia—it's not Alzheimer's Australia anymore. They took the senators on that site visit through as near a lived experience as you could get. They use technology that gives you a feeling of a cognitive impairment so that a carer, a paid staff member or a loved one can gain a sense of what somebody with dementia is living with when they have a cognitive impairment. You can't pretend that it's anywhere near what somebody with dementia would feel, but it at least gives an understanding of certain behaviours. How, in 2017, could we have circumstances where people living with dementia are living in care and in a situation where somebody has not been through at least that training? That's what we still have in 2017, 3½ years later. It is simply not good enough. It is simply not good enough that we have not moved far enough along with training and support to address people's needs.


Senator Polley, I'm wondering how long you think it's going to take before we get a response to the inquiry into the aged-care workforce. Senator Polley's just indicated that she thinks it's going to be a while. We have seen the government's announcement of the aged-care taskforce, which is a step. It doesn't have worker representation, but it's a step. An aged-care workforce that looks after and supports somebody with a cognitive impairment or somebody with dementia requires particular training. The inquiry into the aged-care workforce also highlighted the absolute flaws in the training, supports and preparation of the aged-care workforce. It shows just how understaffed our aged-care services and supports are going to be into the future. So I certainly hope that the government responds in a more fulsome way and in a much quicker way to a workforce inquiry to ensure that we have a workforce that is trained to support people living with dementia, that we have residences that meet the needs of people living with dementia and that we address issues around both chemical and physical restraints.


During this inquiry, we also visited a number of excellent care facilities where they are providing—at no extra cost, folks, because they have to live within the means of the ACFI payments—a caring environment where they have almost eliminated the use of chemical restraints and do not use physical restraints. People are cared for in a non-clinical environment where they have access to the outdoors, access to chickens and caring for animals, access to sensory gardens and access to a workshop. There's no nursing station. This is within an aged-care facility—there's no nursing station. The nurses don't wear uniforms.


Some of the residents there are ex-nurses and they go around and make everybody's beds every day, because in the past, before they adopted the new techniques, they had had problems with people going into other people's rooms. Then they very intelligently worked out that the residents were ex-nurses and they wanted to tidy up people's rooms and make their beds. So that's what they do every day. Other residents with past experience arrange flowers.


That was the only aged-care facility where, when we had our hearing, we didn't have the relatives of the people in care, who were their former carers, complaining. They were glowing in the experiences of their loved ones in aged care. So it is doable. There is no excuse for these facilities not providing the sort of care that we would expect to receive if we were in those facilities or that we would expect our loved ones would receive in those facilities.


I'm extremely disappointed that it has taken so long to respond to this report. Many of the recommendations, as Senator Polley has just articulated, are supported in principle. The report said:


The committee recommends that the use of antipsychotic medication should be reviewed by the prescribing doctor after the first three months to assess the ongoing need.


That was supported in principle, but then the government go on to talk about what they've been doing et cetera and don't actually support this fully or make sure it's implemented. It's just one example of the fact that we aren't seeing a strong enough response from the government to address this very significant issue, which, as was highlighted just a moment earlier by Senator Polley, is only going to grow. If we don't nail this issue now and make sure that we have a workforce that is properly trained to understand the complex needs and the complex behaviours of people living with dementia, this situation is only going to get worse.


We need to address the issues about restrictive practices, about the overuse of antipsychotic drugs and the overuse of restraints—the similar situation to what we've reported before on restrictive practices being applied to people living with disability. We have people with disability—particularly those living in residential institutions—who have also been subject to both physical and chemical restraints. If we don't start taking this issue seriously, we are going to have a very serious problem into the future. It's hugely disappointing that this wasn't addressed much earlier and that our recommendations weren't supported. We will continue to review very closely what the government does do about these recommendations. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Australian Government response to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report:





Care and management of younger and older Australians living with dementia and behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD)





Foreword



In 2017, there are an estimated 365,100 people in Australia living with dementia. This is expected to increase to almost 900,000 by 2050. 


The Senate Community Affairs References Committee report Care and management of younger and older Australians living with dementia and behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) provides 18 recommendations on a range of issues affecting people living with dementia in Australia. Since the report was tabled, the Australian Government has taken action through a wide range of initiatives and reforms targeting dementia. 


These actions are outlined in this response and underpinned by the National Framework for Action on Dementia 2015-2019 (NFAD). The NFAD was endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments Health Council on 7 August 2015. It outlines Australian, state and territory government priorities across primary, acute and aged care to reduce the risk of dementia and improve the quality of life for people living with dementia and their support networks. 


On 29 May 2017, Australia supported the adoption of the World Health Organisation Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia 2017-2025 (GAP). The goal of the GAP is to improve the lives of people living with dementia, their carers and families, while decreasing the impact of dementia on them as well as on communities and countries. The GAP includes seven distinct action areas and outlines measurable targets for achievement. 


The WHO Global Dementia Observatory provides the monitoring mechanism to track implementation and progress of the GAP and will be a valuable resource for knowledge translation and exchange. Australia is proud to be among the first countries supporting and sharing our data and resources on this platform.


The Australian Government is committed to the provision of quality services for people living with dementia, their families and carers, as well as research into the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of dementia. In the 2014-15 Budget $200 million over five years was allocated to boost Australia' s dementia research capacity and deliver best practice support for people with dementia across the health system. Key priorities of projects funded under this commitment are improving care and interventions for the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and maximising the independence of people living with dementia. Research funding includes a strong knowledge translation component to translate research findings into practice within dementia policy and programs.


Phase one of the re-design of national dementia support programs and services was announced by the Government on 25 January 2016. The co-designed reforms are based on the advice of stakeholders and experts received through the Ministerial Dementia Forums of 2014 and 2015 and KPMG' s nationwide consultation and analysis of dementia programs commissioned by the Government in 2015. Outcomes of the redesign address many of the report' s recommendations.


Importantly, the redesign included the engagement of a single national provider to deliver nationally consistent accredited dementia training and education to the aged care workforce and health care professionals across Australia. Accredited training in best practice care of people with behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia is available free to eligible health professionals and care workers. 


Other key elements of service redesign include the establishment of the Severe Behaviour Response Teams (SBRT) and engagement of a single national provider to deliver the Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service (DBMAS) across all states and territories. The national DBMAS supports staff and carers in community, residential, acute and primary care settings with information, advice, assessment and short term case management interventions. Family carers, health professionals and aged care providers have access to 24 hour advice and support to improve the quality of life of the person living with dementia. The SBRT supports Commonwealth funded approved residential aged care providers requiring assistance with addressing the needs of people with severe and very severe BPSD. 


A mobile workforce of multidisciplinary clinicians also provides locally delivered person-centred interventions, capacity building and resources for carers and organisations to improve skills in the care of people living with dementia in the longer term.


The Ministerial Dementia Forum held in December 2016 focused on redesigning dementia consumer supports to ensure national consistency and regional and remote coverage. The Government is now working with stakeholders on phase two of the redesign of national dementia support programs to develop an improved suite of dementia consumer supports for people living with dementia and their carers across the life-cycle of the disease. 


The Government has also supported additional research and service improvement projects at a cost of more than $30 million through three rounds of the Aged Care Service Improvement and Healthy Ageing Grant Fund between 2012 and 2017. Projects address a range of priorities identified through the NFAD including improving dementia diagnosis and care in hospitals and primary care settings, delivering sensory experience interventions, reducing the use of antipsychotic medications in aged care facilities and development of tools and resources to manage and reduce behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).


In June 2016, the Government committed to establishing Specialist Dementia Care Units (SDCUs) across Australia to support residents with very severe BPSD. 


In addition, the Australian Government has provided funding over three years from June 2016 to Dementia Australia (formerly Alzheimer' s Australia) to establish the Dementia Friendly Communities initiative, which is designed to help ordinary Australians better understand dementia. This educative, community awareness raising program aims to give people a greater understanding of dementia and the small things that can be done to make a real difference to people living with the condition. A national dementia-friendly community resource hub will also be developed, to enable communities to network, learn from other initiatives and provide the latest evidence and information on best practice approaches to increasing community awareness and support for people living with dementia.




Aged Care Reforms



The Australian Government is implementing significant reforms to the delivery of aged care services for older people and their carers to ensure that Australia has the best possible system, which is sustainable and affordable. The reforms are consistent with the long term policy direction recommended by the Productivity Commission in its 2011 inquiry into Care for Older Australians.


A number of review processes have also recently been conducted that investigated how aged care services are delivered and the protections for vulnerable older Australians. 


On 1 May 2017, the Government announced an independent Review of National Aged Care Quality Regulatory Processes (the Review). The Review was led by Ms Kate Carnell (AO), in conjunction with Professor Ron Paterson (ONZM), and examined Commonwealth aged care accreditation, monitoring, review, investigation, complaints and compliance processes. On 25 October 2017, the Minister for Ageing, the Hon Ken Wyatt AM, MP released the Review report. The Government is considering the Review recommendations. 


On 15 June 2017, the Australian Law Reform Commission released its report into elder abuse, recommending tighter regulation and safeguards in relation to the use of restrictive practices in residential aged care. The Review panel considered these recommendations.


The Government recognises that care for older people living with dementia is an integral part of the aged care system. 


The Australian Government is committed to the provision of quality services for all older Australians, including for people living with dementia, their families and carers, as well as research into dementia prevention and cure.


Responses to the recommendations have been developed collaboratively by the Department of Health, the Department of Social Services, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and the National Health and Medical Research Council. 




Recommendation 1



The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth create a new Medicare item number that encourages General Practitioners, registered psychologists or other relevant accredited professionals, to undertake longer consultations with a patient and at least one family member or carer where the patient has presented with indications of dementia (para 2.42).




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation.



The second priority area for action under the National Framework for Action on Dementia 2015-2019 (NFAD) is ""The need for timely diagnosis"". Under this priority, the Government has committed to the following outcome: Australians will have access to skilled and knowledgeable health professionals who can support and provide an accurate and timely diagnosis of dementia.


The Government recognises the important role that can be played by primary care providers in the identification, assessment and management of dementia. 


The Government' s view is that rather than creating a new Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item, it would be more appropriate to consider whether current items are effective through the Medicare Benefits Schedule Review and Primary Health Care Advisory Group, and also to improve doctors'  awareness of existing MBS items that allow for cognitive screening and care planning. 


Whilst there are no specific items for dementia diagnosis and intervention under the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) arrangements, a wide range of existing items may be used for these purposes. These include: 


health assessments provided for people aged 75 years and older that can be undertaken annually – MBS items 701-707 


comprehensive medical assessments in residential aged care facilities that can be provided annually - MBS items 701, 703, 705 and 707 


longer consultations using the standard general practitioner attendance items – Level C attendance item - lasting at least 20 minutes, and the Level D attendance item - lasting at least 40 minutes are available for people of any age with suspected or diagnosed dementia 


Chronic Disease Management (CDM) items such as MBS items 721-732. The package of CDM items includes Medicare rebateable items for GP-managed care planning and/or team assisted care planning, items to review care plans and contribute to care plans prepared by other providers including residential aged care services, and a mechanism for GPs to refer patients for Medicare rebateable allied health services


MBS rebates available for professional attendance by specialists and consultant physicians in the practice of geriatric medicine – MBS items 141-149. Some of these services may be to diagnose, treat or monitor patients with dementia and some of these items are for consultations of over 60 minutes and can be undertaken at a hospital or in a patient' s home. One of these MBS items (145 for Consultant Physician or Specialist in Geriatric Medicine, Referred Patient, Initial Comprehensive Assessment and Management - Home Visit) has a rebate of $469.35 as at January 2017.


On 22 April 2015, the Government, announced an MBS Review Taskforce. The Taskforce is undertaking a program of work to review all MBS items to ensure they are contemporary, reflect current clinical practice and allow for the provision of health services that improve health outcomes. Further, it will identify services that are considered unsafe or ineffective. 


It is anticipated that the Mental Health Services Clinical Committee will be established to review psychiatry, GP mental health and psychology MBS items. 


The Government also established the Primary Health Care Advisory Group, led by Dr Steve Hambleton, former Australian Medical Association President. The Advisory Group investigated options to provide: better care for people with complex and chronic illness; innovative care and funding models; better recognition and treatment of mental health conditions; and greater connection between primary health care and hospital care. Following an extensive national consultation process and review of the evidence, the Advisory Group provided a final report to Government in December 2015.


In response to that report, as announced on 31 March 2016, the Government is providing funding for stage one of the establishment of Health Care Homes in ten Primary Health Networks (PHNs) regions across Australia from 2016-17 through 2019-20. Under this model, eligible patients with chronic and complex health conditions will voluntarily enrol with a participating medical practice known as their Health Care Home. This practice will provide a patient with a ' home base'  for the ongoing coordination, management and support of their conditions. The model moves away from current fee-for-service payments for these eligible patients except for routine health issues not related to their chronic illness.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth consider increasing funding for the Younger Onset Dementia Key Worker Program in order to provide support to all people living with dementia. The increased funding should also ensure that accurate data is collected for evaluation purposes (para 3.39).




Not Supported





The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.



Priority four of the NFAD is ""Accessing ongoing care and support"".


The Younger Onset Dementia Key Worker Program (YODKWP) is transitioning to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Transitioning to the NDIS will provide the opportunity for Dementia Australia to receive significantly more funding whilst providing services to eligible people with younger onset dementia.


The Government' s priority is to ensure that the NDIS is structured to provide support to those who need it. The NDIS is designed to provide people with disability, their families and carers greater choice and control over the course of their lives, including the flexibility to make decisions about which disability services and supports they use. Evidence suggests that when people with disability are given greater choice and control over their services they achieve better life outcomes.


Access rates for the YODKWP have not been high and performance statistics do not support expansion of the program. An evaluation of this program is currently underway and although initial reports suggest that the program has resulted in some good outcomes so far, it would be inappropriate to expand the program based on preliminary findings without the analysis of longer term, more meaningful data.


The Cognitive Decline Partnership Centre funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and industry groups recently conducted an evaluation of current models of key workers for people living with dementia in Australia, including a systematic review of the evidence in Australia and internationally. The key findings from the evaluation supported the role of dementia support workers and identified a need to further explore ways to increase access to the role within consumer directed care. Trialling and aligning the model with Primary Health Networks was also recommended. Key findings are relevant to future policy development.




Recommendation 3



The Committee recommends that each State and Territory develop dementia training facilities similar to the Perc Walkley Dementia Learning Centre in Victoria (para 3.40).




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation.



Priority four of the NFAD is ""Accessing ongoing care and support"". The related action to which the Government has committed is: Support system wide, organisational and workforce awareness of BPSD together with evidence-based prevention and management strategies, including the provision of dementia friendly environments. 


The Government recognises the role that the physical environment and design of the care setting plays on providing high quality care to people living with dementia. Noting environmental design as an emerging priority, the Government is committed to providing flexible funding for a range of different approaches. The Government also notes that the aged care industry and the community share a role in ensuring environments are dementia friendly.


In 2013-14 the jointly funded Commonwealth-Victorian Home and Community Care program provided one-off funding to Dementia Australia Victoria towards establishment of the Perc Walkley Dementia Learning Centre in Victoria. The Perc Walkley Dementia Learning Centre is a dementia learning facility which showcases dementia friendly design. The goal of the Centre is to provide education on how workplaces, homes and public spaces can become dementia friendly. The Centre creates a multi-sensory simulation using light, sound, colour and visual content to create a virtual reality experience at the Centre, which enables aged care and health care workers to be taken into the world of people living with dementia.


The Australian Government funds the Dementia Training Program (DTP) to provide dementia-specific training to aged care, health care and other community providers and their staff in order to improve the care and wellbeing of people living with dementia. The DTP offers an environmental design workshop and consultancy for aged and healthcare services. A consultancy and resources specifically for the design, construction and maintenance of aged care facilities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is also available. The program provides service managers and their design consultants with the knowledge, resources and tools required to understand the effects of the built environment on the person living with dementia and modify the environment to promote well-being while reducing confusion and depression. The information is provided through education and on-site consultation and is available in each state and territory.


The Government acknowledges the ongoing work of non-government organisations in improving environmental design. For example, Dementia Australia Victoria and HammondCare have both been involved in development of virtual reality dementia training technology which enables anyone to experience planned physical spaces from the perspective of someone living with dementia. The technology assists care staff, designers and builders to understand sensory challenges for a person living with dementia and design environments that are much more welcoming and less confronting.


The Government-funded DBMAS provider notes that environmental factors contribute to over 70 per cent of referred cases. To inform practice, the DBMAS provider can use portable virtual reality technology to educate staff about how sensory challenges contribute to behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.


The Government currently funds Dementia Australia New South Wales for a trial of a dementia-specific experiential learning program in hospitals. The program uses a train-the-trainer model to engage hospital staff in simulation exercises to see how life might be experienced by their patients with dementia. The program is an opportunity for staff to reflect on the effect their work practices can have on the behaviour of those they are caring for. 




Recommendation 4



The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth encourage relevant professional organisations, such as the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, to ensure that patients diagnosed with dementia and their carers are informed by health professionals of the dementia supports available and how to access them (para 3.53).




Supported In-Principle





The Australian Government supports this recommendation in principle. 



Two priority areas for action under the NFAD is ""the need for timely diagnosis"" and ""accessing care and support post diagnosis"".


The Australian Government has delivered multiple initiatives to increase awareness for patients, carers and General Practitioners about the pathways into support and care. 


The NHMRC Cognitive Decline Partnership Centre (the Centre) has developed Clinical Practice Guidelines and Principles of Care for People with Dementia (the Guidelines) in consultation with an expert multi-disciplinary Guideline Adaptation Committee convened by the Centre. The Guidelines provide recommendations for the diagnosis and management of dementia and are intended for use by staff working with people living with dementia in the health and aged care sectors. The Guidelines also inform GPs about the key entry points for support services for the person with dementia, including Dementia Australia, My Aged Care, Carers Australia and the Aged Care Assessment Teams.


The Centre has also published Diagnosis, treatment and care for people with dementia: A consumer companion guide to the Clinical Practice Guidelines and Principles of Care for People with Dementia. This consumer version of the Clinical Practice Guidelines includes accessible information about the latest evidence on dementia as well as information about the full range of dementia services and support. It is available from: www.sydney.edu.au/medicine/cdpc/resources/dementia-guidelines.php. The guidelines and the consumer companion have both been promoted to GPs via the Primary Health Networks.


GPs also have access to the HealthPathways program which is a web-based information portal supporting primary care clinicians to plan patient care through the primary, community and acute health care systems. This is designed to be used at the point of care, primarily for General Practitioners but is also available to Hospital Specialists, Nurses, Allied Health and other Health Professionals. 


Other activities undertaken by the Department of Health may also assist dementia patients and their carers to be aware of the supports available to them. This includes the establishment of Primary Health Networks (PHNs) which aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of medical services for patients, particularly those at risk of poor health outcomes, and improve coordination of care to ensure patients receive the right care in the right place at the right time. 


PHNs have undertaken their baseline needs assessments and prepared their 2016-18 Activity Work Plans which have informed their commissioning decisions from 2016-17. While there are no activities specifically devoted to dementia in PHNs'  first Activity Work Plans (submitted in May 2016), a number of them give consideration to dementia within broader activities that are focused on aged care including falls prevention, medication management, advanced care planning, palliative and end of life care, and promotion of healthy ageing. 


Another important initiative was the launch of My Aged Care in 2013 and its expansion in 2015 to become a true gateway for consumers to have their needs assessed and where appropriate, be referred to government funded aged care services. My Aged Care now includes a central client record to facilitate the collection and sharing of information, holistic needs assessment through a national standardised assessment form, online referral management and web based portals for clients, assessors and service providers.


Prior to the establishment of My Aged Care, there was no central pathway for older people to access information and services. The transition to My Aged Care was a significant shift in how information, assessment and referral to access aged care services took place.


The My Aged Care Regional Assessment Service (RAS) conducts face-to-face home support assessments for clients seeking entry-level support at home, provided under the Commonwealth Home Support Program (CHSP). The Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACATs) conduct face-to-face comprehensive assessments to determine a client' s eligibility for care types under the Aged Care Act 1997, including home care packages, residential care, residential respite care, Transition Care and Short Term Restorative Care.


In June 2017, the Government launched a national awareness campaign promoting the My Aged Care website and national 1800 phone line. The advertising campaign will run in newspapers, magazines, radio, digital and social media. Other public relations activities will also be undertaken, including materials being available in 4,820 GP surgeries across the country.


In addition, carers are able to access further support through the Carer Gateway at https://www.carergateway.gov.au.


Resources are also available to encourage clinicians in hospital settings to provide information on support and referrals for care. In 2014, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission) released resources titled A better way to care: safe and high quality care for patients with cognitive impairment (dementia and delirium) in hospitals. This publication emphasises the importance of a comprehensive assessment that includes assessing and addressing the support needs for carers.


The booklet Dementia and Your Legal Rights created by Dementia Australia, contains practical information for people living with dementia, and their families and carers, for when the person with dementia no longer has the mental capacity to make decisions that affect them. This resource could assist GPs to support people living with dementia and their family and carers.




Recommendation 5 



The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth facilitate and potentially fund the establishment of dementia-specific respite facilities, including in regional and remote areas (para 3.95).




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation. 



Priority four of the NFAD is ""Accessing ongoing care and support"". The related action to which the Government has committed is: 


Provide people with dementia and their carers and families access to appropriate and responsive respite services. 


Given its prevalence amongst older people, the Government considers the provision of appropriate care and support of people with dementia, their families and carers to be core business for all providers of aged care (including respite care). To support this, the Government provides a broad range of training and resources in dementia care for the aged care sector, as outlined in other recommendations in this document. 


The Government acknowledges the unique respite needs of people living with dementia and their carers, as well as the additional challenges faced by those living in regional and remote areas. Consequently, the Government currently funds a range of programs and initiatives that provide respite support for carers of people living with dementia. 


The CHSP provides a range of planned respite services for older people including flexible respite such as in-home respite and host family respite; cottage respite; and centre-based respite. Respite services provided through the CHSP are complemented by other respite services including emergency respite, which can be accessed through the Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centres (CRCCs), and residential respite (short term stays in aged care homes). 


In response to the growing need for planned respite services for frail older clients, the 2016 CHSP Growth Funding Round targeted planned respite services as a priority area across a number of Aged Care Planning Regions for identified client groups. Through this funding round, an additional $115 million has been made available to deliver additional aged care services, including an increased number of planned respite services. 


Residential respite is provided across Australia. In 2015-16, of the 2,669 aged care homes that claimed Australian Government residential care subsidies, 2,438 (91 per cent) claimed for delivering residential respite care. This includes 944 (91 per cent) of the 1,042 aged care homes located in regional, remote or very remote areas of Australia. 


The Australian Government funds 54 CRCCs nationally to assist carers, including those living in rural and remote locations. CRCCs provide a link to carer support services and assist carers with options to access short-term and emergency respite. Where appropriate, a Centre can help with putting in place regular respite for a carer to reduce the need for unplanned and emergency respite. CRCCs also provide information about carer support services in their local area.


As noted in response to Recommendation 4, My Aged Care is the primary entry point to Australia' s aged care system. My Aged Care provides information about ageing and aged care, and also assesses people' s needs, as well as locating and accessing suitable services, including respite care.


The Department of Social Services (DSS) administers a range of services and programs to specifically support carers. DSS is currently developing and implementing a new Integrated Plan for Carer Support Services which seeks to recognise, support and sustain the vital work of unpaid carers. The first stage of the plan is the implementation of the Carer Gateway, which supports carers to locate and access carer support services. The Carer Gateway can be accessed at https://www.carergateway.gov.au.


The Department of Health is working collaboratively with the DSS to ensure that the support needs of clients and their carers are can considered holistically and in recognition of the importance of supporting the ongoing care relationship.




Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth, in consultation with industry, develop guidelines regarding dementia-specific respite facilities that can effectively manage BPSD (para 3.96).




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation. 



Priority four of the NFAD is ""accessing ongoing care and support"". The related action to which the Government has committed is: 


Provide people with dementia and their carers and families access to appropriate and responsive respite services. 


The Government acknowledges that transitioning from home to respite and back again can be very difficult for a person living with dementia. 


As noted in the Foreword, the national DBMAS supports staff and carers in community and residential care services (including respite care), as well as acute and primary care settings. DBMAS provides information, advice, assessment and short term case management interventions to improve the quality of life of the person living with dementia. SBRTs support Commonwealth funded approved residential aged care (including respite care) providers requiring assistance with addressing the needs of people with severe and very severe BPSD. 


These services can be provided to support the transition of a person living with dementia to and from respite care. Through both programs, a mobile workforce of multidisciplinary clinicians provides locally delivered person-centred interventions, capacity building and resources for carers and organisations to improve skills in the care of people living with dementia in the longer term.


As previously noted, the Australian Government also funds 54 CRCCs nationally to assist carers, including those living in rural and remote locations. CRCCs provide a link to carer support services and assist carers with options to access short-term and emergency respite. Where appropriate, a Centre can help with putting in place regular respite for a carer to reduce the need for unplanned and emergency respite. CRCCs also provide information about carer support services in their local area.


In 2012, the Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service produced guidelines around the management of BPSD. Specifically, the Behaviour Management: A Guide to Good Practice - Managing Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (the Guide) is a comprehensive evidence and practice-based overview of BPSD management principles which enables practical strategies and interventions for assisting care staff and family members in any setting including facilities offering respite care. 


Following the release of the Guide in 2012, the Government has also funded additional resources: the Managing BPSD App for Clinicians is a quick reference guide to assist clinicians when they are presented with BPSD and is based on the Guide. This clinicians'  app has now also been modified into a Managing BPSD App for Family and Carers to assist family carers in responding to and understanding the behaviours associated with the person' s dementia.


Both apps cover topics such as:


a description of the symptom and how it presents in dementia;


potential causes and/or contributing factors


precautions that can be taken to reduce the chance of some behaviours.


Research on BPSD will increase the evidence base to inform guidelines and implementation strategies for effective management of BPSD across a range of care settings including respite care facilities. One of the objectives of the NHMRC National Institute for Dementia Research (established under the Boosting Dementia Research 2014-15 Budget measure) is to strategically expand dementia research by identifying essential research priorities for Australia across the full spectrum from basic research to research translation. A comprehensive consultation with a diverse range of stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians, consumers and policy makers has been undertaken to identify priority areas for Australian dementia research and translation. An evidence based approach to manage BPSD to support dignity and quality of life of a person with dementia, as well as quality of care and the wellbeing of the carer, emerged as a key priority. 




Recommendation 7



The committee recommends that the Commonwealth explore options for improving the provision of respite in rural and remote areas (para 3.97).




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation. 



The Australian Government recognises that providers of aged care services located in rural and remote areas face particular challenges in service provision, including issues related to the operation of small services, higher infrastructure and supply costs, and difficulties in attracting and retaining staff. 


The Australian Government supports a range of respite options, in both residential, flexible care and home care settings, which carers of people living with dementia in rural and remote areas can access. 


Australian Government subsidised aged care facilities are able to provide short-term care in the form of residential respite. Providers of residential respite care do not have a separate allocation of residential respite places. Rather, a portion of each permanent allocation of residential care places is used for the provision of respite care. It is a matter for the provider as to the mix of respite and permanent residential care places delivered within the financial year. The provision of residential respite services depends on the willingness and ability of providers to provide respite care.


In 2015-16, of the 2,669 residential aged care services, 2,438 provided residential respite at some stage in the financial year. Throughout 2015–16, there were 73,335 admissions to residential respite. Providing they are assessed as eligible for respite by an ACAT, people living with dementia are able to access these services. 


Respite is also accessible through the Multi-Purpose Services (MPS) Program. The MPS Program is a joint initiative of the Australian and state and territory governments, and provides integrated health and aged care services for small rural and remote communities. MPS have an important role in small or isolated communities and allow services to exist in regions that could not viably support a stand-alone hospital or aged care home. At 30 June 2016, there were 177 MPS services providing 3,592 flexible aged care places. These places can be used to deliver residential care, respite care and home care services.


In addition to residential respite, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Flexible Aged Care Program (the Flexible Aged Care Program) funds organisations to provide culturally appropriate aged care to older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people close to home and community. Flexible aged care services funded under this program are located mainly in rural and remote areas, and can deliver a mix of residential and community services, including emergency or planned respite care, in accordance with the needs of the community.


As mentioned in response to Recommendation 5, the Government also funds more than 550 providers to deliver centre-based, cottage and flexible respite services through the CHSP, some of which are in rural and regional areas.


Also previously noted, the Australian Government funds 54 CRCCs nationally to assist carers, including those living in rural and remote locations. CRCCs provide a link to carer support services and assist carers with options to access short-term and emergency respite. Where appropriate, a Centre can help with putting in place regular respite for a carer to reduce the need for unplanned and emergency respite. CRCCs also provide information about carer support services in their local area.  




Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that the accreditation standards for Residential Aged Care Facilities include requirements for dementia-friendly design principles (para 4.79).




Supported In-Principle





The Australian Government supports this recommendation in-principle. 



Priority four of the NFAD is ""Accessing ongoing care and support"". The Framework notes that a safe, secure and homely environment can reduce confusion and agitation, improve way finding and encourage social interaction.


The Government recognises the role that the physical environment and design of the care setting plays on providing high quality care to people living with dementia.


The Accreditation Standards for residential aged care services include requirements for dementia-friendly design principles. Standard 4: Physical environment and safe systems requires approved providers to ensure care recipients live in a safe and comfortable environment that meets regulatory requirements and ensures the quality of life and welfare of care recipients, staff and visitors. 


Further, Expected Outcome 4.4: Living environment, states that approved providers of residential aged care services are expected to be actively working to provide a safe working environment. Assessment of a Residential Aged Care Facility' s compliance against Standard 4 by the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency includes ensuring care recipients can access the environment easily and safely.


The Government has commenced the development of a single set of standards across all aged care services, including residential care. The new standards are being co-designed with industry and consumers, with advice from a Technical Advisory Group. Key objectives of the review are to increase the focus on outcomes for consumers in the standards and better support consumer choice and control.


As previously mentioned, the Government funds a number of initiatives to assist aged care providers to implement dementia-friendly design principles, including through the Dementia Training Program. This includes an environmental design education and consultancy for aged and healthcare services, which provides service managers and their design consultants with the information required to design high quality facilities for people living with dementia. The information is provided through education and on-site consultation. 




Recommendation 9



The Committee recommends that the accreditation standards for Residential Aged Care Facilities reflect a better balance between clinical and quality-of-life outcomes (para 4.80).




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation.



One of the key principles underpinning the NFAD is ""People with dementia are valued and respected, including their rights to choice, dignity, safety (physical, emotional and psychological) and quality of life.""


Consumer focus is one of the fundamental principles underlying the provision of quality care and services, whether the expected outcomes concern clinical care or lifestyle related outcomes. Residential aged care services are assessed against the Accreditation Standards by the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency. The Accreditation Standards contain four Standards and 44 Expected outcomes. The four standards are:


1. Management systems, staffing and organisational development


2. Health and personal care


3. Resident lifestyle


4. Physical environment and safe systems.


The Accreditation Standards were designed to protect and foster quality of care and quality of life of care recipients of aged care homes. They were also designed to support a structured approach to the delivery of quality care to care recipients.


The Accreditation Standards and expected outcomes cover a comprehensive range of care outcomes for consumers, from health and personal care through to considerations of independence, leisure interests, cultural and spiritual life, and the safety of consumers and staff. These care outcomes must be delivered in a way that enhance a consumer' s dignity and rights and promote well-being in a safe and comfortable living environment.


As previously noted, the Government has commenced the development of a Single Aged Care Quality Framework across the aged care sector. The new standards are being co-designed with industry and consumers, with advice from a Technical Advisory Group. In developing a single set of standards the intention is to:


provide consumers with greater consistency in expectations and continuity throughout their aged care journey


provide a greater focus on consumer engagement in line with a consumer directed care model


reinforce the consumer' s right to take risks in the pursuit of quality of life.


Consultation has been conducted on the draft single set of standards. The standards are being refined based on feedback from consumers and the sector. Once revised, the standards will be tested with a small group of providers. This work will be led by the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency. Further work will also be undertaken to develop education and guidance material to support the implementation of the new standards. Any changes to the standards will also involve amendment to the aged care legislation.


In addition to changes to Accreditation Standards, the voluntary National Aged Care Quality Indicator (QI) Program commenced in January 2016 with three clinical indicators (pressure injuries, use of physical restraint and unplanned weight loss) for residential aged care services.


Throughout 2016, the Department of Health worked closely with the National Aged Care Alliance Quality Indicators Reference Group, providers and consumers about next steps for the QI Program. Three tools to measure consumer experience and quality of life were piloted in residential aged care and home care. At the same time, the department also undertook a pilot to measure consumer goal attainment in home care.


In the longer term, information on QIs will be published on the My Aged Care website to give consumers transparent, comparable information about the quality in aged care to assist decision making; and for providers to have robust, valid data to measure and monitor their performance and support continuous quality improvement. 




Recommendation 10



The Committee recommends that a phased program of accredited training in dementia and the management of Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) be required for all employees of Residential Age Care Facilities (para 5.44).




Supported In-Principle





The Australian Government supports this recommendation in-principle and acknowledges workforce training and education is a shared responsibility between government and industry.



Priority four of the NFAD is ""Accessing ongoing care and support"". The related action to which the Government has committed is: Provide and promote dementia training and ongoing education for all staff that care for people living with dementia. 


The Aged Care Act 1997 requires approved providers of Commonwealth-subsidised residential aged care to meet the Accreditation Standards and ensure that all care recipients are provided with quality care and services. The Accreditation Standards require aged care providers to ensure that staff have the appropriate knowledge and skills to effectively perform their roles. Recognising that many of the levers to influence the workforce rest with employers and providers, the primary responsibility for workforce rests with providers. Aged care providers are best placed to determine and manage their workforce needs. The Government will assist the sector with the development of an aged care workforce strategy.


The Government funds a suite of programs to help embed best practice care of people living with BPSD in the aged care workforce.


On 25 January 2016, the Government announced a new national approach to dementia care and training, in response to the 2015 Analysis of Dementia Programs. The DTP is now funded to provide nationally consistent dementia-specific training to aged and health care providers and their staff in order to improve the care and wellbeing of people living with dementia. The DTP' s training offerings for employees of residential aged care staff include the understanding of changed behaviours and the management of BPSD. Training is delivered across Australia, including in many rural locations.


DTP training for aged care providers and their employees includes: 


accredited dementia care vocational level training courses – free to eligible care workers in residential, respite, community care or the wider health services 


tailored onsite training to aged care providers who request assistance, including a dementia skills and environment audit, followed by a tailored training package.


As noted previously, the national DBMAS supports staff and carers in community and residential care services, including respite care. DBMAS provides information, advice, assessment and short term case management interventions to improve the quality of life of the person living with dementia. SBRTs support Commonwealth funded approved residential aged care (including respite care) providers requiring assistance with addressing the needs of people with severe and very severe BPSD. In addition to providing person-centred interventions, both programs offer capacity building and resources for carers and organisations to improve skills in the care of people living with dementia in the longer term.   




Recommendation 11 



The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth take a proactive stance in highlighting the importance of staff training in dementia care, and develop linkages between care and education providers (para 5.45).




Supported In-Principle 





The Australian Government supports this recommendation in-principle. 



Priority four of the NFAD is ""Accessing ongoing care and support"". The related action to which the Government has committed is: Provide and promote dementia training and ongoing education for all staff that care for people living with dementia. 


As previously noted, the Australian Government now funds the DTP to provide nationally consistent dementia-specific training to aged and health care providers and their staff in order to improve the care and wellbeing of people living with dementia. In addition to the training for aged care providers and their employees previously noted, the DTA provides Continuing Professional Development training on dementia assessment, diagnosis and management to GPs, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, specialists, allied health and other relevant professionals as appropriate.


Delivered by a consortium of five universities and Dementia Australia, the DTP has a strong Essential Collaborators Network with members from leading aged care, specialist dementia care, health education and research organisations and actively promotes training for staff in aged, primary and acute care settings. 


The DTP engages strongly with aged care and health providers and provides a customised combination of recommended courses, services and resources in response to an audit of the environment and an assessment of staff dementia skills and knowledge.


The DTP learning pathway is designed to enable clients to participate in training options which progress their knowledge from a foundation level to advanced dementia knowledge. The DTP supports choice in learning preferences, depths of engagement, training modality, and accreditation needs. It enables flexible training entry and exit points according to topic, time, and organisational factors.




Recommendation 12



The Committee recommends that the use of antipsychotic medication should be reviewed by the prescribing doctor after the first three months to assess the ongoing need. (para 6.19)




Supported In-Principle





The Australian Government supports this recommendation in-principle. 



Under priority four ""accessing ongoing care and support"", the NFAD notes: 


A decision about the use of medicine to treat BPSD is a clinical one made by the prescriber based on individual circumstances... Feedback should be obtained from people with dementia, their carers and families and regular pharmaceutical reviews by pharmacists and prescribers conducted. 


As previously noted, the NHMRC Cognitive Decline Partnership Centre (the Centre) has developed Clinical Practice Guidelines and Principles of Care for People with Dementia (the Guidelines) in consultation with an expert multi-disciplinary Guideline Adaptation Committee convened by the Centre. Clinical Practice Guidelines have been shown to improve quality and consistency of care for people with a range of conditions.


The Guidelines advise that, if medication is used to manage BPSD, a range of consultations and medication management techniques should be implemented and:


its use should be reviewed every four to 12 weeks, considering the need for antipsychotics and possible cessation of medication


the review should include regular assessment and recording of changes in cognition and target symptoms.


The Guidelines also advise that, due to the increased risk of serious adverse events, people with mild-to-moderate behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia should not usually be prescribed antipsychotic medications. In addition, the Guideline Adaptation Committee found that reducing over-prescription of antipsychotics should be prioritised for further research.


The decision to prescribe antipsychotic medicines for a resident of a residential aged care facility is a clinical decision made by the resident' s treating medical practitioner in consultation with the resident and their family or representative and other clinicians. As with any prescribing decision, the treating medical practitioner must balance the potential benefits of treatment against the potential risks, while taking into account the particular clinical circumstances of each resident. This decision is part of the overall care plan that Commonwealth funded aged care providers are required to develop and implement for each resident, which includes a thorough assessment of the resident' s physical and mental health to determine the most appropriate response to meet their care needs.


With respect to subsidy, in Australia there are already strict Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) restrictions, around the prescribing of antipsychotics to ensure they are used appropriately. 


Most antipsychotic medicines available under the PBS require the prescriber to obtain and include an authority code on the prescription from the Department of Human Services. Prescribers are required to prescribe in accordance with the PBS restriction criteria and keep evidence of compliance and patient eligibility on patient records. The prescriber must also prescribe in accordance with his/her approved scope of practice under state or territory law, and comply with other State and Territory laws that regulate prescribing.


The independent, statutory Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) provides recommendations to the Government about PBS listings based on clinical evidence, and takes into account quality use of medicines issues in making its recommendations. As an example, at its November 2015 meeting, the PBAC recommended that an amendment be made to the PBS restriction for risperidone for the indication of behavioural disturbance in patients who have dementia and who have failed to respond to non-pharmacological methods of treatment, to align with the revised TGA indication. This amendment restricts use to moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer' s type and limits duration of treatment to 12 weeks based on updated evidence about the efficacy and toxicity of this medicine. Further information is available at http://www.pbs.gov.au/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/psd/2015-11/files/risperidone-psd-november-2015.pdf.


A Post-Market Review of PBS Anti-Dementia Medicines for Alzheimer' s Disease was completed in 2012. The PBAC considered the Review report in December 2012 and accepted the Report' s findings that these medicines are being used in a broader population and for longer periods of time than originally anticipated. 


To account for the use of these medicines in a broader population, the PBAC made a number of recommendations including restriction changes to make access to these medicines clinically appropriate for prescribers and patients who respond to treatment. Further information is available on the PBS Post-Market review website at: http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/reviews/anti-dementia-drugs.


In addition, as part of the announcement of the outcomes of the Chemotherapy Review on 30 November 2013, the Prime Minister announced the Government' s intention to review the Authority Required PBS Listings. The Department of Health conducted a Post Market Review of Authority Required PBS Listings, under the Australian Government' s National Medicines Policy framework. The objective of the Review was to improve patient safety and care by reducing administrative burden for health professionals.


The Review built on the PBAC' s consideration of a submission from the Australian Medical Association that recommended the movement of a number of medicines from Authority Required to Authority Required (Streamlined). The PBAC recommended that all Authority Required listings be reviewed to ensure that restrictions appropriately reflect the level of monitoring required to manage the quality use of medicines and the identified risks. 


The Review was undertaken in tranches. The PBAC considered the first tranche of PBS Authority Required listings in December 2014 (which included medicines of the highest regulatory burden), the second tranche in March 2015 (which included medicines for psychiatric conditions such as antipsychotics), the third in July 2015, antibiotics and opioids in August 2015 and dermatological listings in December 2015.


The Review of Authority Required PBS listings is now complete. Implementation of PBAC recommendations is being progressed. The final Review report is expected to be published on the pbs.gov.au website in September 2017. 


Further information about the Review of PBS Authority Required medicines is available on the PBS Post-Market Review website at:


http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/reviews/authority-required-listings.


The Government has funded two separate projects through the University of Tasmania and the University of New South Wales at a total cost of $4.1 million (2013 to 2016) aimed at reducing the use of sedative and antipsychotic medications in residential aged care facilities (RACFs).


Both projects involved the: 


measurement of antipsychotic medication use in participating RACFs


education and training of participating GPs, staff, pharmacists and families on risks related to inappropriate antipsychotic medication use


regular review of individual residents taking antipsychotic medication by the prescribing doctor 


Findings from these projects will inform future policy. 




Recommendation 13



The Committee recommends that residential aged care facilities, as part of their existing Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency annual audit process, report:


circumstances where an individual has been prescribed antipsychotic medication for more than six months, together with the reasons for and any steps taken to minimise that use; and


general usage patterns of antipsychotic medications in each facility (para 6.20).




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation. 



Under priority four ""accessing ongoing care and support"", the NFAD notes: 


It is vital to adopt a collaborative approach to the management of medications for people with dementia as many medicines may induce or worsen BPSD. Feedback should be obtained from people with dementia, their carers and families and regular pharmaceutical reviews by pharmacists and prescribers conducted.


Approved providers of residential aged care must meet the requirements of the Accreditation Standards under the Aged Care Act 1997. Further, each state and territory has legislation covering the use, administration and ordering of medicines. This may include the relevant minimum competency or qualification level required. Providers are required to ensure that all treatments and procedures, including medication, comply with the requirements of their specific state and territory laws (Aged Care Principles 2014; Schedule 1, part 2, item 2.4). 


Each provider should consider the needs of their care recipients, the meeting of the Standards and the local legislation governing the use of medicines in determining the staffing skill mix they require and the processes they may use. While state and territory legislation provides the minimum requirement, a provider may need to implement additional steps or a higher skill mix depending on the specific needs of the care recipients in their care. 


In considering the ability to meet the needs of care recipients, providers need to ensure that they are cognisant of the steps in medication management. Medication management involves more than the administration of a medicine. It also includes, for example, the monitoring of a care recipient after administration of a medication. It can also involve a decision about administering a medication versus withholding a medication while obtaining further medical advice. Providers need to ensure that they have a system that covers all aspects of medication management and regularly evaluate and review their medication management systems and processes. A resource in this area is the Australian Government' s Guiding principles for medication management in residential aged care facilities, disseminated to all residential aged care homes. 


The decision to prescribe antipsychotic medicines for a care recipient is a clinical decision made by the care recipient' s treating medical practitioner in consultation with the resident and/or their representative. As with any prescribing decision, the treating medical practitioner must balance the potential benefits of treatment against the potential risks while taking into account the particular clinical circumstances of each care recipient.


Additionally, the Australian Government supported the development and testing of a standardised medication chart for residential aged care that has been trialled and was fully implemented during 2014-15. The new chart released in 2014 serves as both a prescription for most PBS and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) medicines as well as a record of medication administration. Testing of the chart has demonstrated improved resident safety and will, over time, provide better aged care sector utilisation data on medicines, including rates of antipsychotic use. 


Documents related to the medication chart are available on the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission) website:


http://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/medication-safety/nrmc.


The Commission held a national roundtable on reducing inappropriate use of antipsychotics in older people in October 2016. The purpose of the roundtable was to seek expert advice on ways to reduce inappropriate use of antipsychotics in older people with BPSD, and to identify and prioritise strategies for action in the community, residential aged care and acute hospital settings. 


The Government has funded two separate projects through the University of Tasmania and the University of New South Wales at a total cost of $4.1 million (2013 to 2016) aimed at reducing the use of sedative and antipsychotic medications in Residential Aged Care facilities (RACFs). Findings from these projects will be used to develop future policy.


Both projects involved the: 


measurement of antipsychotic medication use in RACFs


education and training of GPs, staff, pharmacists and families on risks related to inappropriate antipsychotic medication use


promotion of non-drug strategies to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms in people living with dementia.




Recommendation 14



The committee recommends that the Commonwealth develop, in consultation with dementia advocates and service providers, guidelines for the recording and reporting on the use of all forms of restraints in residential facilities (para 6.31).




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation. 



The Australian Government has a regulatory framework in place to monitor the quality of care older Australians receive in aged care facilities through accreditation, complaints, quality reporting, compliance and compulsory reporting. As outlined in the response to recommendation 10, the Aged Care Act 1997 requires approved providers of Commonwealth subsidised residential aged care to meet the Accreditation Standards and ensure that all care recipients are provided with quality care and services. 


The decision to use restraints in residential aged care facilities is a clinical decision and must be made in consultation with the care recipient and/or their representative, staff and their medical practitioner. Any use of restraint should be included in the resident' s care plan. In making decisions on the application of restrictive practices, care providers must balance a patient' s basic legal and human rights (consistent with the aged care standards) with their duty of care to protect the patient, other residents and staff from harm.


In recognition of the issues facing aged care providers around restraint use the Australian Government has supplied providers with a decision making guide on this issue since 2004. This was updated in 2012 and expanded into the following separate guides for residential and community care:


The Decision-Making-Tool: Supporting a Restraint Free Environment in Residential aged care


The Decision-Making-Tool: Supporting a Restraint Free Environment in Community aged care.


The decision making tools provide staff, managers and carers with information and practical strategies on organisational, environmental, physical and psychosocial considerations that reduce the need to consider restraint as a care option. These toolkits include posters and information sheets which can be photocopied to provide in-house education and an information sheet that has been designed to be photocopied and handed to relatives. 


An important avenue in which care recipients and their families can raise concerns about the quality of care provided is the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner, which includes responding to concerns about the use of any form of restraint. The Commissioner takes all complaints seriously and seeks to achieve quality and timely outcomes for care recipients and providers. Where the Department of Health identifies significant failures of an aged care provider to meet their legislative responsibilities compliance action can be taken. 


The level of complaints to the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner from residents and/or their families or representatives in relation to the use of restraints is quite low. Analysis of complaints data in 2016 indicates that 1.3 per cent of all complaints are in relation to the use of chemical or physical restraint.


As outlined in the response to Recommendation 9, one of the three quality indicators in the National Aged Care Quality Indicator Program is use of physical restraint.




Recommendation 15



The committee recommends that the Commonwealth collect and report:


the number of residents in aged care and acute care facilities with a diagnosis of dementia; 


the number of these residents who are taking, or have taken, antipsychotic medication;


the number of instances where a patient has been prescribed multiple anti-psychotic medications; 


the reason the medication was prescribed; and 


the average duration of a course of prescribed antipsychotics. (para 6.32)




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation.



Under priority four ""accessing ongoing care and support"", the NFAD notes: 


A decision about the use of medicine to treat BPSD is a clinical one made by the prescriber based on individual circumstances. It is vital to adopt a collaborative approach to the management of medications for people with dementia as many medicines may induce or worsen BPSD.


ACAT assessments and Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) appraisals currently collect data about diagnoses of dementia among clients.


In the Aged Care Assessment Program (ACAP), dementia may be reported among the health conditions recorded in each ACAT assessment. Diagnoses of dementia that may be recorded include Alzheimer' s disease, vascular dementia, and dementia as a symptom of other diseases. From 2016-17, ACATs'  transition to use My Aged Care systems enables the availability of this data to the Department of Health at the individual client level. 


ACFI appraisals also collect information about diagnosed health conditions, including dementia, for permanent residents in Australian Government-subsidised residential aged care facilities. The ACFI appraisal pack includes a mental and behavioural disorders checklist that allows for the reporting of up to three mental and behavioural diagnoses for each permanent resident. It has previously been reported that over half of all permanent residents with an ACFI appraisal had a diagnosis of dementia . 


People admitted to hospital with dementia may have their diagnosis documented as part of the collection of data in Australian hospitals. Dementia may be recorded as a principal or additional diagnosis. However, research has confirmed that dementia is poorly recorded. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care' s resource titled A better way to care: safe and high quality care for patients with cognitive impairment (dementia and delirium) in hospitals emphasises the importance of recognising people with cognitive impairment to reduce increased risks of harm. Uptake of its key strategies may result in increased dementia and delirium coding and therefore a more accurate reflection of dementia rates in hospitals.


Overall access to medicines in residential aged care is through the PBS and RPBS. The Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee (DUSC) considered an analysis of PBS antipsychotics prescription data in February 2013 and produced a report for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) in June 2013. The Public Summary Document detailing the PBAC' s consideration, discussion and recommendation from the DUSC review is publicly available on the PBS website at www.pbs.gov.au/info/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/psd/2013-08/antipsychotics.


The 2013 DUSC reports are available on the PBS website at www.pbs.gov.au/info/industry/listing/participants/public-release-docs/dusc-public-release-documents-by-medicine. In addition, PBAC recommended that DUSC review the whole class of antipsychotic drugs, 24 months after any changes in the pack size or number of repeats. This DUSC review was considered at the November 2016 PBAC meeting. The outcome statement of PBAC' s consideration of the 2016 review can be viewed from the PBS website at www.pbs.gov.au/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/pbac-outcomes/2016-11/dusc-report-2016-11.pdf. The PBAC noted that there was less use of low dose (25 mg) quetiapine indicating a reduction in the inappropriate prescribing of quetiapine for non-psychotic indications, such as sedation. The PBAC requested that DUSC continue to monitor the use of antipsychotics.


In addition, MedicineWise (NPS) is funded by the Government to assist prescribers and patients in the quality use of medicines and provide support for health professionals to assist their clinical management decisions. NPS has developed resources to help residential aged care staff understand and improve the management of medicines. These include Drug Use Evaluation (DUE) toolkits that help promote best practice medicines use in residential aged care homes. Two of these kits relate to sedation and use of antipsychotics. 


As discussed in the response to Recommendation 13, a national standardised medication chart for residential aged care services was made available in 2014. Testing of the chart has demonstrated improved resident safety and will, over time, provide better aged care sector utilisation data on medicines, including rates of antipsychotic use.


The Commission held a national roundtable on reducing inappropriate use of antipsychotics in older people on 26 October 2016. The purpose of the roundtable was to seek expert advice on ways to reduce inappropriate use of antipsychotics in older people with BPSD, and to identify and prioritise strategies for action in the community, residential aged care and acute hospital settings. 


The Government has funded two separate projects through the University of Tasmania and the University of New South Wales at a total cost of $4.1 million (2013 to 2016) aimed at reducing the use of sedative and antipsychotic medications in Residential Aged Care facilities (RACFs). Findings from these projects will be used to develop future policy.


Both projects involved the: 


measurement of antipsychotic medication use in RACFs


education and training of GPs, staff, pharmacists and families on risks related to inappropriate antipsychotic medication use


regular review of individual residents taking antipsychotic medication by the prescribing doctor.




Recommendation 16



The committee recommends that the Commonwealth undertake an information program for doctors and residential aged care facilities regarding the guidelines Responding to Issues of Restraint in Aged Care in Residential Care. (para 6.48)




Supported In-Principle





The Australian Government supports this recommendation in-principle. 



One of the key principles underpinning the NFAD is ""People with dementia are valued and respected, including their rights to choice, dignity, safety (physical, emotional and psychological) and quality of life.""


As mentioned in the response to Recommendation 14, the Australian Government has supplied providers with a decision making guide on this issue since 2004. This was updated in 2012 and expanded into the following separate guides for residential and community care:


The Decision-Making-Tool: Supporting a Restraint Free Environment in Residential aged care


The Decision-Making-Tool: Supporting a Restraint Free Environment in Community aged care.


These toolkits include posters and information sheets which can be photocopied to provide in-house education and an information sheet that has been designed to be photocopied and handed to relatives. 


An extensive information program has already been undertaken to support the uptake of the guidelines including:


presentations based on the guidelines were made at the Better Practice Conferences sponsored by the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency held around Australia throughout 2013


the toolkits were distributed to all Australian Government funded residential and home care providers nationally in late 2012. Additional printed copies of the resources are also available on request from National Mail and Marketing. In addition, the toolkits have been placed on the Department of Health' s website and are currently available to download at https://agedcare.health.gov.au/publications-articles/resources-learning-training/decision-making-tool-supporting-a-restraint-free-environment


since October 2012 over 7,560 copies of the toolkit have been distributed to residential aged care providers, and over 5,030 to home care providers from National Mail and Marketing.


As previously noted, the Australian Government funds the DTP to provide dementia-specific training to aged care, health care and other community providers and their staff. All of the training offerings promote the development of knowledge and skills and the creation of environments in which the use of physical and chemical restraints are not required. This includes the identification of strategies to prevent the emergence of BPSD and methods for identifying and minimising triggers of BPSD, which may include staff practices, pain, discomfort, environmental stressors or over stimulation.


DBMAS, SBRT and Dementia Training Australia all support minimal use of restraints including chemical restraints. DBMAS provides best practice guides for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and conducts reviews to minimise the use of medication that has a negative impact on a person' s emotional or cognitive state.




Recommendation 17



The Committee recommends that a review of the adequacy of respite facilities for Younger Onset Dementia patients be carried out urgently (para 7.29).




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation.



Priority four of the NFAD is ""Accessing ongoing care and support"". The related action to which the Government has committed is: 


Provide people with dementia and their carers and families access to appropriate and responsive respite services. 


People who are experiencing dementia and are under the age of 65 can face different challenges to those faced by older Australians with dementia and the Australian Government acknowledges the unique respite needs of people with younger onset dementia and their carers. 


Under the Aged Care Services Improvement Healthy Ageing Grants process 2014 funding was available under priority 2 - responding to existing and emerging challenges including de of markementia care, for initiatives that supported good-practice models of respite care for younger people living with dementia and developed resources that assist organisations to tailor their services to younger people living with dementia.


Two projects were successful in this process:


1. Tailor Made, good practice model for respite services for people with Younger Onset Dementia and their families


2. Making Flexible Respite Care A Practical Reality.


There is no age restriction on residential respite care, so clients with Younger Onset Dementia (YOD) have the same access to respite as other people with an ACAT assessment. YOD clients can also access services from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). The NDIS is rolling out nationally over three years (2016-2019) and currently operating in a number of locations across Australia. Findings from the NDIS trial sites coupled with the experience gained during roll-out provides an opportunity to learn, and ensure better outcomes for Australians with disability, their families and carers.


A number of reviews of the NDIS have been commissioned to take place between 2013 and 2017. The reviews will provide information on elements of launch, including performance against aims and objectives and the impact of some policy approaches. In particular, the Evaluation and Review of the NDIS Launch, conducted by the National Institute of Labour Studies, Flinders University and the review of the Lessons Learned from the Trial may provide insights relevant to this recommendation. The Government will reconsider this recommendation upon completion of these reviews.


Currently YOD clients are also able to access respite through other gateways, where there is another diagnosed disability or ailment. For example, the Government funds 109 Mental Health Respite Carer Support organisations across Australia, noting funding is transitioning to the NDIS for this program as care recipients are able to be supported by the NDIS. These services provide flexible respite and support to carers and families of people with mental illness. Carers of people with YOD are able to access these services, provided the care recipient also has a mental illness which is impacting on their ability to function in the community.


In 2013, the Australian Government engaged the University of Wollongong (UoW) to undertake an International Literature Review and a Needs and Feasibility Assessment of Services for People with Younger Onset Dementia. The UoW review and assessment were completed in February 2014, and provided principles of appropriate care and can be used to inform future health care design regarding respite for people living with dementia, their families and their carers. Providers are aware of these principles, and have been encouraged to reference them. The principles are available to the sector online at: http://ahsri.uow.edu.au/chsd/projects/yod/index.html.




Recommendation 18



The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth fund the development of a pilot Younger Onset Dementia specific respite facility at either the Barwon or Hunter area National Disability Insurance Scheme trial sites.( para 7.30)




Noted





The Australian Government notes this recommendation.



Priority four of the NFAD is ""Accessing ongoing care and support"". The related action to which the Government has committed is: 


Provide people with dementia and their carers and families access to appropriate and responsive respite services. 


The NDIS provides funding for long-term, individualised care and support that is reasonable and necessary to meet the needs of people with permanent disability, where a person' s disability significantly affects their communication, mobility, self-care or self-management. This includes people with Younger Onset Dementia (YOD).


Under the NDIS people with permanent and significant disability, supported by their families and carers as appropriate, will work to develop their own personal plan for support, based on their goals and aspirations and their individual needs. The scheme will empower people with disability to engage as equal partners in decisions that will affect their lives. This includes having choice over the types of support they want and how these are delivered.


The National Disability Insurance Agency has a Catalogue of Supports that outlines the range of services that can be delivered to participants, provided they are related to the participant' s disability, achievement of outcomes and ultimately their goals. 


In addition to support through the NDIS, clients with YOD can also access respite care through the aged care system. As outlined in the response to Recommendation 17, there is no age restriction on residential respite care, so clients with YOD have the same access to respite as other people with an ACAT assessment.




Australian Government Response to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee Report on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2017 November 2017





Recommendation 1:





The committee recommends that the proposed mandatory factors, as drafted in subsection 46(2) of the bill, be removed.





Response



The Australian Government adopted this recommendation by successfully moving parliamentary amendments to remove the 'mandatory factors' from subsection 46(2) (see Hansard, House of Representatives, 27 March 2017, p3264).




Recommendation 2:





The committee recommends that the government undertake a post-implementation review of the reforms to section 46 at least five years after commencement.





Response



The Australian Government supports this recommendation in principle, as it will provide an opportunity to ensure that section 46 is working as intended. The timing of a review will need to take account of the extent to which the courts have had the opportunity to develop jurisprudence on the new provision.




Recommendation 
3:





The committee recommends that the bill be passed. 





Response



On 14 August 2017, the Senate passed the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2017 (see Hansard, pp5568-69).




Dissenting report by Labor Senators Recommendation 
1:





That the Senate should not pass the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2016.





Response



On 14 August 2017, the Senate passed the Bill (see Hansard, pp5568-69),




Additional comments by Senator Xenophon Recommendation 1:





A 
'
cost waiver order
'
 should be introduced into market power abuse litigation cases to improve access to justice.





Response



The Australian Government responded to this recommendation in the Senate on 14 August 2017 (Senator Cormann, Hansard, p5561).




Recommendation 2:





A divestiture order must be made available as a judicial remedy for serious or repeat market power abuse offender cases.





Response



The Australian Government responded to this recommendation in the Senate on 14 August 2017 (Senator Cormann, Hansard, p5556).




Recommendation 3:





As per Draft Harper Review Recommendation 25, to mitigate concerns about over-capture a defence should be introduced so that the primary prohibition would not apply if the conduct in question:




would be a rational business decision or strategy by a corporation that did not have a substantial degree of power in the market; and




the effect or likely effect of the conduct is to benefit the long-term interests of consumers.





The onus of proving that the defence applies should fall on the corporation engaging in the conduct.





Response:



The Government does not support this recommendation as the proposed defence would be broad, and could increase uncertainty about the operation of section 46. The Government also notes that, on 14 August 2017, Senator Xenophon withdrew a proposed amendment to the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2017, which sought to introduce the defence, and acknowledged the defence would be unnecessary (Senator Xenophon, Hansard, p5555).




Australian Government response to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry report: Operation, effectiveness, and consequences of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Location of Corporate Commonwealth Entities) Order 2016





INTRODUCTION



On 8 February 2017, the Senate referred an inquiry into the operation, effectiveness, and consequences of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Location of Corporate Commonwealth Entities) Order 2016 (the Order), to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee (the committee). The committee examined:


a. the process leading to the making of the order


b. the policy of relocating corporate Commonwealth entities with agricultural policy or regulatory responsibilities, including:


i. the identity of corporate Commonwealth entities that could be affected


ii. the policy's effect on the ability of affected entities to perform their functions


iii. economic, environmental and capability implications of the policy


c. the application of this policy to the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), including:


i. the plan for relocation


ii. the ability of the APVMA to perform its functions from its new location, and any consequent risks to:


A. human and animal health


B. productivity and profitability to the agriculture and fisheries sectors


C. chemical industries


D. Australia's trading reputation


d. any other related matters.


The committee reported on these matters on 9 June 2017. The majority report outlines five recommendations and the Australian Greens' additional comments outline one recommendation. The Australian Government provides the following response.




D
ETAILED RESPONSE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MAJORITY REPORT









RECOMMENDATION 1



The committee recommends that the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Location of Corporate Commonwealth Entities) Order 2016 be revoked.











The Australian Government does not support the recommendation.



Government policy orders, issued under subsection 22(1) of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PG PA Act), provide a legislative mechanism designed to apply government policies to corporate Commonwealth entities.


The Order was developed and applied to the APVMA to give effect to the government's policy, first outlined in its 2016 election commitment, to establish a Centre of Agricultural Excellence in Armidale by co-locating the APVMA with the University of New England (UNE) and its specialised agricultural research centres (The Coalition's Policy for a Stronger Agriculture Sector)'.


The government is continuing to implement this election commitment; and has provided the APVMA with $25.6 million to help manage its relocation to Armidale.








RECOMMENDATION 2



The committee recommends that the move of the APVMA be paused until the APVMA concludes its review of its business model.











The Australian Government does not support the recommendation.



The APVMA released its relocation strategy (APVMA in Armidale: Relocation Strategy)2 in December 2016. The strategy outlines how the APVMA will implement the government's 2016 election commitment to relocate to Armidale, including how it will manage risks and opportunities. A component of the strategy includes developing a new business model, which is well underway. Once completed, the business model will inform how the APVMA will operate in Armidale; and help shape its relocation from Canberra. While the business model will be an important part of the APVMA operations in the years to come, there is no need to pause the move on account of this work.








RECOMMENDATION 3



The committee recommends that the establishment of the regulatory science course at the University of New England is actively encouraged and supported by the Commonwealth. The establishment of this course should not be contingent on the relocation of the APVMA.











The Australian Government notes the recommendation.



In February 2017, the UNE began offering a Graduate Certificate in Science (Regulatory Science) and a Graduate Diploma in Science (Regulatory Science). A Master of Regulatory Science is also in development.


The UNE has established an Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Regulatory Science Industry Advisory Board to provide advice and input to ensure its regulatory science courses meet the needs of both the APVMA and its industry partners. The board held its inaugural meeting on 21 July 2017 and includes members from the UNE, APVMA, Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Animal Medicines Australia, CropLife Australia, Veterinary Manufacturers and Distributors Association and the National Farmers' Federation. The UNE is also developing partnerships with other government members of the Regulatory Science Network3 to ensure its courses also meet the regulatory science needs of these agencies.


The UNE has advised the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources that a key motivation for students commencing the regulatory science courses is the possibility of future employment with the APVMA in Armidale. The government commends the UNE in developing these courses, which will fill an important gap in the market.








RECOMMENDATION 4



The committee recommends that the Finance Minister apply greater scrutiny to future requests or orders to be made under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 with a specific focus on consideration being given to the following:


the financial and governance implications on an agency from an order under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013; and


a cost-benefit analysis. In the event that a cost-benefit analysis does not identify a net benefit from the proposed order, the Finance Minister should require the relevant minister to explain the grounds on which the order should be made.











The Australian Government notes the recommendation.



This recommendation does not appear to recognise the policy, that corporate Commonwealth entities with agricultural policy or regulatory responsibilities be located in a regional community and within 10 kilometres by road of a regional university recognised for research and teaching in agricultural science, applied by the Order, had already received formal government consideration and approval. It is not the Finance Minister's role to re-make a government policy already made through due process.


In making an order to apply a policy to a corporate Commonwealth entity under section 22 of the PGPA Act, the Finance Minister must be satisfied that the minister responsible for the policy has consulted the entity on the application of the policy. Such consultation occurred in November 2016.








RECOMMENDATION 5



The committee recommends that a broad inquiry led by representatives from both Houses of Parliament be undertaken into the merits of decentralisation, and the appropriate policy mechanisms for undertaking it.











The Australian Government notes the recommendation.



On 1 June 2017, the House of Representatives established a Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation to inquire and report on best practice approaches to regional


3 The Regulatory Science Network is a group of nine government agencies and departments responsible for the regulation of chemicals and biological agents in Australia (apvma.gov.au/node/15496).


development, the decentralisation of Commonwealth entities, and supporting corporate decentralisation. The Select Committee is due to produce its final report by 28 February 2018.


This inquiry is in addition to the whole-of-government process, announced by the Minister for Regional Development on 19 April 2017, to consider Commonwealth entities that may be suitable for decentralisation. This process is methodical and rigorous, involving a staged approach that includes the Cabinet's consideration of initial criteria and a two-stage business case process.


As there is significant government and parliamentary work underway on decentralisation issues, the government does not see a need to undertake an additional inquiry.




DETAILED RESPONSE TO THE AUSTRALIAN GREENS ADDITIONAL COMMENTS









RECOMMENDATION 1



That the APVMA relocation be scrapped entirely and that the APVMA remain located at its current site in the ACT.











The Australian Government does not support the recommendation.



The Australian Government is committed—consistent with its 2016 election policy—to relocating the APVMA to Armidale to establish a Centre of Agricultural Excellence by co-locating it with the UNE and other specialised agricultural research centres in the region.


This move provides an opportunity to build an efficient and effective regulator; and improve how the APVMA works with its clients, which will increase farmers' access to new chemicals and reduce costs to business.




Australian Government response to the Senate Select Committee on Health First Interim Report





Senate Select Committee on Health First Interim Report





Recommendation 1





The committee recommends that the government should immediately 
abandon its 
plan to implement the 
$7 
copayments.



Agreed.


There is no plan to implement the $7.00 co-payment.




Recommendation 2





The committee notes the evidence of the negative implications of the government
'
s:




changed hospital funding indexation arrangements that will see public hospitals funded on the basis of population growth and CPI;




cuts to the National Health Reform Agreements and associated National Partnership Agreements; and




lack of commitment to Activity Based Funding.





The evidence points to a significant loss of health services in Australia
'
s public hospitals if these changes proceed.





On the basis of the evidence to the committee, the government should restate its commitment to Activity Based Funding and associated reforms.



Support in-principle.


As announced in the Budget 2017-18, the Australian Government will deliver an overall investment of over $10 billion in the Long-Term National Health Plan — based on the four pillars of Guaranteeing Medicare and access to medicines; Supporting our hospitals; Prioritising mental health, preventive health; and sport; and Investing in medical research.


The Commonwealth's contribution to public hospital services has experienced significant growth since the 2014-15 Budget. Between 2014-15 and 2015-16, Commonwealth funding for public hospitals under the NHRA increased from $15.5 billion to $17.2 billion, representing growth of $1.7 billion or 11.1 per cent. Further to this, Commonwealth funding for public hospitals continues to grow over the forward estimates from $18.5 billion in 2016-17 to $22.7 billion in 2020-21, representing growth of $4.2 billion or 22.8 per cent.


Since the release of this interim report, a Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Heads of Agreement on Public Hospital Funding (HoA) was signed on 1 April 2016, which effectively reversed the decision of the 2014-15 Budget to index hospital funding by CPI and population growth from 2017-18. As part of the first wave of reform under the Long-Term National Health Plan, to give effect to the HoA, an Addendum to the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) began on 1 July 2017.


The HoA retains important parts of the existing public hospital funding arrangements under the NHRA, including Activity Based Funding (ABF), which provides transparency of the services delivered, and the pricing of hospital services at a National Efficient Price (NEP). The HoA also introduces a national cap on growth in the Commonwealth contribution to public hospital services. This cap, set at 6.5 per cent per annum, demonstrates the Commonwealth's commitment to sustainable growth in hospital funding and will encourage the states and territories to do all they can to reduce costs and improve efficiency.




Recommendation 3





The committee recommends that, based on the evidence before it, and the demonstrated benefits arising from the work of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency (ANPHA) and the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health, the government should drop its plans to abolish ANPHA and reinstate the National Partnership Agreement on Preventative Health.



Not Agreed.


Preventive health measures formerly administered by ANPHA were transferred to the Department of Health on 1 July 2014. The Department continues to support the effective delivery of preventive health measures to reduce health related risk factors within the Australian population. It is not possible to fully quantify funding on the Department's prevention activities, as measures can have a broad remit. For example, preventive health can include guidance to clinicians, support for health service provision, support for the work of peak bodies and non-government organisation (NGO) groups, research and monitoring, and intervention and disease management components that cannot be disaggregated. The Commonwealth continues to work with key health stakeholders, including the states and territories.


As announced in the Budget 2017-18, the Australian Government will deliver an overall investment of over $10 billion in the Long-Term National Health Plan (the Plan) — based on the four pillars of Guaranteeing Medicare and access to medicines; Supporting our hospitals; Prioritising mental health, preventive health; and sport; and Investing in medical research. The Plan, increases investment in health, aged care and sport to $94.2 billion in 2017-18. The funding will enable targeted investment, with a focus on high value clinical care, promotion of good health and collaboration with the health sector.


With heart disease, cancer and mental illness accounting for almost half the burden of disease in Australia, the Government is funding initiatives to support healthy lifestyles, prioritising mental health, preventive health and sport. Examples of such initiatives include:


$64.3 million to continue mammograms services for women aged 70 to 74 years under the BreastScreen Program, which complements the BreastScreen Australia services being provided for women aged 59 to 60.


$41.6 million for the Victorian Cytology Service to continue research and quality services for cervical cancer.


$40 million per calendar year to increase sport participation in schools via the Sporting Schools initiative.


$20.3 million for National Sporting Organisations to increase participation in sport.


$20 million for preventive health and research translation projects under the Medical Research Future Fund.


$15.5 million to maintain sporting grounds and services for over 2,000 athletes.


$10.8 million to fight childhood cancer through research and clinical trials.


$10 million to the Heart Foundation for the Prime Minister's Walk for Life Challenge.


$5.9 million to expand the Prostate Cancer Nurse program


$5 million to Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to develop education and training material for GPs to support Australians to achieve a healthy lifestyle through increased physical activity and better nutrition.




Recommendation 4





If the goal of better integration of primary care is to be achieved, the committee recommends that the Primary Health Networks tender must include:




a clear statement of the population health needs to be addressed, including clear outcome measures;




a statement of the population health data expected to be collected or used;




a statement on the outcomes Primary Health Networks will be expected to achieve to improve access to primary care and improve primary care integration for the whole population, in particular for disadvantaged groups; and




a requirement that the integrity of the data collected by Medicare Locals will be preserved





In considering the applications for funding for Primary Health Networks the government should have a mind to the success of Medicare Locals in:




reducing hospitalisations




improving access to after-hours primary care services




reducing rates of chronic disease




reducing smoking rates




increasing immunisation rates




improving access to mental health services




improving access to allied health services



Agreed.


In 2014-15, the Australian Government selected organisations to establish and operate 31 Primary Health Networks (PHNs) through an open competitive funding round. As part of the PHN Invitation to Apply in December 2014, applicants needed to demonstrate their capacity and capability to undertake the role of a PHN, including:


relevant subject matter expertise; and


specific examples of similar activities that demonstrated experience and capacity.


This process clearly articulated that the 31 PHNs, established on 1 July 2015, were to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of primary healthcare services for patients,


particularly those at risk of poor health outcomes; and improve coordination of care to ensure patients receive the right care, in the right place, at the right time.


Under the PHN program, PHNs also have a core set of six priorities, which are: mental health, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, population health, health workforce, digital health and aged care.


Each PHN has undertaken population health planning, including needs assessments and associated market analyses, as well as stakeholder consultations to identify service gaps, and major health and system capacity issues. This information is used by PHNs to determine their priorities and to develop activity work plans, which describe how the PHN will commission and coordinate services to address those priorities. When this process identifies needs and activities which align with work undertaken by Medicare Locals, PHNs may commission activities to continue to address their community's health needs.


A dedicated data webpage is accessible on the PHN website,


(http ://www.health.gov. au/intemet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/PHN-Home), which provides geographic-level health and demographic data specific to each PHN region.


The PHN program is actively improving the coordination and integration of a wide range of primary health services. PHNs also play an important role in providing education, training and support to general practice, as a key part of strengthening the primary health care system.


The Government provides funding to PHNs to lead mental health and suicide prevention planning at a regional level. Through a new flexible primary mental health care funding pool, PHNs in partnership with relevant services will improve outcomes for people with, or at risk of, mental illness and/or suicide.


To support PHNs in meeting their performance objectives for immunisation, the Department of Health recently engaged NPS Medicine Wise (in collaboration with the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance) through a competitive process to develop and implement a PHN Immunisation Support Program.


The Program, which commenced in June 2017, will deliver a national and coordinated approach for assisting PHNs in supporting a range of immunisation providers including GPs, nurse immunisers, community health clinics, Aboriginal Medical Services, local councils and pharmacies, in delivering immunisation programs to their patients and communities, consistent with the Australian Immunisation Handbook and National Immunisation Program.


Under the Primary Health Care Development Program, PHNs will continue to .ensure patients in their local communities can access after-hours primary health services and maintain continuity of services. PHNs received funding of $145.5 million from 2015-16 to 2016-17, to implement innovative and locally tailored after-hours solutions based on community need, recognising that all PHN regions are different.




Recommendation 5





The committee expresses its concern that the government
'
s decision to abolish 61 Medicare Locals and establish 30 new Primary Health Networks is resulting in loss of frontline services and will see significant cuts to services and programs at the local level that are aimed at improving population health, better integration of primary care services and keeping people out of hospital.



Not Agreed.


Funding for frontline services delivered through the Medicare Local Program has been maintained through PHNs.


Further to this, increased funding has been provided to PI-fNs to support them to take on a larger role in commissioning mental health care services and drug and alcohol treatment services following the Government's response to the National Mental Health Commission's Review of Mental Health Programmes and Services, and the National Ice Taskforce's Final Report.




Recommendation 6





The committee recommends that the government, as a matter of urgency, ensures certainty in regards to the maintenance of the suite of services supplied by Medicare Locals, particularly in areas of rural and remote Australia where access to medical facilities and services is less comprehensive than the level of access in metropolitan areas.



Agreed.


In the establishment of PHNs, service continuity was a priority and PHNs have managed a smooth transition of services from Medicare Locals.


Further information on this recommendation is provided under recommendation 4.




Recommendation 
7





The committee recommends that the government must take immediate steps to reinstate funding to indigenous health organisations and ensure that the particular health challenges facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are effectively analysed and responded to.



Not agreed.


Overall funding levels for Indigenous health are growing. From 2017-18 to 2020-21 the Government will invest $3.6 billion, through the Indigenous Australians' Health Programme, in Indigenous specific health programmes and activities - an increase of over $724 million compared to the previous four years (2012-13 to 2016-17). This does not include funding provided through Medicare and access to pharmaceuticals through the PBS.


To ensure continuity of access to primary health care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, funding that had been allocated to Medicare Locals prior to 1 July 2015 was transitioned to PHNs established in these regions. These PHNs were funded to deliver primary health care and New Directions: Mothers and Babies services during the transition period.


On 28 January 2016, the Department of Health approached the market with an Invitation to Apply for the continuation of services in the nine regions where PI-INs were still being funded to deliver primary health care and New Directions services. Successful applicants from this process began a transition period to the full delivery of services from 1 January 2017.


Through the 2017-18 Budget, the Government has expanded activity in the key areas of child and maternal health, and chronic disease prevention and management. For example, the Rheumatic Fever Strategy was strengthened and expanded, with funding totalling $18.8 million over four years from 2017-18.




Recommendation 8





The committee recommends that the government should cease its planned merger of the Organ and Tissue Authority and the National Blood Authority.



Agreed.


In December 2015, the Government decided not to proceed with the merger of the National Blood Authority and the Organ and Tissue Authority, as previously announced in the 2014-15 Budget.




Government Senator

Recommendation 1





That Coalition members of the Committee recommend that the Senate support reforms to improve the sustainability of health expenditure as provided for in the 2014-15 Budget.

Australian Government response to the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia Pivot North - Inquiry into the Development of Northern Australia: Final Report October 2017





OCTOBER 2017



Further developing the north to realise its full potential is in the best interest of the nation as a whole. The north has great promise; however this is limited by factors including its remoteness, challenging weather and a sparse population.


In June 2013 the Coalition released the 2030 Vision for Developing Northern Australia (2030 Vision), which was followed by the release of the Green Paper on Developing Northern Australia in June 2014. Our North, Our Future: White Paper on Developing Northern Australia (the White Paper) was released in June 2015. The White Paper sets out a plan for economic development by facilitating more private investment to the north while developing more opportunities for a range of industries and communities to grow.


The White Paper was informed by the findings of Pivot North: Inquiry into the Development of Northern Australia: Final Report (Pivot North) released by the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia (JSC), chaired by the Hon Warren Entsch MP. This report identified the important issues facing the north, including trade, industry, water and land rights. The JSC provided valuable input to the White Paper and the Australian Government's response to the development needs of the north. It highlighted the great potential of the north to further develop as a strong economic base for Australia.


The White Paper includes measures to unlock the north's potential across six key areas: simpler land arrangements to support investment; developing the north's water resources; growing the north as a business, trade and investment gateway; investing in infrastructure to lower business and household costs; reducing barriers to employing people; and improving governance.


The White Paper outlines the Australian Government's plan to open the north to world markets and to realise the north's great potential. The Australian Government is determined to take advantage of northern Australia's proximity to the strongly growing Asian region and open the north to both investment and tourism from Asia and surrounding regions.


As outlined in the White Paper, the Australian Government's priorities are to improve the business environment, cut red tape, invest in infrastructure, and strengthen partnerships with the three northern governments and neighbouring nations. Investments in infrastructure include upgrading major roads and water resources and providing concessional loans for major economic infrastructure through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Upgrading supply chain routes such as transport infrastructure will increase the north's ability to efficiently and reliably produce and get goods to market.


The White Paper acknowledges the need to safeguard Australia's northern environment for future generations and to understand our role as stewards of our unique natural wonders, such as the Great Barrier Reef, to ensure all development is done in a way that protects the outstanding universal value of such special places.


The White Paper, consistent with the 2030 Vision, also looks to establish the north as a world class centre for tropical medical research. As Asia and the tropics grow, the north is in a prime position to develop a research centre to combat diseases and other medical issues that are unique to the tropics.


We are dedicated to the further development of the north but changes are needed to realise its potential. The White Paper, in addressing many of the recommendations of the JSC, establishes the platform needed to build on the potential that is in the north.




Recommendation 1: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government create a Department of Northern Australian Development, and that it be based in northern Australia.




Response: Agreed in part — The Office of Northern Australia opened its head office in Darwin, in December 2015. The headquarters for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility is in Cairns and the Cooperative Research Centre on Developing Northern Australia headquarters opened in Townsville on 10July 2017 and will also have a presence in Darwin and WA (location yet to be determined). The White Paper commits to changes to governance arrangements (pp.115-121) including implementing the Northern Australia Strategic Partnership and measures to increase economic activity in northern Australia (pp.55-82). The Australian Government also established the Cabinet position of Minister for Resources and Northern Australia. In addition, a Ministerial Forum on Northern Development has been established. It is chaired by the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia and attended by ministers responsible for economic development from the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia.




Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government identify key roads and commit to funding their upgrade as a matter of priority, subject to relative benefit assessment by Infrastructure Australia.





Projects to consider would include:




Continued upgrade of National Highways, including the Bruce and Stuart Highways




Hann Highway




Peninsula Development Road (to the tip of Cape York)




Tanami Road




Outback Way




Beef development roads such as the Barkly Stock Route.




Response: Agreed - The Australian Government understands the importance of the land transport network in northern Australia and is therefore committed to improving its safety, efficiency and connectivity. The Australian Government notes the importance of many of the roads identified in the Pivot North Report and has committed significant funding to improve land transport infrastructure in northern Australia.


The Australian Government committed $600 million to the Northern Australia Roads Programme which focusses on inter-jurisdictional links identified in Infrastructure Australia's Northern Australia Audit, infrastructure for a Developing North Report January 2015. A further $100 million has been committed to the Northern Australia Beef Roads Programme, which aims to improve the productivity and resilience of cattle supply chains in northern Australia (pp.95-96).


The Australian Government engaged CSIRO to assess the absolute and relative benefits of more than 80 potential northern Australia road upgrades, including all of those named above for consideration.


Following this assessment, throughout 2016 the Australian Government announced 38 separate projects to be funded under both of the Northern Australia Roads programmes. Key roads to be upgraded include the Hann, Peak Downs, Flinders and Capricorn highways in Queensland; the Barkly Stock Route and the Tablelands, Buntine and Arnhem highways in the Northern Territory; and the Great Northern Highway and Cape Leveque Road in Western Australia.


The Australian Government has committed $100 million to upgrade the Outback Way across Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. This commitment builds on the $70 million the Australian Government has already invested in the Outback Way through the Infrastructure Investment Programme and the NARP.


In addition to these recent commitments, the Australian Government has committed significant funding to projects in northern Australia in which construction is already underway. This includes its $208.4 million contribution towards the $260 million Cape York Region Package (CYRP). The CYRP includes a range of works to upgrade infrastructure in the Cape York Region including $200 million to continue to seal the Peninsula Development Road.


Further, the Australian Government has also committed up to $6.7 billion towards an $8.5 billion ten-year programme of works on the Bruce Highway (2013-14 to 2022-23), focusing on a range of specific upgrades and safety packages agreed with the Queensland Government as part of the Infrastructure Investment Programme.


Not all projects within the Bruce Highway commitment are within the area defined as northern Australia by the White Paper, however upgrades across the full length of the Bruce Highway will improve access and connectivity into northern Australia.


It remains essential for new or upgraded road construction to consider the north's variable climatic conditions, including rain fall predictions, wet seasons and flood resilient assets. Having operational transport corridors promotes economic activity, increases productivity, attracts investment and helps to minimise social disruptions. The Australian Government continues to work with the northern jurisdictions to identify further priority projects in northern Australia that could inform future investment as funding becomes available.




Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in conjunction with the Queensland and Northern Territory Governments, should fund a cost-benefit analysis of the following projects:




rail line linking Mount Isa and Tennant Creek;




and passing lanes on the Darwin to Alice Springs railway.





Response: Agreed in part—in the White Paper the Australian Government committed $5 million to improve cross jurisdictional freight rail planning with the support of northern jurisdictions (p.91). In addition, Infrastructure Australia's Northern Australia Audit, Infrastructure for a Developing North Report January 2015 continues to be used as a basis for better planning and prioritisation.


The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development (DIRD) entered into a departmental-level Memorandum of Understanding with Queensland and the Northern Territory Governments to progress strategic and technical studies on the Mount Isa to Tennant Creek corridor. DIRD has committed $1.5 million to this project to assess the viability of freight rail to support broader transport and supply chain corridors from Townsville to Darwin. It is anticipated that the final strategic options paper that provides infrastructure options and key findings will be released in 2017.


The Australian Government continues to work with the northern jurisdictions to identify and select additional proposals beyond the Mount Isa to Tennant Creek Link, including on the rail link to Townsville.




Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government give priority to the development and funding of water resource proposals that have been scientifically identified as being sustainable and with the strongest cost-benefit case, and consistent with National Water Policy. Projects to be considered could include:




Use of groundwater for expanding horticulture;




Flinders River Weir/O
'
Connell Creek Water Storage Project;




Urannah Dam;




Elliot Main Channel;




Nullinga Dam;




Eden Bann and Rookwood Weirs on the Fitzroy River; and




Cloncurry Dam, Cave Hill.





The Committee further recommends that the government proceed with its election proposal to set up the Water Project Development Fund which could be used to assess and plan—and possibly provide seed funding for water management proposals for northern Australia.





Response: Agreed - Through the White Paper the Australian Government has established the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund which is providing support for developing potential infrastructure projects (including dams). It is also enabling detailed information to support decision making by producers, investors and government on water opportunities, including up to $200 million for the north (pp.49-54) over ten years to 2024-25. Applications are now open for Expressions of Interest (E0I) from state and territory governments for water infrastructure construction through the Fund. EOls will be accepted until all funds are committed. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister released the Fund's guidelines on 27 October 2016.


Through the Fund the Australian Government is funding 15 northern feasibility studies worth over $25 million; 10 in Queensland, three in Western Australia, one in the Northern Territory and one cross-jurisdictional (NT and WA). These studies include the Nullinga and Urannah Dams (p.53) and the $130 million commitment to the Rookwood Weir mentioned above for consideration.


The Fund is also providing land-use suitability analysis of Ord Stage 3 and water resource assessments commissioned from the CSIRO in the Mitchell River catchment (Qld), the Fitzroy River Basin west Kimberley (WA) and the Darwin region (NT) (p.44).


The National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility has also been implemented which will provide $2 billion in concessional loan funding for water infrastructure that supports the growth of regional economies and communities. Initial applications are being assessed for funding by February 2018. Future assessment dates will be announced in due course.




Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government conducts a full investigation of the potential and practicality of special economic zones in northern Australia.





Response: Not agreed - The Australian Government does not support special economic zones in northern Australia for the reasons set out in the White Paper (p.60).




Recommendation 6: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government take measures to reduce insurance premiums back to an affordable level, which could include increasing competition in the insurance market in northern Australia. The Australian Government has particular responsibility for the Indian Ocean Territories, but should also conduct negotiations with the Governments of the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland, with a view to allowing the Territory Insurance Office to extend its coverage across northern Australia including the Torres Strait Islands.





Response: Agreed in part — The Australian Government has previously announced reforms to increase competition in the insurance market and established the Northern Australia Insurance Premiums Taskforce (p.75). The Taskforce's key finding is that mitigation is the only sustainable way


of lowering premiums. The Government is carefully considering the findings of the Taskforce and all options available in detail.


The Government has also directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to


monitor prices, costs and profits in the insurance market in northern Australia in relation to home, contents and strata insurance. The inquiry commenced on 1 July 2017 and will continue for three years. The Government will provide the ACCC with $7.9 million to ensure it has the resources to


conduct this inquiry. The Government will closely monitor the findings of the ACCC inquiry, which is an important step in ensuring that all relevant factors impacting affordability including federal and state regulations can be considered.


The Senate Economics References Committee recently inquired into Australia's general insurance industry, including the increase in the cost of home, strata and car insurance, competition in the industry, and legislative and other changes necessary to facilitate a comparison service to improve competition and transparency. The Government is currently considering its response to that inquiry.




Recommendation 7: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in conjunction with State and Territory Governments, continue to fund the Great Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative with a view to completing the capping and piping of all uncapped bores identified under the Great Artesian Basin Coordinating Committee Strategic Management Plan.




Response: Agreed in part — The Australian Government announced a three year extension of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) Sustainability Initiative in October 2014 (p.49) which concluded on 30 June 2017. On 12 May 2017 the Australian Government announced the Interim Great Artesian Basin Infrastructure Investment Program which will provide $8 million in funding (to be matched by state and territory governments) to continue the delivery of water infrastructure improvements in the Basin to 2018-19. The purpose of the two year program is to enable a seamless transition from the conclusion of the Great Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative to a new, long term funding model that encourages greater private investment in water infrastructure. The Australian Government has commenced discussions with northern jurisdictions on options for future funding of GAB infrastructure beyond mid-2019.




Recommendation 8: That the impacts of the ongoing change in climate are included in all planning processes, and that the planning process includes the development of adaptation and mitigation policies and strategies for northern Australia.




Response: Agreed in principle — The Australian Government supports the use of best practice planning strategies for development in northern Australia, including the work undertaken by the states and territory. The Australian Government agrees that implications of climate change should be considered as part of that planning in addition to the extreme weather conditions northern Australia is exposed to. For example, the water resource assessments outlined in recommendation four will take into account ongoing impacts of climate variability and change.


The Australian Government released a National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy in December 2015 that sets out how Australia is managing climate risks for the benefit of the community, economy and environment. The strategy identifies a set of principles to guide effective adaptation practice and resilience building, and outlines the government's vision for the future.


The Government is reviewing its climate change policies to take stock of Australia's progress in reducing emissions, and ensure the Government's policies remain effective in achieving Australia's 2030 target and Paris Agreement commitments. The review commenced in early 2017 and will conclude by the end of 2017.




Recommendation 9: The Committee recommends to the Australian Government that it is necessary that where socially significant community centres are placed at risk due to the finite nature of mining activities, consideration be given to appropriate actions to extend mine or like operations and opportunities consistent with best environmental practices and the interests of the region.




Response: Not agreed — The issue of the appropriate time to close or suspend production from a mine is a commercial consideration by the company.


The Australian Government supports world leading best practice for mine closure based on long term planning in partnership with communities and community ownership of post-closure outcomes as a core part of the business of mining.


Community centres are the responsibility of state and territory governments. In developing such facilities the ongoing viability needs to be considered.




Recommendation 10: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in conjunction with the Queensland Government, investigate the construction of an abattoir in north Queensland with a view to facilitating private sector investment at the earliest possible date.




Response: Agreed in part —The Australian and Queensland Governments jointly funded a feasibility study into establishing an abattoir in northwest Queensland. The study was published and analysed a number of potential locations in Queensland with Cloncurry being identified as the most suitable for potential investors interested in developing an abattoir facility in this region.




Recommendation 11: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in conjunction with the Northern Australia Strategic Partnership, develop a tourism strategy for promoting northern Australia domestically and internationally, highlighting natural assets and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture.




Response: Noted — Any tourism strategy for northern Australia is best pursued through the framework of the existing national long-term tourism strategy, Tourism 2020, which has been developed and implemented in partnership with the Australian and State and Territory Governments. A separate northern Australia strategy would duplicate efforts and dilute the impact of current tourism marketing and promotion.


Northern Australia's iconic experiences and destinations feature strongly in Tourism Australia's current and recent marketing campaigns. Destinations such as Kakadu, Litchfield, Broome, Darwin, Cairns and Uluru are some of Australia's most iconic and unique regions adding to Australia's diverse and competitive tourism offering. Promotional and marketing strategies for the region should be in line with the Tourism 2020 goal of growing overnight visitor expenditure from $115 billion to $140 billion by 2020. The strategy has broad support within Australia and targets high-yield visitors that will deliver the greatest benefit to the industry and the local economy.


The development of a new product, including through the attraction of investment in tourism infrastructure in northern Australia, should be prioritised to help ensure the region can compete in the highly contested international tourism market. Reliable and cost-effective access to northern Australia via air, sea and land will improve the visitor experience and boost the local economy. Investment in quality tourism products and experiences will also be essential to develop the northern tourism industry.


The White Paper expanded services under the Entrepreneurs' Programme to include eligible northern businesses in the tourism sector (p.66). This was implemented in February 2016. The White Paper also committed to:


An expanded Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) in northern Australia. Implemented in


2016, the expansion enables Australian employers in the tourism industry in northern Australia to participate in a new pilot under the SWP;


The Pacific Microstates—Northern Australia Worker Pilot Program; a programme providing citizens of Pacific micro-states (Nauru, Tuvalu and Kiribati) with access to a multi-year visa of up to two years. This work can include, as an example, occupations in tourism in northern Australia;


- Other measures to reduce red tape on visa applications for Chinese and Indian visitors


(pp.77-78) and expanding the Working Holiday Maker programme arrangements (pp.112-114).


The Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia is inquiring into and reporting on Opportunities and methods for, and impediments and challenges to stimulating the tourism industry in northern Australia. The Inquiry has received public submissions. Public hearings have been held in Canberra, Brisbane, Perth, Hamilton Island, Cannonvale, Port Douglas, Cairns, Townsville, Yulara, Alice Springs, Darwin and Broome.


The Australian Government remains committed to working closely with the three northern jurisdictions on developing northern Australia. The Strategic Partnership is an essential mechanism for this collaboration through meetings between the Prime Minister and the First Ministers of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia.




Recommendation 12: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government seek to build upon significant cultural and artistic events, and programs including the promotion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts, to increase participation in, and the public profile of, artistic and cultural activities in northern Australia.




Response: Agreed — the Australian Government has a range of programs and policies that encourage excellence in art, support cultural heritage and provide access to arts and culture. The Department of Communications and the Arts delivers $40 million annually through its Indigenous arts and languages programs.


The Indigenous Languages and Arts program supports Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to revive and maintain languages, and to deliver diverse arts projects that showcase and encourage participation in traditional and contemporary Indigenous artistic expression. The program currently has funding agreements to the value of $10 million with 49 organisations to deliver 67 language and/or arts projects across northern Australia.


The Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support (IVAIS) program provides operational support to around 80 Indigenous-owned art centres as well as a number of service organisations, art fairs and regional hubs. Together they enable the development, production and marketing of Indigenous visual art. In 2017-18, 72 per cent or $14.9 million of the IVAIS budget is being delivered to organisations in northern Australia.


The Department of Communications and the Arts also provides a range of other funding


opportunities for various cultural and artistic events and programs across northern Australia. These include:


The Regional Arts Fund, supporting sustainable cultural development in regional and remote communities.


The Festivals Australia program, funding a range of high quality, innovative arts projects that grow audiences and encourage partnership and collaboration in arts activities at festivals and events.


The National Collecting Institutions Touring and Outreach and Visions of Australia programs


support access to arts and cultural exhibitions for Australians in regional and remote Australia.


The Community Heritage Grants Program provides funding to assist with the preservation of locally owned, but nationally significant collections. In 2016 it supported organisations in the Northern Territory, far north Queensland and northern Western Australia with training, preservation assessments and the purchase of archival material.


The Australia Council invested in nearly 60 projects by artists and arts organisations in northern Australia in 2015 and 2016 and funds 16 arts organisations working in northern Australia. Regional touring programs Playing Australia, Contemporary Music Touring and the Contemporary Touring Initiative have a particular focus on regional and remote communities.




Recommendation 13: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government commit to facilitating the approval process to enable the reopening of the Christmas Island casino.




Response: Noted — While the Australian Government supports economic and tourism development for Christmas Island, broader government and community consultation would be required prior to any consideration of a proposal to re-establish a casino.




Recommendation 14: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government support the creation of a Cooperative Research Centre for Northern Agriculture. All three universities substantially based in northern Australia should be involved in the CRC.




Response: Agreed — In the White Paper the Australian Government committed to establish an industry-focussed Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) on developing northern Australia, located in the north (pp.67-68). On 21 April 2016 the Australian Government announced Townsville as the location of the CRC's headquarters, although the CRC's work will be across the north. The CRC will support industry-led projects where the north has particular strengths, including in agriculture, food and tropical health and work collaboratively with key academic partners. On 20 February 2017, the Australian Government announced the establishment CRC board. On 10 July 2017, the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Jed Matz commenced in Townsville. The CRC will also have a presence in Darwin and WA (location yet to be determined).




Recommendation 15: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government support the development of a national institute for tropical sports and sports medicine in northern Australia.




Response: Noted — The Australia Sports Commission has developed Australia's Winning Edge, which provides the high performance sports sector with clear performance targets and a framework for collaboration from 2012-2022. The strategy provides for greater levels of accountability, consistent and sustainable success for athletes and teams, and improved governance structures for reporting and monitoring performance. High performance not only fosters a sense of national pride, but also contributes to other government priorities such as participation, economic development, health and education. The Australian Government notes that any new national facility would need to take into account the current investment in, and services offered by, the Australian Institute of Sport as well as existing sports infrastructure in northern Australia.




Recommendation 16: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government allow graduates to have some or all of their Higher Education Loan Program debt written-off in return for living and working in locations deemed remote for a significant period of time, such as five years.




Response: Not supported — While the recommendation fits within the Australian Government's strategy to strengthen and develop northern Australia, a Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) debt write-off scheme would be inconsistent with the Australian Government's current policy on HELP.


The 2014 Review of the Demand Driven Funding System by Dr David Kemp and Mr Andrew Norton concluded that reduced HELP repayments were not a major influence on decisions concerning courses and careers. It is likely that HELP debt remission for graduates in remote Australia will incur a cost to government and would be helping graduates who would live there in any case. This would have little impact, if any, in encouraging others to move and work in northern Australia and is not likely to be an efficient or effective initiative.




Recommendation 17: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government give consideration to locating relevant departmental functions within the Australian Public Service to northern Australia, particularly where new organisations or departments or positions are being created which have no historical connection to other parts of Australia.




Response: Agreed in principle — In the White Paper the Australian Government committed to shift the Office of Northern Australia to the north (p.119). This was completed in December 2015, and in January 2016 the Major Projects Approval Agency (now Major Projects Facilitation Agency) 'single point of entry' Darwin office opened (pp.75-76). The Cairns headquarters for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (pp.67-68) opened in August 2016, and the CRC for Developing Northern Australia (pp.67-68) headquarters opened in Townsville on 10 July 2017, and will have a presence in Darwin and WA (location yet to be determined) and work across the north.


In addition, on 1 September 2017 the Government announced that a new biosecurity hub will be built in Darwin as part of an $8 million joint project by the Australian and Northern Territory Governments to guard against foreign pests and diseases.


These relocations have bought, and will continue to bring, more public servants and other professionals to northern Australia. Additionally there are a number of existing government agencies that have a significant presence in the north, such as the Department of Defence, Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, CSIRO, and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.




Recommendation 18: The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence give preference to local firms in northern Australia for the repair and maintenance of material and infrastructure, where it is financially sound.




Response: Agreed in principle — The Australian Government released the 2016 Defence White Paper in February 2016, accompanied by the Integrated Investment Program and Defence Industry Policy Statement. The Integrated Investment Program included around $195 billion in investment in Defence capability over the decade to 2025-26, including a major investment in Defence capability and infrastructure based in northern Australia. This will provide significant opportunities for local industry.


The Defence Industry Policy Statement outlined the Australian Government's commitment to maximising opportunities for the Australian defence industry to meet Australia's defence capability needs and help manage strategic risk over the coming decades. The Statement was founded on four principles:


Australian industry must competitively meet our capability needs.


- Maximise opportunities for Australian industry involvement in our capability programs.


- Strategically plan and develop Australia's industrial base.


- Normalise Australian industry as a fundamental input to capability.


The Australian Government and Defence are focused on building the capability and skills of Australian industry, including in northern Australia to contribute to Defence capability. The size and scale of Defence requirements, including in support of the continuous shipbuilding program, require a national approach harnessing the skills and innovation within industry across Australia.


The Australian Industry Capability Program is where Australian industry can contribute in meeting our defence capability requirements in every materiel project of $20 million and above. The Program has been significantly strengthened by making the requirements on tenderers more explicit. The requirements include:


- maximising Australian industry involvement in the acquisition and sustainment of our Defence capabilities and identify why work proposed to be performed overseas cannot be performed or transitioned to Australian industry;


- growing the skills, knowledge, technology and infrastructure within Australian industry to support enduring Australian industry capability to meet broader Defence needs;


increasing innovation and research and development in Australia, including through Australian industry, academia and other government agency support and collaboration;


- identifying opportunities for increasing Indigenous business involvement in the supply chain


and involve more Indigenous Australians to work in the delivery of that capability; and


promoting defence export opportunities to enhance industry sustainability and international competitiveness.


This new approach was embedded in the Request for Tender for the SEA1180 Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPVs) that Defence released on 30 November 2016. The project will purchase 12 OPVs to provide surveillance, patrol and response operations in Australia's maritime approaches.


The Australian Industry Capability requirements are a core component of the capability need tenderers must respond to that applies across all materiel acquisition and sustainment procurements that meet the threshold. These changes will provide increased opportunities for Australian industry, including companies based in northern Australia, to support Defence.


The Australian Government is also fundamentally transforming the way that Defence engages with Australian industry and the support it provides. A key initiative of the Defence Industry Policy Statement is the Centre for Defence Industry Capability (CDIC), funded by Defence in partnership with Auslndustry. The CDIC engages with and supports industry to do business in the defence market, and to liaise across national and state and territory governments. The CDIC delivers initiatives within three key focus areas:


Industry Development—activities include business advice and funding for sector wide


initiatives.


- Facilitating Innovation connecting business, academia and research organisations with


innovative ideas to Defence.


- Defence Business Competitiveness and Exports — supporting Australian businesses to be


more competitive and internationally successful, including through access to Capability Improvement Grants and export programs.


The CDIC has advisors that can work with local firms in northern Australia to assist them to be best positioned to competitively bid for and win Defence work. A CDIC officer is co-located with the Office of Northern Australia in Darwin.


Under the Australian Government's Defence industry policy and initiatives, companies in northern Australia now have more opportunities than ever to contribute to Defence capability objectives.


The Australian Government has in place a range of measures designed to promote economic growth through procurement. Additional Commonwealth Procurement Rules commenced on 1 March 2017. They require Commonwealth officials to consider the economic benefit of the procurement to the Australian economy and operate within the context of relevant national and international agreements, and the procurements policies to which Australia is a signatory. This includes free trade agreements and the Australia and New Zealand Government Procurement Agreement.


This change requires officials to consider the economic benefit of a procurement to the Australian economy as part of their value for money assessment, for procurements above $4 million for non-construction goods and services and above $7.5 million for construction services.


In general terms, benefits to the Australian economy, including in northern Australia, will result in the better use of Australian resources and increase productivity.




Recommendation 19: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government consider relocating additional defence assets to northern Australia in accordance with the recommendations of the Defence White Paper.




Response: Agreed — the Australian Government will enhance the Defence investment in northern Australia as part of the 2016 Defence White Paper. This investment in national defence infrastructure includes the following northern Australia Air Force bases, Tindal, Curtin, Scherger and Learmonth, the HMAS Coonawarra, and Robertson Barracks.




Recommendation 20: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government improve access to, speed and reliability of high speed broadband in order to support the development of uses of digital communication technologies in northern Australia, such as:




tele-health;




e-learning; and




projects to improve social amenity.




Response: Agreed- The Australian Government has put the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) on track to affordably deliver high-speed broadband to all Australian homes and businesses by 2020. The rollout of the NBN is more progressed in regional areas than in metropolitan areas. At the end of February 2017, when the Interim Satellite Service was decommissioned, almost 65,000 premises were using Sky Muster services. By September 2017, this had increased to 79,000 active users. When the NBN is complete, all Australian homes and businesses will have access to a minimum wholesale download speed of 25 megabits per second.


Approximately two and a half million premises in regional Australia will be receiving a fixed line service. This equates to approximately 70 per cent of premises outside major urban areas. Of the remaining premises, 19 per cent will receive a fixed wireless service, and 11 per cent will receive the Sky Muster satellite service.


The Australian Government is investing more than $2 billion in the Sky Muster service, which will reach parts of Australia that are the most difficult to serve. By 21 September 2017, approximately 79,000 premises had a Sky Muster service installed. The Australian Government is working with NBN Co Limited to design new products using the Sky Muster service to cater for the needs of regional Australia. For example, distance education students can access higher monthly data allowances, comprising 50 gigabytes per student and public interest premises such as eligible health facilities available via a second satellite port in their house. In early October 2017, data allowances increased by 50 per cent for all users.


The Government has introduced legislation into the Parliament to establish a statutory infrastructure provider (SIP) regime. Under this regime, SIPs will have to connect premises to a superfast network on reasonable request, and supply services to retail providers that will allow consumers to receive peak broadband speeds of at least 25 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload.


SIPs will need to connect premises to fixed-line networks unless this is not reasonable, in which case they will need to connect premises to fixed wireless or satellite networks. SIPs must also support voice services on the fixed-line and fixed wireless networks.


NBN Co will be the SIP in areas it declares ready for services, and after the NBN is complete it will be the default SIP for Australia. Other carriers will be able to be SIPs where appropriate, for example where they have a contract to service a new development.


The Australian Government also notes that the private sector continues to make significant investments in communications infrastructure, both as a complement to the NBN, and on a standalone basis, particularly in the area of mobile communications, transmission, and networks for businesses. Over 99 per cent of people in Australia have access to 3G mobile coverage; and over 98 per cent of people in Australia have access to 4G mobile coverage as a result of competitive, commercial private sector investment. Further significant investment has been announced. NextGen, a Vocus company, has made noteworthy investments in new transmissions through its 2000 kilometre North-West Submarine Cable System. Such investments are important to supporting the delivery of high-speed broadband to people on the move and in their homes and businesses. In December 2009 Telstra laid a fibre-optic cable between Jabiru and Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory, as part of a $34 million project in partnership with the Northern Territory Government and Rio Tinto.


The Australian Government continues to provide funding for Telehealth services which allow patients to consult with specialist medical practitioners using online video consultations.


Access to broadband will also be important for enabling growth in the tourism industry. This will support tourism operators to optimise digital platforms to better meet visitor needs, such as instant booking/purchasing platforms, payment options in foreign currencies and multilingual information.




Recommendation 21: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government develop a telecommunications and digital technology strategy specifically for northern Australia.




Response: Noted — the Australian Government recognises that communications and connectivity are vital for people living, working and travelling in regional Australia. The ability to connect brings regional Australia closer to the rest of the world and unlocks opportunities for students, farmers, families and business owners. This is why the government is investing more in regional communications than at any other time. This historic-level of investment is already bringing benefits to regional Australians.


As noted above in response to Recommendation 20, the private sector continues to make significant investments in communications infrastructure, both as a complement to the NBN, and on a standalone basis, particularly in the area of mobile communications, transmission, and networks for businesses.


In addition to the government's investment in the NBN, the government acknowledges that mobile phone coverage is an issue of central importance to regional Australians. The government is investing $220 million in the Mobile Black Spot Program to improve mobile coverage along major regional transport routes and in small communities. Using a co investment model, this program has attracted investment from telecommunications carriers, state governments, local governments and businesses. The government's commitment of $160 million for rounds 1 and 2 of the program has leveraged a total co-investment of almost $600 million and will deliver 765 new and upgraded mobile base stations across the country. As part of its commitment, the government has allocated $60 million to address 125 priority locations. There will be an approach to market during 2017 to deliver on this commitment.




Recommendation 22: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government support the development of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment and businesses through the use of successful public and private sector models of employment and enterprise.




Response: Agreed — The Australian Government's Indigenous Advancement Strategy is focussed on getting people into work and supporting economic development. As part of the reforms to the Remote Jobs and Communities Programme, job seekers will have the opportunity to fulfil their 'work for the dole' requirements through placements in local businesses (p.109). The Community Development Programme (COP) was launched in July 2015 allowing any organisation or business to host CDP job seekers in a Work for the Dole activity.


The Australian Government has also committed up to $100 million to deliver the Vocational Training and Education Centres (including six in northern Australia) for up to 7,500 guaranteed jobs since 2014. In addition the Australian Government, through Tailored Assistance Employment Grants, can provide funding for activities that help Indigenous Australians overcome disadvantage in the labour market and connect them to employment, gain experience that builds work readiness, and contributes to the broader community.


In the White Paper the Australian Government committed to work with northern jurisdictions to agree on Indigenous employment and supply use targets for road projects (and other relevant expenditure) funded through the White Paper (p.110). Following the announcement in 2016 of successful roads projects under the Northern Australia Roads and Beef Roads programmes the work to identify employment and supply use targets for northern jurisdictions is underway. A number of additional measures in the White Paper seek to facilitate and make it easier to do business on Indigenous land, thus supporting enterprise, investment and employment:


The NAIF Investment Mandate includes a mandatory criterion that projects have an Indigenous Engagement Strategy which sets out objectives for Indigenous participation, procurement and employment that reflects the Indigenous population in the region of the proposed project.


Austrade has released a web-based business guide to land tenure arrangements in northern Australia, to encourage engagement and investment in Indigenous land.


A number of communities in the Northern Territory have negotiated township leases in 2017 and are seeing the real-time benefits of economic activity—Mutijulu in Central Australia, Pirlangimpi on the Tiwi Islands and the Binjari housing lease near Katherine. Work continues on the Gunyangara lease in northeast Arnhem Land, at Jabiru in Kakadu National Park and at Yarralin in the Victoria Daly region.


29 Aboriginal Ranger groups in northern Australia are now conducting biosecurity activities across northern Australia in addition to the 40 existing ranger groups that were doing so already.




Recommendation 23: The Committee recommends that large scale extraction of water from river systems and aquifers in northern Australia, which may impact on the environment and the fisheries industry and other activities, should be preceded by thorough scientific investigation.




Response: Agreed — In the White Paper the Australian Government committed to fund thorough water resource assessments in the Mitchell River catchment (Qld), West Kimberley (WA) and Darwin region (NT) (p.44). CSIRO has commenced the $15 million Northern Australia Water Resource Assessment project. Under this project CSIRO is working with state and territory government agencies, scientists, industry, farmers and local and Indigenous communities to assess the three water catchments. This will help state and territory governments develop water resource management plans to govern the sustainable economic and environmental development for these areas.


In addition, as part of the Exploring for the Future Programme, Geoscience Australia is undertaking regional investigations of surface and groundwater systems across northern Australia in collaboration with state and territory government agencies, to underpin future opportunities for irrigated agriculture, mineral and energy development, and community water supply. The programme includes the delivery of pre-competitive data and information to inform decision-making regarding sustainable water management and development planning. The groundwater component of this four year programme totals $30.8 million.




Recommendation 24: The Committee recommends that the numbers of Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service officers be significantly increased in northern Australia.




Response: Agree in principle — Additional resources are being applied in northern Australia to focus on tropical biosecurity risks. Under the Northern Australia and Agricultural Competitiveness White Papers the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources has increased Bio-Security officers (previously known as Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service officers) in northern Australia. The number of staff (including airport and cargo inspection staff) has increased across the north from 110.5 Full Time Equivalents (FTE) as at 30 June 2015 to around 140 FTE currently.




Recommendation 25: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government encourage ongoing bilateral exchange between the northern regions of Australia and neighbouring countries and communities in the Asia—Pacific and Indian Ocean regions.




Response: Agreed — The Australian Government is building international links and northern capacity in tropical research (p.71). It is also linking the north to ASEAN's infrastructure 'connectivity' agency and APEC's Connectivity Blueprint (p.63). The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade supports the development of the ASEAN Master Plan on Connectivity and the ASEAN Economic Community more broadly through the $57 million (2008-2019) ASEAN- Australia Development Cooperation Program Phase II. This program promotes the cooperation between Australia and ASEAN in areas of agreed regional development priority. The program has evolved to keep pace with economic progress in South East Asia and the maturing nature of the ASEAN-Australia relationship. This program had continued to support regional economic and social development cooperation and capacities.


Recent Free Trade Agreements have been agreed with China, Japan and Korea. This is supporting increased trade that creates more Australia jobs and delivers more opportunities for Australian businesses, including in northern Australia. Furthermore, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiations continue to facilitate and strengthen bi-lateral discussions that have the potential to deliver significant opportunities for Australian businesses.


There is also a tailored programme to build direct business links between the north and Indonesia, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Timor-Leste (pp.62-63). In Timor-Leste, a business registration and licencing program is being supported to reduce red-tape and improve connectivity, including with northern Australia, and in PNG a partnership has been established to support cocoa farmers to increase productivity and improve business skills.


The White Paper identified the need to share biosecurity expertise with scientists and officials in neighbouring countries including Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste (p. 73). The Australian Government is also investing $3 million over three years to 2017/18 to trial tropical health and medical research short courses for Indonesian professionals (p.71). Short courses on malaria prevention and treatment for infants, children and pregnant women were delivered in 2016, with further courses in progress for 2017 and 2018.


In addition, the $8.5 million Australian Tropical Medicine Commercialisation Grants Program helps develop pathways to commercialise Australian research on new tropical therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics for tropical diseases in partnership with international companies. It also provides opportunities to connect Australian research institutes and the global pharmaceutical value chain, including global pharmaceutical companies and philanthropic organisations.




Recommendation 26: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government in conjunction with the Northern Australia Strategic Partnership, design and implement a 20 year strategy for the staged development of capital infrastructure in northern Australia, including:




the upgrade of major arterial roads with a view to provide year round access to most areas in Australia
'
s north;




increasing the capacity of ports and airports to facilitate an increase in volumes of traffic and trade; and




the development of water infrastructure to cater for urban and industrial development, particularly in agriculture and the resources sector.





Response to recommendations 26 and 27:



Agreed in part — in the White Paper the Australian Government committed to delivering better analysis, planning and prioritisation of infrastructure to inform decision making and provide greater certainty to investors (pp.86-101); and to work with jurisdictions to develop an infrastructure pipeline for the north (pp.92-93).


The Australian Government has made available key freight route maps identifying nationally significant places for freight, including key container and commodity ports, and the routes that connect them. This ensures strategic planning, operational and investment decisions relating to the Australian freight network can be better informed.


The Australian Government has also committed to measures to better use existing infrastructure (pp.93-95). The Australian Government is working with industry experts to develop a plan for improving aviation and surface transport connections in northern Australia (pp.98-100). In 2017, the Australian Government is providing $10.4 million for 25 aerodrome projects across northern Australia under round 4 of the Remote Airstrips Upgrade Programme with works now underway.


The Australian Government engaged CSIRO to create the Transport Network Strategic Investment Tool (TraNSIT) logistics model that is used to assess the absolute and relative benefit of investment in infrastructure such as rail, roads and ports. TraNSIT is widely used by Australian, state, territory and local governments, and businesses, to guide operation of and investment in northern Australia's infrastructure.


The Australian Government also commissioned Infrastructure Australia's Northern Australia Audit, Infrastructure for a Developing North Report (p.85) which is informing the implementation of White Paper measures. These include the Northern Australia Roads and Beef Roads Programmes, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, the northern component of the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund and the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility which will support investment in capital infrastructure via concessional loans to state and territory governments. This funding will accelerate the construction of major water infrastructure projects such as dams, weirs, pipelines and managed aquifer recharge projects to provide affordable and secure water supplies to support the growth of regional economies and communities across Australia, including the north.




Recommendation 27: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government identify key ports and commit to funding their upgrade, subject to relative benefit assessment by Infrastructure Australia. Projects to consider may include:




Darwin;




Karumba; and




Wyndham.




Response: Noted - In addition to the response at recommendation 26, the Australian Government has interests in ports for national economic performance, international trade and interstate trade and commerce. The states and territories control planning for port precincts, adjacent land uses and in most cases the connecting transport systems.


The Port of Townsville and the Port of Darwin are two examples of strategically positioned ports. For instance, in accordance with the Sustainable Ports Development Act 2015 (Ports Act) and the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan, the Port of Townsville was identified as a priority port given its proximity to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and its economic contribution ($10 billion in cargo moved through the port in 2015-2016). Noting also that the $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility opened for business on 1 July 2016 and will offer up to $5 billion in concessional finance to encourage and complement private sector investment in infrastructure which can include ports.




Recommendation 28: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in consultation with the cattle industry, investigate standover/transfer facilities to accommodate the movement of cattle across Australia.




Response: Agreed in part — The Australian Government is committed to identifying, prioritising and investing in improvements to the northern cattle industry supply chain. The Australian Government undertook extensive consultation with key industry and government stakeholders in Rockhampton, Kununurra and Darwin to identify suitable projects under the $100 million Northern Australia Beef Roads Programme (pp. 95-96). In October 2016 the Australian Government announced 18 projects under the programme. Work is expected to commence on some of these projects in 2017. Further information is available at: http://investment.infrastructure.gov.au/funding/NABeef/


index.aspx.


As outlined in Recommendation 26, the Australian Government commissioned CSIRO to develop the TraNSIT logistics model that has been used to identify and prioritise investment in the northern cattle industry supply chain, based on the absolute and relative benefit of alternative infrastructure investments.




Recommendation 29: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government in conjunction with the Northern Australia Strategic Partnership, design and implement a 20 year strategy for the staged development of horticulture and agriculture in Northern Australia, including:




funding scientific studies on the available water and soil resources on a catchment scale, as well as the environmental implications of horticultural and agricultural developments in each catchment;




identifying infrastructure requirements for horticultural and agricultural development in each region; and




identifying regulatory impediments to horticultural and agricultural development and the best way to overcome these (e.g. land tenure issues and approvals processes).




Response: Agreed in principle — The Australian Government has committed to support analysis necessary for planning and investing in water infrastructure. This includes land-use suitability analysis of Ord Stage 3 (p.53), business case development for Nullinga Dam (p.53) and water resource assessments in the Mitchell River (Old), West Kimberley (WA) and Darwin region (NT) (p.44). The water resource assessments being undertaken by the CSIRO directly address all points in this recommendation. These catchments have been identified as the most prospective for agricultural development in northern Australia.


The $100 million Exploring for the Future programme announced by the Australian Government in May 2016 includes funding for Geoscience Australia to undertake a thorough assessment of groundwater resources and an analysis of the salinity risk for potential agricultural areas in northern Australia and parts of South Australia.


The Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Developing Northern Australia, headquartered in Townsville, will focus on agriculture, food and tropical health (pp.67-68).


The 'single point of entry' Major Projects Approval Agency Darwin office provides information and facilitation services to investors navigating regulatory approval processes (pp.75-76).


Austrade has delivered a web-based business guide to tenure in northern Australia. The guide is investor-focussed and provides a general introduction to systems of land tenure and native title in northern Australia (pp.32-33).


The Australian Government also released the Agriculture Competitiveness White Paper in July 2015 which complements many of the initiatives and measures under the Developing Northern Australia White Paper.




Recommendation 30: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government facilitate the creation of a rural investment fund to provide opportunities for investors to participate in rural infrastructure development projects.




Response: Noted — The Australian Government has three significant investment vehicles directly relevant for attracting investors to participate in rural and infrastructure developments.


In the White Paper the Australian Government committed to establish the $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF). The NAIF opened for business on 1 July 2016 and will offer up to $5 billion in concessional finance to encourage and complement private sector investment in infrastructure (such as rail, water, energy, communications networks, ports and airports) that otherwise would not be built or would not be built for some time. This support for transformative economic infrastructure will be a significant step for the longer term expansion of the economy and population in northern Australia. Investment will be spread across the three northern jurisdictions (pp.86-87).


The Australian Government has also committed to the northern component of the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (pp.49) and the $2 billion National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility (NWILF) which will support investment in capital infrastructure via concessional loans to state and territory governments. This funding will accelerate the construction of major water infrastructure projects such as dams, weirs, pipelines and managed aquifer recharge projects. It will provide affordable and secure water supplies to support the growth of rural and regional economies and communities across Australia, including the north. In May 2017, the Australian Government announced a newly created Regional Investment Corporation will be established in Orange NSW in 2018 and will administer the $2 billion NWILF as well as the $2 billion farm business concessional loans from 2018-19.




Recommendation 31: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, as a matter of urgency, engage the Queensland and Western Australian Governments to improve power grids in northern Queensland and in the Pilbara respectively.




Response: Noted — The Australian Government supports the efficient provision and use of energy infrastructure and recognises the private sector is best placed to respond to signals around the need for investment in this sector. The Australian Government works closely with both the Queensland and Western Australian Governments on energy matters. The State's participation in the National Electricity Market, primarily through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council, provides engagement to ensure consumers are able to secure reliable and adequate energy supplies at an efficient cost. The Australian Government notes that the Western Australian Government is also a member of the COAG Energy Council.




Recommendation 32: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government promote the use of renewable energy sources as a solution to the remoteness and isolation from the grid of many homesteads and communities in northern Australia.





Response: Agreed — The Australian Government is supporting the deployment of renewable energy systems in Australia through the Renewable Energy Target and a number of projects specifically supporting the use of renewable energy in off-grid and fringe-of-grid applications, including throughout northern Australia.


The Australian Government notes the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee completed an inquiry into the role and contribution of regional capitals to Australia, with a final report tabled on 24 November 2016. This includes the Northern Territory Solar Energy Transformation Program, jointly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Northern Territory Power and Water Corporation. The program will integrate 10 megawatts of solar PV in up to 30 remote communities in the Northern Territory, including one site with energy storage technologies. This will create a platform for greater future use of solar in the Northern Territory. Financing is also available through the Australian Government's Clean Energy Finance Corporation to finance renewable energy solutions across northern Australia.




Recommendation 33: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in conjunction with the Northern Australia Strategic Partnership, develop a strategy to promote liveability in Northern Australia using the 
'
hub-and- spoke
'
 model to deliver services and promote amenity in regional and remote communities, including in the areas of:




health;




education;




social/community services;




sports; and




arts/culture.




Response: Agreed in principle — the Australian Government notes that while the 'hub and spoke' model of service delivery already exists for a range of government services, there is an opportunity for further refinement of those models to ensure that they are efficient and meet changing consumer needs.


The Australian Government provides funding for Telehealth services which allows patients to consult with specialist medical practitioners using online video consultations.


Across northern Australia, primary health networks (PHNs) have also been established with the key objectives of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of medical services for patients, particularly those at risk of poor health outcomes and improving coordination of care. They have established strong partnerships with local providers to ensure collaboration throughout the region.


The Australian Government is working with the states and territories which are responsible for delivering school education and ensuring access to quality education within their jurisdictions. This ensures that all students, regardless of where they live, have access to high quality education and the same educational opportunities as other students. Further funding is provided to reflect the additional cost of operating smaller schools and schools located in regional, rural and remote areas.


The Australian Government has also commissioned an independent review into regional, rural and remote education to consider key issues, barriers and challenges. This review recommends innovative ways to support these students to succeed whilst at school and during their transition to further study, training and employment. The review will be completed by December 2017.


The Australian Government promotes liveability in regional and remote communities by supporting access to, and participation in arts and cultural activities such as festivals, performances, exhibitions and community projects. Several funded Indigenous art and language centres currently provide an outreach service to multiple outlying communities, and this model is highly successful in some areas, especially in remote Western Australia.


The Australian Government notes the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee completed an inquiry into the role and contribution of regional capitals to Australia, with a final report tabled on 24 November 2016.


The Australian Government, Queensland Government and Townsville City Council signed Australia's first City Deal for Townsville on 9 December 2016. The Townsville City Deal is a 15 year commitment between the three levels of government. They will focus on improving the lives of Townsville residents through job creation, economic growth, investment in local infrastructure, a revitalised urban centre, and a more vibrant and liveable city. The Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments have entered into an agreement to work together to create a City Deal for Darwin. The two governments have signed a Memorandum of Understanding, as a step towards a future City Deal for Darwin that will drive investment, jobs and make life better for communities in the region.




Recommendation 34: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in conjunction with State and Territory Governments, work to normalise the local government arrangements in mining communities, such as Weipa and Nhulunbuy, to allow these communities to pursue development opportunities free from the control of mining companies. Strategies need to be developed to complete the normalisation process in a number of Pilbara towns where mining companies
'
 retention of monopoly ownership of utilities and land is hampering growth and economic diversification.





Response: Noted — states and territories are responsible for local government arrangements.




Recommendation 35: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government facilitate the development of the aquaculture industry in Northern Australia by improving the regulatory framework.




Response: Agreed — The Australian Government requested the Productivity Commission to conduct an inquiry into the Regulation of Australian Marine Fisheries and Aquaculture Sectors to identify further opportunities to improve regulation for the aquaculture sector (p.82). The Productivity Commission publically released itsinquiry on 23 May 2017. The Government released its response to the PC report on 23 May 2017 and will continue to work with jurisdictions to develop a collaborative cross-jurisdictional strategy for progressing relevant recommendations. The government continues to progress initiatives to cut red tape for fisheries arising from the White Paper on Developing Northern Australia. These include: moving to single jurisdiction management of northern fisheries; devolving aquaculture management to the states and territories; sharing licensing and compliance services; and extending export approvals to 10 years for low risk fisheries.


Further, the Australian Government is pleased to note the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia has undertaken an inquiry into opportunities for expanding the aquaculture industry in northern Australia. The Joint Senate Select Committee on Northern Australia report 'Scaling up: Inquiry into opportunities for expanding aquaculture in Northern Australia' was released in February 2016. The Australian Government tabled a response in June 2017 noting that research, revision of existing legislation and provision of financial and technical support were already underway. Potential aquaculture activities in Commonwealth marine reserves are considered when consistent with reserve zoning, management prescriptions and the acceptability of impacts on reserve values. The Australian Government is keen to support further exploration of opportunities for development in Northern Australia, which ensure the waters and land of Northern Australia remain healthy, abundant with native species and a resource for generations to come.




Recommendation 36: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review fisheries laws to harmonise regulations between jurisdictions, promote the sustainable development of existing commercial, recreational and sporting fisheries and the creation of new fisheries, and provide a secure long-term future for the fishing industry in northern Australia.




Response: Agreed — Discussions on low risk fisheries suitable for long-term (up to 10 year) export approvals have been held with all Commonwealth state and territory fisheries management agencies. These export approvals will be granted as part of the Department of Environment and Energy's business as usual practices. The Australian Government is committed to harmonising regulations between the Commonwealth and northern jurisdictions.




Recommendation 37: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government explore reforms to the taxation system to better promote investment and development in northern Australia.




Response: Agreed in part –As part of the 2016-17 Budget, the Australian Government announced its 10-year Enterprise Tax Plan. The Plan is currently before the Senate and it is the government's policy to legislate the company tax cuts under the Enterprise Tax Plan in full. Under the Plan, a company tax rate of 27.5 per cent will apply to businesses with annual turnover less than $10 million from the 2015-16 income year. For the 2016-17 income year, the Australian Taxation Office has put in place arrangements to ensure that all companies who qualify for the 27.5 per cent in 2016-17 are subject to that rate. The turnover threshold to qualify for the lower tax rate will then be progressively increased to cover all companies by 2023-24. From 2024-25, the corporate tax rate will be reduced in stages to reach 25 per cent in 2026-27. Treasury modelling estimates that a five percentage point cut in the company tax rate will increase business investment by up to 2.9 per cent in the long term and GDP by over 1 per cent. This impact will be felt across Australia, including northern Australia.




Recommendation 38: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government investigate the equity of the current application of the Zone Tax Offset arrangements so that:




the Zones reflect the current distribution of population and rebates are increased to reflect the current cost of living in regional and remote areas; and




the Zone Tax Offset applies only to persons whose principal place of residence is within a zone.





Response: Agreed in part — The Australian Government has made changes to better target the Zone Tax Offset. Eligibility for the Zone Tax Offset has changed to exclude 'fly-in fly-out' and 'drive-in drive-out' workers from claiming the Zone Tax Offset where their normal residence is not within a 'zone' from the 2015-16 incomeyear. This better targets the Zone Tax Offset to taxpayers who genuinely live within the zones.




Recommendation 39: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the taxation treatment of FIFO work arrangements to ensure that they are consistent with the goal of promoting the development of regional and remote communities in northern Australia, including:




implementing Recommendations 12 
and 
13 of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia report Cancer of the Bush or Salvation for Our Cities? relating to changes to the 
Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986; 
and




Response: Noted — Reforming the Fringe Benefits Tax regime requires careful consideration of how best to achieve a range of objectives, including promoting efficiency while maintaining equity and integrity within a fiscally constrained environment. The Australian Government will consider this recommendation as part of its ongoing work programme of making improvements to the tax system.


reviewing the taxation laws to encourage the construction of permanent dwellings rather than temporary work camps by:


capital depreciation for residential housing developed by mining companies on the same basis as transient worker accommodation; and


the exclusion of transient worker accommodation from within a sixty kilometre radius of existing settlements.



Response: Not agreed — The tax treatment of employer provided temporary housing and residential rental housing is consistent with principles which underpin the rules for depreciating capital assets (that is, an asset is generallyallowed to be depreciated over its useful life, with temporary housing typically having a shorter life).




Recommendation 40: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government pursue, through the Northern Australia Strategic Partnership, the harmonisation and simplification of land tenure arrangements in the jurisdictions across northern Australia. The Committee acknowledges the unique nature of the statutory inalienable freehold title under the 
Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 
1976 and that it is particular to the Northern Territory. The Committee also acknowledges the limited range of rights in land that are derived from the 
Native Title Act 1993. 
The Committee recommends that governments and business work constructively with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and organisations such as land councils and native title representative bodies or prescribed bodies corporate to maximise the economic development and employment opportunities on Aboriginal land and/or land over which there is native title.




Response: Agreed in principle — The Australian Government is committed to working with Indigenous land owners and native title holders to support them to be able to leverage their rights in land to pursue economic development.


In the White Paper the Australian Government committed to a range of initiatives in support of this, including:


investing in stronger native title corporations to help them meet their aspirations and engage in the mainstream economy ($20.4 million) (pp.23-24);


investing in planning and infrastructure that is needed to improve land administration and support more certain long term tenure arrangements ($17 million) (pp.28-29);


supporting pilot land reform projects ($10.6 million) (pp.18-19);


supporting the efficient resolution of native title claims and efficient native title processes (pp.22-23); and


reinforcing the importance of native title in our economy (pp.19-21; p.25).


Funding has been provided to assist native title holding corporations to generate economic benefit through the effective and sustainable management of their land. In 2016 and 2017, funding of $2.5 million was agreed for 11 projects to date. The Australian Government is supporting eight land tenure reform pilot projects that broaden economic activity on land in the north and demonstrate the benefits of more diverse activity to business, Indigenous communities and other stakeholders. Funding arrangements for these pilots is in place and implementation is underway. The Australian Government is considering additional pilots.


A number of communities in the Northern Territory have negotiated township leases in 2017 and are seeing the real-time benefits of economic activity—Mutijulu in Central Australia, Pirlangimpi on the Tiwi Islands and the Binjari housing lease near Katherine. Work continues on the Gunyangara lease in northeast Arnhem Land, at Jabiru in Kakadu National Park and at Yarralin in the Victoria Daly region.



Further actions for reforming land tenure arrangements are being pursued through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). On 11 December 2015, COAG agreed to implement the recommendations of the Report of the Investigation into Indigenous Land Administration and Use.


In cooperation with state governments, Austrade has developed a guide for investors to explain land tenure arrangements in northern Australia, including an interactive map to show tenure and native


titles applying in any one geographical location in the north. Austrade will continue to develop this guide and will highlight case studies for investors to demonstrate the processes for engaging with traditional owners.


Austrade appointed in September 2016 a senior manager for northern Australia Delivery (with a cross jurisdictional responsibility to support investment opportunities in Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia) to further support the promotion of investment opportunities in the north.




Recommendation 41: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the cost and administration of customs, quarantine and immigration services to provide the most cost-effective way of delivering those services, including:




providing customs, quarantine and immigration services at selected regional airports;




reducing visa charges for overseas visitors to encourage inbound tourism; and




reducing the passenger movement charge to reflect the actual cost of providing customs, quarantine and immigration services.




Response: : Agreed in part — On 1 July 2015, the functions of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service were integrated into a new department. The integration of complementary customs, immigration and border protection functions and capabilities provide greater opportunities for a shared approach to service delivery.


The Australian Government has announced the provision of border control services to facilitate international flights to and from Townsville airport, noting that airports commencing international flights may have an increased transport security obligation requiring a review of their Transport Security Program. International flights to and from Townsville commenced in September 2015.


The Australian Government also announced a number of changes to border fees, charges and taxes as part of the 2015-16 Commonwealth Budget, including simplifying arrangements around import processing charges, changes to licensing arrangements, and the harmonisation of Visa Application Charges.




Recommendation 42: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government pursue, through the Northern Australia Strategic Partnership, the harmonisation of governance and regulation in the jurisdictions across northern Australia, including in the areas of, but not exclusive to:




environmental management;




provision of health services and health industry qualifications;




transport regulations, especially those dealing with heavy vehicle capacity and driver fatigue;




water management; and




Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.




Response: Agreed in principle — The Australian Government remains committed to removing red tape where appropriate.


The Australian Government is continuing to work with state and territory governments to reduce unnecessary regulation for environmental approvals of nationally protected matters whilst maintaining high environmental standards. The 'single point of entry' Major Projects Approval


Agency (now Major Projects Facilitation Agency) Darwin office provides information and facilitation services to investors navigating regulatory approval processes (pp.75-76).


Through the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator, the Australian Government is working with jurisdictions in northern Australia to implement targeted and flexible regulatory regimes that facilitate greater use of higher productivity vehicles, whilst delivering better safety outcomes. The Australian Government will also work with jurisdictions in the north to cut red tape associated with cattle supply chains (p.96).


The Australian Government's commitment to water resource assessments will support more certainty over water management in the north (pp.47-48).


The Australian Government is committed to working with Indigenous groups, business and communities to find new ways of using land in the north to promote economic opportunities for all (pp.26-34). The Australian Government will also consult on a more efficient approach to cultural heritage regulation including an option for Commonwealth accreditation of best practice state/territory Indigenous heritage protection regimes (p.79).

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Government Response to Report</title>,COMMITTEES,14,2
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-12-05,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:43):  I move:



That the Migration Legislation Amendment (2017 Measures No. 4) Regulations 2017, made under the 
Migration Act 1958
, be disallowed [F2017L01425].



This regulation which we are seeking to disallow would provide the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection with sweeping new powers on top of what the Australian Greens already consider to be a far too broad range of powers, which have been exercised continually in an unreasonable way by the minister.


The changes that the minister is proposing to make, in broad terms, would allow the immigration department to detain people, potentially indefinitely, on the basis of criminal conduct that has not been proven or even tried, on the basis of behaviour that's considered by the department to have endangered or threatened another person extending, potentially, to bullying and online vilification, and because of inconsistencies in people's names on identity documents issued by any Commonwealth, state or territory government authority or official, or failures to update any name changes in those documents.


It's really important to note here that the conduct or behaviour that I've just referred to, and that the minister is seeking to act upon by detaining people who are on temporary visas, would not need to be assessed by a court, and therefore they would not be subject to the safeguards of Australia's criminal justice system. Indeed, the behaviour does not even need to be criminal and captures a very broad range of offences which would occur every day in every state and territory in our country, such as minor traffic offences. Potentially, people who have different names on their Medicare card and drivers licence could find themselves triggering the cancellation of a visa if these regulations go through, which would lead to detention and, in the case of refugees, potentially indefinite detention.


I acknowledge, and the Australian Greens acknowledge, that these changes would not immediately affect people on TPVs, temporary protection visas, but they would affect people if they renew their temporary protection visa after these regulations pass through the parliament—if, in fact, they do. It's important to note that the people we are discussing here are prevented by our current laws from ever becoming permanent residents in Australia, and they already suffer enormously because of their insecure state. We also acknowledge that this instrument will not immediately affect people on bridging visas. But it's important to note that bridging visas often have very limited time periods and will expire and potentially be renewed, in which case the proposed changes would start affecting people soon.


Of course, the human consequence of what the minister is proposing to do in the instrument that we are seeking to disallow today is that people who are already highly vulnerable for a range of reasons will have to live in fear that some day—maybe even decades into the future—they could be detained because somebody else has simply made an allegation that they have harassed or vilified them. While these changes do not apply to temporary protection visas that have already been granted, once the TPVs start being renewed—and there is currently a large tranche of people who will have their TPVs renewed starting shortly—it will also affect people once they have their visas renewed.


The idea that someone on a temporary visa should not engage in criminal conduct, should not endanger or threaten any individual and should use the same name for all government dealings, on the face of it, may not seem inappropriate, but it is actually the way that these measures will be implemented—and this will be implemented by the department, by departmental officers, at an unknown level—that is of significant concern to the Australian Greens.


Firstly, I go to the issue around names. Again, on the face of it, it's not unreasonable for somebody to have the same name on all of their documents. However, it's important to note that many people come here fleeing persecution and stretch out a hand to Australia for help. There are those who are lucky enough to still be here—because, of course, there are still many hundreds of people on Manus Island and Nauru who, shockingly, have been detained for nearly five years now in Australia's offshore detention system. For those people who are in Australia, it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect that they would have the identical name on all of their documents. But many of them come from countries where their names are required to be translated—sometimes from other languages that don't actually use the same alphabet as ours, such as Arabic—and it is at times almost an inevitability that letters or sounds will be lost in translation or translated differently by different people. So you have a situation where simply having a slightly differently spelled name—on, for example, your driver's licence and your Medicare card—could lead to you ending up in Australia's onshore detention system. These rules, in the view of the Greens, exacerbate the inadequacies of current laws concerning how we determine a person's legal identity. One of the real pitfalls, which I don't believe the minister has thought through here, is that these rules will increase the potential for false findings that migrants have intentionally misled or sought to defraud.


On the behaviour conditions—that is, the conditions that relate to a requirement not to engage in criminal conduct and a requirement not to endanger or threaten any individual—it's important to note that you won't even have to be charged with these offences for the minister to throw you into Australia's onshore detention system. You won't need to be charged with a criminal offence, much less convicted in a court. The freedom and the liberty of the people we are discussing here will turn on how an immigration department official interprets what are inherently vague concepts like 'endangering', 'threatening' and 'disrupting' either other people or the community.


Our legal system has a set of checks and balances built into it. They are designed to make sure that people get access to a fair trial and a fair hearing, and that a range of rights that we often take for granted in this country are not trampled through our legal system or our administrative law system. This seeks to move matters that are caught by these regulations out of those systems with those safeguards and into the hands of an immigration department official. And, as I said, you won't even need to be charged with an offence to find yourself locked up and potentially, in some cases, indefinitely locked up, depending on the circumstances of the individuals who fall foul of these draconian new provisions that the minister is seeking to make. The changes would also bar people whose temporary visas have been cancelled on behaviour related grounds from applying for a bridging visa, and they would also bar people from applying for a resident return visa where their permanent visa has been or is being considered for cancellation.


So what we've got here is a minister, in Minister Dutton, who has shown horrendous disregard for human rights and horrendous disregard for the rule of law—a man who was happy to order the withdrawal of drinking water, food, electricity and medicine from over 600 people on Manus Island who have already, in most cases, been indefinitely detained for nearly five years—and, for a large part of that time, illegally detained on Manus Island, according to the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court. Mr Dutton's track record on fairness can be described in no other way than as an abject failure. He is a serial trampler of human rights. He has shown repeatedly in the past that he has no respect for the rule of law and no respect for decisions that our country's administrative law system makes and, in fact, our judicial system makes. He cannot be trusted with these draconian, sweeping powers that he is seeking to grant himself with this instrument. It is strongly and stridently opposed by the Australian Greens.


When you take what the minister is doing as a whole, when you think about the fact that you won't need to be charged to be thrown into detention in Australia by Minister Dutton, when you think about the fact that you are dealing here with a cohort of people, many of whom will already be in an incredibly vulnerable state due to their life circumstances and their journeys to arrive in Australia, to allow someone like this immigration minister—or, in fact, any immigration minister—to have such unfettered control over their lives and to have such draconian capacity to deny them of their rights, their liberties and their freedoms, we have to ask ourselves: on what basis do we seek to allow this instrument to be made? It's the view of the Australian Greens that we ought not to allow this instrument to be made. Of course, that's why we have moved the disallowance motion that we are speaking about this evening.


It's ironic, isn't it, that at times the immigration department has, itself, incorrectly entered somebody's name onto their paperwork. There are demonstrated circumstances and proven circumstances where this has occurred. So you've got a situation where the department of immigration may itself make an error which entraps an innocent person who has done nothing wrong into a regime that the minister and the government are proposing to create, and this will allow the minister to throw someone into Australia's onshore detention system. This absolutely beggars belief. It is overreach in the extreme for this minister, with such an abject track record on human rights and respecting the rule of law, to come into this place and seek to grant himself ever more draconian and sweeping powers. He has more front than a D9 bulldozer—this minister. The Australian Greens are not going to have a bar of it.


The inevitable consequence of this regulation passing—and we don't believe that it should, which is why we've moved this disallowance—will be miscarriages of justice. The inevitable consequence will be natural justice denied to some of the people in this country who need it the most—many of whom would have fled from a country where a fair and reasonable justice system is only, and can only ever be, a thing of dreams. They come to this country, where they have a right to expect the government to respect the rule of law and where they have a right to expect a fair and impartial justice system, and they find themselves, if this regulation is not disallowed, entering a country where they can simply be thrown into our onshore detention regime effectively on the whim of an officer of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection for something as minor as a traffic offence. I look around this chamber now and I wonder how many of us have ever been caught speeding. I'll put my hand up for that. And I reckon there would be a majority of others who'd put their hand up, too. Do we seriously want people thrown into Australia's onshore detention system because they drove a car six kilometres an hour over the limit? 


What sort of country are we becoming, where we would even countenance such draconian and sweeping powers for a minister who has repeatedly shown that he cannot be entrusted to wield the powers that he already has in a fair and impartial manner? The answer, of course, is: we shouldn't be creating these new draconian, sweeping powers for this minister, or any other. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:43):  I move:



That the Migration Legislation Amendment (2017 Measures No. 4) Regulations 2017, made under the 
Migration Act 1958
, be disallowed [F2017L01425].



This regulation which we are seeking to disallow would provide the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection with sweeping new powers on top of what the Australian Greens already consider to be a far too broad range of powers, which have been exercised continually in an unreasonable way by the minister.


The changes that the minister is proposing to make, in broad terms, would allow the immigration department to detain people, potentially indefinitely, on the basis of criminal conduct that has not been proven or even tried, on the basis of behaviour that's considered by the department to have endangered or threatened another person extending, potentially, to bullying and online vilification, and because of inconsistencies in people's names on identity documents issued by any Commonwealth, state or territory government authority or official, or failures to update any name changes in those documents.


It's really important to note here that the conduct or behaviour that I've just referred to, and that the minister is seeking to act upon by detaining people who are on temporary visas, would not need to be assessed by a court, and therefore they would not be subject to the safeguards of Australia's criminal justice system. Indeed, the behaviour does not even need to be criminal and captures a very broad range of offences which would occur every day in every state and territory in our country, such as minor traffic offences. Potentially, people who have different names on their Medicare card and drivers licence could find themselves triggering the cancellation of a visa if these regulations go through, which would lead to detention and, in the case of refugees, potentially indefinite detention.


I acknowledge, and the Australian Greens acknowledge, that these changes would not immediately affect people on TPVs, temporary protection visas, but they would affect people if they renew their temporary protection visa after these regulations pass through the parliament—if, in fact, they do. It's important to note that the people we are discussing here are prevented by our current laws from ever becoming permanent residents in Australia, and they already suffer enormously because of their insecure state. We also acknowledge that this instrument will not immediately affect people on bridging visas. But it's important to note that bridging visas often have very limited time periods and will expire and potentially be renewed, in which case the proposed changes would start affecting people soon.


Of course, the human consequence of what the minister is proposing to do in the instrument that we are seeking to disallow today is that people who are already highly vulnerable for a range of reasons will have to live in fear that some day—maybe even decades into the future—they could be detained because somebody else has simply made an allegation that they have harassed or vilified them. While these changes do not apply to temporary protection visas that have already been granted, once the TPVs start being renewed—and there is currently a large tranche of people who will have their TPVs renewed starting shortly—it will also affect people once they have their visas renewed.


The idea that someone on a temporary visa should not engage in criminal conduct, should not endanger or threaten any individual and should use the same name for all government dealings, on the face of it, may not seem inappropriate, but it is actually the way that these measures will be implemented—and this will be implemented by the department, by departmental officers, at an unknown level—that is of significant concern to the Australian Greens.


Firstly, I go to the issue around names. Again, on the face of it, it's not unreasonable for somebody to have the same name on all of their documents. However, it's important to note that many people come here fleeing persecution and stretch out a hand to Australia for help. There are those who are lucky enough to still be here—because, of course, there are still many hundreds of people on Manus Island and Nauru who, shockingly, have been detained for nearly five years now in Australia's offshore detention system. For those people who are in Australia, it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect that they would have the identical name on all of their documents. But many of them come from countries where their names are required to be translated—sometimes from other languages that don't actually use the same alphabet as ours, such as Arabic—and it is at times almost an inevitability that letters or sounds will be lost in translation or translated differently by different people. So you have a situation where simply having a slightly differently spelled name—on, for example, your driver's licence and your Medicare card—could lead to you ending up in Australia's onshore detention system. These rules, in the view of the Greens, exacerbate the inadequacies of current laws concerning how we determine a person's legal identity. One of the real pitfalls, which I don't believe the minister has thought through here, is that these rules will increase the potential for false findings that migrants have intentionally misled or sought to defraud.


On the behaviour conditions—that is, the conditions that relate to a requirement not to engage in criminal conduct and a requirement not to endanger or threaten any individual—it's important to note that you won't even have to be charged with these offences for the minister to throw you into Australia's onshore detention system. You won't need to be charged with a criminal offence, much less convicted in a court. The freedom and the liberty of the people we are discussing here will turn on how an immigration department official interprets what are inherently vague concepts like 'endangering', 'threatening' and 'disrupting' either other people or the community.


Our legal system has a set of checks and balances built into it. They are designed to make sure that people get access to a fair trial and a fair hearing, and that a range of rights that we often take for granted in this country are not trampled through our legal system or our administrative law system. This seeks to move matters that are caught by these regulations out of those systems with those safeguards and into the hands of an immigration department official. And, as I said, you won't even need to be charged with an offence to find yourself locked up and potentially, in some cases, indefinitely locked up, depending on the circumstances of the individuals who fall foul of these draconian new provisions that the minister is seeking to make. The changes would also bar people whose temporary visas have been cancelled on behaviour related grounds from applying for a bridging visa, and they would also bar people from applying for a resident return visa where their permanent visa has been or is being considered for cancellation.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-12-05,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:22):  I was just expounding on the way that the current immigration minister has abused the broad-ranging powers that this parliament has, sadly, seen fit to already give him. Now he's in here again, in a massive overreach, asking for yet more powers. One of the powers that he is asking for in this instrument that we are seeking to disallow is a power around responding to a healthcare debt. You've got to remember, Mr President, that many of these people that we're discussing may have spent years in a detention system, or being persecuted in other countries, or living in Australia on insecure bridging visas or other temporary visas, including temporary protection visas. Once they get a modicum of stability in their life, they are going to be faced with these draconian new conditions that the minister is seeking to impose. That will underscore the already fragile nature of the temporary visa status and, as I said earlier, expose a person potentially to detention and incarceration at the discretion of an immigration department official.


With regard to health debts, in this instrument there is a new condition: that many temporary visa holders should not have an outstanding health debt. This exposes a range of already vulnerable people to the risk of their visas being cancelled and them being thrown into Australia's onshore detention system if they get sick and cannot afford health care. We are proposing to provide the minister for immigration with the powers to detain someone who has had the misfortune of being sick and not being able to pay for health care.


I look around Australia and I've visited onshore detention centres. I've been to Manus Island many times, where Australia is destroying its international reputation with the significant and serious harms that we are deliberately imposing on already vulnerable people. I ask myself, 'What sort of country are we becoming? And why don't I recognise the Australia I grew up in today?' Well, it's because of powers like this, it's because of regulations like this and it's because of ministers like Mr Dutton that I don't recognise the country I grew up in and it's why so many Australians don't recognise the country they grew up in.


This instrument should be disallowed by the Senate on the basis that it is overreach, on the basis that it is punitive and on the basis that it will impact disproportionately on some of the most vulnerable people in the country. I commend this disallowance motion to the Senate.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-12-05,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:25):  Labor will be supporting this disallowance motion. I repeat that we are willing to work with the government to strengthen Australia's visa program if there are gaps, but any measures that are advanced must be appropriate, must be proportionate and must uphold the criminal justice system. This regulation, however, is disproportionate and is a denial of natural justice. It raises the prospect of temporary visa holders being detained and their visas cancelled even though they have not been found to have committed an offence. The regulation broadens the reasons for which a person may be detained or have their visa cancelled and be deported to include a public health debt, behaviour not necessarily subject to criminal sanction, and other behaviour not covered by section 501 of the Migration Act, which is the character test, such as driving offences. The regulation also prevents some temporary visa holders from applying for a bridging visa E. It changes the eligibility for resident return visas. The regulation seeks to substantially increase the waiting time for eligibility to reapply for a visa if a previous application was rejected under Public Interest Criterion 4020.


There's already a clear basis for deciding that a visa holder has forfeited their right to remain in Australia. The parliament has drawn the line and we say that should not be crossed. When a person fails a character test under section 501 of the act—that is, if someone fails a character test such as when they have a substantial criminal record, if they're found to not be of good character, if they've been given an adverse security assessment or if there's an Interpol notice from which it is reasonable to infer that the person is a risk to the Australian community—that is the basis upon which Labor has supported changes to the Immigration Act. Labor has offered its support to visa cancellations under section 501 if the person is serving a full-time custodial sentence or has been sentenced to 12 months or more of imprisonment or has been convicted of a sexually based crime involving a child. But, if the immigration minister reasonably suspects that a person does not pass the character test, he can use his existing powers to cancel a visa.


On these particular measures, Labor have not been consulted. If we had been, we would have pointed out that the regulation significantly expands the reason for cancelling visas and for deporting people. It sets the bar so low that the average Australian citizen could fail to pass the test. Of course, no-one in the Labor Party is suggesting that visa holders must do anything other than obey the law. But that's not what this regulation is about. It says that if you behave in any way contrary to the views of the minister or of some departmental official, you face being placed in immigration detention and having your visa cancelled.


New conditions under 8303 and 8564 are already applied in some visas, but they will now be applied to temporary visas, including temporary protection visas, and people who are on safe haven enterprise visas. While we say there is no place whatsoever for intentional fraud in Australia's visa program, the new public interest criterion 4020 penalises temporary visa holders who make a simple mistake on a form. They will be prevented from making another application for 10 years. This is simply unjust.


The new visa condition in 8304 requires temporary visa holders to use the same name in all their dealings with government departments. Of course, people should use their real names and their identities. But the new condition doesn't provide flexibility to allow for the different ways Medicare or Centrelink or the immigration department respond to cultural naming practices. These differences can create inconsistencies that are not the fault of the visa holder.


We accept that officers need to be able to act with discretion and with common sense, but community legal advocates and human rights advocates have repeatedly warned that, under this government, discretion is rarely applied when it comes to visa applications. In these circumstances alone, these broad measures should be treated with caution. The Refugee Council of Australia, refugee and advice casework services and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia have all raised concerns about these regulations. 


In Australia, we ask temporary visa holders to live by the rules as they are written, but when you have rules that are written in such a broad and unclear manner then these propositions go much further than one could reasonably expect. These measures allow people to be detained and deported and for their visas to be cancelled, even though they have not committed an offence. I think this is particularly important in a country that actually prides itself on upholding the principles of the rule of law and the principles of natural justice. We should not allow this to happen.


Labor has confidence that, in the arrangements where the people who have been detained and deported under section 501, the cancellations have had the benefit of a fair hearing in the criminal justice system. This regulation, however, sends the message that the proper legal process need not count. This regulation sends that message that temporary visa holders do not have the protections of the safeguards that are provided by a proper rule of law. It creates a permanent class of temporary visa holders who are at all times extremely vulnerable. People are liable to be detained and deported even though they have committed no crime and have not been excluded on the character test.


The new visa condition 8303, which can be applied mandatorily to most temporary visas, would mean that a visa holder could have their visa cancelled and face deportation without ever having been accused, charged or convicted of a criminal offence. The regulation's explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the behaviour does not have to be unlawful; it simply only has to be unacceptable or disruptive. 


We have a tradition in this country. A famous High Court judge said, 'It's not wrong to be an agitator.' Remember that famous expression? You might not like it, but we do not lock people up because they're unacceptable or because they're disruptive. We don't throw them out of the country on that basis, which is what these regulations would provide for. These are terms that are far too broad and far too undefined. In the hands of an authoritarian minister they could mean anything. You may well say that the current minister is not of that character—I would disagree with you, but you may well say that—but these are propositions that will stand the test of time, if they're accepted by this parliament, and that's the danger here.


The memorandum lists some examples of 'unacceptable behaviour', and there is potential for a wide range of activities to come under the label. There is no guidance. They might include broad categories of activities that could endanger an individual. They could be comments made online about individuals. Temporary visa holders could be detained and deported for making comments on Facebook about the Department of Immigration and Border Protection or if an officer doesn't like criticism. It suggests that the regulation is less about protecting Australians than it is about protecting the political authorities of this country. I'm sure that, if the department was to look on Facebook on any day of the week, there would be any number of Australians who would fail the tests that are set by these regulations.


We know that migrant workers in this country are exploited every day of the week. Despite the pious statements of the ministers in this government, we know how widespread the abuse of workers is in this country. We know how often it is that personal safety is at risk. We know, from evidence put before Senate inquiries, about the exploitation of temporary visa holders and we know of the serious and systematic shortcomings in the protections that are actually available at law. We know this government has done very little to change those circumstances.


These visa regulations make the situation even worse. They make people more vulnerable to detention and visa cancellation if they complain about those circumstances, because they are the sorts of circumstances that could be alleged as 'disruptive'. Stakeholder consultation about these regulations demonstrate that the definition of 'disruptive behaviour' could include a visa holder participating in union activity. How could that possibly be justified as grounds for deportation? These are measures the Labor Party cannot support. They are very badly drafted, they are very poorly considered and, as has already been indicated, they have all the hallmarks of vindictiveness. They demonstrate a government that has lost its way on these matters. These measures are not appropriate to be on the statute books of this nation.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:39):  It was quite interesting to listen to Senator McKim's comments today, because the Greens are hell-bent on weakening Australia's immigration system. They have consistently tried to open our borders to anyone, and they don't care who they are or how that affects other Australians. We can see in the disallowance motion before us that the Greens want public health debts incurred on previous visits to Australia to be ignored when a new visa application is made. I see that right across our country we don't have enough money to open up hospital beds for our Australian people here. We aren't able to give them the dental health care that they need or the operations that they need. But don't worry about; we've gotta look after those who have been here previously with health debts incurred! We don't want to worry about that or to put any impost on these people!


Secondly, the Greens want to allow visas to be granted to people who lied—absolutely lied—to get a visa in the past. This weakens what is known as the public interest criterion 4020. So we are getting people coming to this country that cannot be truthful and we're supposed to overlook that. Then, thirdly, the Greens want to remove the condition that visa holders maintain a single identity in Australia. Well, I've heard a lot of drivel on the floor of parliament today with regard to, 'Oh, there might be an incorrect letter, or the spelling may be wrong.' What we're talking about are multiple names. How often do we hear through Centrelink, drivers licences, even getting your HR drivers licence or any certificate that people are rorting the system with multiple names? Why shouldn't we expect someone to have the right name? We have had migrants come into this country in a flood after the Second World War. They had names that were hard to pronounce, but they got through the system. They had to do it tough.


I wish the Labor Party and the Greens would actually see the vote that One Nation got in the last election in Queensland, because in a lot of the seats we pulled 25 to 30 per cent. Our average is about 21 to 22 per cent right across the state. That's a clear indication that they are not listening to what the Australian people want. I cannot really get my head around the fact that every time I hear the Greens in this chamber, all they are worried about is the people who have come to this country illegally, people who want to come to this country like the illegals that are on Manus Island. Manus Island has absolutely nothing to do with this. That's the detention centre. They were the illegals. We're talking about visa holders coming into Australia. It has nothing to do with Manus Island. In the time that I've been here, I have never heard—correct me if I'm wrong—the Greens stand up and fight for the farmers in this country, the people who are homeless on the street. You don't need to go very far. It actually happens here in Canberra on the streets at night, when I go back to my apartment after finishing a day here. Where's the fight for those people to find out whether they've got decent health care or housing? I never hear one word from them. I often wonder what the hell they're doing in this parliament, because it's not representing the Australian people that have voted for them. It's always representing someone else around the rest of the world.


Labor say they want to lock them up because they are disruptive. Well, let's look at the streets of Melbourne. Go and ask the people down in Melbourne how they feel about it, with these ones that have come into the country. They've lost control of their streets in Melbourne and they would dearly love to do something about it. Yes, if people are not going to abide by the rules of this country and be disruptive, and if they think they can carry on in this country like they have from the place that they've come from, no, we don't want them. Why would we?


Senator McKim said if they go six kays over the limit they're going to be locked up and thrown into a detention centre. What an exaggeration—an absolute exaggeration! That is not the case whatsoever. We have allowed too many people in this country who are abusing us and taking us for granted and taking us for mugs, and that's the way we're seen around the world. We're actually mugs. What I see in this country is taxpayers forking out more and more, and we're raising their taxes even more, there's no real wage increase, there's nothing. And Australians are doing it tough. Yet, bleeding hearts in this place are going out to people who want to come here. We don't need these people in this country. We can actually be very particular who we bring in, and we should be, because people are breaking down our doors to actually come to Australia.


We want quality people coming into this country. Stop making excuses for them; set tough laws and give the reasons. Many migrants are now supporting One Nation because they know how tough it was for them to get here. They're sick of seeing all the leniency shown to these others who will lie and cheat to get into this country and have no regard for Australia. They don't want to be Australians. They have no respect for our culture, our laws or our way of life. You talk about the legal system. I know many Australians who would dearly love to be able to have their cases paid for by the taxpayer—but we don't have the money. It was around $12 per person for legal aid in Australia; now it's down to $7 per person. People can't afford to get legal aid in Australia; yet you're opening up our courts and we're going to pay for it! It's also quite interesting that even the Nick Xenophon Team may, I believe, be supporting this disallowance.


It's about representing the people here in Australia. You talk about people coming here. We have the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It was set up about 30-odd years ago—I think it was in the 1970s or the 1980s; I'm not quite sure—and it cost us about $2 million a year. The tribunal now costs us $142 million to run. People who come here on visas can appeal to it. There are around 4,000 to 5,000 people a year who apply for a visa to come to Australia—and we have opened up for visa applications from Malaysia, the only Third World country who can do it via the internet—and a very high percentage of those people, after being here for three months, apply for refugee status. When the immigration department knocks them back, they then apply to the tribunal, which is a $35 fee. On average, it takes around 386 days for a decision to be made. In the meantime, they are given a bridging visa, they can work and they're looked after. Most of them actually leave the country before the 386 days, after they've worked and accumulated some money to take back to their own country—and we're actually paying for that. The taxpayer is paying for it. Like I said, the tribunal now costs $142 million a year to run. A lot of them are coming from Malaysia, China, India and Pakistan—and, like I said, we're taken for mugs.


I have Australians here who need only a few thousand dollars to help them, and charities and organisations that we need to help our own. The bleeding hearts in this parliament disgust me. The Australian people voted for you to represent them, to fight for their needs and to fix up their needs. Clean up our own backyard first before you worry about everyone else around the world. That is what we need to do first. I guarantee that the Australian people will agree with what I say about this. We need to have intervention with this because we cannot keep going down the track that we're going. You have more and more people applying for visas here. They will come here under a visa and turn around and abuse the whole system. We don't need any more people on our welfare system.

I'm calling on the Xenophon party to have a rethink about whether they are going to support this disallowance motion and to have a rethink about looking after the Australian people, because they are the ones who actually voted for you to represent them in this parliament—not those who want to try to get into this country who have no regard for Australian values or way of life.

Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (17:49):  I take great pleasure in stating that the Xenophon party, or NXT, have thought about this matter extensively, and we very much will be supporting this disallowance. We believe the regulations contain elements which are ambiguous and have well and truly gone too far. For instance, the regulations introduce a new clause, condition 8303, which in part prohibits a temporary or bridging visa holder from becoming involved in activities 'disruptive to the Australian community or a group within the Australian community'.


We have no issue with protecting the community, but booting a visa holder out for being disruptive is a step too far. What does the government mean by 'disruptive'? It is not defined, so we can't say. Does it mean that they can't engage in their democratic right to protest? If they make a scene in a hospital or at a post office, is their visa cancelled? Refugee advocates have raised concerns that people caught up by condition 8303 can be detained indefinitely from the moment an accusation against the visa holder is made until the matter is resolved. That is a denial of due process and, again, goes beyond what a fair-minded person would think is reasonable.


The regulations also seek to amend public interest criterion 4020, which allows the minister to refuse or cancel a visa if an applicant provides a fake document or misleading information to support their application. It affects applicants for skilled migration visas, business visas, temporary visas, student visas and family visas. Currently, this condition relating to a visa that the applicant held in the 12 months before the application was made; the government now wants to make this 10 years, which is excessively punitive, particularly for minor infractions.


These are just some of the concerns which have been raised with us, and we believe they warrant the government well and truly going back to the drawing board on these regulations.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:51):  The government does not support this disallowance motion. The regulations which Senator McKim has moved to disallow have been introduced to ensure that integrity, identity and community protection issues relating to temporary visa holders can be managed effectively. These regulations should be uncontroversial. They do not impact on the vast majority of temporary visa holders who come to Australia who abide by our laws. The government has zero tolerance for fraudulent, disruptive or criminal behaviour by noncitizens, and the measures introduced by these regulations allow the government to better manage noncompliance with Australian laws.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the disallowance motion moved by Senator McKim be agreed to.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-12-05,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:22):  I was just expounding on the way that the current immigration minister has abused the broad-ranging powers that this parliament has, sadly, seen fit to already give him. Now he's in here again, in a massive overreach, asking for yet more powers. One of the powers that he is asking for in this instrument that we are seeking to disallow is a power around responding to a healthcare debt. You've got to remember, Mr President, that many of these people that we're discussing may have spent years in a detention system, or being persecuted in other countries, or living in Australia on insecure bridging visas or other temporary visas, including temporary protection visas. Once they get a modicum of stability in their life, they are going to be faced with these draconian new conditions that the minister is seeking to impose. That will underscore the already fragile nature of the temporary visa status and, as I said earlier, expose a person potentially to detention and incarceration at the discretion of an immigration department official.


With regard to health debts, in this instrument there is a new condition: that many temporary visa holders should not have an outstanding health debt. This exposes a range of already vulnerable people to the risk of their visas being cancelled and them being thrown into Australia's onshore detention system if they get sick and cannot afford health care. We are proposing to provide the minister for immigration with the powers to detain someone who has had the misfortune of being sick and not being able to pay for health care.


I look around Australia and I've visited onshore detention centres. I've been to Manus Island many times, where Australia is destroying its international reputation with the significant and serious harms that we are deliberately imposing on already vulnerable people. I ask myself, 'What sort of country are we becoming? And why don't I recognise the Australia I grew up in today?' Well, it's because of powers like this, it's because of regulations like this and it's because of ministers like Mr Dutton that I don't recognise the country I grew up in and it's why so many Australians don't recognise the country they grew up in.


This instrument should be disallowed by the Senate on the basis that it is overreach, on the basis that it is punitive and on the basis that it will impact disproportionately on some of the most vulnerable people in the country. I commend this disallowance motion to the Senate.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-12-05,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:25):  Labor will be supporting this disallowance motion. I repeat that we are willing to work with the government to strengthen Australia's visa program if there are gaps, but any measures that are advanced must be appropriate, must be proportionate and must uphold the criminal justice system. This regulation, however, is disproportionate and is a denial of natural justice. It raises the prospect of temporary visa holders being detained and their visas cancelled even though they have not been found to have committed an offence. The regulation broadens the reasons for which a person may be detained or have their visa cancelled and be deported to include a public health debt, behaviour not necessarily subject to criminal sanction, and other behaviour not covered by section 501 of the Migration Act, which is the character test, such as driving offences. The regulation also prevents some temporary visa holders from applying for a bridging visa E. It changes the eligibility for resident return visas. The regulation seeks to substantially increase the waiting time for eligibility to reapply for a visa if a previous application was rejected under Public Interest Criterion 4020.


There's already a clear basis for deciding that a visa holder has forfeited their right to remain in Australia. The parliament has drawn the line and we say that should not be crossed. When a person fails a character test under section 501 of the act—that is, if someone fails a character test such as when they have a substantial criminal record, if they're found to not be of good character, if they've been given an adverse security assessment or if there's an Interpol notice from which it is reasonable to infer that the person is a risk to the Australian community—that is the basis upon which Labor has supported changes to the Immigration Act. Labor has offered its support to visa cancellations under section 501 if the person is serving a full-time custodial sentence or has been sentenced to 12 months or more of imprisonment or has been convicted of a sexually based crime involving a child. But, if the immigration minister reasonably suspects that a person does not pass the character test, he can use his existing powers to cancel a visa.


On these particular measures, Labor have not been consulted. If we had been, we would have pointed out that the regulation significantly expands the reason for cancelling visas and for deporting people. It sets the bar so low that the average Australian citizen could fail to pass the test. Of course, no-one in the Labor Party is suggesting that visa holders must do anything other than obey the law. But that's not what this regulation is about. It says that if you behave in any way contrary to the views of the minister or of some departmental official, you face being placed in immigration detention and having your visa cancelled.


New conditions under 8303 and 8564 are already applied in some visas, but they will now be applied to temporary visas, including temporary protection visas, and people who are on safe haven enterprise visas. While we say there is no place whatsoever for intentional fraud in Australia's visa program, the new public interest criterion 4020 penalises temporary visa holders who make a simple mistake on a form. They will be prevented from making another application for 10 years. This is simply unjust.


The new visa condition in 8304 requires temporary visa holders to use the same name in all their dealings with government departments. Of course, people should use their real names and their identities. But the new condition doesn't provide flexibility to allow for the different ways Medicare or Centrelink or the immigration department respond to cultural naming practices. These differences can create inconsistencies that are not the fault of the visa holder.


We accept that officers need to be able to act with discretion and with common sense, but community legal advocates and human rights advocates have repeatedly warned that, under this government, discretion is rarely applied when it comes to visa applications. In these circumstances alone, these broad measures should be treated with caution. The Refugee Council of Australia, refugee and advice casework services and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia have all raised concerns about these regulations. 


In Australia, we ask temporary visa holders to live by the rules as they are written, but when you have rules that are written in such a broad and unclear manner then these propositions go much further than one could reasonably expect. These measures allow people to be detained and deported and for their visas to be cancelled, even though they have not committed an offence. I think this is particularly important in a country that actually prides itself on upholding the principles of the rule of law and the principles of natural justice. We should not allow this to happen.


Labor has confidence that, in the arrangements where the people who have been detained and deported under section 501, the cancellations have had the benefit of a fair hearing in the criminal justice system. This regulation, however, sends the message that the proper legal process need not count. This regulation sends that message that temporary visa holders do not have the protections of the safeguards that are provided by a proper rule of law. It creates a permanent class of temporary visa holders who are at all times extremely vulnerable. People are liable to be detained and deported even though they have committed no crime and have not been excluded on the character test.


The new visa condition 8303, which can be applied mandatorily to most temporary visas, would mean that a visa holder could have their visa cancelled and face deportation without ever having been accused, charged or convicted of a criminal offence. The regulation's explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the behaviour does not have to be unlawful; it simply only has to be unacceptable or disruptive. 


We have a tradition in this country. A famous High Court judge said, 'It's not wrong to be an agitator.' Remember that famous expression? You might not like it, but we do not lock people up because they're unacceptable or because they're disruptive. We don't throw them out of the country on that basis, which is what these regulations would provide for. These are terms that are far too broad and far too undefined. In the hands of an authoritarian minister they could mean anything. You may well say that the current minister is not of that character—I would disagree with you, but you may well say that—but these are propositions that will stand the test of time, if they're accepted by this parliament, and that's the danger here.


The memorandum lists some examples of 'unacceptable behaviour', and there is potential for a wide range of activities to come under the label. There is no guidance. They might include broad categories of activities that could endanger an individual. They could be comments made online about individuals. Temporary visa holders could be detained and deported for making comments on Facebook about the Department of Immigration and Border Protection or if an officer doesn't like criticism. It suggests that the regulation is less about protecting Australians than it is about protecting the political authorities of this country. I'm sure that, if the department was to look on Facebook on any day of the week, there would be any number of Australians who would fail the tests that are set by these regulations.


We know that migrant workers in this country are exploited every day of the week. Despite the pious statements of the ministers in this government, we know how widespread the abuse of workers is in this country. We know how often it is that personal safety is at risk. We know, from evidence put before Senate inquiries, about the exploitation of temporary visa holders and we know of the serious and systematic shortcomings in the protections that are actually available at law. We know this government has done very little to change those circumstances.


These visa regulations make the situation even worse. They make people more vulnerable to detention and visa cancellation if they complain about those circumstances, because they are the sorts of circumstances that could be alleged as 'disruptive'. Stakeholder consultation about these regulations demonstrate that the definition of 'disruptive behaviour' could include a visa holder participating in union activity. How could that possibly be justified as grounds for deportation? These are measures the Labor Party cannot support. They are very badly drafted, they are very poorly considered and, as has already been indicated, they have all the hallmarks of vindictiveness. They demonstrate a government that has lost its way on these matters. These measures are not appropriate to be on the statute books of this nation.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-12-05,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:39):  It was quite interesting to listen to Senator McKim's comments today, because the Greens are hell-bent on weakening Australia's immigration system. They have consistently tried to open our borders to anyone, and they don't care who they are or how that affects other Australians. We can see in the disallowance motion before us that the Greens want public health debts incurred on previous visits to Australia to be ignored when a new visa application is made. I see that right across our country we don't have enough money to open up hospital beds for our Australian people here. We aren't able to give them the dental health care that they need or the operations that they need. But don't worry about; we've gotta look after those who have been here previously with health debts incurred! We don't want to worry about that or to put any impost on these people!


Secondly, the Greens want to allow visas to be granted to people who lied—absolutely lied—to get a visa in the past. This weakens what is known as the public interest criterion 4020. So we are getting people coming to this country that cannot be truthful and we're supposed to overlook that. Then, thirdly, the Greens want to remove the condition that visa holders maintain a single identity in Australia. Well, I've heard a lot of drivel on the floor of parliament today with regard to, 'Oh, there might be an incorrect letter, or the spelling may be wrong.' What we're talking about are multiple names. How often do we hear through Centrelink, drivers licences, even getting your HR drivers licence or any certificate that people are rorting the system with multiple names? Why shouldn't we expect someone to have the right name? We have had migrants come into this country in a flood after the Second World War. They had names that were hard to pronounce, but they got through the system. They had to do it tough.


I wish the Labor Party and the Greens would actually see the vote that One Nation got in the last election in Queensland, because in a lot of the seats we pulled 25 to 30 per cent. Our average is about 21 to 22 per cent right across the state. That's a clear indication that they are not listening to what the Australian people want. I cannot really get my head around the fact that every time I hear the Greens in this chamber, all they are worried about is the people who have come to this country illegally, people who want to come to this country like the illegals that are on Manus Island. Manus Island has absolutely nothing to do with this. That's the detention centre. They were the illegals. We're talking about visa holders coming into Australia. It has nothing to do with Manus Island. In the time that I've been here, I have never heard—correct me if I'm wrong—the Greens stand up and fight for the farmers in this country, the people who are homeless on the street. You don't need to go very far. It actually happens here in Canberra on the streets at night, when I go back to my apartment after finishing a day here. Where's the fight for those people to find out whether they've got decent health care or housing? I never hear one word from them. I often wonder what the hell they're doing in this parliament, because it's not representing the Australian people that have voted for them. It's always representing someone else around the rest of the world.


Labor say they want to lock them up because they are disruptive. Well, let's look at the streets of Melbourne. Go and ask the people down in Melbourne how they feel about it, with these ones that have come into the country. They've lost control of their streets in Melbourne and they would dearly love to do something about it. Yes, if people are not going to abide by the rules of this country and be disruptive, and if they think they can carry on in this country like they have from the place that they've come from, no, we don't want them. Why would we?


Senator McKim said if they go six kays over the limit they're going to be locked up and thrown into a detention centre. What an exaggeration—an absolute exaggeration! That is not the case whatsoever. We have allowed too many people in this country who are abusing us and taking us for granted and taking us for mugs, and that's the way we're seen around the world. We're actually mugs. What I see in this country is taxpayers forking out more and more, and we're raising their taxes even more, there's no real wage increase, there's nothing. And Australians are doing it tough. Yet, bleeding hearts in this place are going out to people who want to come here. We don't need these people in this country. We can actually be very particular who we bring in, and we should be, because people are breaking down our doors to actually come to Australia.


We want quality people coming into this country. Stop making excuses for them; set tough laws and give the reasons. Many migrants are now supporting One Nation because they know how tough it was for them to get here. They're sick of seeing all the leniency shown to these others who will lie and cheat to get into this country and have no regard for Australia. They don't want to be Australians. They have no respect for our culture, our laws or our way of life. You talk about the legal system. I know many Australians who would dearly love to be able to have their cases paid for by the taxpayer—but we don't have the money. It was around $12 per person for legal aid in Australia; now it's down to $7 per person. People can't afford to get legal aid in Australia; yet you're opening up our courts and we're going to pay for it! It's also quite interesting that even the Nick Xenophon Team may, I believe, be supporting this disallowance.


It's about representing the people here in Australia. You talk about people coming here. We have the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It was set up about 30-odd years ago—I think it was in the 1970s or the 1980s; I'm not quite sure—and it cost us about $2 million a year. The tribunal now costs us $142 million to run. People who come here on visas can appeal to it. There are around 4,000 to 5,000 people a year who apply for a visa to come to Australia—and we have opened up for visa applications from Malaysia, the only Third World country who can do it via the internet—and a very high percentage of those people, after being here for three months, apply for refugee status. When the immigration department knocks them back, they then apply to the tribunal, which is a $35 fee. On average, it takes around 386 days for a decision to be made. In the meantime, they are given a bridging visa, they can work and they're looked after. Most of them actually leave the country before the 386 days, after they've worked and accumulated some money to take back to their own country—and we're actually paying for that. The taxpayer is paying for it. Like I said, the tribunal now costs $142 million a year to run. A lot of them are coming from Malaysia, China, India and Pakistan—and, like I said, we're taken for mugs.


I have Australians here who need only a few thousand dollars to help them, and charities and organisations that we need to help our own. The bleeding hearts in this parliament disgust me. The Australian people voted for you to represent them, to fight for their needs and to fix up their needs. Clean up our own backyard first before you worry about everyone else around the world. That is what we need to do first. I guarantee that the Australian people will agree with what I say about this. We need to have intervention with this because we cannot keep going down the track that we're going. You have more and more people applying for visas here. They will come here under a visa and turn around and abuse the whole system. We don't need any more people on our welfare system. We cannot afford it, because by 2019-20 we will be reaching $191 billion. We cannot afford it any longer.


I'm calling on the Xenophon party to have a rethink about whether they are going to support this disallowance motion and to have a rethink about looking after the Australian people, because they are the ones who actually voted for you to represent them in this parliament—not those who want to try to get into this country who have no regard for Australian values or way of life.

Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  for the federal government to show some leadership and provide an off-balance-sheet loan to compensate the states and drive this transition. Then we might start dealing with issues around supply of housing, housing occupancy and vacancy rates. We might start dealing with some serious issues around value capture, which we've discussed in this chamber before when we've been talking about infrastructure.


We also believe that we need to make brave decisions—and the Greens have led on this now for years—to drive reform, get rid of capital gains tax concessions and get rid of negative gearing. We know that, if we do that, our own estimates through the PBO show that, even if we phase it out over time, even if we design it to minimise the impacts that we see around retrospective legislation, we can raise $13 billion over the forward estimates over four years. That's money that we desperately need in this country.


Let's be really clear about what this is today. This is a smokescreen for a government that's trying to show that it's doing something about tackling housing affordability in this country. But there's no evidence that a super saver scheme for first home buyers, or even for Australians who are down on their luck and who want to own a home, is actually going to work. We have already gone through this in the second reading debate. The Rudd scheme failed badly; virtually nobody used it. It's not going to do anything about housing prices, which is one of the key issues here. If anything, it's just going to add to demand-side pressure to push up housing prices.


We reiterate our message in this debate. If we're actually here to represent the people of Australia, especially young Australians and low-income Australians who are reflected in those HILDA surveys I talked about in my speech, and tackle this issue, this is not the right way to do it.

 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  Last Saturday, the people of New England returned Barnaby Joyce to his rightful place as for member of New England. It was a huge victory and all the Labor lies about selling off Medicare and cuts to school funding did not help Labor one bit—an 11 per cent primary vote. The voters saw through the mistruths, which brings me to Saturday, 16 December, when John Alexander, who showed plenty of integrity by standing down over his citizenship, seeks to retain his seat against a Labor candidate who reigned over the darkest times in New South Wales politics.


It is well-documented that Kristina Keneally led a Labor government that suffered a 17 per cent swing across the state, and Ms Keneally had a swing against her of 16.6 per cent in her own seat of Heffron. What did she leave us? She left a state with the highest unemployment rate in the country and lowest economic growth. Of course, Ms Keneally will forever be known as the Premier who reappointed Ian Macdonald to the ministry. Let's remember, Ian Macdonald's place in history. 


In 2008, Doyles Creek Mining was awarded an exploration licence by the then Minister for Mineral Resources in New South Wales, Ian Macdonald. The licence was awarded to former CFMEU National President John Maitland, who is now serving six years in prison. Ian Macdonald had granted the coal exploration licence without opening it to competitive tender. On 15 November 2009, the then Premier, Nathan Rees, sacked Ian Macdonald from cabinet. Nathan Rees had signed his own death warrant, and on 3 December 2009 a spill was called for the Labor leadership. That morning Nathan Rees said: 


Should I not be Premier by the end of this day, let there be no doubt in the community's mind, no doubt, that any challenger will be a puppet of Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi.


That puppet turned out to be Kristina Keneally, and it wasn't long before Ian Macdonald was back in cabinet—how strange!


It is history that in 2013 ICAC found that Mr Ian Macdonald, Mr Eddie Obeid, Mr Joe Tripodi and Mr Tony Kelly had engaged in corrupt conduct. Both Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald were sentenced to jail. There are questions Ms Keneally still has to answer. What knowledge did Ms Keneally have about the approval of the Doyles Creek Mining lease before reappointing Mr Macdonald to cabinet? What steps did Ms Keneally take to investigate this matter before she appointed Mr Macdonald to her cabinet? Who did Ms Keneally speak with about the appointment of Mr Macdonald to cabinet? Did Ms Keneally make any inquiries with the relevant New South Wales department about the procedures that had been followed in awarding the Doyles Creek Mining licence? 


The by-election in Bennelong comes down to integrity: the integrity of John Alexander, a former tennis champion who has worked hard for Bennelong but took the honourable step of standing down, or the integrity of a former Labor Premier with dubious links. Ms Keneally didn't have the great start to her campaign—criticising her own party's policy. She claimed that in 2015 the Liberals shut down the Eastwood office of Medicare. Imagine her embarrassment when someone whispered to her that it was actually Labor policy that shut the office. 


We saw in New England last Saturday that voters want the truth. They want their political representatives to be fair dinkum with them, and they don't want to be promised something that can't be delivered. They can see through those who aren't genuine. I'll be in Bennelong on Saturday, 16 December, to support John Alexander. He was a champion on the court, and he's a champion for his people. He needs to be returned to his rightful place as the member for Bennelong, as part of a strong Turnbull-Joyce government.
