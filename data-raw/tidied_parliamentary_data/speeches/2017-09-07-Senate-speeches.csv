Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  Australian households are hurting. Politicians are to blame, and politicians can relieve this pain right here, right now. Household electricity bills across the country have risen by around eight per cent each year over the past decade, and household electricity bills have risen by a further 20 per cent just over the last quarter. This is crippling. Charities have reported that thousands of low-income households have had to go without heating this winter because of unaffordable electricity—thousands of households, including our sick and elderly.


We will never know just how many deaths this winter can be attributed to unaffordable electricity, but the number would be substantial. And of course any number is unacceptable in a developed, resource-rich country like Australia. Thousands of households will go without cooling this summer, and more deaths will be the result. I challenge those who feel moral superiority when they cheer for policies that make electricity more expensive to acknowledge these deaths, and I challenge them to acknowledge their role in these deaths. You might say that this is the greatest moral challenge of our time.


Politicians are to blame for the pain of exorbitant electricity prices. Two decades ago, Australia enjoyed the lowest electricity prices in the world. Now Australians pay the highest electricity prices in the world. How is this possible? It is possible because, over the past two decades, no large-scale generators of reliable base-load power have been built in Australia. This is despite the fact that there has been considerable economic and population growth and the fact that the construction costs of power plants—along with their fuel, coal and gas—have gone down, although gas prices have currently gone up. This investment drought has been caused by politicians. They have implemented renewable energy targets that force coal-fired generators to pay small-scale, intermittent generators whatever it takes for their market share to grow. They have imposed carbon taxes with the specific purpose of driving out coal-fired base-load generators. Even now, with the carbon tax gone, they threaten carbon pricing that, depending on the carbon price involved, could drive the lowest-cost coal-fired power plant to bankruptcy. To top it off, the politicians have maintained an evidence-free ban on nuclear power.


Politicians can relieve the pain of exorbitant prices right here, right now. The building of new large-scale generators of dispatchable power will take years and will require either the suspension of the renewable energy target and a guarantee that there will be no carbon pricing or the legalisation of nuclear power. But we can relieve some of the pain of high electricity prices right now by making electricity GST free. My bill before the Senate makes electricity GST free. I propose that the Senate votes on this straightforward bill within the hour.


Electricity is an essential service like water and should be treated the same for tax purposes. I challenge any politician who plans to vote against making electricity GST free to declare that electricity is not an essential service; to explain how their constituents can live without electricity, which is more than likely what some of them will have to do this summer or, indeed, each summer until more generators are constructed; and to explain why water should be GST free but electricity should not.


Making electricity GST free will immediately save a typical household around $200 each year. For any politician planning to vote against it, please stop wringing your hands about the punishing electricity bills facing your constituents and admit that you just do not care. For those who use the excuse that the state governments would receive around $2 billion less in GST grants if we made electricity GST free, might I point out: each state budget other than Western Australia's is in surplus, and WA gets so little of its GST back that its deficit would be little changed. Together the state governments enjoy annual revenue of around $300 billion. So, if you plan on voting against making electricity GST free, please explain why you think it is that the state governments rather than the people should not struggle.


If you care about everyday Australians as they struggle with electricity prices created by politicians, I believe you must vote to make electricity GST free. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (09:37):  I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for his bill, which indicates a desire to address what is one of the most significant issues facing Australians—consumers not only in a residential sense but also in a small business sense. I note news announced today that Cafe Buongiorno at Modbury in South Australia, which is a cafe I have frequented a number of times over the years, has announced that this will be its last week of operation. It is looking to close down because of high electricity costs.




Senator Farrell:
  Yes, because you sold ENSA.




Senator FAWCETT:
  We are seeing a number of businesses impacted as they come off contract and get bill shocks as they go onto higher electricity costs. I note Senator Farrell interjecting from the other side. I highlight to Senator Farrell that one of the drivers of the high electricity costs that people are paying is because of our market design with the peaking gas plants that come in at the end of the bidding cycle and all of the other providers that get lifted up to that point. It's been acknowledged in the last couple of weeks that, when Senator Farrell's side were in government, they were warned that the approvals they gave for the export of LNG would drive up domestic prices if domestic supply was constrained and yet they did nothing about that. Senator Farrell is from the Labor Party in South Australia, where we've seen the Labor Premier embark upon what he called one of the greatest experiments in energy production and we've seen a reckless pursuit of renewable energy to the point where the excessive amount of wind power has undermined the market for thermal-based base load. So we've seen the state government refuse to keep open the Northern Power Station at Port Augusta, which would have been a cost that pales in comparison to what they now have to do, which is to commission a large fleet diesel generators in order to provide some kind of reliable power for South Australia in the approaching summer. The reckless ideology of the Labor Party in this regard, as evidenced in South Australia and as we see in the policies that have been enacted by Labor in the past and have been promised should they ever—heaven forbid!—return to power in Australia, will only worsen the kind of situation we currently see.


I've said in this place a number of times that one of the reasons these things occur is we have far too many lawyers in the parliament as opposed to engineers. If we had more engineers—people who understand systems engineering and the interface of mechanical, technical and systems-related things—instead of saying that you could push on with more renewables you would understand there is a cost to having renewables because of the interface with the electricity system and the requirement for frequency stability as well as being able to dispatch. AEMO came out with their report looking at a range of these issues. My report to Senator Leyonhjelm is that removing the GST from electricity, whilst there is a very short-term gain, does nothing to actually change the long-term structural issues causing the drive-up in price.


Let me come to a number of specific things in relation to his bill and what we need to be doing moving forward. Firstly, from a technical perspective, as Senator Leyonhjelm should know, section 53 of the Constitution requires that bills dealing with the appropriation of revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, need to originate in the House of Representatives. From a purely technical perspective, whilst it's a good idea, this is actually the wrong chamber to introduce it. From a purely technical perspective, even if it were to pass, it would not necessarily have the desired outcome. Putting that aside though, he's indicated that this could result in a change of around $200 for an average household. The modelling shows that the actions the government has taken in a range of areas—such as specifically requiring that the retailers contact customers to make sure they are aware of the best deal available to them—could save the average household around $500 a year and in some cases up to $1,500 a year. Whilst I hear Senator Leyonhjelm's case that this is a simple fix, I would point out that, technically, it may not work and there are other measures that the government is putting in place that will provide savings of a far greater magnitude than what Senator Leyonhjelm is proposing.


Lastly, when it comes to the GST, it is not explicitly a federal issue. Changes to the GST actually require the agreement of all the states. The deal we are working on to get the providers to provide that incentive and information to consumers to save them $500 to $1,500 a year is something that is within the power of the federal government. What Senator Leyonhjelm is proposing is not explicitly within the federal government's power. It would require the agreement of the states. Therefore, even were something to pass here in the appropriate chamber, there is no guarantee that the states would agree. In the time it would take to get that agreement, there are other things we can be putting in place.


One of those is the issue of a limited merits review. In 2008 the then Labor government allowed the network providers to challenge decisions that were taken around pricing. I think some 32 out of 51 decisions of the Australian Energy Regulator have been challenged. A research note by a major broker said investors are getting this as a free option, with the upside being that it brings forward a dividend surprise. In other words, every time they are able to challenge a decision of the regulator, it actually brings forward more profit and more dividend to those network providers.


Given that one of the largest components of the price which is paid by residents and commercial users of electricity in Australia is the network cost, then one of the actions this Senate should be taking is on the limited merits review. In fact, we are dealing with an issue right now where we are seeking to have that limited merits review removed, which is in line with other things such as postal, water et cetera. We are seeking to do that now. We're seeking to do it quickly, and yet we will have a vote in this place later today as to how the Senate deals with the government's legislation to remove that limited merits review. I call on Senator Leyonhjelm and others on the crossbench, and the opposition: when that comes up for a vote today you should be supporting the government to bring that legislation forward as soon as possible, rather than referring it off to a committee. Bring it forward so that we can take action now to bring electricity supply, in terms of the networks, into line with things like water networks so that the people who are providing that can't make additional profit by using what brokers in the system call 'the free option to them', which increases their profits at the expense of the Australian public.


Since 2008, when it was established by the Labor government, it is calculated that those 32 out of 51 decisions taken against the Australian Energy Regulator have resulted in some $6.5 billion of additional costs being passed on to consumers in their electricity bills. We are looking to make sure that the Australian Energy Regulator can make informed and sensible decisions that can't be challenged as a free option. There's still a judicial review if the networks want to go to that extent—if they think there is inequity or unfairness in the decision. But the limited merits review has cost consumers some $6.5 billion since it was established by the Labor government in 2008. We wish to remove it. There is a vote coming before this chamber today which will provide a passage forward for the government to take that action, and I will be calling on Senator Leyonhjelm to help us to take those steps to address something that is a substantial component of the electricity price that goes to consumers.


More broadly, we also need to look at market design—the whole concept of how we retail electricity in Australia, or, in fact, how the providers put it into the National Electricity Market. If you look at other nations, other models and other ways of pricing that, there are different models that could put significant downward pressure on electricity. That's something that we need to be looking at, as well as the other levers that talk about how renewable energy is introduced into the system.


As I've looked at the Finkel report and the modelling that's been done out of that, I believe the government has been right to adopt the 49 recommendations there. But we also need to understand whether the optimum modelling has been done around that last recommendation and where we should be moving to. Finkel himself said it could take a number of months for the government to examine what was proposed there, to look at alternative modelling and to understand how best to move forward in that area. Personally, I believe that the market in Australia, without the extent of government interference that we've seen—particularly with the state governments pushing for the very high renewable targets—would have delivered more investment in base-load energy over the last couple of decades and would have been providing Australia with more reliable and affordable power than we currently have.


What are some of those policies? Well, the opposition has put forward that it wants a 45 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030 and a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. It is talking about forcing the closure of coal-fired power plants. This is despite people, like AEMO, looking and saying that that rapid closure is actually going to ramp up costs as well as decrease reliability.


People who want those really high renewable targets have to look no further than South Australia to see that what Premier Weatherill called his great big experiment has in fact failed. Here we are in a First World country, with supplies of coal, gas and uranium—if we had the courage to move down that path—and yet we had state-wide blackouts in this nation. The cost to South Australian businesses was huge.




Senator Farrell:
  It was a catastrophic storm! Come on, be honest!




Senator FAWCETT:
  Senator Farrell interjects again with the normal claim that comes from South Australian Labor, which is that there was a storm. Well, Senator Farrell, you know that my background was as an experimental test pilot. I was dealing with the design of systems that had to be able to cope with a range of environmental factors. When you design an aircraft well, it can cope with turbulence and interruptions without failing either structurally or in terms of its systems. Those trigger events highlight good design or poor design.


And so the fact that there was a storm in South Australia merely points to the fact that the system was poorly designed; it had low redundancy; and it didn't take account of the failure modes. Basic systems engineering has a thing called failure mode criticality effects analysis. I would argue that nobody ever did the level of systems engineering to understand what the failure modes were in the South Australian system as a result of the rapid increase of renewable, unreliable, intermittent energy as opposed to reliable, frequency-stable, base-load energy. So don't come into this place and say that it was a storm. The storm was merely a trigger event. The storm was merely a trigger event that highlighted the poor system design that resulted because of the policies that have seen that incredible growth in renewable energy in South Australia.


Having seen that there, why would we then impose that same kind of system instability and poor design on the whole nation? Yet that's what federal Labor's plans are for Australia. Labor said in its climate action plan that it would kickstart the closure of coal-fired power stations. It teamed up with the Greens to pass a motion that would encourage the closure of coal-fired power stations, saying:


The question is not if coal fired power stations will close, but how quickly …


This would lead, as we've seen in Victoria and other places, to the destruction of jobs in Australia's coal-fired plants and thousands of jobs elsewhere. The Australian Energy Market Commission has said that the forced closure policy could cost up to $24 billion around Australia. In Hazelwood, in Victoria, as a result of their closure, energy companies AGL and Energy Australia have increased bills by up to $135 in 2017. In South Australia, as a result of pushing out the Northern Power plant, at Port Augusta, contract prices for large industrial users jumped 50 per cent, and spot market prices tripled in the months following.


So there are a range of issues with taking the view that we can just push renewables without doing the engineering behind it and realising that there is a cost associated with the integration of renewables. Doing that systems engineering, understanding the failure modes and understanding the true costs of those inputs, is what we need to be considering as we look to see whether we would expand the RET. Consequently, we should also be considering what we can achieve in terms of optimising the three critical parameters that we're concerned about, which are energy price, keeping it low; energy reliability; and emissions. The whole concept of modern use of big data in modelling is to test those various parameters and variables and iterate your modelling until you come up with the optimal mix. I would lay odds that the answer would not be a 50 per cent renewable target, as is being pushed by the ideologues. As the Prime Minister has said, rather than engineering, it's ideology and in some cases idiocy that have brought us to this point.


I will come back to Senator Leyonhjelm's bill. As I said, this is not the chamber. If it's to do with appropriation and taxation it needs to come into the other place. You've quoted $200. Some of the interim steps that the government is seeking, around the dealing with retailers, could save families orders of magnitude more than that—$500 to $1,500.


Importantly, in terms of things that this chamber can do, today there will be a vote in this chamber about how we deal with the limited merits review. The indications are that those opposite want to push it off to a committee and kick it down the road, as opposed to dealing with it today. I would challenge them: if they are concerned about the of closure of businesses, like Buongiorno Cafe in Modbury, and if they are concerned about the impact of prices that are impacting families in South Australia then they will be voting with the government today to enable us to deal with the limited merits review, given that network costs are one of the most significant inputs to the costs paid by consumers and businesses in Australia. So I won't be supporting Senator Leyonhjelm's bill, not because I don't share his concern about electricity prices, but because technically this is not the chamber and because there are other measures that we could be dealing with today that could have a far greater impact on prices that go to Australian consumers.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment (Make Electricity GST Free) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2017-09-07,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:56):  I rise to speak on the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment (Make Electricity GST Free) Bill 2017. I'll detail in a moment why Labor, regrettably, Senator Leyonhjelm, will oppose this bill.


However, before I get onto that, I think I do need to respond to some of the absolute misrepresentations made to the chamber by Senator Fawcett. I start by making this observation: I understand why Senator Brandis often attacks South Australia and its electricity system, but I don't understand why a South Australian Senator, even a Liberal Senator, would attack South Australia. He knows full well why we have problems with electricity in South Australia. We have problems with electricity in South Australia because his government—the Olsen government—after promising not to sell the electricity service in South Australia reversed that decision and sold the electricity system in South Australia. That was the start of all of South Australia's electricity problems.




Senator McGrath:
  It's all Playford's fault, isn't it!




Senator FARRELL:
  No, it isn't. I will take that interjection. Tom Playford understood why, in a monopoly situation for electricity, we needed to have a government-controlled electricity system. So in 1946, with the support of the federal Chifley government, he nationalised the South Australian electricity system. That system provided the cheapest and most efficient electricity system in this country. All that went out the window when the Liberals in South Australia sold that monopoly. That's when our problems started with electricity. If that decision had not been made—if Senator Xenophon hadn't supported the second reading speech to allow that bill to proceed—then we would not have the problems that we have today.


I happened to be in Adelaide on the night of the storm that Senator Fawcett was talking about. That was the worst storm in our history. Anybody who'd gone out to the north of Adelaide would understand the catastrophic effect of that storm that night. To connect that catastrophic storm with more serious problems in the electricity market is an absolute misrepresentation, and I suspect that even Senator Fawcett knows that because, if he had been in town that day, he'd recall just how bad the weather was. I was in Clare the day after the storm, and there was one street where you could not go in any direction because massive trees had been blown over. It was a catastrophic storm, and the fact that the Liberals continue to make reference to that in relation to electricity prices is an outrage. I'm sure Senator Bernardi would agree with me in respect of that.


But we are not here today to talk about the misrepresentations by the Liberal Party—I know Senator Bernardi knows a lot about that. As noted in the explanatory memorandum, A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment (Make Electricity GST Free) Bill 2017 would make the supply of electricity GST free. This would commence from the first day of the quarter following royal assent. There are two important points from the explanatory memorandum that I will address:


… this Bill will make electricity GST-free irrespective of the views of State and Territory Governments. The enactment of this Bill will override the commitment, previously legislated in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and the A New Tax System (Managing the GST Rate and Base) Act 1999, to only vary the base of the GST with the unanimous support of the State and Territory Governments.


…   …   …


GST revenues granted to the State and Territory Governments would fall by around $2 billion each year …


The Senate dealt with the issue of GST modification only a few months ago. At that time, Labor noted that parliament should be the end of the process, not the start. It's a point we have been clear on in the past. At the time, Senator Gallagher said:


We think in all fairness, considering how important the GST is for states and territories, and indeed the agreement that exists between the Commonwealth and the states and territories on GST arrangements, that these discussions about how this should be done and when it should be done needs to happen with all of those parties but also needs to be done at the start of the process, not at the end of it here in this chamber.


This goes to the heart of the process for changing the GST. The GST may be levied by the Commonwealth, but the revenue from the GST is distributed to the states and territories. This arrangement is set out in the Intergovernmental Agreement—or IGA—on Federal Financial Relations. Clause A4(c)i provides that the standing Council on Federal Financial Relations, chaired by the Commonwealth Treasurer, must approve 'changes to the GST base and rate'. Clause A6 of that agreement requires that any such agreement be unanimous. Whilst it is true that it can be difficult to gain the unanimous support of the state, territory and Commonwealth governments, this is a matter of due process and good faith. If the process is not followed, it could potentially allow any government, present or future, to ride roughshod over revenue for states and territories.


Whether you like the GST or not, this bill will remove roughly $31 billion of revenue from the states and territories over the next 10 years, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office costings attached to the explanatory memorandum. It goes without saying that the premiers and chief ministers of those states and territories will be the first to let you know which schools, hospitals and services will be hit by the sudden collapse in revenue. Some legal commentary has suggested that the Commonwealth would be legally free to disregard the IGA and amend the GST legislation unilaterally. That is the presumption on which this bill is also based. Even if this happens to be the case, the inherent imposition and purpose of the goods and services tax is underpinned by good faith and intergovernmental cooperation.


We can spare ourselves the lengthy discussion about horizontal fiscal equalisation, but I take this opportunity to point out that Labor deeply understands the complexity and challenges of the GST. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, recently outlined Labor's Fair Share for WA Fund. Labor would invest $1.6 billion in Western Australia in the first budget of a Shorten Labor government—which is looking closer and closer, and I'm sure Senator Sterle would be delighted to hear that news and for that to happen. That would bring Western Australia's funding up to the equivalent of 70c in the dollar, up from the current 33c.


I re-emphasise the importance of agreement. The job-creating infrastructure projects that would flow would be decided in agreement with the Western Australian government on the advice of local businesses and the community. On that basis alone, we cannot support the bill as a matter of due process. We would also add that this bill does not address the issues that underpin the Australian energy crisis under the present government. Wholesale electricity prices have doubled in the four years this government has been in power. This is particularly important for businesses for whom this bill has no impact, as GST-taxable businesses are able to claim input tax credits for the GST included in the price of the electricity they consume.


The government refuses to give full and fair consideration to the Finkel review, including the clean energy target. Business groups, environmental groups, unions, industry and stakeholders all believe that the worst outcome for energy consumers and suppliers alike would be the absence of any credible and enduring energy and climate policy in Australia. This bill will not achieve the cheaper, reliable and cleaner energy that households and businesses need. Without reform, Australia will endure higher prices, reduced security, lost investment opportunities and stubbornly high emissions. The Turnbull government stumbles from one energy crisis to another—in fact, they seem to stumble from one crisis to another on a whole range of things. Yes, I know you are agreeing with me there, Acting Deputy President Bernardi. I know that you know that what I'm saying is absolutely true. The Prime Minister may have accomplished his plan to get energy retailers to write letters to customers—what a terrific thing to do—but he is yet to start talking about any real action on implementing a clean energy target to bring electricity prices down for all Australians. Labor has extended the offer to work, in good faith, on an energy policy that is clean and provides certainty for businesses and households.


The Prime Minister spends the majority of his press conferences attacking Labor for the energy crisis his government has presided over, and he refuses to take any serious action on it. Experts, industry and even his own Finkel review have said clearly that it is government policy inaction that is driving up electricity prices and that a CET is the solution to crippling policy paralysis. Even the CEO of Snowy Hydro, a proponent of the Prime Minister's favourite pet project, has called for the government to adopt a CET. Why doesn't the Prime Minister listen to him? I think that's the question.


I respectfully note that Senator Leyonhjelm is not proposing this bill to be a panacea to the electricity crisis, and also has a different view to the circumstances precipitating the crisis. In summary, Labor will not be supporting the bill, but I take the opportunity to note that Labor is willing to work constructively in the parliament on delivering cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-09-07,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:08):  I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Greens today in relation to Senator Leyonhjelm's private members' bill, A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment (Make Electricity GST Free) Bill 2017.


I will start by indicating that we will be supporting this bill. The Greens have been very clear for over a decade now that we don't support a broad-based, blanket, untargeted goods and services tax on the Australian people, especially on low-income Australian people, so we're happy to support Senator Leyonhjelm. Had we had more time or had this gone to committee, we may have talked to Senator Leyonhjelm about how we could target this more specifically—for example, to low-income households or renters. We do feel that there should be some price incentives in place in the electricity market to reflect the externalities of climate change and, for example, the burning of dirty fossil fuels. So, while we would support the removal of a broad-based, untargeted, progressive tax—it just makes life harder for low-income Australians—we do as a party have a very strong view on supporting a price on pollution. We feel that the revenue raised through a price on pollution—such as we saw in this country before it was cynically and ruthlessly removed by Mr Tony Abbott and his Liberal government—is a better way to accurately reflect the prices in the electricity market. So we support a targeted tax like a carbon price and would see the revenue raised from that potentially substituting for the loss of revenues to the Commonwealth for removing a goods and services tax.


Let's be frank about this. We're talking about giving relief, especially to low-income Australians, by removing the GST on power. Let's call it that. Let's just say on electricity bills. Why is it needed? Electricity prices under this Liberal government, as we heard in this chamber yesterday, have nearly doubled. So much for the sky falling in when the carbon price was introduced in this place. In fact, since it was removed, the little daisy ring that was run in the other place with Mr Greg Hunt and others celebrating the loss of the carbon price because we suddenly were going to relieve Australian households of this burden of their higher electricity bills has proven to be hollow and laughable. So we have this situation now in our energy market where energy prices are going through the roof. We're having political spats over the distribution mix of power with base loads.


Ironically, we've had a debate in this place in recent days about the government and its messaging about the Labor Party and their pre-1989 eastern European economic and industrial policies—their socialist and communist policies. It's actually the Liberal Party that's looking to interfere in the capitalist energy market by talking about buying coal-fired power stations or coalmines or by giving low-interest loans, which the Productivity Commission said in estimates to me was effectively a subsidy to foreign coal barons who want to build new coalmines. So here we have the government looking to implement their own eastern European policies and interfering in the energy market. And for what purpose? Is it really, as the Prime Minister says or Senator Birmingham said in here yesterday, to give us reliability in our energy market here in Australia? There are so many other ways we could have reliability in our energy market, especially in base-load power. Or is it more a cynical political tactic: short-term, self-interested politics for the Liberal government to make sure they don't lose votes in marginal seats in Queensland and New South Wales to One Nation? That's what this is. The climate policy and energy policy in this country at the moment are being dictated by the survival of Mr Malcolm Turnbull and the LNP going into a federal election.


'Too much renewable energy', 'flip it on its head', 'coal is good', 'we need more coal'—as Senator McGrath said in here yesterday, 'coal is good for you'—what is all this nonsense about? What is this messaging, like the Treasurer holding up a piece of coal as a prop in the other place, all about? Call me cynical, but I do live on planet politics, especially while I'm here in Canberra. This is all about a short-term political strategy to not lose votes to One Nation. Since they have been in this place, One Nation have been totally out of the closet about supporting the coal industry. They're climate deniers; they're unafraid. Senator Roberts is out and proud about believing that man-made climate change is rubbish. And he's a big supporter of the coal industry, as are his colleagues. That resonates in parts of Australia, and I understand why that would resonate in towns that rely on employment from coalmines and coal-fired power stations. I totally get that.


I chaired the environment committee that went around the country and took evidence on this. I said at the time that, as politicians, we have a duty to show leadership on transitioning this country away from dirty coal-fired power stations to base loads that we know can be filled with renewable energy. We need a plan to transition those workers, to retrain them. We know that renewable energy is jobs rich, especially when we start looking at the disruption that's coming to the grid around battery storage and household solar, which I have no doubt at all will make the grid virtually redundant in many ways in our lifetimes, possibly even in the next five to 10 years. We are seeing big changes coming to the electricity markets, whether we want them or not.


Let me tell you: it's not about coal; it's actually about people wanting to have energy independence, to not be dependent on the AGLs and the other big companies of the world. As a Greens senator, I get asked about this all the time by people who meet me—it might be a taxi driver or whoever—because it's something we've got in common, and they say: 'Senator, I've got a new household solar system. I looked at it yesterday and I'm generating all this power. Every day, I can't wait to have a look at how much I've been generating.' It's something they have in common with me, as a Green. But often when I get to the bottom of it, what I find really interesting is their motivation for getting the rooftop solar and putting in place new battery storage systems. The motivation is not necessarily that they want to save the planet and reduce emissions; the motivation is they want to be independent of the grid or power companies. It's almost a Tea Party attitude, which I find quite interesting as a Green. They're supporting us, but really what they want is to be independent and to give the big power companies the bird, to say: 'I generate my own power. I can store it. I'm not reliant on you. I don't want to pay your bloody fees, and this and that.' Good. If it's good for the planet, then I support that.


These changes are coming and I reckon they're unstoppable. We're already seeing millions of household solar power systems operating around this country, and there are more to come. Why are we having this debate about the federal government interfering in the market by buying coal-fired power stations? Why are we having this debate about governments supporting some of the biggest coal mines in the world, like those being proposed for the Galilee Basin in Queensland? It's politics. It's cynical, short-term politics.


But if you walk down the street in any town in this country and you ask people what they really care about, and what they want politicians to do, they want us to help solve their problems. They want new ideas. They want us to actually be constructive, and they will tell you that electricity prices are too high. Of course, it's a very complex debate as to why that's the case, but we support the intention of this bill, which is to remove GST and give some relief to households. To give relief to renters, who rely on landlords to put in place energy efficiency systems or renewable energy systems, which won't necessarily happen if those costs are being covered by their renters, and to give relief to low-income Australians, who may not necessarily be able to afford their own home. Even those Australians who can afford to buy their own home and who are suffering from mortgage stress, and we know there are way too many of those for our liking, are struggling with power prices.


The flipside of that is that we, as the Greens party, want to balance incentives that allow people to put in place their own renewable energy generation systems, or move the generation mix in this country towards clean renewable energy. There have to be some pricing signals to make that happen. If you own your own home and you're wealthy, or you're an investor who owns up to eight homes, as can be the case in this country—we would have liked to have seen GST relief on power prices being targeted to those who directly need it, but we haven't got the time to go into that. If we truly want to make an impact on global warming, then we need to do a lot more than we already are. So while we support removing GST, we would also support very strong action on curbing the emissions that are leading to global warming.


I know some senators watch 24-hour news coverage—ABC News 24, or Sky if you're in the Liberal Party. If you go back to your offices, have a look at your screens. You're likely to see images of the biggest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic, Hurricane Irma, and tracking charts. This is just a week after Hurricane Harvey, which is now officially the biggest natural disaster in US history. What have those two events got in common? It's a bit more simple than most people think. Hurricane Harvey, before it made landfall, was expected to diminish in size and intensity, but it didn't do that—quite the opposite. Against all expectations and against all modelling, it increased in intensity just before it made landfall. Why did it do that? The answer is simple—because of warming oceans. The ocean temperatures were much higher than predicted. 


Sadly, for those people in Haiti and Cuba and other countries that are getting battered, Irma is a storm that meteorologists never thought could happen. It has exceeded the maximum theoretical speeds in their models. Why? The same reason—ocean temperatures are higher than their models could have predicted. What is it about warming oceans and hurricanes? What is it about warming oceans and coral bleaching? What is it about warming oceans and floods and droughts? The oceans dictate our global weather systems, and warming oceans are directly correlated to rising global carbon emissions. While Irma is making its way to the US—very possibly to break another US record since climate records were begun, with two category 4 hurricanes hitting in the same year, let alone in back-to-back weeks, with unprecedented wind speeds and rainfall—another two storm systems are now forming behind Irma that look like they are also going to become hurricanes. This is literally off the charts.


As I found during the recent Senate committee visit to the Great Barrier Reef, there are unprecedented warming events in our oceans. I support our climate scientists and all the great work they do, even though this government has tried to sack the lot of them in the last couple of years, but their modelling predicted that these kinds of events couldn't happen till 2040 or 2050. They're happening now. This is global warming happening now. What are we doing about it? Even if we meet our Paris global emissions targets, or have even deeper cuts to global emissions leading into Paris—I suppose even the most optimistic of us don't necessarily believe that could happen—we're still going to get 15 years of warming oceans locked in from our current emissions trajectory. Think of what is happening around the world now, including in our own country. We have mortality to half the Barrier Reef, one of the biggest living organisms on the planet, because of warming oceans. You can stick your head in the sand, but I challenge every senator in here to go and stick their head under the water at the Great Barrier Reef and see what is happening. You can't avoid seeing the effects of global warming. 


So, while we're talking about the need to put policies in place to provide relief to low-income Australians, we need to be very clear that we need legislation and the right incentives, the right price signals, to reflect the externality that is climate change and the horrific damage it's doing all around the world. We have heard a lot about Harvey in the US, and rightly so—the damage bill is in the hundreds of billions of dollars already. You can laugh about climate change and stick your head in the sand, but these events cause economic damage as well as social and environmental damage. We have seen in Bangladesh 1,200 people die from record floods. This is not just happening in Australia and in the Atlantic; this is happening all around the world. We need a system that correctly prices the externality of climate change if we're going to fix it.


I will now finish up—probably much to all senators' relief—and say we'll be supporting this bill. The Greens would still like to see a price on carbon that reflects the damage that climate change is doing to our environment, to our communities and to our economy.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  Australian households are hurting. Politicians are to blame, and politicians can relieve this pain right here, right now. Household electricity bills across the country have risen by around eight per cent each year over the past decade, and household electricity bills have risen by a further 20 per cent just over the last quarter. This is crippling. Charities have reported that thousands of low-income households have had to go without heating this winter because of unaffordable electricity—thousands of households, including our sick and elderly.


We will never know just how many deaths this winter can be attributed to unaffordable electricity, but the number would be substantial. And of course any number is unacceptable in a developed, resource-rich country like Australia. Thousands of households will go without cooling this summer, and more deaths will be the result. I challenge those who feel moral superiority when they cheer for policies that make electricity more expensive to acknowledge these deaths, and I challenge them to acknowledge their role in these deaths. You might say that this is the greatest moral challenge of our time.


Politicians are to blame for the pain of exorbitant electricity prices. Two decades ago, Australia enjoyed the lowest electricity prices in the world. Now Australians pay the highest electricity prices in the world. How is this possible? It is possible because, over the past two decades, no large-scale generators of reliable base-load power have been built in Australia. This is despite the fact that there has been considerable economic and population growth and the fact that the construction costs of power plants—along with their fuel, coal and gas—have gone down, although gas prices have currently gone up. This investment drought has been caused by politicians. They have implemented renewable energy targets that force coal-fired generators to pay small-scale, intermittent generators whatever it takes for their market share to grow. They have imposed carbon taxes with the specific purpose of driving out coal-fired base-load generators. Even now, with the carbon tax gone, they threaten carbon pricing that, depending on the carbon price involved, could drive the lowest-cost coal-fired power plant to bankruptcy. To top it off, the politicians have maintained an evidence-free ban on nuclear power.


Politicians can relieve the pain of exorbitant prices right here, right now. The building of new large-scale generators of dispatchable power will take years and will require either the suspension of the renewable energy target and a guarantee that there will be no carbon pricing or the legalisation of nuclear power. But we can relieve some of the pain of high electricity prices right now by making electricity GST free. My bill before the Senate makes electricity GST free. I propose that the Senate votes on this straightforward bill within the hour.


Electricity is an essential service like water and should be treated the same for tax purposes. I challenge any politician who plans to vote against making electricity GST free to declare that electricity is not an essential service; to explain how their constituents can live without electricity, which is more than likely what some of them will have to do this summer or, indeed, each summer until more generators are constructed; and to explain why water should be GST free but electricity should not.


Making electricity GST free will immediately save a typical household around $200 each year. For any politician planning to vote against it, please stop wringing your hands about the punishing electricity bills facing your constituents and admit that you just do not care. For those who use the excuse that the state governments would receive around $2 billion less in GST grants if we made electricity GST free, might I point out: each state budget other than Western Australia's is in surplus, and WA gets so little of its GST back that its deficit would be little changed. Together the state governments enjoy annual revenue of around $300 billion. So, if you plan on voting against making electricity GST free, please explain why you think it is that the state governments rather than the people should not struggle.


If you care about everyday Australians as they struggle with electricity prices created by politicians, I believe you must vote to make electricity GST free. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2017-09-07,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (09:37):  I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for his bill, which indicates a desire to address what is one of the most significant issues facing Australians—consumers not only in a residential sense but also in a small business sense. I note news announced today that Cafe Buongiorno at Modbury in South Australia, which is a cafe I have frequented a number of times over the years, has announced that this will be its last week of operation. It is looking to close down because of high electricity costs.




Senator Farrell:
  Yes, because you sold ENSA.




Senator FAWCETT:
  We are seeing a number of businesses impacted as they come off contract and get bill shocks as they go onto higher electricity costs. I note Senator Farrell interjecting from the other side. I highlight to Senator Farrell that one of the drivers of the high electricity costs that people are paying is because of our market design with the peaking gas plants that come in at the end of the bidding cycle and all of the other providers that get lifted up to that point. It's been acknowledged in the last couple of weeks that, when Senator Farrell's side were in government, they were warned that the approvals they gave for the export of LNG would drive up domestic prices if domestic supply was constrained and yet they did nothing about that. Senator Farrell is from the Labor Party in South Australia, where we've seen the Labor Premier embark upon what he called one of the greatest experiments in energy production and we've seen a reckless pursuit of renewable energy to the point where the excessive amount of wind power has undermined the market for thermal-based base load. So we've seen the state government refuse to keep open the Northern Power Station at Port Augusta, which would have been a cost that pales in comparison to what they now have to do, which is to commission a large fleet diesel generators in order to provide some kind of reliable power for South Australia in the approaching summer. The reckless ideology of the Labor Party in this regard, as evidenced in South Australia and as we see in the policies that have been enacted by Labor in the past and have been promised should they ever—heaven forbid!—return to power in Australia, will only worsen the kind of situation we currently see.


I've said in this place a number of times that one of the reasons these things occur is we have far too many lawyers in the parliament as opposed to engineers. If we had more engineers—people who understand systems engineering and the interface of mechanical, technical and systems-related things—instead of saying that you could push on with more renewables you would understand there is a cost to having renewables because of the interface with the electricity system and the requirement for frequency stability as well as being able to dispatch. AEMO came out with their report looking at a range of these issues. My report to Senator Leyonhjelm is that removing the GST from electricity, whilst there is a very short-term gain, does nothing to actually change the long-term structural issues causing the drive-up in price.


Let me come to a number of specific things in relation to his bill and what we need to be doing moving forward. Firstly, from a technical perspective, as Senator Leyonhjelm should know, section 53 of the Constitution requires that bills dealing with the appropriation of revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, need to originate in the House of Representatives. From a purely technical perspective, whilst it's a good idea, this is actually the wrong chamber to introduce it. From a purely technical perspective, even if it were to pass, it would not necessarily have the desired outcome. Putting that aside though, he's indicated that this could result in a change of around $200 for an average household. The modelling shows that the actions the government has taken in a range of areas—such as specifically requiring that the retailers contact customers to make sure they are aware of the best deal available to them—could save the average household around $500 a year and in some cases up to $1,500 a year. Whilst I hear Senator Leyonhjelm's case that this is a simple fix, I would point out that, technically, it may not work and there are other measures that the government is putting in place that will provide savings of a far greater magnitude than what Senator Leyonhjelm is proposing.


Lastly, when it comes to the GST, it is not explicitly a federal issue. Changes to the GST actually require the agreement of all the states. The deal we are working on to get the providers to provide that incentive and information to consumers to save them $500 to $1,500 a year is something that is within the power of the federal government. What Senator Leyonhjelm is proposing is not explicitly within the federal government's power. It would require the agreement of the states. Therefore, even were something to pass here in the appropriate chamber, there is no guarantee that the states would agree. In the time it would take to get that agreement, there are other things we can be putting in place.


One of those is the issue of a limited merits review. In 2008 the then Labor government allowed the network providers to challenge decisions that were taken around pricing. I think some 32 out of 51 decisions of the Australian Energy Regulator have been challenged. A research note by a major broker said investors are getting this as a free option, with the upside being that it brings forward a dividend surprise. In other words, every time they are able to challenge a decision of the regulator, it actually brings forward more profit and more dividend to those network providers.


Given that one of the largest components of the price which is paid by residents and commercial users of electricity in Australia is the network cost, then one of the actions this Senate should be taking is on the limited merits review. In fact, we are dealing with an issue right now where we are seeking to have that limited merits review removed, which is in line with other things such as postal, water et cetera. We are seeking to do that now. We're seeking to do it quickly, and yet we will have a vote in this place later today as to how the Senate deals with the government's legislation to remove that limited merits review. I call on Senator Leyonhjelm and others on the crossbench, and the opposition: when that comes up for a vote today you should be supporting the government to bring that legislation forward as soon as possible, rather than referring it off to a committee. Bring it forward so that we can take action now to bring electricity supply, in terms of the networks, into line with things like water networks so that the people who are providing that can't make additional profit by using what brokers in the system call 'the free option to them', which increases their profits at the expense of the Australian public.


Since 2008, when it was established by the Labor government, it is calculated that those 32 out of 51 decisions taken against the Australian Energy Regulator have resulted in some $6.5 billion of additional costs being passed on to consumers in their electricity bills. We are looking to make sure that the Australian Energy Regulator can make informed and sensible decisions that can't be challenged as a free option. There's still a judicial review if the networks want to go to that extent—if they think there is inequity or unfairness in the decision. But the limited merits review has cost consumers some $6.5 billion since it was established by the Labor government in 2008. We wish to remove it. There is a vote coming before this chamber today which will provide a passage forward for the government to take that action, and I will be calling on Senator Leyonhjelm to help us to take those steps to address something that is a substantial component of the electricity price that goes to consumers.


More broadly, we also need to look at market design—the whole concept of how we retail electricity in Australia, or, in fact, how the providers put it into the National Electricity Market. If you look at other nations, other models and other ways of pricing that, there are different models that could put significant downward pressure on electricity. That's something that we need to be looking at, as well as the other levers that talk about how renewable energy is introduced into the system.


As I've looked at the Finkel report and the modelling that's been done out of that, I believe the government has been right to adopt the 49 recommendations there. But we also need to understand whether the optimum modelling has been done around that last recommendation and where we should be moving to. Finkel himself said it could take a number of months for the government to examine what was proposed there, to look at alternative modelling and to understand how best to move forward in that area. Personally, I believe that the market in Australia, without the extent of government interference that we've seen—particularly with the state governments pushing for the very high renewable targets—would have delivered more investment in base-load energy over the last couple of decades and would have been providing Australia with more reliable and affordable power than we currently have.


What are some of those policies? Well, the opposition has put forward that it wants a 45 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030 and a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. It is talking about forcing the closure of coal-fired power plants. This is despite people, like AEMO, looking and saying that that rapid closure is actually going to ramp up costs as well as decrease reliability.


People who want those really high renewable targets have to look no further than South Australia to see that what Premier Weatherill called his great big experiment has in fact failed. Here we are in a First World country, with supplies of coal, gas and uranium—if we had the courage to move down that path—and yet we had state-wide blackouts in this nation. The cost to South Australian businesses was huge.




Senator Farrell:
  It was a catastrophic storm! Come on, be honest!




Senator FAWCETT:
  Senator Farrell interjects again with the normal claim that comes from South Australian Labor, which is that there was a storm. Well, Senator Farrell, you know that my background was as an experimental test pilot. I was dealing with the design of systems that had to be able to cope with a range of environmental factors. When you design an aircraft well, it can cope with turbulence and interruptions without failing either structurally or in terms of its systems. Those trigger events highlight good design or poor design.


And so the fact that there was a storm in South Australia merely points to the fact that the system was poorly designed; it had low redundancy; and it didn't take account of the failure modes. Basic systems engineering has a thing called failure mode criticality effects analysis. I would argue that nobody ever did the level of systems engineering to understand what the failure modes were in the South Australian system as a result of the rapid increase of renewable, unreliable, intermittent energy as opposed to reliable, frequency-stable, base-load energy. So don't come into this place and say that it was a storm. The storm was merely a trigger event. The storm was merely a trigger event that highlighted the poor system design that resulted because of the policies that have seen that incredible growth in renewable energy in South Australia.


Having seen that there, why would we then impose that same kind of system instability and poor design on the whole nation? Yet that's what federal Labor's plans are for Australia. Labor said in its climate action plan that it would kickstart the closure of coal-fired power stations. It teamed up with the Greens to pass a motion that would encourage the closure of coal-fired power stations, saying:


The question is not if coal fired power stations will close, but how quickly …


This would lead, as we've seen in Victoria and other places, to the destruction of jobs in Australia's coal-fired plants and thousands of jobs elsewhere. The Australian Energy Market Commission has said that the forced closure policy could cost up to $24 billion around Australia. In Hazelwood, in Victoria, as a result of their closure, energy companies AGL and Energy Australia have increased bills by up to $135 in 2017. In South Australia, as a result of pushing out the Northern Power plant, at Port Augusta, contract prices for large industrial users jumped 50 per cent, and spot market prices tripled in the months following.


So there are a range of issues with taking the view that we can just push renewables without doing the engineering behind it and realising that there is a cost associated with the integration of renewables. Doing that systems engineering, understanding the failure modes and understanding the true costs of those inputs, is what we need to be considering as we look to see whether we would expand the RET. Consequently, we should also be considering what we can achieve in terms of optimising the three critical parameters that we're concerned about, which are energy price, keeping it low; energy reliability; and emissions. The whole concept of modern use of big data in modelling is to test those various parameters and variables and iterate your modelling until you come up with the optimal mix. I would lay odds that the answer would not be a 50 per cent renewable target, as is being pushed by the ideologues. As the Prime Minister has said, rather than engineering, it's ideology and in some cases idiocy that have brought us to this point.


I will come back to Senator Leyonhjelm's bill. As I said, this is not the chamber. If it's to do with appropriation and taxation it needs to come into the other place. You've quoted $200. Some of the interim steps that the government is seeking, around the dealing with retailers, could save families orders of magnitude more than that—$500 to $1,500.


Importantly, in terms of things that this chamber can do, today there will be a vote in this chamber about how we deal with the limited merits review. The indications are that those opposite want to push it off to a committee and kick it down the road, as opposed to dealing with it today. I would challenge them: if they are concerned about the of closure of businesses, like Buongiorno Cafe in Modbury, and if they are concerned about the impact of prices that are impacting families in South Australia then they will be voting with the government today to enable us to deal with the limited merits review, given that network costs are one of the most significant inputs to the costs paid by consumers and businesses in Australia. So I won't be supporting Senator Leyonhjelm's bill, not because I don't share his concern about electricity prices, but because technically this is not the chamber and because there are other measures that we could be dealing with today that could have a far greater impact on prices that go to Australian consumers.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2017-09-07,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:56):  I rise to speak on the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment (Make Electricity GST Free) Bill 2017. I'll detail in a moment why Labor, regrettably, Senator Leyonhjelm, will oppose this bill.


However, before I get onto that, I think I do need to respond to some of the absolute misrepresentations made to the chamber by Senator Fawcett. I start by making this observation: I understand why Senator Brandis often attacks South Australia and its electricity system, but I don't understand why a South Australian Senator, even a Liberal Senator, would attack South Australia. He knows full well why we have problems with electricity in South Australia. We have problems with electricity in South Australia because his government—the Olsen government—after promising not to sell the electricity service in South Australia reversed that decision and sold the electricity system in South Australia. That was the start of all of South Australia's electricity problems.




Senator McGrath:
  It's all Playford's fault, isn't it!




Senator FARRELL:
  No, it isn't. I will take that interjection. Tom Playford understood why, in a monopoly situation for electricity, we needed to have a government-controlled electricity system. So in 1946, with the support of the federal Chifley government, he nationalised the South Australian electricity system. That system provided the cheapest and most efficient electricity system in this country. All that went out the window when the Liberals in South Australia sold that monopoly. That's when our problems started with electricity. If that decision had not been made—if Senator Xenophon hadn't supported the second reading speech to allow that bill to proceed—then we would not have the problems that we have today.


I happened to be in Adelaide on the night of the storm that Senator Fawcett was talking about. That was the worst storm in our history. Anybody who'd gone out to the north of Adelaide would understand the catastrophic effect of that storm that night. To connect that catastrophic storm with more serious problems in the electricity market is an absolute misrepresentation, and I suspect that even Senator Fawcett knows that because, if he had been in town that day, he'd recall just how bad the weather was. I was in Clare the day after the storm, and there was one street where you could not go in any direction because massive trees had been blown over. It was a catastrophic storm, and the fact that the Liberals continue to make reference to that in relation to electricity prices is an outrage. I'm sure Senator Bernardi would agree with me in respect of that.


But we are not here today to talk about the misrepresentations by the Liberal Party—I know Senator Bernardi knows a lot about that. As noted in the explanatory memorandum, A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment (Make Electricity GST Free) Bill 2017 would make the supply of electricity GST free. This would commence from the first day of the quarter following royal assent. There are two important points from the explanatory memorandum that I will address:


… this Bill will make electricity GST-free irrespective of the views of State and Territory Governments. The enactment of this Bill will override the commitment, previously legislated in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and the A New Tax System (Managing the GST Rate and Base) Act 1999, to only vary the base of the GST with the unanimous support of the State and Territory Governments.


…   …   …


GST revenues granted to the State and Territory Governments would fall by around $2 billion each year …


The Senate dealt with the issue of GST modification only a few months ago. At that time, Labor noted that parliament should be the end of the process, not the start. It's a point we have been clear on in the past. At the time, Senator Gallagher said:


We think in all fairness, considering how important the GST is for states and territories, and indeed the agreement that exists between the Commonwealth and the states and territories on GST arrangements, that these discussions about how this should be done and when it should be done needs to happen with all of those parties but also needs to be done at the start of the process, not at the end of it here in this chamber.


This goes to the heart of the process for changing the GST. The GST may be levied by the Commonwealth, but the revenue from the GST is distributed to the states and territories. This arrangement is set out in the Intergovernmental Agreement—or IGA—on Federal Financial Relations. Clause A4(c)i provides that the standing Council on Federal Financial Relations, chaired by the Commonwealth Treasurer, must approve 'changes to the GST base and rate'. Clause A6 of that agreement requires that any such agreement be unanimous. Whilst it is true that it can be difficult to gain the unanimous support of the state, territory and Commonwealth governments, this is a matter of due process and good faith. If the process is not followed, it could potentially allow any government, present or future, to ride roughshod over revenue for states and territories.


Whether you like the GST or not, this bill will remove roughly $31 billion of revenue from the states and territories over the next 10 years, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office costings attached to the explanatory memorandum. It goes without saying that the premiers and chief ministers of those states and territories will be the first to let you know which schools, hospitals and services will be hit by the sudden collapse in revenue. Some legal commentary has suggested that the Commonwealth would be legally free to disregard the IGA and amend the GST legislation unilaterally. That is the presumption on which this bill is also based. Even if this happens to be the case, the inherent imposition and purpose of the goods and services tax is underpinned by good faith and intergovernmental cooperation.


We can spare ourselves the lengthy discussion about horizontal fiscal equalisation, but I take this opportunity to point out that Labor deeply understands the complexity and challenges of the GST. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, recently outlined Labor's Fair Share for WA Fund. Labor would invest $1.6 billion in Western Australia in the first budget of a Shorten Labor government—which is looking closer and closer, and I'm sure Senator Sterle would be delighted to hear that news and for that to happen. That would bring Western Australia's funding up to the equivalent of 70c in the dollar, up from the current 33c.


I re-emphasise the importance of agreement. The job-creating infrastructure projects that would flow would be decided in agreement with the Western Australian government on the advice of local businesses and the community. On that basis alone, we cannot support the bill as a matter of due process. We would also add that this bill does not address the issues that underpin the Australian energy crisis under the present government. Wholesale electricity prices have doubled in the four years this government has been in power. This is particularly important for businesses for whom this bill has no impact, as GST-taxable businesses are able to claim input tax credits for the GST included in the price of the electricity they consume.


The government refuses to give full and fair consideration to the Finkel review, including the clean energy target. Business groups, environmental groups, unions, industry and stakeholders all believe that the worst outcome for energy consumers and suppliers alike would be the absence of any credible and enduring energy and climate policy in Australia. This bill will not achieve the cheaper, reliable and cleaner energy that households and businesses need. Without reform, Australia will endure higher prices, reduced security, lost investment opportunities and stubbornly high emissions. The Turnbull government stumbles from one energy crisis to another—in fact, they seem to stumble from one crisis to another on a whole range of things. Yes, I know you are agreeing with me there, Acting Deputy President Bernardi. I know that you know that what I'm saying is absolutely true. The Prime Minister may have accomplished his plan to get energy retailers to write letters to customers—what a terrific thing to do—but he is yet to start talking about any real action on implementing a clean energy target to bring electricity prices down for all Australians. Labor has extended the offer to work, in good faith, on an energy policy that is clean and provides certainty for businesses and households.


The Prime Minister spends the majority of his press conferences attacking Labor for the energy crisis his government has presided over, and he refuses to take any serious action on it. Experts, industry and even his own Finkel review have said clearly that it is government policy inaction that is driving up electricity prices and that a CET is the solution to crippling policy paralysis. Even the CEO of Snowy Hydro, a proponent of the Prime Minister's favourite pet project, has called for the government to adopt a CET. Why doesn't the Prime Minister listen to him? I think that's the question.


I respectfully note that Senator Leyonhjelm is not proposing this bill to be a panacea to the electricity crisis, and also has a different view to the circumstances precipitating the crisis. In summary, Labor will not be supporting the bill, but I take the opportunity to note that Labor is willing to work constructively in the parliament on delivering cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy.

 (Tasmania) (10:08):  I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Greens today in relation to Senator Leyonhjelm's private members' bill, A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Amendment (Make Electricity GST Free) Bill 2017.


I will start by indicating that we will be supporting this bill. The Greens have been very clear for over a decade now that we don't support a broad-based, blanket, untargeted goods and services tax on the Australian people, especially on low-income Australian people, so we're happy to support Senator Leyonhjelm. Had we had more time or had this gone to committee, we may have talked to Senator Leyonhjelm about how we could target this more specifically—for example, to low-income households or renters. We do feel that there should be some price incentives in place in the electricity market to reflect the externalities of climate change and, for example, the burning of dirty fossil fuels. So, while we would support the removal of a broad-based, untargeted, progressive tax—it just makes life harder for low-income Australians—we do as a party have a very strong view on supporting a price on pollution. We feel that the revenue raised through a price on pollution—such as we saw in this country before it was cynically and ruthlessly removed by Mr Tony Abbott and his Liberal government—is a better way to accurately reflect the prices in the electricity market. So we support a targeted tax like a carbon price and would see the revenue raised from that potentially substituting for the loss of revenues to the Commonwealth for removing a goods and services tax.


Let's be frank about this. We're talking about giving relief, especially to low-income Australians, by removing the GST on power. Let's call it that. Let's just say on electricity bills. Why is it needed? Electricity prices under this Liberal government, as we heard in this chamber yesterday, have nearly doubled. So much for the sky falling in when the carbon price was introduced in this place. In fact, since it was removed, the little daisy ring that was run in the other place with Mr Greg Hunt and others celebrating the loss of the carbon price because we suddenly were going to relieve Australian households of this burden of their higher electricity bills has proven to be hollow and laughable. So we have this situation now in our energy market where energy prices are going through the roof. We're having political spats over the distribution mix of power with base loads.


Ironically, we've had a debate in this place in recent days about the government and its messaging about the Labor Party and their pre-1989 eastern European economic and industrial policies—their socialist and communist policies. It's actually the Liberal Party that's looking to interfere in the capitalist energy market by talking about buying coal-fired power stations or coalmines or by giving low-interest loans, which the Productivity Commission said in estimates to me was effectively a subsidy to foreign coal barons who want to build new coalmines. So here we have the government looking to implement their own eastern European policies and interfering in the energy market. And for what purpose? Is it really, as the Prime Minister says or Senator Birmingham said in here yesterday, to give us reliability in our energy market here in Australia? There are so many other ways we could have reliability in our energy market, especially in base-load power. Or is it more a cynical political tactic: short-term, self-interested politics for the Liberal government to make sure they don't lose votes in marginal seats in Queensland and New South Wales to One Nation? That's what this is. The climate policy and energy policy in this country at the moment are being dictated by the survival of Mr Malcolm Turnbull and the LNP going into a federal election.


'Too much renewable energy', 'flip it on its head', 'coal is good', 'we need more coal'—as Senator McGrath said in here yesterday, 'coal is good for you'—what is all this nonsense about? What is this messaging, like the Treasurer holding up a piece of coal as a prop in the other place, all about? Call me cynical, but I do live on planet politics, especially while I'm here in Canberra. This is all about a short-term political strategy to not lose votes to One Nation. Since they have been in this place, One Nation have been totally out of the closet about supporting the coal industry. They're climate deniers; they're unafraid. Senator Roberts is out and proud about believing that man-made climate change is rubbish. And he's a big supporter of the coal industry, as are his colleagues. That resonates in parts of Australia, and I understand why that would resonate in towns that rely on employment from coalmines and coal-fired power stations. I totally get that.


I chaired the environment committee that went around the country and took evidence on this. I said at the time that, as politicians, we have a duty to show leadership on transitioning this country away from dirty coal-fired power stations to base loads that we know can be filled with renewable energy. We need a plan to transition those workers, to retrain them. We know that renewable energy is jobs rich, especially when we start looking at the disruption that's coming to the grid around battery storage and household solar, which I have no doubt at all will make the grid virtually redundant in many ways in our lifetimes, possibly even in the next five to 10 years. We are seeing big changes coming to the electricity markets, whether we want them or not.


Let me tell you: it's not about coal; it's actually about people wanting to have energy independence, to not be dependent on the AGLs and the other big companies of the world. As a Greens senator, I get asked about this all the time by people who meet me—it might be a taxi driver or whoever—because it's something we've got in common, and they say: 'Senator, I've got a new household solar system. I looked at it yesterday and I'm generating all this power. Every day, I can't wait to have a look at how much I've been generating.' It's something they have in common with me, as a Green. But often when I get to the bottom of it, what I find really interesting is their motivation for getting the rooftop solar and putting in place new battery storage systems. The motivation is not necessarily that they want to save the planet and reduce emissions; the motivation is they want to be independent of the grid or power companies. It's almost a Tea Party attitude, which I find quite interesting as a Green. They're supporting us, but really what they want is to be independent and to give the big power companies the bird, to say: 'I generate my own power. I can store it. I'm not reliant on you. I don't want to pay your bloody fees, and this and that.' Good. If it's good for the planet, then I support that.


These changes are coming and I reckon they're unstoppable. We're already seeing millions of household solar power systems operating around this country, and there are more to come. Why are we having this debate about the federal government interfering in the market by buying coal-fired power stations? Why are we having this debate about governments supporting some of the biggest coal mines in the world, like those being proposed for the Galilee Basin in Queensland? It's politics. It's cynical, short-term politics.


But if you walk down the street in any town in this country and you ask people what they really care about, and what they want politicians to do, they want us to help solve their problems. They want new ideas. They want us to actually be constructive, and they will tell you that electricity prices are too high. Of course, it's a very complex debate as to why that's the case, but we support the intention of this bill, which is to remove GST and give some relief to households. To give relief to renters, who rely on landlords to put in place energy efficiency systems or renewable energy systems, which won't necessarily happen if those costs are being covered by their renters, and to give relief to low-income Australians, who may not necessarily be able to afford their own home. Even those Australians who can afford to buy their own home and who are suffering from mortgage stress, and we know there are way too many of those for our liking, are struggling with power prices.


The flipside of that is that we, as the Greens party, want to balance incentives that allow people to put in place their own renewable energy generation systems, or move the generation mix in this country towards clean renewable energy. There have to be some pricing signals to make that happen. If you own your own home and you're wealthy, or you're an investor who owns up to eight homes, as can be the case in this country—we would have liked to have seen GST relief on power prices being targeted to those who directly need it, but we haven't got the time to go into that. If we truly want to make an impact on global warming, then we need to do a lot more than we already are. So while we support removing GST, we would also support very strong action on curbing the emissions that are leading to global warming.


I know some senators watch 24-hour news coverage—ABC News 24, or Sky if you're in the Liberal Party. If you go back to your offices, have a look at your screens. You're likely to see images of the biggest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic, Hurricane Irma, and tracking charts. This is just a week after Hurricane Harvey, which is now officially the biggest natural disaster in US history. What have those two events got in common? It's a bit more simple than most people think. Hurricane Harvey, before it made landfall, was expected to diminish in size and intensity, but it didn't do that—quite the opposite. Against all expectations and against all modelling, it increased in intensity just before it made landfall. Why did it do that? The answer is simple—because of warming oceans. The ocean temperatures were much higher than predicted. 


Sadly, for those people in Haiti and Cuba and other countries that are getting battered, Irma is a storm that meteorologists never thought could happen. It has exceeded the maximum theoretical speeds in their models. Why? The same reason—ocean temperatures are higher than their models could have predicted. What is it about warming oceans and hurricanes? What is it about warming oceans and coral bleaching? What is it about warming oceans and floods and droughts? The oceans dictate our global weather systems, and warming oceans are directly correlated to rising global carbon emissions. While Irma is making its way to the US—very possibly to break another US record since climate records were begun, with two category 4 hurricanes hitting in the same year, let alone in back-to-back weeks, with unprecedented wind speeds and rainfall—another two storm systems are now forming behind Irma that look like they are also going to become hurricanes. This is literally off the charts.


As I found during the recent Senate committee visit to the Great Barrier Reef, there are unprecedented warming events in our oceans. I support our climate scientists and all the great work they do, even though this government has tried to sack the lot of them in the last couple of years, but their modelling predicted that these kinds of events couldn't happen till 2040 or 2050. They're happening now. This is global warming happening now. What are we doing about it? Even if we meet our Paris global emissions targets, or have even deeper cuts to global emissions leading into Paris—I suppose even the most optimistic of us don't necessarily believe that could happen—we're still going to get 15 years of warming oceans locked in from our current emissions trajectory. Think of what is happening around the world now, including in our own country. We have mortality to half the Barrier Reef, one of the biggest living organisms on the planet, because of warming oceans. You can stick your head in the sand, but I challenge every senator in here to go and stick their head under the water at the Great Barrier Reef and see what is happening. You can't avoid seeing the effects of global warming. 


So, while we're talking about the need to put policies in place to provide relief to low-income Australians, we need to be very clear that we need legislation and the right incentives, the right price signals, to reflect the externality that is climate change and the horrific damage it's doing all around the world. We have heard a lot about Harvey in the US, and rightly so—the damage bill is in the hundreds of billions of dollars already. You can laugh about climate change and stick your head in the sand, but these events cause economic damage as well as social and environmental damage. We have seen in Bangladesh 1,200 people die from record floods. This is not just happening in Australia and in the Atlantic; this is happening all around the world. We need a system that correctly prices the externality of climate change if we're going to fix it.


I will now finish up—probably much to all senators' relief—and say we'll be supporting this bill. The Greens would still like to see a price on carbon that reflects the damage that climate change is doing to our environment, to our communities and to our economy.

 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:54):  I move the amendment circulated in my name:


At the end of the motion, add, “but in respect of the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Abolition of Limited Merits Review) Bill 2017, the bill be referred immediately to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee report by 16 October 2017.”


Just briefly, this amendment is to have the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Abolition of Limited Merits Review) Bill 2017 referred to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee, with a report date of 16 October 2017. 


Just to explain this, while Labor support the bill, our consultation with stakeholders led us to the view that there is merit in holding a short inquiry. The abolition of the limited merits review is a large reform and should be subjected to a process and to proper scrutiny. The limited merits review can be accessed by parties other than network companies—groups like unions and consumer groups—and Labor believe it's important their views are heard by the Senate. The inquiry will be very prompt, with a report back in the first sitting week of October, and will not have any material impact on the work of the Australian Energy Regulator or the broader energy system. I hope that the Senate can support this amendment.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (11:55):  The government doesn't support referring the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Abolition of Limited Merits Review) Bill 2017. The government has a commitment to an affordable, reliable electricity system. To help put downward pressure on electricity prices, the government is taking action on all fronts. With network costs making up around 50 per cent of an average electricity household bill, the abolition of the LMR regime is a key part of the government's plan.


The evidence is clear that the LMR regime has failed consumers, adding $6.5 billion in prices for households and businesses. There has not been a single occasion when the LMR regime has reduced prices for consumers. The process is seen as a free option for network businesses. A recent Macquarie note described LMR, saying currently investors are getting this as a free option, with the upside being it brings forward a dividend surprise. This view was shared by the Council of Australian Governments Energy Council following the review of the limited merits review regime in 2016. The council acknowledged at its 14 December 2016 meeting that the regime was failing and was leading to higher prices for consumers.


Based on the clear facts, there isn't a need to refer this bill to a committee. I note that the shadow minister for climate and energy said on 21 June at a doorstop:


Abolishing the Limited Merits Review we support and there has frankly been too much time wasted over the last 12 months from the Federal Government to actually make that happen. So we are glad it has finally happened.


So the question as to why the opposition is proposing to waste time on a committee is one that the government doesn't understand.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Regional Forest Agreements Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2017 seeks to end the destruction of Australia's native forests, by repealing the Act which enables logging to continue with exemptions from our country's environmental protection laws.


For the past two decades, our native forests have been managed under the banner of ten regional forest agreements (RFAs), established between the federal government and the states.


These agreements cover significant tracts of forest in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia, and New South Wales. 


RFAs were meant to provide long-term forest management to protect these complex ecosystems and ensure the viability of threatened species living in the forests, as well as govern the production of timber from these forests and maintain jobs. They have failed in every regard.


The government has indicated that they intend to 'roll over' the existing 20-year regional forest agreements when they come up for expiry. The lack of rigour and reflection in this position is astounding, and demonstrate that the government does not have any commitment to safeguarding our carbon stores, clean air, water supplies, tourism hot-spots and wildlife habitat.


Let me remind the chamber that the Commonwealth has a duty to protect our environment for all Australians, yet in continuing the regional forest agreements and their exemption from The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act), this government is abrogating that responsibility and allowing an extractive industry to carry out its business with no regard for the long-term damage this does to our forest estate.


Instead of these management regimes which include EPBC Act exemptions, our forests should be subject to the same environmental protections and approval processes that any other extractive industry must adhere to. Logging operations in Australia should not have different rules to mining. 


This Bill would wind up each of the ten RFAs when their expiry dates arrive, with the first occurring in November 2017 with the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement. 


I note that the Tasmanian RFA has been subject to a 'variation', signed on 18 August 2017 by the Prime Minister and the Tasmanian Premier. This was presented to the public as a 'variation' but the actual outcome is a substantial re-writing of the RFA. This was undertaken without any engagement with this Parliament, despite the significance of its extension of the RFA to 2037 and that, in effect, it makes future extensions automatic, into perpetuity.


This Bill is doing the proper thing, where the Government has failed to, in bringing this major aspect of our forest management to the Parliament. 


Industrial logging in public native forests has had its day. It has failed to protect our environment and failed to protect jobs.


The future for our Australian wood products industry lies in a sustainably managed plantation-based industry. 


The industry is already well on the way to relying solely on plantation grown timber and fibre. Eighty-five percent of wood produced in Australia now comes from plantations. Propping up the native forest logging industry flies in the face of market demand for sustainable wood products and fails to envision an industry with jobs that sustain communities in the long-term.


Let us help make this vision for sustainable management of our forests a reality. 


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

  Cyberbullying has been successfully prosecuted under section 474.17 of the Criminal Code. Live-streaming offending conduct, including assaults, may also be captured by Commonwealth offences. During sentencing, a court must take into account any harm suffered by a victim. The Office of the eSafety Commissioner works with social media services to remove cyberbullying material. The government has also initiated programs addressing cyberbullying and online activities, including the Australian Federal Police's ThinkUKnow program, which provides cybersafety education to school students, parents and teachers, covering online grooming, sexting, cyberbullying and general online safety, and the e-safety office's online safety, education and complaints process for young people who experience cyberbullying.

Senator McGRATH:
  The Australian government provides fee relief for families; however, it does not run childcare centres, employ staff for those centres or set their fees. The case brought by a child care union seeks pay rises of between 14 and 49 per cent for childcare workers and early childhood teachers in long day care centres and preschools, on the basis that they are not receiving equal pay for work of equal or comparable value. The decision to award wage increases is a matter for the Fair Work Commission, not the government. The government is carefully monitoring the case and has made submissions to assist the Fair Work Commission with the interpretation of the Fair Work Act's equal pay provisions.

  Labor absolutely stands with early childhood professionals in this country, but we can't support this motion because of some of the inaccuracies in its drafting.

Labor is steadfastly supportive of the Big Steps campaign, which calls on the government to fund professional pay for every educator. Early childhood professionals sometimes earn as little as $20 an hour, and Labor, with United Voice, will continue to fight for these professionals to achieve equal pay.

The speeches read as follows—



EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS (TPS LEVIES) AMENDMENT BILL 2017


Today I am introducing the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2017 which amends the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Act 2012. This Bill reflects the Government's commitment to support the international education sector by reducing the financial burden on education providers while maintaining our strong student protections. 


International education is a cornerstone of our economy and Australia's largest service export. It contributed $22.4 billion and 130,000 jobs to our economy last year. The strong growth in the sector shows the Government's policy settings are working to drive success and create job opportunities for Australians. 


This is only possible because of our reputation in providing high quality education and offering unique, strong student protections. 


The Tuition Protection Service (TPS) is an initiative of the Australian Government to assist international students whose education providers are unable to fully deliver their course of study. It is a key mechanism to protect students, and is funded by an annual levy on all international education providers which is credited into the Overseas Students Tuition Fund, or the Fund. The levy comprises an administrative fee and base fee components which are based on a provider's enrolment numbers, a risk rated premium and a special tuition protection component.


Since 2012, the TPS has provided assistance to 1,228 students who have been affected by provider closures, by placing them in alternative courses or refunding their unspent tuition fees.


The success and strong growth of the sector, reflected by an increased number of international student enrolments and a comparatively low number of provider closures, has resulted in the Fund reserves increasing sharply. 


The balance of the Fund has already passed the original target amount recommended by the Australian Government Actuary and the TPS Advisory Board in 2013. The balance in the Fund is forecast to exceed the upper target unless changes are made to current TPS levy settings. It is important to retain industry commitment to the TPS and to appropriately recognise international education providers that are managing risk effectively and contributing to stable growth in the sector.


The TPS Director has taken action to address this issue by reducing the risk rated premium component of the TPS levy to slow the growth of the Fund. However, the risk rated premium is calculated based on the risk profile of each provider. Further reducing this component would result in the loss of an effective price signal to higher risk providers, and would not benefit low risk providers who are exempt from this component of the levy. Low risk providers pay proportionately more of the administrative and base fees, as the higher number of enrolments in these education providers has a significant multiplier effect on the fees collected. Further reductions to the risk rated premium would also give little incentive to providers to reduce their overall level of risk.


A reduction to the current administrative and base fees will ensure the Fund remains within the target range of $30 million to $50 million, as recommended by the Australian Government Actuary and endorsed by the TPS Advisory Board.


If we are to continue to be one of the most sought after study destinations in the world, we must continue to improve the effectiveness of our consumer protection mechanisms. 


This Bill will enable the Minister for Education and Training to proactively manage the Fund in response to changing market conditions, by setting the administrative and base fees through a legislative instrument. 


This will ensure that international education providers are appropriately recognised for managing risk effectively, while ensuring sufficient reserves are maintained in the Fund to meet future claims. The Minister will still be able to increase the fees to an 'upper limit' set at the current legislated levels to ensure adequate tuition protection, if required.


I turn now to the specific measures which will reduce the burden on the sector while maintaining our world class student protections.


The Bill contains new measures to require the Minister to set the administrative and base fee amounts for the 2018 calendar year through a legislative instrument. The Minister must do this by 31 December 2017 for the new fee amounts to take effect for the 2018 levy collection. 


The new amounts will help reduce the levy collections in a way that appropriately recognises international education providers managing risk effectively, while ensuring the Fund remains viable to meet any future claims. 


A further amendment to the TPS Levies Act gives the Minister discretion to make a new legislative instrument for the administrative and base fee amounts in following calendar years, that is, for 1 January 2019 onwards. It is anticipated that this will be a one-off reduction to the Fund and the fee settings will not be updated every year. If the Minister chooses not to make a legislative instrument in later years, the current instrument will be indexed annually until a new one is made. This will give providers some stability, as these amounts will not have to change each year.


The Minister must have regard to the sustainability of the Fund and any other matters in setting the administrative and base fee components through a legislative instrument.


To give certainty to providers, the Bill will impose an 'upper limit' which the Minister cannot surpass in setting the administrative and base fee amounts. The limit is set at the current indexed legislated levels. This amendment provides transparency and assurance to the sector by limiting the Minister's power to determine dollar amounts for the administrative and base fee components of the TPS levy through a legislative instrument. 




The Minister must cause the administrative and base fee components to be published in any manner he or she considers appropriate. 


This measure will ensure that the administrative and base fee amounts for each year are publicly available to providers to assist in planning their finances.


In today's fast growing international sector, Australia's third largest export, the Government must play a proactive role in maintaining a healthy Fund balance to protect overseas students' investment in their education. 


This Bill will ensure that Australia maintains strong student protection mechanisms, appropriately recognise low risk providers and contributes to the stable growth of the international education sector. This will strengthen the industry's confidence in the TPS, and will ultimately result in better outcomes for students.


This Bill delivers on the objectives of the National Strategy for International Education 2025 for developing Australia's role as a global leader in education, training and research through strengthening a fundamental student protection mechanism. 


EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT BILL 2017


I am also introducing the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2017 which amends the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, or ESOS Act,as a consequence of the changes to be made to the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Act 2012, or TPS Levies Act. It builds on the Government's commitment to support the international education sector by reducing the financial burden on education providers while continually improving our student protection mechanisms.


This Bill makes consequential amendments to the ESOS Act to clarify that the TPS Director works out the TPS levy payable by each provider in accordance with the legislative instruments made under the amended TPS Levies Act. This includes legislative instruments made by the Minister to set the administrative and base fee components, and legislative instruments made by the TPS Director to set the risk rated premium and special tuition protection components. 


This Bill gives effect to changes made to the TPS Levies Act to improve the operations of the TPS and ensure the Government has a proactive role in managing the balance in the Fund. 


I commend the Bills.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:48):  Labor support the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2017 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2017. It was Labor that introduced the tuition protection service in response to some of the poor behaviour by providers in the international education market in 2009. Labor acted swiftly to introduce more effective national regulation of Australia's tertiary education sector. The tuition protection service has been well managed and has responded appropriately where required. We are pleased that the levies have remained low, despite a significant increase in international students coming to Australia to study. That could have put pressure on the scheme.


International education is one of the great success stories in Australia. It's good for the economy, our society, and soft diplomacy across the world. In fact, last year international education contributed more than $21 billion to the Australian economy. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act was groundbreaking when it was introduced as it was one of the first pieces of legislation anywhere in the world designed to address the needs of foreign students.


Labor are proud that we have a strong and supportive regulatory system for the nearly 600,000 international students in this country. We believe the measures in this bill are sensible and should be supported. We caution the government on ensuring it does more to protect the rights and financial situation of Australian students. We know that far too many students took on bad VET FEE-HELP debt, and the government took too long to respond. Labor reminds this government to get on with the job of addressing some of the terribly bad debts of these students. A high-quality, well-regulated tertiary education system is an important tool for our future economic success.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Hinch. I've dealt with that.




Senator CAMERON:
  Well, the 'Human Headline' is in again! The 'Human Headline' is there with all the great help that this place needs—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, please resume your seat. Senator Bernardi.




Senator Bernardi:
  I will draw a point of order, because it is inappropriate to refer to senators in this place by anything other than their correct title.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bernardi. I would ask Senator Cameron to withdraw.




Senator CAMERON:
  I withdraw. That was a bit easier than earlier! This is a minister—Senator Nash with an 'N'—who is in absolute policy paralysis and absolutely distracted from operating as a capable minister. She has a total lack of accountability because she cannot even do her job. This is pathetic. Senator Nash has got dual citizenship issues before the High Court and her performance demonstrates why she should have stood aside. She should have done the same as Senator Canavan. Why is it Senator Canavan can stand aside and Senator Nash cannot? There is a huge double standard here. The National Party are so incompetent that they can't ensure that three of their ministers, the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator Canavan and Senator Nash, are actually eligible to be in this place representing their states. The National Party are so incompetent that they are trying to bluff and bluster their way through this whole affair.


This is a minister who has been reduced to a new level of ineffectiveness. The minister has not been very effective since she's been here, but we're now seeing a new low from this minister. Her ineffectuality underscores the National Party. She is unable to answer questions about the pork-barrelling that's going on in New England to try and save the seat of the Deputy Prime Minister, who may not be eligible to be in parliament. They are doing everything they can to cling to power in the lower house, because only one vote stands between them and disaster in the other place.


There are key issues facing rural and regional Australia. They should have ministers there that can concentrate on the issues, not ministers that are so distracted and so sidelined because they may not be eligible to be in this place. People in rural and regional Australia need help on ensuring penalty rates are in place to make sure they can afford a house, help to make sure that the TAFE system in rural and regional Australia is protected, and help to make sure that energy prices are dealt with. This lot cannot deal with any of that. They are so divided, so amateurish, so bad, such a rabble that they can't even get their act together to deal with the key issue of energy prices in this country, which they actually sent the Chief Scientist to go and look at.


The fundamental proposition, the key proposition from the Chief Scientist, was to put a clean energy target in place, yet this rabble of a government can't even get their act together to do that. And now we're seeing projects being announced in New England to try to save the hide of the Deputy Prime Minister—if the High Court determines that he is ineligible to be here. This is a coalition in disarray. This is a coalition that just do not have an answer for the key issues facing Australian people. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-09-07,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:10):  It is often said that, out of the overflow of the heart, so speaks the mouth. And what we have just heard is five minutes of personal denigration, hatred, nastiness—all those sorts of qualities that really are unbecoming of anybody in this chamber, let alone somebody who seeks to portray themselves as a frontbencher and an alternate minister in an Australian government. I just hope the Australian people who might read the Hansard or have listened to this broadcast stop to consider and ask themselves the question: would you really want such a person representing you in the high office of a government ministry?


We on this side are used to these tirades from Senator Cameron, but they do him and the Australian Labor Party a great injustice. What we on this side of the House are continuing to do is deal with the questions—and that is what Senator Nash is doing as well—dealing with the questions and issues confronting the Australian people. The Australian people want their government to be focused on international security—think North Korea. That is what the government's been doing with the Prime Minister in telephone conversations with the President of the United States, and our Minister for Defence has been making a tour of the region to ensure that our international security is guaranteed. What the Australian people want to know is that our national security is guaranteed—think border protection. That is what this government is focusing on: delivering national security for our fellow Australians. What the Australian people want us to be thinking about, talking about and delivering on is security of household budgets, how we can drive down the cost of living for our fellow Australians—think energy cost: the ever-burgeoning cost of energy and electricity for Australian households, Australian small business, Australian farmers and indeed our big manufacturers.


That is why the government is focused on ensuring that these issues are dealt with so that we can in fact undo the legacy issues of the idiotic ideology of the green movement, which has seen the complete compromise of our energy system. All we need to do is look at the hapless Labor government in South Australia, who bragged that on some days they can get 102 per cent of their energy from renewables. Of course, when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow, their energy supply is zero—and they then wonder why they have blackouts. The Australian people also want their government to look at intergenerational fiscal equity—in other words, that we don't pass on a legacy of debt to the next generation, as the Australian Labor Party would have done with their irresponsible promises day after day after day.


These are the issues that Senator Nash, a very capable minister in the coalition government, is dealing with on a day-by-day basis. And what does the Labor Party say? They focus on an unfortunate issue in relation to citizenship, which will be resolved by the High Court in due course. But do you know what the Australian people want? They want Senator Nash—a very capable, competent minister—to keep on with the task of running the country, of governing in the best interests of the Australian people, and not be distracted by this particular issue. Of course, if we were to listen to the Australian Labor Party then the postal survey on whether or not we should change the definition of 'marriage' was going to be thrown out by the High Court. Well, the news is—it was hot off the press about one hour ago—that that prediction by the Australian Labor Party was completely false, and not just by a slim margin. It was 7-0. Once again, the Labor Party, in this area, have sought to play the game of spoiler, to deny the Australian people the opportunity to have a say. We, on this side, are saying: 'We trust the Australian people. We want them to have a say.' There's a great distinction between Labor and the coalition on all these issues. (Time expired)

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-09-07,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:15):  I really wonder if there's any cognition of how desperately in need the Australian people are and how much failure is being demonstrated by this government. I asked a question about the Central Coast of Minister Nash today. On the Central Coast, youth unemployment is now at 17.3 per cent. The national average is a shameful 12.9 per cent, but it is 17.3 per cent on the Central Coast. That is why you'd think an investment in proper training for young people on the Central Coast would be so good. I specifically asked a question today about a grant of $2.7 million that has gone through the Community Development Grants to the Central Coast Group Training Ltd. I would like to put on the record a few detailed remarks about what's going on with that project. 


In 2014, the Abbott government funded this $2.7 million shiny new training facility, supposedly to boost skills and employment opportunities. But, as revealed in the Newcastle Heraldyesterdayby award-winning journalist Joanne McCarthy, a great Central Coast resident herself, the building, which opened in 2016, is almost empty, with only three of the 10 light industrial bays actually operating. The Turnbull and Abbott government's complete waste of tax money is evident not only in the failure to have that operating but in a whole lot of probity questions around it that need to be scrutinised. 


Central Coast Group Training chairman was none other than local Liberal mayor—now disgraced Liberal mayor—of Wyong, Doug Eaton. He is the council candidate who is up for this weekend's local government election as an independent—not endorsed by the Liberal Party, but certainly associated with them. Mr Greg Best is the manager of the Central Coast Training scheme. He was also on the council and very closely aligned with Mr Eaton. On Tuesday night, I spoke in this place about the seriously concerning links between Mr Eaton and Mr Best and their long association with another party called the Save Tuggerah Lakes Party—a puppet party created by Mr Eaton, who's on the record as having invested $1,500, as did his wife; and Mr Best invested $1,500, as did his wife. This is the council situation that's going on in the Central Coast. 


With regard to the building, the Turnbull-Abbott government's decision to pay Mr Eaton's company to build this failed training facility raises serious questions about the conduct of the minister, especially given the site for this facility was leased by council, of course, when none other than Mr Eaton was the mayor himself. There are many more questions, and if I thought it were worth asking them in this place to get answers, I would. But the fact is that what we have seen from the minister is a complete inability to answer anything in any detail about the serious matters that have been raised with her in this place. But she's good at answering one question. When she's asked if they're doing anything wrong, she says, 'I reject that.' Let me put these questions on the record with regard to the Central Coast Group Training facility. Did the former member for Dobell, Ms McNamara, or the minister know that, when the Wyong mayor, Mr Eaton, was the chairman of the Central Coast Group Training, he would financially benefit from this construction? What discussions did the minister have with Mr Eaton about the development? I'm sure these further questions simply won't be answered by those opposite. 


This facility represents, I think, another breach of faith with the people of the Central Coast in the context of these dodgy deals that are being done by the Liberal Party at multiple levels. I join with local community campaigners such as Jo and Laurie Eyes in calling for the Australian National Audit Office to conduct an audit of the Community Development Grants Program and investigate the government's decisions with regard to the Central Coast Group Training and this facility, which remains unattended. That is quite remarkable. I again repeat: with a 12.9 per cent youth unemployment rate on the coast, with a 17.3 per cent youth unemployment rate on the Central Coast, you'd think this place would be absolutely full. But there's something that really smells about this spending of money. If this facility were fulfilling its purpose, you could accept it. But the fact that it's operating at a third of its capacity, at best, is a very, very serious concern.


In the short time that remains to me, I want to put on the record my great concern about the fact that this government continues to say that there are no new commitments to the electorate of New England that have not yet been publicly announced. Well, the minister went on the record here today. We'll be holding her to account on that matter. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-09-07,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:20):  I too rise to take note of Minister Nash's answers to questions today. I said two days ago in this place that I had never been prouder of Minister Nash, and that is even more the case now. I am utterly ashamed of the tactics of those opposite in this matter over the last four days, and I'd like to go through exactly what those opposite have done this week. They have asked 17 questions of Minister Nash over the last four question times. It is absolutely their right to do that, but it is the way they do it and the nastiness and meanness of the intent of this. You can have a look at the questions. Every single day, that very smart and very nasty Labor tactics team have sat down and worked out, 'How do we get her today?'


What they did on Tuesday was ask Senator Nash five questions in a row, and they were very cunning: 'How do we try to make the minister lose her cool? How can we make her look bad? How can we get under her skin? We'll just ask the same question over and over and over again'—questions that Minister Nash answered on 17 August in great detail and that the Attorney-General reinforced on 18 August. So, this is their cunning plan. They had five female senators in this place, one after the other, who got up—Senators O'Neill, Kitching, Pratt, Collins and Bilyk—all asking the same nastily intentioned questions of the minister. The minister was calm, she was graceful and she answered those questions with great dignity. That was Tuesday.


The day before that, they did exactly the same thing. On the Monday, they had Senator Moore to Senator Nash, and Senators McAllister and Polley asking the same questions again, which were repeated five times on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday the Labor tactics team had this bright idea: 'Maybe we'll ask her some questions that are so obscure, one after the other, that she won't be able to answer the questions. We can question her integrity and what else she's doing or what she doesn't know.' So, on Wednesday there were questions not only within her portfolio but outside of her portfolio—five questions again, not seeking in any genuine way to get answers to these questions; it was all about ganging up and being completely horrid to a minister who has done absolutely nothing wrong. She has done absolutely the right thing. She's entitled to be here. Nobody except the Labor Party is suggesting that she is not entitled to be here as a minister. It is only those opposite.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  We are!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  And the Greens as well—I'll take that interjection. She is absolutely entitled to be here. The Solicitor-General has provided advice, and I would remind those in the chamber that his advice was spot on, as we saw today in relation to the same-sex marriage plebiscite.


So, that was Wednesday. And what did that cunning, nasty Labor tactics team do again today? 'Well, let's do what we did yesterday.' While we've got North Korea, high energy prices and other things facing this nation, for four days in a row they thought, 'Let's gang up on Fiona Nash, because we haven't quite beaten her up enough.' Again, there were four questions to her about regional grants, something that it is completely hypocritical for the Labor Party to ask about, because they absolutely, as the minister said, rorted that scheme. There was no pretence of accountability. You've done that four times in a row. All of you should be ashamed.


Another thing I would point out is that I absolutely know that women on this side would never, ever dream of ganging up. If a woman on any side of this chamber were in the situation that Senator Nash is in, we would not think it okay to get together and gang up on another woman just because we're women.


You imagine if we on this side did that to anybody on the other side of this chamber! It would be a national disgrace and a scandal. The fact that the Labor Party—and the Greens—think it is okay to treat a minister of this state in this way, and do it in a way that is directly relevant to her gender, is an absolute disgrace. Nobody else in this place, or even in the media, may have called it out but the tactics are very clear. It makes me utterly ashamed. Again, I'm very, very proud of Senator Nash, who you have mercilessly hounded this week. She has not even raised a sweat, and for that I am very proud to be not only a colleague of hers but also a friend.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-09-07,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:25):  I would agree that in some regards Senator Nash didn't raise a sweat, but that's only because she didn't answer any of the questions. She goaded us and said to ask her about policy, but when we went to policy Senator Nash couldn't answer. The whole reason we had to spend so much time this week focused on Senator Nash—and this is something that Senator Reynolds didn't mention—is that she came in here and announced her dual citizenship five minutes before the Senate shut down last sitting week. The only opportunity we've had in this place to ask questions of Senator Nash has been this week. Absolutely there's been a consistent theme to them, because there's been a consistent nonanswer from Senator Nash.


There really are three parts to this that have been consistent, in my mind: (1) the lack of clarity from Senator Nash about decision making; (2) the difference between Senator Canavan, who stood down, and Senator Nash and the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, who are still holding their ministerial portfolios; and (3) the policy dysfunction and chaos that this government is responsible for.


Today we saw a lack of clarity when it comes to the decision making at the heart of this government and Minister Nash. We had no clarity into how those decisions are being made. It really does appear as if Senator Nash is a minister in name only. The only thing we could point to that has been close to a decision by this government has been the tender going out for roads project in New England, which is going to help only the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce. That's the only thing we could see that this minister has been a part of since it was announced that she has dual citizenship.


Again, we go to the point of being unable to see the difference between Senator Canavan, who stood down, and Senator Nash and the Deputy Prime Minister, who are still holding their ministerial portfolios. The only conclusion you can come to is that they are leading a protection racket for the Deputy Prime Minister. It's clear from the answers that we've seen—and I said earlier in the week that you start to feel a little bit sorry for Senator Nash—that she knows she is doing the wrong thing.


But the thing that really concerns me is the policy dysfunction and chaos. Senator Nash asked us to ask her about policy. We did that. We asked her about energy policy and we asked her about other issues in regard to her portfolio. Senator Reynolds said the questions were a bit unfair because they were too precise. Well, that's exactly what this minister should be across. She couldn't give us a coherent answer on energy. Over the last couple of days, we've asked significant questions about local regional communities, which this minister is responsible for, that she has been unable to answer.


There is another significant thing that goes to the chaos and dysfunction of this government, and we saw this in question time today. Senator Abetz touched on this as well. I think what he said was that he wants to focus on the questions and issues confronting the Australian people. What are the only two recent achievements of this government? They mentioned them both in question time. The only two recent achievements of this government revolve around sending two letters—one about marriage equality, the other one to energy consumers. This is the federal government of Australia. This is their record over recent months: two letters—one about marriage equality and one to energy consumers in regard to power prices. This is the record. This is the federal government of Australia, and this is what it's saying its record has been over recent months.


What's the common link between these two things? It is the weakness of the Prime Minister. The weakness of the Prime Minister is leading to the chaos and dysfunction on policy on his side. He wasn't able to stand up to his backbench when it comes to marriage equality. He was boxed into a corner. His way out of it was saying that we would have a postal survey. That is his record when it comes to marriage equality, something that he says he has believed in for a long time. He is now pursuing this survey for the Australian people. The other one is around energy. Unable to gain a commitment from his backbench about a clean energy target, he is out there looking for distractions. His most recent distraction has been repeated cups of tea. The outcome of them is a letter. That is all the Australian people are going to see from this between now and the end of the year. Power prices are going up. We're paying for an expensive survey because of the weakness and the ineptitude of this Prime Minister. It really is not good enough for the Australian people.


Question agreed to.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:36):  I present the first report on crystal methamphetamine (ice) of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SINGH:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


After the initiation of this inquiry, in March 2015, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Law Enforcement travelled extensively around Australia to hear from community members about the effects that methamphetamine was having on individuals, families and communities across the country. Not only did we focus this inquiry in the capital cities, but we also went to Mt Gambier, to Caboolture, and to areas and communities where people were reaching out for critical support. During this time—it has been quite a lengthy inquiry—we have heard stories of the devastating impact of this drug on particular rural and regional communities. Of course, rural and regional communities not only are at greater risk but they also lack resources and rehabilitation services.


The particular stories that have stuck with me are from parents who are desperate for the opportunity to help their own children—communities who are desperately trying to keep their youth away from the scourge of crystal methamphetamine. For me, the most powerful evidence in this report has been from St Vincent's Hospital, which we visited, both in Sydney and in Melbourne. It showed the impact that it is having on emergency services and on front line staff, with increased violence and new issues arising from a growing number of users. Indeed, the submission provided to this inquiry by St Vincent's highlighted that, as a nation, we have one of the highest rates of methamphetamine use in the world. This places increasing demand on an already stretched health system, because our community is desperately seeking access to treatment and intervention. Everyday Australians who see the devastating impact of methamphetamine use feel quite powerless to help, even to help their own family members. Illicit drug use is being dealt with through a three-pillar policy—that is, demand reduction, supply reduction and harm reduction—with prevention being a central theme across those three pillars. Those things need to be looked at, particularly harm reduction, because harm reduction practices that follow best practice and are evidence based should be an important part of any national drug strategy. Indeed, they are critical to the long-term strategies across the board to minimise the impact of drug and alcohol abuse.


The report that I tabled is our first report. There will be a final report, which will go into a lot more detail, with recommendations around rehabilitation and treatment services, whereas this report has a much stronger focus on law enforcement. Law enforcement, or supply reduction—which is one of the three pillars—is very important and is obviously a part of this committee's inquiry. The committee made eight key recommendations. We acknowledge the work the government is already doing and has been doing, in relation to the National Ice Taskforce and the National Ice Action Strategy, since this inquiry started. Overall, as the committee noted, the public's initial response to both the task force and the strategy was very positive. The focus on and funding for a supply-reduction approach and treatment services was supported by a number of commentators and members of the community. But, obviously, it will only work if there is enough funding for it to be successful. Harm-minimisation approaches alone are not seen as being enough. The government needs to approach this very much in a holistic frame, but harm minimisation must certainly be a key part of that. The Public Health Association of Australia went into that in detail, as noted in our report, along with Mental Health Australia, which highlighted links between methamphetamine and mental illness, and I think that is an incredibly important point to make.


We cannot be blind to the fact that new illicit drugs will continue to appear. How we deal with that is what is so important as policymakers—how we have effective policies to protect our community and to support our community into the foreseeable future. The committee learnt of successful strategies that are contingent on the relationships built between health workers and law enforcement, and education providers and the community. It is that partnering that is so important. Those relationships are really critical to ensuring that individuals are diverted before becoming addicted or, if they are addicted, that they receive the necessary treatment. But, unfortunately, all through this inquiry we heard that, if someone who is addicted to crystal methamphetamine chooses to make that decision, whether through a drug-diversion mandated court process or by themselves, often the treatment services are not available; often rehabilitation beds and places are not available for them. That is the hardest thing here, and it is something that this government has to address. Meanwhile, the government now wants to embark on drug-testing welfare recipients. That is just the most ridiculous policy, and all the health professionals have made that very clear. By the same token, the government hasn't even thought about the fact that there aren't enough rehabilitation and treatment services available in the first place. That is the critical issue here that needs to be addressed. These long waiting lists for treatment services are simply exacerbating our community's inability to help their own people. If you are finally ready to deal with something as big as a drug addiction to crystal methamphetamine and you can't get in to any kind of treatment or rehabilitation service then that just shows you how the system is broken.


I do commend, though, the input that the government has made into its National Ice Taskforce and also the National Ice Action Strategy. I also would like to acknowledge not only the work that is happening here but the work that is happening within our region. UNODC, which the law enforcement committee have briefings with from time to time, also plays a key role assisting member states in our region to implement evidence-based drug-use prevention policies and programs to again have, as Australia is slowly starting to, a more harm-minimisation focus, rather than a criminal focus on the end user. I know that UNODC enhances its regional capacities in drug-use prevention, treatment and reintegration by playing a key role in some of our South-East Asian states but also in China. We know that some of the substance which goes into making crystal methamphetamine has been imported from China, and that is an ongoing issue for Border Force and, indeed, our country. I would also like to acknowledge the work the AFP do in trying very hard to stop the importation of crystal methamphetamine but also in dealing with drug syndicates and organised crime to try to put an end to this proliferation of ice in our community.


All in all, I would like to thank the committee members for their input during this inquiry. I look forward to working with them on the next tranche of this inquiry, which will have its focus on drug rehabilitation and treatment services, a key ingredient to fight this ice drug addiction.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-09-07,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:47):  I also rise to speak to this report and to welcome the fact that what we are seeing now is some consideration given to the realities of illicit drug use in Australia. It is a report that really considers the fact that what we are doing when it comes to illicit drugs isn't effective and we need to start considering alternative approaches. We certainly welcome that. We know that the war on drugs isn't a war on drugs; it is a war on people. Those are not just the words of the Australian Greens; in fact, many experts in this area, many drug and alcohol clinicians, many academics and now many law enforcement officers are of the same view.


Ken Lay, for example, a former commissioner in the Victorian police force, made a very strong statement when he was charged with leading the National Ice Taskforce. He said:


We can't arrest our way out of this problem.


He is absolutely right. Ken Lay is not the only law enforcement officer of that view. Mick Palmer, a former AFP commissioner, also strongly believes that, despite the fact that he was responsible for taking a tough-on-drugs approach to illicit drug use, in fact in many areas it was counterproductive. He is now a strong advocate for harm minimisation and, indeed, for the removal of criminal penalties associated with illicit drug use.


The National Drug Strategy, which was very overdue, it must be said, when it was finally released, is referenced in the committee report. It's a crucial step in starting to address some of the issues associated with the use of ice.


I understand that the committee are now planning a further trip to Portugal. It is largely because most of the experts in this area told the committee that the harm of ice and other illicit drugs might be reduced if we took a more evidence-based approach, such as the approach that has been adopted in Portugal. Portugal had a big problem with the use of heroin in the late nineties. They had many people overdosing from heroin. They tried to get tough on drugs—they had a very strong law-and-order approach to the use of illicit drugs—and the problem got worse. They sought the advice of experts: drug and alcohol doctors, people in the social services space, academics, judges and others. The result there was that this expert committee told them, 'We don't think criminal penalties are the answer here. It drives the problem underground. It doesn't stop drug use. It diverts resources away from treatment to the prosecution of a war that can't be won.' So, since 2001, Portugal has treated drug use in a way that most countries who understand this problem do—that is, that it must be treated as a health issue and not a criminal one. But it wasn't just that; there were a number of other strategies put in place at the same time.


The removal of criminal penalties associated with personal drug use—and, let's remember, there were still strong criminal penalties for individuals who trafficked commercial quantities of drugs—was also coupled with a huge expansion in drug treatment, harm reduction services and other support services, such as housing, employment pathways and so on. The result is very clear. It's reduced the burden on the criminal justice system. It's reduced drug related deaths. They have seen a significant decline in problematic drug use, particularly intravenous drug use. 


I visited Portugal in 2015. I spoke to many experts in this field—I spoke, in fact, to the architect of the policy in Portugal—and I was privileged to see up close the success of the approach that Portugal took when it came to illicit drug policy. I really encourage the committee to go there with an open mind and to start to change the conversation that we're having in this country about how we deal with a very, very difficult problem.


I don't come at this from the perspective that illicit drugs are harmless. I worked as a drug and alcohol doctor. I treated people every day who came to serious harm as a result of drugs, both legal and illegal—from alcohol to cannabis, heroin, prescription opiates, ice and other novel, new and emerging synthetic drugs. But what I did see was that what we were doing wasn't helping in many areas. In fact, there is a desperate shortage of treatment places for people because so much of our effort is directed at prosecuting individuals rather than helping them. Even this week, in the parliament, I moved a very simple motion on International Overdose Awareness Day calling for basic harm reduction strategies to be put in place, like many of those in the government's own National Drug Strategy. Disappointingly, both Labor and the Liberals banded together to vote against it, really saying to the community that they don't care about the evidence and they don't care about the lives that are needlessly lost thanks to our current policies, which divert money away from where we need it. I thought it was a great shame. Here was an opportunity to start supporting the things that we know work.


Just last week, I joined my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert in hearings to examine the government's proposal to drug-test recipients of income support. Here we were, with a committee, taking evidence from a range of witnesses—experts in their field, right across the board, who are there at the coalface seeing people with these problems. Yet we have members of the government ignoring the advice of experts, with one of them saying that drug-testing is a positive initiative. Then, at the same time, we've got a committee going to Portugal. Which one is it? Let's start recognising that, if we are going to follow the evidence, it's time to follow the evidence and put partisan ideology aside.


We Greens are very proud to be a party in the parliament that's taken on this issue for a number of years. We have done it despite the fact that we have been attacked by some elements of the media and, indeed, by some people on the conservative side of politics. We do it because it is so critical that we put ideology and politics aside and start pursuing the evidence. Australia had an incredibly proud track record of progressive drug policy that reduced harm, which in fact led the world. It must be said that, during the Hawke era, we saw the then health minister convene a group of experts to look at how to respond to the issue of HIV and hepatitis C transmission among injecting drug users. They proposed needle and syringe exchanges at a time when policies like that were unheard of. Good on them, because as a result of that Australia took strong and decisive action to reduce the transmission of blood-borne viruses among injecting drug users, while other countries around the world saw rates of those illnesses skyrocket amongst that community. 


We also had proposals for medically supervised injecting centres. Indeed, we had the Kings Cross centre established, with great results. It is a great shame, though, that in Victoria, where a proposal for a medically supervised injecting centre has been on the cards in Richmond for many years now, we saw the Labor government just today refuse to accept a positive proposal for a trial for 18 months of a medically supervised injecting facility. We were on the verge of a medically supervised trial of heroin in 1999, supported by all state governments. Indeed, it was supported by the then Labor opposition and supported by the Liberal health minister. It was John Howard who prevented that trial from going ahead. 


So, Australia has a strong and proud track record of governments taking action, of being prepared to lead the world when it comes to evidence based approaches, even though they may be controversial at the time. Let's renew that push. Let's get back on track. Let's recognise that what we are doing isn't working, that our war on drugs is a war on people and that we have to make the threshold decision to treat this as a health issue, not a criminal one. If we do that, we will save lives. We will make sure that we can invest in those areas that work. Let me say as Leader of the Australian Greens: I will do everything I can to make sure Australia takes that approach. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2017-09-07,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:36):  I present the first report on crystal methamphetamine (ice) of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SINGH:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


After the initiation of this inquiry, in March 2015, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Law Enforcement travelled extensively around Australia to hear from community members about the effects that methamphetamine was having on individuals, families and communities across the country. Not only did we focus this inquiry in the capital cities, but we also went to Mt Gambier, to Caboolture, and to areas and communities where people were reaching out for critical support. During this time—it has been quite a lengthy inquiry—we have heard stories of the devastating impact of this drug on particular rural and regional communities. Of course, rural and regional communities not only are at greater risk but they also lack resources and rehabilitation services.


The particular stories that have stuck with me are from parents who are desperate for the opportunity to help their own children—communities who are desperately trying to keep their youth away from the scourge of crystal methamphetamine. For me, the most powerful evidence in this report has been from St Vincent's Hospital, which we visited, both in Sydney and in Melbourne. It showed the impact that it is having on emergency services and on front line staff, with increased violence and new issues arising from a growing number of users. Indeed, the submission provided to this inquiry by St Vincent's highlighted that, as a nation, we have one of the highest rates of methamphetamine use in the world. This places increasing demand on an already stretched health system, because our community is desperately seeking access to treatment and intervention. Everyday Australians who see the devastating impact of methamphetamine use feel quite powerless to help, even to help their own family members. Illicit drug use is being dealt with through a three-pillar policy—that is, demand reduction, supply reduction and harm reduction—with prevention being a central theme across those three pillars. Those things need to be looked at, particularly harm reduction, because harm reduction practices that follow best practice and are evidence based should be an important part of any national drug strategy. Indeed, they are critical to the long-term strategies across the board to minimise the impact of drug and alcohol abuse.


The report that I tabled is our first report. There will be a final report, which will go into a lot more detail, with recommendations around rehabilitation and treatment services, whereas this report has a much stronger focus on law enforcement. Law enforcement, or supply reduction—which is one of the three pillars—is very important and is obviously a part of this committee's inquiry. The committee made eight key recommendations. We acknowledge the work the government is already doing and has been doing, in relation to the National Ice Taskforce and the National Ice Action Strategy, since this inquiry started. Overall, as the committee noted, the public's initial response to both the task force and the strategy was very positive. The focus on and funding for a supply-reduction approach and treatment services was supported by a number of commentators and members of the community. But, obviously, it will only work if there is enough funding for it to be successful. Harm-minimisation approaches alone are not seen as being enough. The government needs to approach this very much in a holistic frame, but harm minimisation must certainly be a key part of that. The Public Health Association of Australia went into that in detail, as noted in our report, along with Mental Health Australia, which highlighted links between methamphetamine and mental illness, and I think that is an incredibly important point to make.


We cannot be blind to the fact that new illicit drugs will continue to appear. How we deal with that is what is so important as policymakers—how we have effective policies to protect our community and to support our community into the foreseeable future. The committee learnt of successful strategies that are contingent on the relationships built between health workers and law enforcement, and education providers and the community. It is that partnering that is so important. Those relationships are really critical to ensuring that individuals are diverted before becoming addicted or, if they are addicted, that they receive the necessary treatment. But, unfortunately, all through this inquiry we heard that, if someone who is addicted to crystal methamphetamine chooses to make that decision, whether through a drug-diversion mandated court process or by themselves, often the treatment services are not available; often rehabilitation beds and places are not available for them. That is the hardest thing here, and it is something that this government has to address. Meanwhile, the government now wants to embark on drug-testing welfare recipients. That is just the most ridiculous policy, and all the health professionals have made that very clear. By the same token, the government hasn't even thought about the fact that there aren't enough rehabilitation and treatment services available in the first place. That is the critical issue here that needs to be addressed. These long waiting lists for treatment services are simply exacerbating our community's inability to help their own people. If you are finally ready to deal with something as big as a drug addiction to crystal methamphetamine and you can't get in to any kind of treatment or rehabilitation service then that just shows you how the system is broken.


I do commend, though, the input that the government has made into its National Ice Taskforce and also the National Ice Action Strategy. I also would like to acknowledge not only the work that is happening here but the work that is happening within our region. UNODC, which the law enforcement committee have briefings with from time to time, also plays a key role assisting member states in our region to implement evidence-based drug-use prevention policies and programs to again have, as Australia is slowly starting to, a more harm-minimisation focus, rather than a criminal focus on the end user. I know that UNODC enhances its regional capacities in drug-use prevention, treatment and reintegration by playing a key role in some of our South-East Asian states but also in China. We know that some of the substance which goes into making crystal methamphetamine has been imported from China, and that is an ongoing issue for Border Force and, indeed, our country. I would also like to acknowledge the work the AFP do in trying very hard to stop the importation of crystal methamphetamine but also in dealing with drug syndicates and organised crime to try to put an end to this proliferation of ice in our community.


All in all, I would like to thank the committee members for their input during this inquiry. I look forward to working with them on the next tranche of this inquiry, which will have its focus on drug rehabilitation and treatment services, a key ingredient to fight this ice drug addiction.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-09-07,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:47):  I also rise to speak to this report and to welcome the fact that what we are seeing now is some consideration given to the realities of illicit drug use in Australia. It is a report that really considers the fact that what we are doing when it comes to illicit drugs isn't effective and we need to start considering alternative approaches. We certainly welcome that. We know that the war on drugs isn't a war on drugs; it is a war on people. Those are not just the words of the Australian Greens; in fact, many experts in this area, many drug and alcohol clinicians, many academics and now many law enforcement officers are of the same view.


Ken Lay, for example, a former commissioner in the Victorian police force, made a very strong statement when he was charged with leading the National Ice Taskforce. He said:


We can't arrest our way out of this problem.


He is absolutely right. Ken Lay is not the only law enforcement officer of that view. Mick Palmer, a former AFP commissioner, also strongly believes that, despite the fact that he was responsible for taking a tough-on-drugs approach to illicit drug use, in fact in many areas it was counterproductive. He is now a strong advocate for harm minimisation and, indeed, for the removal of criminal penalties associated with illicit drug use.


The National Drug Strategy, which was very overdue, it must be said, when it was finally released, is referenced in the committee report. It's a crucial step in starting to address some of the issues associated with the use of ice.


I understand that the committee are now planning a further trip to Portugal. It is largely because most of the experts in this area told the committee that the harm of ice and other illicit drugs might be reduced if we took a more evidence-based approach, such as the approach that has been adopted in Portugal. Portugal had a big problem with the use of heroin in the late nineties. They had many people overdosing from heroin. They tried to get tough on drugs—they had a very strong law-and-order approach to the use of illicit drugs—and the problem got worse. They sought the advice of experts: drug and alcohol doctors, people in the social services space, academics, judges and others. The result there was that this expert committee told them, 'We don't think criminal penalties are the answer here. It drives the problem underground. It doesn't stop drug use. It diverts resources away from treatment to the prosecution of a war that can't be won.' So, since 2001, Portugal has treated drug use in a way that most countries who understand this problem do—that is, that it must be treated as a health issue and not a criminal one. But it wasn't just that; there were a number of other strategies put in place at the same time.


The removal of criminal penalties associated with personal drug use—and, let's remember, there were still strong criminal penalties for individuals who trafficked commercial quantities of drugs—was also coupled with a huge expansion in drug treatment, harm reduction services and other support services, such as housing, employment pathways and so on. The result is very clear. It's reduced the burden on the criminal justice system. It's reduced drug related deaths. They have seen a significant decline in problematic drug use, particularly intravenous drug use. 


I visited Portugal in 2015. I spoke to many experts in this field—I spoke, in fact, to the architect of the policy in Portugal—and I was privileged to see up close the success of the approach that Portugal took when it came to illicit drug policy. I really encourage the committee to go there with an open mind and to start to change the conversation that we're having in this country about how we deal with a very, very difficult problem.


I don't come at this from the perspective that illicit drugs are harmless. I worked as a drug and alcohol doctor. I treated people every day who came to serious harm as a result of drugs, both legal and illegal—from alcohol to cannabis, heroin, prescription opiates, ice and other novel, new and emerging synthetic drugs. But what I did see was that what we were doing wasn't helping in many areas. In fact, there is a desperate shortage of treatment places for people because so much of our effort is directed at prosecuting individuals rather than helping them. Even this week, in the parliament, I moved a very simple motion on International Overdose Awareness Day calling for basic harm reduction strategies to be put in place, like many of those in the government's own National Drug Strategy. Disappointingly, both Labor and the Liberals banded together to vote against it, really saying to the community that they don't care about the evidence and they don't care about the lives that are needlessly lost thanks to our current policies, which divert money away from where we need it. I thought it was a great shame. Here was an opportunity to start supporting the things that we know work.


Just last week, I joined my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert in hearings to examine the government's proposal to drug-test recipients of income support. Here we were, with a committee, taking evidence from a range of witnesses—experts in their field, right across the board, who are there at the coalface seeing people with these problems. Yet we have members of the government ignoring the advice of experts, with one of them saying that drug-testing is a positive initiative. Then, at the same time, we've got a committee going to Portugal. Which one is it? Let's start recognising that, if we are going to follow the evidence, it's time to follow the evidence and put partisan ideology aside.


We Greens are very proud to be a party in the parliament that's taken on this issue for a number of years. We have done it despite the fact that we have been attacked by some elements of the media and, indeed, by some people on the conservative side of politics. We do it because it is so critical that we put ideology and politics aside and start pursuing the evidence. Australia had an incredibly proud track record of progressive drug policy that reduced harm, which in fact led the world. It must be said that, during the Hawke era, we saw the then health minister convene a group of experts to look at how to respond to the issue of HIV and hepatitis C transmission among injecting drug users. They proposed needle and syringe exchanges at a time when policies like that were unheard of. Good on them, because as a result of that Australia took strong and decisive action to reduce the transmission of blood-borne viruses among injecting drug users, while other countries around the world saw rates of those illnesses skyrocket amongst that community. 


We also had proposals for medically supervised injecting centres. Indeed, we had the Kings Cross centre established, with great results. It is a great shame, though, that in Victoria, where a proposal for a medically supervised injecting centre has been on the cards in Richmond for many years now, we saw the Labor government just today refuse to accept a positive proposal for a trial for 18 months of a medically supervised injecting facility. We were on the verge of a medically supervised trial of heroin in 1999, supported by all state governments. Indeed, it was supported by the then Labor opposition and supported by the Liberal health minister. It was John Howard who prevented that trial from going ahead. 


So, Australia has a strong and proud track record of governments taking action, of being prepared to lead the world when it comes to evidence based approaches, even though they may be controversial at the time. Let's renew that push. Let's get back on track. Let's recognise that what we are doing isn't working, that our war on drugs is a war on people and that we have to make the threshold decision to treat this as a health issue, not a criminal one. If we do that, we will save lives. We will make sure that we can invest in those areas that work.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:29):  At the request of Senator Gallagher, I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes Government policy inaction is driving up electricity prices, and a Clean Energy Target is the solution to crippling policy paralysis;


(b) observes that the Government refuses to act, citing any and all excuse to delay, when everyone knows it is internal Coalition division and the weakness of the Prime Minister that are really to blame; and


(c) recognises that Australians deserve real leadership on energy and it is clearer every day that they will not get it from Prime Minister Turnbull.


Now, I think we don't get that from the Prime Minister because he really is a weak Prime Minister. Even the issues that this Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, saw as important some years ago—he has now abandoned those values and abandoned those principles because he wants to cling to power as the Prime Minister of Australia. So his own personal ambitions have pushed aside any values that he once had.


We see the government set about trying to resolve the issue of high electricity prices. What it did was it asked the Chief Scientist to prepare a report and give recommendations on exactly what the government should do. Dr Finkel, the Chief Scientist, developed a report. Dr Finkel delivered that report. The key recommendation in the report was to introduce a clean energy target. That was the most fundamental issue and the most powerful recommendation that was there. But it is something this rabble of a government, under a weak Prime Minister, doesn't have the capacity to deliver. That's the problem: there is absolutely no capacity to deliver.


You just look at the report in the Financial Review, going back to 13 June this year. Phillip Coorey, one of the main political analysts and reporters in this country, said:


Malcolm Turnbull has been hit with a stronger-than-anticipated backlash over plans to introduce a Clean Energy Target in a battle which is fast becoming a test of his leadership, Liberal sources say.


It goes on to say:


… only four or five MPs had spoken in favour of Dr Finkel's key recommendation—


this was in the coalition party room—


while about 22, including Tony Abbott, were against, and four more unclear.


I'm not surprised that members of the coalition are unclear. They are really unclear about most things. It goes on:


Chief complaints—


this is in the coalition party room—


were that the CET modelled by Dr Finkel did not classify so-called clean coal as a low emissions source and there was widespread scepticism at his forecast that his CET would deliver lower power prices than doing nothing.


You had people arguing in the party room of the coalition that they shouldn't do anything on this and they should do nothing, while you have got working-class families, with kids, battling to pay their power bills. This just shows you how out of touch, weak and unfocused this government is. It goes on:


""It's a slaughter,"" said an MP inside the meeting ""and a lot of the usual suspects haven't spoken yet"".


It goes on to say:


… the prospect of doing anything at all regarding a CET is now in serious doubt.


Well, we know that because the government has had this report now for some time, and it is in no way capable of delivering, even though Labor have said that we will work with the government to deliver a clean energy target in the interests of ensuring that we can do something about reducing power prices in this country. Coorey says:


Both Nationals and Liberals spoke against the plan, despite it promising to lower electricity prices and the government yet to do any design work.


So it hasn't even looked at doing any design work on this. This is a government that really is only a government in name. They are doing no governing, they are weak and they are incapable of delivering reduced power prices in this country.


The Financial Review goes on to quote Senator Cormann. He said:


The biggest cost…tax that we could impose on consumers and taxpayers would be to do nothing.


It was actually Senator Cormann who was saying that we've got to do something about this. But Senator Cormann is being ignored in this debate as well. He said that, without policy certainty, prices would continue to go 'up and up and up.' This is one of the most effective politicians within the coalition putting a warning out to his colleagues in the coalition that, if they don't do anything about this, prices would go 'up and up and up'. It even beggars belief that we have the finance minister having to tell the coalition party room that, if they don't do anything on this, power prices will go 'up and up and up'.


It goes on to say:


…CET with bipartisan support would restore investor certainty to a volatile and dysfunctional energy market, resulting in lower prices. The most expensive option in terms of power prices would be to do nothing, Dr Finkel said.


The person who the coalition asked to do a report, Dr Finkel, is being supported by Senator Cormann, the finance minister, who is saying that we have to do something about this. But hour after hour after hour of division within the coalition party room couldn't bring about a resolution to say, 'Let's get on with the job and reduce power prices for the Australian community.' This is not in the national interest. This weak government is not in the national interest.


Then the Prime Minister is reported to have stressed to the party room that the CET did not prohibit the construction of new coal-fired power stations. What planet is this Prime Minister on? No-one wants to invest in new coal-fired power stations—nobody! Yet, to try and appease the opposition to a CET in the party room, the Prime Minister is talking about building new coal-fired power stations. Then he changes his mind on that, and then the National Party bail him up and he's off down that road again.


The energy sector and the experts believe that even if coal is included in the scheme there is no interest in building a coal-fired power station, if only because they are more expensive than renewable energy. This coalition is in an absolute bind. This government just cannot get its act together to operate in the interests of the Australian community. This government would, through its own ideological approach on power prices and on climate change, force ordinary Australians to pay more and more for their power. They are an absolute disgrace.


Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, doesn't have a clue about how to deal with this issue, because the extremists in the coalition will do anything to stop a proper, measured, scientific approach to dealing with power prices in this country. This is the same Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who said that he would not lead a party that is not as committed to effective climate action as he was. He said that before they ditched him, and then he clawed his way back, knifed former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, became the Prime Minister, and he is now captive of the climate change deniers, the unscientific rabble that is the coalition party room. The party room is lording it over a weak and ineffective Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who is a huge disappointment to people who thought that this guy, who was on Q&A with a fancy leather jacket, would do something—that this cool character with the leather jacket would actually make a difference.


Well, the cool character in the leather jacket is an absolute captive of the extremists in the coalition. He is weak, he is ineffective and everyone knows that he is a massive disappointment. It has been reported that he's got an identity crisis. Well, you have to get an identity before you can have a crisis. What is this guy's identity? He just goes from one thing to another—capitulates on one issue of his values and one issue of his principles; it's just capitulate, capitulate. That is the Prime Minister we have—a Prime Minister who would force the community to pay $122 million for a postal survey instead of standing up to the lunatics in the coalition who will never agree that everyone should get equal rights in this country. Households are battling to pay their bills, just being ignored. The man who led the campaign for a republic won't bring a republic debate, won't talk about a republic, because the extremists in the coalition have complete control. 


You only have to go back to look at why we're in this position. It is because the coalition is led by nose by former senator Barnaby Joyce, who was a Kiwi at the time he was in here—a New Zealander—making speeches about $100 lamb roasts. Remember that? He was creating fear in the community about doing something in relation to climate change. Why was he doing that? He was doing that because he was being funded by the mining sector in this country. He was being given massive support and the National Party were being given support by the mining industry in this country. What is the result of that? We are all facing higher and higher power bills because of his incompetence and his bending the knee to the climate change deniers. It's been a decade of stupidity from the coalition. There was even someone who wrote a thesis about climate change. It was Mr Greg Hunt, the ex-environment minister, claiming that it would be $1,300 a tonne. What did ABC Fact Check say? That it is untenable. It is just a nonsense. 


I worked in Liddell power station for seven years as a maintenance fitter. I went there in 1974, two years after it was opened. I worked there until about 1981. In those days, in 1972 when this power station was built, Donny Osmond was No. 1 in the charts with Puppy Love. That is how long ago it was when Liddell power station was commissioned. Don Maclean was up in the charts with American Pie, and—Senator Nash would like this—the pipes and drums of the military band of the Royal Scots Dragoon were in the charts with Amazing Grace. The P76 was out there. Remember the Leyland P76? That is when Liddell was built, yet we have a Prime Minister saying we should extend the life of that power station over 50 years. It just beggars belief. The AGL chief executive has said, 'I'm not keeping it going.' I know about some of the problems we had when I was as a maintenance fitter there, trying to keep the boiler tubes decently intact. And I know how the turbines played up and how the turbines have been closed down on a number of occasions over the last year. I know the problems that are there. Yet we have a Prime Minister who wants to keep Liddell power station going.


I like Liddell. I must say, it was great. I was a union delegate at Liddell. We had good wages and conditions. We had good camaraderie. We had bosses that were awful, but we fought back. Even so, those workers deserve a proper move from a power industry that's not going to get any investment to a situation where they can get new jobs doing work in new areas such as clean energy. There was a report in The Singleton Argus today from Elise Pfeiffer. She sounds like a very good reporter; it's a very good article. It says:


In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on Wednesday, AGL yet again insisted it does not plan to sell its ageing Liddell power station nor keep it open beyond the set date of 2022.


Instead, the energy powerhouse is assessing its ability to replace the coal-fired station with a mix of energy from solar and wind, and fill its capacity gap with a mix of load-shaping and firming, from gas peaking plant, demand response, pumped hydro and batteries.


That's what the future is laying out. That's where I want the kids of the people I worked with at Liddell power station to be getting their jobs. That's what they should be doing. That's where the young kids who are listening in now should be getting jobs: load-shaping and firming, hydro, batteries, wind power, solar power. That's the future of this country. Yet the coalition are so backward, so incompetent, such troglodytes that they cannot understand what the future is. It goes on to say that the more economically viable position is the one I've just described, and that is opposed to spending millions on upgrading a 46-year-old plant.


Mr Andy Vesey said:


It will require a significant investment and so, you know, if you're thinking about extending the life of a plant like that for 10 years, let's say, the level of investment would be significant …


And the question we have to ask if we're going to make a significant investment in generation, would we do it in an older plant which is less reliable with higher maintenance costs or should we be making that investment in new technology which aligns with what we believe is the future which will be a greater value long term to our shareholders and customers.


The other thing at Liddell power station is that, when the power station was built, Denman Shire Council was the council that entered arrangements about the build with the then state government, but there was no agreement about the clean-up costs, so whoever ends up with that power station will have hundreds of millions of dollars of clean-up costs. These are issues that would have to be factored into any sale price and factored in by anyone who thinks they would take that over.


I will finish on this. A recent report said the coal-fired power stations, Bayswater and Liddell, were creating huge toxic problems—30 toxic substances that have serious health impacts on the communities of both Singleton and Muswellbrook. Why would we keep that going, when AGL are saying there are different ways to do this? I was not a great fan of privatising the power industry; I'm not a great fan of what's happened. Combined with the incompetence of the coalition and Malcolm Turnbull, all it has led to is this crisis.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2017-09-07,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs) (16:49):  I, for one, certainly enjoyed that trip down memory lane from Senator Cameron. I wasn't aware of what was on Top of the Pops in 1974.




Senator Cameron:
  You were two!




Senator SESELJA:
  That was a couple of years before my birth. I've got no doubt that Senator Cameron wanted to do that trip down memory lane. I am more interested in a more recent trip down memory lane—this is going back to the last, incompetent, Labor government and its energy policy. We might talk a bit about that. I don't know who was top of the pops, I can't remember who was top of the pops, in 2010, but there was this crew in charge called 'Gillard and Brown', in a Labor-Greens government, who delivered us a carbon tax and a disastrous energy policy. That's why I'm shocked that Labor wants to talk about energy policy today in the Senate. Yesterday we were talking about its economic failures; today, its policy failures on energy—and what failures they have been. This is the party that introduced a carbon tax, the whole point of which was to raise electricity prices. This is the party that introduced a mining tax that hit the economy and made it tougher to use our abundant natural resources. This is the party that, with its partners the Greens, opposed coal mining and any effort to build power stations.


Senator Cameron talked about values. Remember when the Labor Party valued workers? I recall, distantly, a Labor Party that actually used to value workers. But this is the Labor Party which, in South Australia, cost local businesses $450 million because it simply couldn't keep the lights on. With a 50 per cent renewable energy target, the Labor Party in South Australia brought blackouts throughout last summer and left its people with the highest power bills in the country—and you want to talk about an energy policy!


Now Bill Shorten wants to take Jay Weatherill's energy policy national. That's what Bill Shorten wants to do. He wants to deliver the South Australian experiment and impose that on the Australian people. It is Labor nationally that is proposing a 45 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030, a 50 per cent renewable energy target, the forced closure of coal-fired power plants, and no energy security plant. That sounds like a Greens policy to me. It reminds me of a local Greens politician who said words to the effect of 'we don't want to go back to the caves just yet'. That is the type of policy, this Greens-inspired Labor policy, that will kill our economy. 


Together these policies would absolutely wreak havoc on Australia's households and businesses, including the 900,000 Australians who work in manufacturing. These are workers who the Labor Party used to care about, but no longer do. Labor's own modelling, back when it was in government, showed that a target similar to 45 per cent, which Bill Shorten wants to impose on Australia, would increase wholesale electricity prices by 78 per cent. The Business Council of Australia called this 45 per cent target 'risky' and 'unnecessary' and said it could jeopardise Australia's future economic growth.


Only the coalition is capable of delivering solid, reliable and affordable energy for Australians. We as a government take this issue seriously, and we're not taking an ideological approach. Our priority is energy affordability and reliability, while meeting our international targets. That's what a responsible government does. We don't put forward unfunded energy targets. We don't try to close down power stations, leaving a state vulnerable to mass power outages during a storm. We look at the evidence and make considered decisions accordingly. That's why we commissioned an independent review of the National Electricity Market.


Australia's Chief Scientist presented his final report on the future security of the National Electricity Market to COAG leaders on 9 June. The independent review was commissioned following the statewide blackout in South Australia on 28 September 2016. It notes that business as usual is no longer an option. On 14 July 2017, the COAG Energy Council agreed to immediately act on 49 of the 50 recommendations of the independent review into the future security of the National Electricity Market. Following the eight-month review led by Australia's Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, these significant reforms have been agreed to in record time and will help to drive down power prices and ensure we have a more reliable system well into the future.


Key recommendations which the Energy Council agreed to include: 


A new Generator Reliability Obligation which will require intermittent sources of generation to provide an appropriate level of backup to guard against blackouts;


The introduction of Energy Security Obligations to provide the necessary support services (Frequency Control and Ancillary Services and inertia) to intermittent sources of generation;


A new requirement for large generators to give a minimum three years notice before closing; and


The establishment of an Energy Security Board to oversee the health, security and reliability of the NEM.


To help increase gas supply and reduce prices, the government calls on states and territories to accept the Chief Scientist's recommendation to adopt a science based, case-by-case approach to new gas supply and end their arbitrary bans and moratoria. This is effectively saying that we shouldn't be adopting a Greens approach when it comes to exploration. As for the clean energy target, we'll continue to work through it in a considered manner, with further analysis required. What we won't do is what the Labor Party has done and just declare a target without any planning or forethought and expect the Australian people to pay for it. 


The coalition government also understands that base-load power anchors our electricity system. We know that we need to keep the lights on for all Australians, something that Jay Weatherill and Labor don't understand. We need to ensure we have enough power to meet future needs. The Australian Energy Market Operator's dispatchability report confirms that the accelerated withdrawal of base-load power, as pushed by the Labor Party, creates major risks in terms of both price and stability. AEMO's analysis shows there is a heightened risk of shortages during summer peaks without targeted actions to provide additional firming capability. They are currently seeking to contract 1,000 megawatts of additional generation for the coming summer to make sure we have enough electricity for these peak demand periods in South Australia and Victoria. The reckless policy of state Labor in Victoria and South Australia, contributing to the closure of Hazelwood in Victoria and Northern power station in South Australia, has seen the need for AEMO to take these steps.


Consistent with the advice of the Finkel review and of the market operator, the government will accelerate work around the strategic reserve, which will beef up how AEMO currently contracts for reserve generation to manage summer peaks. With a major coal-fired power station, Liddell in New South Wales, scheduled to close in 2022, AEMO has identified an additional shortfall of 1,000 megawatts from 2022 onwards. The Prime Minister has started discussions with AGL on keeping Liddell operating longer, remembering that our first obligation to families and businesses is to ensure the stability and affordability of the system. While the government understands coal is absolutely critical to the future of our energy system, Bill Shorten wants to close down coal-fired power stations.


We aren't only looking at coal, though. To help with the integration of more renewables, we are working with ARENA on pumped hydro projects in Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. The jewel in this crown is the development of Snowy Hydro 2.0, which will increase the generation of the scheme by 50 per cent, adding 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy to the national electricity market—enough to power 500,000 homes. With a reckless 45 per cent emissions reduction target, Labor needs to be held to account for policies that will lead to higher power prices and a less stable energy system. To compare and contrast: everything that the coalition government has done in this space has been designed to deliver affordability and to ensure that we have reliability; everything that Bill Shorten and the Labor Party, at both state and federal levels, is proposing will do exactly the opposite. It will undermine the security and stability of our system and it will dramatically push up prices, as we saw when Labor was last in power.


We are not just looking at the supply side of electricity. We are also looking at what is happening in homes around Australia, with many families not being on the best deal they can be for their home electricity. That's why we're taking further action to help Australian families. We know that 50 per cent of households have not moved retailers or contracts in the past five years, even though savings can be as high as $1,500. At the first meeting of retailers, the Prime Minister has secured agreement on immediate measures and ongoing changes, to be backed by law, to put families and small businesses first.


The commitments from the retailers include: contacting all customers who are on expired discounts and telling them how much they can save on a better deal; requiring companies to report to the government and ACCC what they are doing to get families on a better deal and how many families remain on expired deals; developing simple plain English fact sheets with understandable comparison rates; supporting a change to the electricity rules requiring companies to inform customers when their discount benefits end, setting out the dollar impact of doing nothing; and ensuring families and individuals on hardship programs will not lose any benefit or discount for late payment. 


At the second meeting, retailers agreed to go further, contacting another one million customers on standing offers—usually the most expensive rates. The government also secured a commitment from retailers to make available to customers their consumption and payment information, working with the Australian Energy Regulator on a QR code or equivalent on their bill which they can scan using a smartphone and instantly compare offers from other retailers. Since the first meeting, over 280,000 Australians have visited the government's Energy Made Easy website, which allows them to seek a better deal. The industry and government will continue to work together over the coming months to make more changes that will ensure families do not have to pay a cent more for electricity than they need to. The coalition government has directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to review retail electricity prices. The review will scrutinise electricity retail behaviour as well as contracts offered to residential and business customers and ensure consumers benefit from competition in the National Electricity Market. Competition in retail electricity markets should mean lower prices for residential and business customers. 


The Turnbull government is determined to ensure Australians get a better deal for their energy. An interim report will be delivered by September, with the final report by June 2018. In responding to the ACCC's review, the coalition government will consider what further action should be taken to ensure the market is competitive and energy consumers, both residential and business, can have confidence in the reliability, security, pricing and terms and conditions of supply. The coalition government will also legislate to remove the ability of networks to appeal the merits of decisions of the Australian Energy Regulator: This will remove the ability of regulated energy network companies to game the system at the expense of consumers. This reform is critical, as network costs make up around 40 to 50 per cent of the household bill. Energy networks will have access to judicial review if they want to challenge the AER's decisions. Telecommunications, water and postage sectors do not have access to merits review and nor should the energy sector. The LMR regime was established in 2008. Since then, electricity networks have used it to challenge 32 out of 51 AER decisions, resulting in $6.5 billion being passed on to consumers in their electricity bills. In not one instance has an appeal by the networks led to reduced costs for consumers. This process is seen as a free option for network businesses. A research note by a major broker said of LMR:


… investors are getting this as a 'free option', with the upside being it brings forward a dividend surprise. 


In December 2016, the Commonwealth sought agreement at the COAG Energy Council to abolish LMR but was unsuccessful in achieving the support of all states due to vested interests. That is why we are showing leadership and taking this position to abolish this appeals mechanism. To back this, the Turnbull government is strengthening the AER by providing it with an additional $67.4 million in funding. This will ensure they are fully equipped to address behaviour in the market that is resulting in higher than necessary electricity prices. This is a response to the recommendation of the Finkel review to increase resources for the AER. Making sure the AER is well resourced is critical to consumer confidence in the electricity and gas markets. 


In contrast to our comprehensive, wide-ranging plan to help Australians get secure, reliable and affordable power to their homes, we have seen the results of Labor's green-inspired policies. We have seen what has happened in South Australia—the highest bills in the country and the least reliable network. We have seen in Victoria, as a result of Labor pushing out Hazelwood, energy companies AGL and Energy Australia increasing bills by up to $135 in 2017. In its Climate Action Plan, Labor said it would kick-start the closure of coal-fired plants. 




Senator Williams:
  They'd put us in the dark.




Senator SESELJA:
  As Senator Williams points out, it would put us in the dark. It would put Australia in the dark. Labor wants to take the South Australian failed energy experiment, which leads to lights out and the highest energy prices in the country. Bill Shorten and federal Labor want to take that national. I find the fact that Labor would come to the Senate today and want to talk about energy policy absolutely extraordinary. We are happy to talk about energy policy, because we are absolutely the party who will do all we can to keep the lights on, and we will have the policies to keep prices as low as possible. Labor's only policies will see prices go up and the reliability of our system undermined. 


Labor's one policy prescription is closing down 24 coal-fired power plants. The Australian Energy Market Commission said a forced closure policy could cost up to $24 billion and thousands of jobs—thousands of jobs of people whom the Labor Party used to represent. No more do they represent them. The contrast could not be clearer between us and a Labor Party that is now so enthralled by Greens policy that it will take reckless action. Bill Shorten has indicated that, if he becomes Prime Minister, he will shut down our coal-fired power industry, he will push up electricity prices with a 50 per cent renewable energy target and a 45 per cent reduction target, and he will put our economy at risk. Our manufacturing sector, which relies on cheap energy, will be absolutely decimated, and the small businesses that flow from it will also be decimated. There are workers, regional towns and suburban areas and households that rely on this. There are households that can't afford to pay for Bill Shorten's deal with the Greens. And fundamentally—




Senator Carol Brown:
  Mr Shorten.




Senator SESELJA:
  I will respond to the interjection from Senator Brown. It is 'Mr Shorten', but I note there was no objection to what I was saying about Mr Shorten's policies: how Mr Shorten's policies will take us back to the Dark Ages; how Mr Shorten's policies will see Australia on a path to oblivion when it comes to our economy; how Mr Shorten's policies, which he has adopted from the Greens, will see the loss of tens of thousands of jobs; how Mr Shorten's policies will see jobs being exported offshore; and how Mr Shorten's policies will see families having more and more pressure put on them because of ideology. That is the offering from the Australian Labor Party and Mr Shorten. They have now adopted Greens policies. They want to shut down the coal-fired power industry in this country. They want to push up electricity prices. They want to give us a state of being that the people of South Australia have been living now for a number of years and, most starkly, in the last year or so when we've seen the statewide blackouts for the first time in living memory. They want to take us back to the Dark Ages. 


I'm very, very pleased to sit here and compare and contrast what a Turnbull coalition government is doing and has done with the alternative that is being put forward by Mr Bill Shorten and the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party once claimed to stand for workers but it now stands for Greens preferences. This is an Australian Labor Party that would absolutely sell this country out with its energy policy. It would sell out our economy, it would sell out our business sector and it would sell out Australian families.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-09-07,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:09):  It's apt, isn't it, to be talking about policy leadership on the day that the High Court has ruled that we have to continue with this shambles of a postal survey cooked up by the government? 


On energy, much like on marriage equality, the government has had to repair its makeshift solutions so many times that there's really not much left but masking tape and bits of chewing gum.


In this case, it's not just a case of the government making a bad decision; it's actually refused to make any decision at all. Its policy paralysis on energy has had serious effects for business, consumers and our environment. Let's be really clear about this: we are in the middle of an unprecedented investment strike which has been brought about by the government. Earlier this year, the head of the Energy Council, which represents the coal-fired generators and the gas generators, wrote:


We are already experiencing the consequences of energy policy paralysis … The ""grid"" as we know it is degrading in front of our eyes.


But you don't hear much about that from the coalition, a group ordinarily enthusiastic about championing the views of business, because they are not listening. They are stuck in an ideological dilemma entirely of their own making.


I want to take a moment to consider how we got into this mess in the first place. This is not a technical problem. We know how to reduce electricity prices and we know how to reduce emissions, and we know that those two things are entirely compatible. This is a political problem. It's a political problem because the solution requires the coalition to make a break from the universality of coal-fired generation, a mineral that has long ceased to be an energy source and instead has become a symbol of the culture wars in the coalition party room. 


The Liberal Party brawl about energy has been going on for so long that it is hard to remember where it all started, but late last year we were promised a circuit breaker. The Finkel review was supposed to be a way for the Liberal party room to put off having to make a decision about energy policy. They were going to defer it for a while and have an expert come up with what was hopefully a workable compromise. Within days, however, the Minister for the Environment and Energy had already been forced into an embarrassing backdown. On Monday on ABC Radio an EIS was in. The minister said:


We know that there's been a large number of bodies that have recommended an emissions intensity scheme, which is effectively a baseline and credit scheme, we'll look at that …


That is what he was saying on the Monday—'We'll look at it.' On talkback radio on Tuesday it was ruled out. What did he say on the Tuesday, just 24 hours later? He said: 'The Turnbull government is not contemplating such a scheme. We are not advocating for such a scheme. What we are focused on is driving down electricity prices and increasing energy security.' How utterly embarrassing and completely depressing for Australian consumers and Australian energy businesses.


This depressing trend continues. Every time anyone from the government dares question the orthodoxy propagated by the hard Right of the Liberal Party, the hard Right flex their muscles and bring them right back into line. It was inevitable that the same thing would happen to Dr Finkel's proposal. Within hours of the Liberal Party's special meeting on the Finkel report in June, one anonymous but very, very talkative MP had briefed The Australian:


Finkel in its current form is dead.


What we have had ever since is a government in search of an escape and absolutely desperate to avoid making a decision. It has been months since Chief Scientist Alan Finkel delivered his report recommending a clean energy target. The Finkel panel indicated that there was an urgent need for a clear and early decision on a clean energy target. At this stage, I think we'd just settle for a decision.


This isn't a problem caused by partisanship. At the start of this year, industry, consumer and not-for-profit groups put out a rare joint statement on energy. I'm going to read it because all of these groups, not normally allies, said:


The status quo of policy uncertainty, lack of coordination and unreformed markets is increasing costs, undermining investment and worsening reliability risks. This impacts all Australians, including vulnerable low-income households, workers, regional communities and trade-exposed industries.


The finger pointing will not solve our energy challenges. More than a decade of this has made most energy investments impossibly risky. This has pushed prices higher while hindering transformational change of our energy system. The result is enduring dysfunction in the electricity sector.


We need mature, considered debate.


Well, that was in February, and now—in September—nothing has changed.


Labor have been willing all along to compromise in order to find a solution, to work with whoever we can on the other side of the aisle who might be in a position to meaningfully or coherently negotiate. But this is something the Liberal Party has proven to be unwilling and unable to do, time and time again. The problem is that the Liberal Party doesn't need to compromise with us; it needs to reach a compromise with itself. What does the solution look like? It's not coal. You have to wonder how far from the pack you have strayed if you are being slapped down by electricity companies as being too bullish on coal, as the Prime Minister was yesterday. The simple reason AGL, like all the other generation companies, is getting out of coal is that it doesn't make economic sense for them.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  They worked for the Labor Party!




Senator McALLISTER:
  I want to take a moment to talk about this, because Senator Macdonald is having a minor fit over there about the fact that someone at AGL once worked for GetUp! and maybe supported renewables.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator McALLISTER:
  Well, there are all sorts of conspiracy theories, and Senator Macdonald is voicing them now, about how environmentalists are trying to capture Australian business with leftist policies. The fact that people have missed is this: it is not that the Australian energy sector has been dragged to the left; it is that renewables are now a sensible, mainstream, entirely unobjectionable policy proposition everywhere except in the coalition party room. And it's not just business but households as well.


It's worth reading the material AEMO produces, rather than just name-dropping AEMO, which is the government's current approach. AEMO says that net residential demand—the households, the mums and dads the coalition love to talk about—is 'projected to decline as growth in population and appliance usage is offset by increased generation from rooftop solar and by energy efficiency initiatives'. That is what AEMO projects. That's its vision of a future electricity network, and it actually doesn't look like a great big new coal-fired power station.


The electricity system is changing. It is radically altering, and the coalition are simply not keeping up with the market reality, with the technological reality, with the engineering reality. Despite all the carry-on about how they are going to be guided by economics and guided by engineering, none of that is evident in their approach, because they're so selective in the material they are willing to draw on when they are considering the AEMO information. Think about transition. On average, network charges accounted for 43 per cent of residential electricity prices in 2015. If you are generating locally, that entire charge no longer need apply to you. There are enormous savings. If you want to go chasing savings, there are enormous savings available with a more decentralised energy system. Let's talk about storage technology. We've already seen two huge technology driven changes in electricity demand. The peak in the electricity system used to be in winter, associated with heating homes. Now it's in summer, associated with the ubiquitous presence of air conditioning in so many Australian homes. The growth in rooftop storage has seen further changes. There's a dip in energy use in the afternoon as people generate their own power and then a surge in use in the early evening. And storage technology is going to drive further changes.


The system is changing. The demands of the system are changing, and solutions that were appropriate back in 1970, when most of the people on the other side formed their view about energy policy, are not solutions that will work in the future. Battery technologies are expected to fall in cost by another 40 to 60 per cent by 2020. We are seeing the introduction of entirely new technologies that will radically change the way that households and businesses consume electricity, providing opportunities for people to manage their electricity demand behind the meter at home. Energy Networks Australia predicts that 30 to 50 per cent of Australia's energy needs will be supplied by millions of customer-owned generation and storage devices. 


The Prime Minister can complain—and he often does, slightly disingenuously, because I'm not sure that he actually believes it—about wind and solar having different generation profiles from traditional coal. Sorry, Mr Turnbull, that is just the future. That is where technology is going. People are going to have rooftop solar; they are going to have batteries—they already do. Tens of thousands of Australian households already do, and they are looking to the government for leadership as to how all these new technologies will be integrated into a new system. But all they get is a nostalgic hankering for coal, which presents no solution to the energy challenge that we face now. 


We should be able to make our energy system more flexible, better able to accommodate diverse sources of supply, and better able to manage our demand and sequence our demand so that overall the system is in balance. That is what all of this communication technology will allow, if only the market can be adapted to allow these things to take place, and nothing has happened on this front. The coalition has been asleep at the wheel while report after report has been produced by the AEMC, the AER and the AEMO begging the government to undertake meaningful market reform to allow these technologies to work. 


I come back to the original proposition. We need to create a certain investment environment. This is something the coalition has comprehensively failed to do, and the repeal of the carbon price was the first step in a long march towards trashing the energy market. Everybody who knows anything about the electricity system is demanding policy certainty. Dr Finkel presented options months ago that still wait to be enacted. All that it would take is for the coalition to get its act together, sort out its own differences, put aside the dinosaurs and the hard Right of the Liberal Party and the National party, and come to a decision, based, as they say they will, on the engineering, on the science, on the economics and on Dr Finkel's report.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Clean Energy Target</title>,MOTIONS,25,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-09-07,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:22):  I am so delighted the Labor Party have raised this subject for debate this afternoon. I can't for the life of me understand why they would want to do it. This debate highlights that the Labor Party federally have no policies whatsoever to address the crisis that is confronting Australia. In Queensland, the state that I represent and that I will refer to often in my presentation, naturally enough, the Labor Party are all over the ship on energy policy. The only thing that's clear from the state Labor government in Queensland is that they own the generators of electricity in Queensland. They have been gouging the market, selling electricity—generated by coal-fired power stations—at enormous profit, simply to prop up the Queensland state budget which, because it is run by the Labor Party, would otherwise be in real crisis. From a Queenslander's point of view, there are very high electricity prices. Why? Because they are gouged by the electricity generators of Queensland, owned by the state government, providing huge profits to the state government, who are trying to balance their budget at the expense of Queensland households. 


You wouldn't think it could get worse in Queensland, but it can. The Palaszczuk government have indicated that they want to have 50 per cent of Queensland's power in renewables by 2030. For one thing, that provides them with a real problem with balancing their budget, because renewable energy means less coal-fired energy and it means that there will be less revenue going to the Queensland budget. But for consumers in Queensland—for mums and dads and for small businesses—it means that the price of electricity will skyrocket again. In my own home town of Ayr there was a blackout for about five hours a couple of weeks ago. I don't think it was lack of supply. It was probably for some maintenance, but I suspect it's the Queensland government acclimatising us to the fact that, under their policies, Queenslanders will eventually suffer the same fate that the South Australians suffer under the Labor government there—having no power in the hottest months of the year. And for Queenslanders, and particularly where I come from in the north, having no power in the summer months will just be horrendous. This is what you can expect from state Labor governments in Queensland and around the country following the lead of the Labor government in South Australia, where the lights are simply turned out. 


There is a fallacy around that renewable energy is cheap. I'm pleased to say that in the north there are a number of renewable energy projects. The Kidston Solar Project has $54 million of subsidies from the Australian taxpayer via the Clean Energy Foundation and another almost $9 million from ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. So, regarding suggestions that renewable energy doesn't cost you much: it might not cost you much because taxpayers are subsidising it. There is the Ross River Solar Farm proposal, with $20 million from the CEFC. There's the Kennedy Energy Park, with $18 million from ARENA. This doesn't fit into the same category, but there is the Moranbah solar farm which Adani are going to do. That has no subsidy at this time. There is the Collinsville Solar Farm, with a $60 million subsidy from CEFC and $9.5 million subsidy from ARENA. There is the Pentland Bioenergy Project feasibility study, with another $3 million from ARENA. They are just a few renewable energy projects in North Queensland. Forget about Australia! Imagine the taxpayer subsidies of the clean energy proposals across the nation. 


I want to repeat an explanation that a constituent gave me: 'Renewable energy has nothing to do with reducing energy prices; its sole purpose is to assuage the middle-class guilt of the inner-city intelligentsia.' That is not a bad description from that constituent. People who live in a completely different world to the rest of Australia think that they have to do something, so they think this renewable energy will be good for the planet. 


Let's have a look at how good it will be for the planet. I do hope that there is a Greens senator around who might come and tell me where this argument is wrong, because I keep raising it. I keep asking the Greens to tell me where this scenario is wrong, but, apart from abusing me and calling me names, they never answer the question. The question is this: Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's total carbon emissions. I will repeat that so that anyone who might be listening to this can understand that: Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's total carbon emissions. 


If Mr Shorten and Ms Palaszczuk have their way, they are going to reduce those emissions by a small amount. Let's say 50 per cent of our power comes from non-carbon sources; what we're going to do to help the world is reduce Australia's 1.2 per cent of emissions by 50 per cent. I asked Dr Finkel this question: if you reduce Australia's carbon emissions by 1.2 per cent, which is down to zero, what impact will that have on the changing climate of the world? His response was 'virtually none'. Whilst the Labor Party and, as my constituent said, the inner-city intelligentsia with their middle-class guilt feel good about this, it's not going to make one iota of difference to the changing climate of the world—yet it will cost Australians.


You know, Australia used to have a competitive advantage. It was never in the price of our labour. Certainly our labour was skilled, but the price of labour made us relatively uncompetitive around the world. The one competitive advantage that Australia had was cheap, affordable, regular and reliable power. Why was that? Because in Australia we are blessed with huge reserves of high-quality coal and we can get electricity cheaper to Australian manufacturers. Korea Zinc's Sun Metal was encouraged to set up a zinc refinery in Townsville about 30 years ago. This was one of the reasons they set up in Townsville in Australia. Rather than doing what lots of others have done and take the zinc concentrate back to Korea, they set up in Townsville where the zinc was mined. Why? Because they could be guaranteed cheap coal-fired energy for a long period of time. Regrettably—and I know Sun Metal have looked at this with regret in years gone by—that agreement ran out and now they're being forced to pay enormous prices for the huge amounts of power they use, which makes it very, very difficult to compete in the world.


We emit less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. Even if we stopped all emissions from Australia—that is, shut off every electric light, stopped every car moving and didn't allow South Australia to run all of these dirty diesel generators—it would make virtually no difference. If we shut Australia down completely and saved 1.2 per cent, according to common sense—and if you want a better authority than common sense, go to Dr Finkel, who said this—it would make virtually no difference to the changing climate of the world.


My friend and colleague Senator Williams had some research done on Australia's position on coal-fired power stations compared to other countries in the world. I'll say this slowly so some of the Greens and Labor senators can absorb it. Let me give you an example. This research talks in units of power. Australia has fewer than 73 units of power—that is, units of coal-fired power generation. There are 73 from Australia. What has China got? China has 2,107 units. Australia has 73. When we get the coal-fired, base-load power station in North Queensland, which I am confident will come with a change of government in Queensland at the next election, we will go up to 74 or 75 units of power. According to the Labor Party and the Greens, this is going to destroy the world. Australia will then have, say, 75 units of power; China has 2,107; Germany; 155—double what Australia has—Japan, 119; Russia, 358; Poland, 178; South Africa, 108; Ukraine, 112; United States, 783; Again, I relate these figures to Australia. United States has 783; Australia, with its one new coal-fired power station, has 75. Can I ask the Greens or the Labor Party speakers who might be following me in this debate, how does having one new low-emissions, high-quality coal-fired power station in Australia have any impact whatsoever on the changing climate of the world?


I know it is popular for the Greens to say, 'You're a dinosaur; you don't accept that the climate is changing.' Of course I accept that the climate is changing. And I always give the obvious, exaggerated example that once upon a time the world was covered in ice and now it isn't so, clearly, over time, the climate does change. I accept that the climate changes. But, Australia's carbon emissions, if carbon emissions are the problem—I say if they are, but I don't go to that debate—then Australia emits 1.2 per cent. If Labor and the Greens' policies are to be implemented, that might come down by an infinitesimal amount. But even at 1.2 per cent, Dr Finkel confirms that it has absolutely no impact on the changing climate of the world.


There's a lot of misinformation that goes around about carbon emissions and electricity prices. I like energy minister Senator Canavan's description of Westpac bank. When Westpac said that they didn't want to get involved in coal—for one, Adani had never asked them for any money. When we look into it, why Westpac were a bit concerned about the Queensland coalfields opening is because Westpac owns several mines in the Hunter Valley and they own the Newcastle Port, so they don't want any competition. Senator Canavan was so right when he said that Westpac should go back to its old name of the Bank of New South Wales because clearly it was more interested in its New South Wales coal and port investments than it was in the future of Australia.


A lot of comments have been made about AGL, who want to shut down a power station that is making considerable contributions towards the power that we currently have. If Liddell power station, which is owned by AGL, is closed in 2022, the authority has identified an additional shortfall of 1,000 megawatt hours to the Australian grid from 2022 onwards. Fortunately, the government is trying to arrange or assist a buyer to take that project on. But we wonder why AGL is so, what I might call, bolshie about its energy network and the huge money it's made over the years from coal and other energy supplies. Then we read in today's paper that one of their senior executives is a mouthpiece for the ALP. She was, as I understand it, on the board of GetUp! and, no doubt, influencing, very substantially, policy of AGL. I just hope that the shareholders in AGL understand that this company, which has made squillions out of energy supply, most of which was from coal-fired power stations, is now taking the GetUp!-ALP-Greens' line to their business. I suspect that their business will start to fall, and I hope shareholders are aware of that and might be interested in that.


The whole energy market is ridiculous at the moment. In all of my time in the Senate—and that's been a long while!—power supply, energy supply and costing have been matters for state governments. Why? Because the state governments own the transmission lines and the generators. That's been the case, but we now have state governments refusing to allow us to tap the enormous reserves of gas under the ground in Victoria, in South Australia, and now, I understand, in Western Australia, along with the Northern Territory—all Labor governments. There's gas there, but they won't even let it be discovered.


Fortunately the coalition government saw a national crisis coming and said, 'We've got to do something about this because the states are not.' The coalition government has taken the lead in trying to keep the power supply flowing. We've mandated a certain amount of what the Labor Party would allow to be exported gas. That will now be used on the domestic market to help try and bring prices down. The Commonwealth government has put pressure on the generators—in my case, that's the Queensland state government—to reduce their generating profits by stopping gouging the market and bringing it back to something that is reasonable. These initiatives had to be taken by the federal government because state Labor governments were incapable of dealing with these issues.


I have a lot more I want to say on this particular subject, but I've run out of time. I again thank the Labor Party for nominating this as the topic for debate today. I couldn't have asked for a better debate myself. It just shows the people of Australia that the Labor Party has no interest. They're captured by the inner-city Greens intelligentsia, they're trying to assuage their consciences, and what they are doing is putting up prices for ordinary Australian families, making power almost unreachable for many Australians. Unless the Commonwealth acted, as it has done, this would have got worse. Congratulations to Mr Turnbull on his leadership and initiative in this area. (Time expired)

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-09-07,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:42):  Trust, trust, trust. As servants to the people of Queensland and Australia, we listen to the people of Queensland and across Australia, and people repeatedly tell us they can't trust the tired old parties. Think about this, senators from the Labor Party: you had an opportunity today to decrease energy prices by removing the GST on energy, and what did you do? You voted against reducing energy prices.


Before we go into that further, let me just remind people of the fundamental importance of energy. Since 1850 and the industrial revolution, we have seen energy prices decrease in real terms. That has led to increasing productivity, and with increasing productivity there is increasing prosperity. That has enabled us to have human progress. Human civilisation has progressed dramatically, not just because we are a creative species and a caring species—contrary to what the Greens would have us believe—but because we also apply that creativity to reducing energy prices. That has increased human progress dramatically. Energy is what drives the implementation of our creative talents. Kevin Rudd's initiatives, joined by Penny Wong, Peter Garrett and Julia Gillard—and Christine Milne; how could we forget her!—are reversing human progress. They are denying the people of the Third World cheap energy, or they are trying to. They are denying people jobs in this country and, in fact, they are exporting jobs from this country. 


A false statement in this Labor Party motion is that the clean energy target will reduce energy prices. We have seen prices go up by more than double the CPI to an outstanding high—eight times what they were in 1980. That is an explosion in energy prices. As a result of the Finkel report, I commissioned, at my own cost, a review by a well-known energy economist, Alan Moran. He points out that, if we adopt the Finkel report, consumers will not be paying less for energy; they will be paying around $800 a year more. He also points out that energy prices have increased from around $40 per megawatt hour during the first 15 years of the present century to currently in excess of $80 per megawatt hour and that futures prices are now over $100 per megawatt hour. There is more to come in the future, and with the clean energy target there will be even more beyond that. 


So we are seeing a degradation of our energy market. In fact, this is really an energy racket, because it is polluted by subsidies, vested interests and regulations. This is a fundamental thing in what we see the Labor Party advocating. They are advocating the Finkel report and the clean energy target when, fundamentally, the driver of energy prices is the overregulation of energy. We no longer have an energy market; we have an energy racket. That energy racket is now laced with subsidies, vested interests, regulations and politicisation. We don't have an energy market now; we have an energy racket. What is more, that racket is distorting prices; it is increasing prices dramatically. We are seeing more of it and it will continue, as the Moran report shows. 


Let's look at the Finkel report and see what it is based on. Finkel does his projections based on the economic modelling of Jacobs. We see that, in recent years, literally within the last few years, the Jacobs modelling has contradicted itself several times. It raises serious questions about Dr Finkel's report. We have to question now the purpose and the nature of the modelling. It looks to me like it was rigged to produce the result that government wanted. Is that what Alan Finkel was paid to do? 


We will see something else now. As Dr Moran has pointed out, if we continue to do what the government is doing now, we will see export industries hurt. The trade-exposed energy-intensive industries that are really suffering will suffer body blows, and we could lose them as well. So it won't just be small business that falls prey to the tired old parties; it won't just be employees. It will be big businesses and our highly competitive businesses that will be destroyed in this country. We need to end the renewable energy target, not bring in a worse replacement. I must give credit to Senator Macdonald. I have developed enormous trust in him as a result of his work in recent months. 


Let's have a look at what has happened in South Australia. We have seen a Labor government destroy its own state, gleefully blow up a power station and celebrate it. Isn't that what terrorists do? They destroy the power stations. That is what Jay Weatherill's government has done. Why have they done that? Because the Greens have pushed them into it. They have lulled the Labor Party into it. The Labor Party needs the preferences; the Labor Party then falls for the trick. The Greens are actually running South Australia, to the detriment of all South Australians. We have seen the Greens in their home state—it is basically their home state, apart from Tasmania, the state where they were most popular—lose one of their two senators, and Senator Sarah Hanson-Young is now on her own. That is not all we see in South Australia. We see the madness that the Xenophon team has been plying the alliance of the Greens and the Labor Party. Those three have colluded to drive up energy prices in that state. But, sadly, we've also seen a dysfunctional Liberal Party in South Australia that has been gutlessly silent—cowed into submission and cowed into not having the guts to stand up and call the alliance of the Labor Party, the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team for what it is. They're all hurting energy prices.


How can we have trust in those tired old parties, especially the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team? Why is there inaction, supposedly, from the Prime Minister, according to Senator Gallagher's motion? It's very simple: the economic reality is biting. We now see the legacy of driving up energy prices. People are now feeling it in the hip pocket. Businesses are now sacking employees. Steggles have gone under—a household name. They're gone. What we've seen is economic reality coming home to roost, but it's going to get far worse.


As for action, part (b) of Senator Gallagher's motion talks about action. Look at the action that her own Labor Party is taking in the state of Queensland, where the major coal-fired power stations are owned and operated by the Labor Party government.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Profiteering!




Senator ROBERTS:
  It is exceptionally high profiteering. It's, essentially, a tax. It is a tax—nothing else. It's a tax that's destroying jobs, a tax that's destroying people's futures, a tax that's destroying industries and a tax that's destroying exports and making us uncompetitive. Then, as South Australia is on 47 per cent for its renewable energy target, what does the Labor government want to do in Queensland? It wants to bring on a 50 per cent target. Then it has the dishonesty to claim that it won't cost jobs. If we bring in a 50 per cent renewable energy target, that means that that will either displace or be an addition to the coal-fired power stations, which will mean that they will have to shut. They will not have the subsidies that intermittent energies now have. When they shut, that will put coal operators, coal employers and power-station workers out of their jobs. They will watch these imported windmills and imported solar farms working with subsidies passed on by state governments through taxation and higher energy prices.


What we have from the Greens and the Labor Party—can you believe it—is a highly regressive and destructive tax. That's because energy is an essential commodity today. It's no longer a luxury, I say to the Labor Party. Energy is now essential, a significant part of people's expenditure and highly regressive on the poor. Who is subsidising the wealthy to install subsidised solar panels? The poor, because they can't afford solar panels. So we now have a Queensland government that is stealing taxation—they're exorbitant rates, and it's nothing more than a tax—destroying the future of the state with a renewable energy target that is even beyond South Australia's imagination and using subsidies to kill the futures of people on lower incomes.


That's not all. We see the Nicholls opposition in Queensland—the LNP—passing a Labor Party budget that includes a 50 per cent renewable energy target. We also see that they want a target of around 23 per cent. How can anybody trust any of the tired old parties—the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team? Then we have hydro. Hydro is the only power source that's cheaper than coal-fired power stations, but we can't build dams in this country, despite having massive water flows and water reservoirs up in North Queensland. We cannot build dams because of the Greens.


Let's look at the cause for energy prices being so high and increasing. First of all, we have the Renewable Energy Target, which kicked in in 2007. That Renewable Energy Target coincides exactly with the dramatic increase in prices for electricity. The Renewable Energy Target, with its massive subsidies to solar and wind, has driven up the price of electricity. We've seen subsidies for the intermittent energies and we've seen gold-plated networks that are abnormally high and intolerably high because they're not being managed because the sector is too highly regulated.


We also see something else, and that is what the Howard government brought in. Prime Minister John Howard proudly said that he wouldn't sign the Kyoto Protocol, and that was good. But he also said that we would comply with it, and that we did. To be able to do that, the Howard government had to stop land clearing or stop industry. So what did it choose to do? It chose to stop land clearing. If he'd implemented that then, as a result, the government would have had to pay compensation to farmers in New South Wales, Queensland and the other states, but that's in fact not what happened, because to get around that compensation, Prime Minister Howard colluded with the then Premier, Peter Beattie, and the then environment minister in New South Wales, Bob Carr. They put in place native vegetation protection legislation, which stole farmers' property rights, and Bob Carr is on YouTube gloating and laughing at doing it in a way that would mean farmers would not be entitled to compensation.


We've also seen jobs destroyed by the Renewable Energy Target that the Howard government put in place. A question for everyone: who was the leader of the major political party in this country that first brought in an emissions trading scheme? It wasn't Kevin Rudd; it was John Howard. Howard had the trifecta: the first emissions trading scheme as policy, the Renewable Energy Target and the stealing of farmers' property rights. How can we trust anyone in this debate? Following Kevin Rudd's mad, lunatic and disastrous quest for UN favours in his 2007 campaign, when the Labor Party brought out Al Gore to spread his lies, instead of countering it with facts, John Howard actually endorsed it by timidly falling for the ploy and reinforcing the claims about climate.


Just a couple of months ago John Howard said, by the way, that the two per cent Renewable Energy Target was all it should've been. He is the man who brought in what we see now: around 23 to 28 per cent. In 2011, four years after he left the prime ministership, John Howard was delivering the Global Warming Policy Foundation's annual lecture in Britain in London. After wreaking all of this havoc and doing all of this damage, John Howard admitted that he is agnostic on climate change. He hasn't seen the evidence, and that's why he's agnostic. The reason is that there is no evidence. What we see from the Liberal Party and the National Party is gutlessness, but what we see from the Labor Party and the Greens is dishonesty and deceit. We see that from the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd.


Then we move onto the mad rantings we heard from the Greens this morning. We heard about hurricanes—the North American equivalent of cyclones—increasing. Let's have a look at that. We saw one cyclone last week, and then we see evidence that another cyclone is building and about to head towards North America. We then look at the records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in North America, and we see that in the last 10 years North America has had 10 cyclones. If we go back to the 1850s, 1851 to 1860, the first years of the records, we see 19. That's double. If we then look at 1880 to 1889, we see 27, almost three times the number of cyclones we've had in the last decade.


Senator Whish-Wilson this morning was speaking rubbish, absolute nonsense. There are no trends that indicate any changes in rainfall patterns; no trends that indicate any changes in drought severity, frequency or duration; no trends that indicate any changes in snowfall; and no trends that indicate any changes in cyclone severity, intensity or frequency. In fact, cyclones and hurricanes lately are unusually low in the last 10 years. We see no changes in ocean pH. What some people call acidity is actually alkalinity, because the pH is around 8.3. That makes it alkaline, not acidic. How can we trust the mad rantings of the Greens when they distort the facts? Instead of data, what do the Greens they rely on? They rely on pictures of cute, cuddly animals and colourful fish, instead of data. That is not science.


Then we look at the Labor Party—and I see Senator McAllister in the chamber right now. She has mentioned things like a 97 per cent consensus. When people don't have the scientific data, they put in a red herring like 'a 97 per cent consensus'. Well, I am here to say that the 97 per cent consensus has been proven to be a 0.3 per cent fudging, and none of those scientists have any proof—

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:02):  I rise to take note of the government response to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme report Provision of services under the NDIS for people with psychosocial disabilities related to a mental health condition. This was a very important inquiry. Before I go into the content of the report, I want to thank those people and organisations, particularly from the mental health sector, who made submissions and attended the public hearings. The report makes 24 recommendations, which were unanimously agreed to by everyone on the committee, across all parties. I will touch on some of the recommendations later. 


As the report points out, it is estimated that 64,000 people with psychosocial disabilities related to a mental health condition will become NDIS participants by 2019-20. This equates to nearly 14 per cent of the total 460,000 Australians who will be participants in the NDIS. We must do everything that we can to ensure that each and every one gets increased supports and improved outcomes under the NDIS. We must also end the uncertainty that exists about just what psychosocial services will be available as the NDIS is fully rolled out. It is also vital that all governments continue to provide support for people with psychosocial disabilities who are not eligible for the NDIS. I've met with many carers who are worried about the future of services for people who experience mental ill-health, the majority of whom will not be covered by the NDIS. Some carers are worried that psychosocial disability support services may not be adequately funded through the information linkages and capacity-building framework. It is clear, however, that the NDIS eligibility criteria for people with mental illness are a major concern for all stakeholders. 


As I said, the committee made 24 recommendations. What the committee particularly recommends is that the NDIS Act be reviewed to assess the permanency provisions and the appropriateness of the reference to psychiatric conditions. It goes on to recommend at recommendation 2:


… a review of the NDIS (Becoming a Participant) Rules 2016 should be considered to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of:


•Including the principle of recovery-oriented practice for psychosocial disability, and 


•Clarifying that Rule 5.4 which dictates that a condition is, or is likely to be permanent,[54] does not apply to psychosocial disability, to reflect that people with mental conditions will receive ongoing treatments to aid recovery.


The NDIS Act, as we all know, requires that a person's condition be permanent. The mental health sector says that this runs counter to the principle of a recovery orientated practice for people with psychosocial disability. The committee heard that some people did not even bother to engage with the NDIS because of the permanent disability requirement and the definition of mental illness disability. This was particularly so for young people who experience severe mental ill-health. In fact, Anglicare Tasmania was one of the organisations to raise concerns about the permanent impairment requirement for young people. Anglicare said:


Professionals are often reluctant to both diagnose and label symptoms as a specific illness and to confidently state that this is a permanent condition. Many young people living with mental health conditions are likely to be reluctant to consider that their condition is permanent, given the recovery model's emphasis on positive improvements.


It is a complex matter, and I am pleased that the permanency position has been recommended to be reviewed.


In a related recommendation, the committee recommends that:


… the NDIA, in conjunction with the mental health sector, develops and adopts a validated fit-for-purpose assessment tool to assess the eligibility of people with psychosocial disability that focuses on their functional capacity for social and economic participation.


It should be about what people can and can't do, and what we can do to support people with psychosocial disability to lead good lives.


The report also touches on forensic disability services, and it goes to the point that the NDIS has the potential to decrease the incarceration rates for people with cognitive and psychosocial impairment, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are overrepresented amongst those in prison with complex disability support needs. However, before the opportunity offered through the NDIS can be realised, access to the NDIS must be readily available and consistent within the criminal justice system. There are recommendations that have also been made in that regard.


I also would like to touch on the role of carers under the NDIS. We have data from the ABS that estimates that 194,000 primary carers care for someone with a psychosocial disability. It came out in the inquiry—and I touched on this in an earlier contribution about another NDIS committee report which was tabled earlier—that it seems that the planning process to develop and review NDIS plans has not been operating as well as it should be. This has resulted in unsatisfactory experiences and outcomes for people with psychosocial disabilities, their families and particularly their carers, who have raised concerns with me and also in the context of this inquiry. Sometimes it seems that carers have not been involved in planning discussions, and, instead of face-to-face contact with NDIS participants, it has been done over the phone. That has been an issue raised continuously.


Before I conclude, I want to raise the very important issue of advocacy and outreach services. The committee recognises the critical role that advocacy and outreach services can play in identifying people and engaging them, and their family and carers, with NDIS services. I quote from the executive summary of the report:


In many cases the most efficient way to engage with people in the NDIS process is to work with their families and carers who have long-term, personal and special knowledge of their needs and circumstances. The operational systems in place to provide information about the NDIS and to engage with hard-to-reach cohorts through assertive outreach could be greatly improved. With the transition of Commonwealth and state and territory programs, there is a risk of emerging service gaps in these areas.


I wish to thank the committee again for the work they have done in producing this report, and I thank all those people and organisations who made submissions. It is a very good report. Those recommendations are extremely important and I hope that NDIA takes up the recommendations. If they are taken up and implemented correctly, they will go a long way towards enhancing the NDIS, but they also will make the process much easier for participants entering the NDIS. Some of the gaps that are emerging for those who are inside and outside the NDIS can be identified and dealt with. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—





ELECTORAL AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2017





I am pleased to present the 
Electoral and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2017
 to amend the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 
and related legislation.





The Bill addresses the recommendations made by the first interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into the 2016 Federal Election, relating to the authorisation of voter communication, which was tabled on 9 December 2016. 





Concerns raised during, and immediately following, the 2016 Federal Election campaign, as well as submissions received during the Inquiry, show that the current authorisation requirements have not kept pace with technological change. This means that those who wish to hide their identity from voters can do so by communicating on mediums not imagined a decade ago.





These practices reduce the information available to voters in making their decision on polling day. Reduced transparency and accountability, as well as a reduced ability for regulators to trace the source of a communication, is not a good outcome for Australian democracy.





The Bill proposes to ensure that: 





electoral communication is clearly authorised irrespective of how it is communicated;





electoral matters and political debate is not only open, it is also transparent; and





authorisation requirements are harmonised across different communication channels, cutting red tape for those who seek to contribute to public debate.





The Bill has no impact on the news media or on satire, academic or artistic endeavours, which are important elements of our open and free democratic system. Equally, it does not impose red tape, and require an additional authorisation, where it is already clear who is communicating.





This Government is committed to ensuring that voters are fully informed in making decisions at the ballot box. These changes to one of Australia's oldest pieces of legislation – the 99-year-old 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 
– improve the requirements for all of those who engage in electoral communication, without imposing an undue burden on communication with voters. 





The Parliament has been well served by the work of its Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which regularly examines aspects of our electoral system, and the issues that arise from the conduct of national elections. 





I commend the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for its work to date in identifying the need to reform the authorisation regime and I look forward to their further work. 





The changes to the Electoral Act proposed in this Bill will not take effect until six months after Royal Assent and therefore will not affect the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey.





I commend the Bill to the Senate.
