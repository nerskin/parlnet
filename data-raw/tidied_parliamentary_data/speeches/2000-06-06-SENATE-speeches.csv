"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-06-06,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. Why is it that the government has been so quick to make public examples of businesses such as Video Ezy and Gleebooks in relation to GST price exploitation, yet does not make such public claims of GST price exploitation by big businesses such as Woolworths and David Jones? Is it because the government does not want to upset its big business mates, particularly when one of them is the chairman of the Business Coalition for Tax Reform?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Exploitation</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-06-06,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I find that answer quite inadequate. It would appear to me that the camouflaging that you have the business community do is continuing and has continued for some time. My question to you, clearly, was: why have public examples been made of stores like Video Ezy and Gleebooks, yet you let Woolies and DJs off the hook?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Exploitation</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-06,"—I think it is a bit of a pity that Senator Hutchins was not at the Senate estimates. I do not often say it is a pity that someone was not there, because I think it was a pity that a number of people were there. Senator Hutchins, this was very extensively canvassed at the Senate estimates hearings. I will arrange for my office to forward you a copy of the Senate Hansard, if you tell me that you are unable to find it yourself. If I get that information from you, I will follow through on that issue.
On to the specifics of the question: is the government worried about upsetting big business? Have you not been reading the papers recently, Senator? I would have to say that big business is never backwards in coming forward about its views on various issues. If I remember correctly, big business has made some comments. Some individuals, who I will not name in the parliament—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Persistent shouting is disorderly.
—Quite right, Madam President. It is very hard to give a detailed answer to Senator Hutchins's question while this sort of abuse continues. Senator Hutchins clearly has not been reading the newspapers or he would not have asked a question that said that the government was afraid to take on big business when it has to. I repeat: when it has to. I refer to the comments by some elements in big business about the ACCC, so the overall premise of your question falls over.
Let me make it clear that the Labor Party have a totally confused position in relation to the ACCC. Sometimes they think the ACCC has too much power, and sometimes they think the ACCC does not have enough power. Both these particular lines are run concurrently. Senator Hutchins, I invite you to read the Hansard.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-06-06,"—I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an answer to a question which Senator West asked me yesterday in relation to expenditure on GST related promotion in relation to the Family and Community Services portfolio.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator West asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 5 June 2000:
 (1) For financial years 1999-2000, 2000-01, 2001-02 and 2002-03 what funds has the Department of Family and Community Services budgeted to spend on GST related promotion, education and/or advertising?
Senator Herron—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1) The amount that the Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS) has currently committed to spend on paid advertising to inform Australians about the tax reform changes it is implementing is $3.6m in 1999-00. The cost of the FaCS TV and press advertising (which includes NESB and indigenous advertising) is a modest amount given that it is aimed directly at around 8 million people and indirectly at the broader community as a whole, many of whom are required to return forms to receive correct payments.
The cost of a direct mail product to inform families about changes to family assistance was $378,450 in 1999-00.
For 1999-00, FaCS has budgeted around $100,000 to educate external service providers about FaCS' 2000-01 GST-related requirements for funding. It has also budgeted around $750,000 for its child care service provider education strategy and a further $50,000 for general community sector education activities.
$lm has been allocated to FaCS for tax reform education and advertising in 2000-01. 
No funds have been allocated for 2001-02 or 2002-03.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Information</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-06,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 576.
I note at the outset the objection to this matter being voted upon by the Labor Party and its previously stated reasons for that. However, this motion simply notes an event and an expression of a wish by the unanimous assembly of 3,000 delegates held in Jayapura, the capital of West Papua, in the last week for independence for the purpose of establishing the future of West Papua. I also note that the Labor Party has on the Notice Paper a very important motion relating to the overthrow of democracy in Fiji and in the Solomon Islands. I inform the Senate that the Greens will not be blocking the passage of that motion to a vote because it is quite proper that the Senate should vote on such a matter. We do not take the prescriptive attitude of the Labor Party, allowing the Senate to move expeditiously on matters of urgent importance so that messages can be sent where they need to be to intervene on behalf of democracy, human rights and the environment elsewhere in the world.
If this motion were successful, it would simply be a motion letting the Indonesian authorities, including President Wahid, know that the Australian Senate recognises that the meeting of West Papuan leaders took place and that they decided to call for independence. Of itself, the motion is not an endorsement of that call, although I as a Green member of parliament thoroughly endorse the right of the West Papuan people to their day in the sun, their human rights, their right to independence and, basically, their right to self-determination. Is the coalition or the opposition going to stand here today and deny two million West Papuans their right to self-determination? I have a lot of respect for the President of Indonesia, President Wahid, but if reports in today's Australian press are correct, wherein he said that the majority of West Papuans are opposed to independence, I start to see that respect eroded.
President Wahid knows, like successive Australian governments have known, that that is not true. Everybody knows. Recent documents relating back to the awesome events of the 1960s, when the Australian government turned its back on the aspirations of West Papuans, make it very clear that Australian delegates in West Papua knew that more than 95 per cent of West Papuans wanted their independence. Yet it went along with the sham that denied these people that right. These are our nearest neighbours. This is a nation that has had its rights suppressed. It is time Australian politicians had the backbone to stand up for democratic rights, human rights and aspirations for self-determination when people express them. I find it a total derogation of commitment by the members of the big parties in this place to the basic and fundamental aspiration for freedom, endorsed by the Australian people, when they repeatedly deny the aspirations of the West Papuan people, our nearest neighbours.
I am going to push this debate in this place. I will not have our backs turned on these people. They deserve their right to express their own opinions. And if President Wahid is right and the majority do not want independence, let him put it to a referendum as well.",SENATE,<title>CONGRESS OF 3000 WEST PAPUANS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-06-06,"—The opposition do oppose formality of this motion. As Senator Brown indicated, the reasons we oppose the passage without debate of a motion have been stated a number of times. Simply put, the Labor Party will not be supporting this motion. I understand the government will not be supporting this motion. In relation to Senator Brown's contribution, there is nothing that indicated this motion was urgent. The Labor Party are quite happy to debate this motion in the general business time that Senator Brown might devote to this when his opportunity arises. He is quite at liberty to do that. But there is nothing in Senator Brown's contribution that indicated why this matter is urgent. It is, after all, simply asking the Senate to acknowledge the statement that is attributed to the Congress of West Papuans. But, of course, the acknowledgment of that by the Senate would have ramifications beyond the determination by the West Papuans. Simply put, we will not be supporting the suspension and Senator Brown will have the opportunity to pursue this matter at another time, because it clearly is not urgent. 
Question resolved in the negative.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I move opposition amendment No. 1:
(1)	Page 2 (after line 5), after clause 3, insert:
4 Review of operation of Act
	(1)	The Minister must cause an independent review of the operation of gap cover schemes to be undertaken as soon as practicable after 1 July 2002.
	(2)	A person who undertakes such a review must give the Minister a written report of the review.
	(3)	The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of the Parliament not later than 31 December 2002.
	(4)	In this section:
independent review means a review undertaken by persons who:
	(a)	in the Minister's opinion possess appropriate qualifications to undertake the review; and
	(b)	include one or more persons who are not employed by a registered organization, the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority and have not, since the commencement of this Act, provided services to a registered organization, the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under or in connection with a contract.
This amendment seeks to insert a clause providing for the review of the operation of the act. A concern that was raised by many people during the Senate inquiry was that the proposed gap cover schemes were a bit of an unknown quantity and it was unclear how they would work in practice. The principal concern was that the schemes would result in fee inflation and, as a consequence, push up health insurance premiums. The doctors argued that this was not the intention and that if this happened the scheme would have failed. Consumers, however, were concerned that the benefits of gap schemes would not be delivered and that a form of financial consent would not be provided. 
The Catholic Health Association proposed a review of the scheme after 12 months, while the Australian Health Insurance Association went further and wanted a sunset clause on the arrangements to ensure that there was a greater incentive for doctors to moderate their negotiating position. The opposition has considered both arguments and has decided that the gap cover schemes need a longer period to prove themselves but that a full review is necessary to ensure that the goals set out for gap cover schemes are in fact achieved. The medical community needs to be on notice that the obligation lies with them to get gap cover schemes to work.
The proposed mechanism in our amendment is that an independent inquiry be established after two years of operation—that is, in July 2002—and that a written report be provided by the minister to parliament by December of that year. This broad review is separate to the minister's power to individually review schemes which fail to comply with their conditions of approval. The intention is that the two-year review should look at the broad picture and examine whether gap cover schemes have achieved a sufficient market penetration. The government has set no target for the anticipated penetration of no gap and known gap schemes by which the review could judge the success of those schemes. Currently, about 16 per cent of all claims are made as part of the existing no gap schemes. The opposition would hope that, if these schemes were successful in the way that their promoters have argued, over 50 per cent of all medical claims by mid-2002 would be part of these schemes.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-06-06,"—Madam Chair, as this is the start of the committee stage of this legislation, I would like to say something in a broad sense whilst supporting the proposal that has been made by the opposition for the legislation. I think that, as has been recognised in the debate thus far, the legislation, although recognising the need for medical gap cover by health funds, still lacks the rigorous framework which will provide certainty for customers when they approach medical specialists. This is one of the things that I have been concerned about for some considerable time. In other words, the legislation does not guarantee that doctors will provide no gap cover. Consumers will still be at the mercy of their particular specialist's disposition as to whether to provide the no gap cover. The absence of a contract or commercial arrangement between the health fund and the medical specialist will mean that, at best, the benefit for consumers will arise out of the operations of the health care market. People who are sick are not at their best as consumers in the health care market—we all know that. They are at the mercy of their specialists and do not have the capacity, or even the time, to shop around to find those specialists who will provide them with medical gap cover. That is particularly the case where specialist services are very limited—for example, in the regional areas. It is important that legislation such as this should safeguard consumers and not defer to the orthodoxy of market economics as the solution.
There is an inconsistency in this legislation with the imperative that hospitals and health funds must have contractual arrangements. There is no logical reason whatsoever why health funds and doctors are not treated in the same fashion as hospitals and health funds to ensure that no gaps exist for consumers. It is common knowledge that doctors already provide pensioners and other low income people with bulk-billed private services. This means, of course, that those consumers pay no gap. This legislation will actually increase the payment to doctors for these consumers for no extra gain to consumers—the status quo will remain. Doctors' reimbursements will increase. This will put significant inflationary pressure on the eventual price of health insurance. As we know, increased prices for health insurance become counterproductive in attracting people to insurance.
We will need to monitor the uptake of gap cover products by doctors to ensure that there are more consumers, other than those who are already receiving bulk-billed services, actually being offered no gap cover to justify, even in a minimal way, this legislation. I notice that Senator Evans is proposing, in the amendment that is currently before us, a review of the operation of the act. That will be absolutely essential to see whether people are playing the game properly. But the legislation does lack any robust mechanism to monitor the inflationary impact of medical gap cover. There is a very real danger that doctors will offer medical gap cover to patients and consumers whom they previously have bulk-billed and will only offer known gap cover to other consumers in order to maximise their reimbursements. Both these trends will lead to the overall inflation of private health costs and will place increasing pressure on opening up new gaps in medical fees. The government has not accompanied this legislation with a sensible and workable mechanism to monitor the inflationary impacts and to put in place a far more sound and reasonable commercial arrangement that not only provides consumers with more certainty but will better manage the inflationary pressures this legislation brings to the fore. Senator Evans's amendment relating to the review of the operation of the act will, I hope, set some sort of machinery in motion by which the minister will be required to have an independent reviewer undertake a review of the operation of gap cover schemes after this measure has been in operation for 12 months, or is it two years, Senator Evans?
—Two years—in 2002.
—The independent review is defined as one undertaken by persons who `in the Minister's opinion possess appropriate qualifications to undertake the review' and it will `include one or more persons who are not employed by a registered organisation, the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority'. I support that. I am just wondering whether it should be after a year's operation and whether the committee, on reflection, would consider that to be appropriate. Other than that, I would be interested to hear why it is necessary for the review not to take place until after two years of operation.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-06-06,"—I appreciate that Senator Harradine has taken this opportunity to raise various issues and to alert us to his concerns. They are similar in some respects to those issues raised yesterday in the second reading debate by Senators Evans, Crowley and Lees, and most of those issues were addressed. I would refer Senator Harradine to my response at the end of the second reading debate last evening when I did address most of those particular issues.
As a result of the consideration of this legislation and of the issues and concerns that have been raised by the Democrats and the Labor Party, I am in a position to indicate that the government this afternoon is inclined to accept the amendments put forward by the Democrats and the amendments proposed by the Labor Party with the exception of No. 6, which has a particular constitutional effect in that area. Senator Harradine, can I refer you to yesterday evening's debate with respect to most of the issues you have raised. Monitoring the gap cover, the inflationary aspects and the certainty with regard to medical specialists were certainly addressed in the course of the discussion. I will need to seek a bit more advice on the point that you raised in your last paragraph about the time schedule, but I will certainly put that into the debate.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I will respond to Senator Harradine on the question of the time period while the parliamentary secretary is getting advice. In addressing some remarks to the amendment, I said that we had thought about it, because there are a couple of propositions on this issue. I think the Catholic Health Association suggested a time period of 12 months. A couple of other parties had various other propositions, including a sunset clause. On balance, we took the view that two years would allow a proper period for the schemes to work before a review and that 12 months might be a bit short. I do not think we would die in a ditch over it, but on balance we came to the view that two years would allow a good period of time in which a proper assessment could be made and that 12 months might be a bit on the short side in terms of making that proper assessment. These things are arbitrary, as you know.
Also, we wanted to note that the minister has the ability to review and approve individual schemes and that that sort of process will be ongoing. This is more of a look at the overall measure and at how the system is performing. On balance, we thought that the two years would be the appropriate measure. As I said, I do not think anyone is particularly wedded to that, but the consensus that has emerged is that two years might be an appropriate time period. I have not been ordered to die in a ditch over the particular period, but the consensus was for two years.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-06-06,"—I wish to comment on the Democrats' support for this particular amendment. I believe we need to review the success or otherwise of changes to the private health insurance regime and this gap cover scheme. I agree with some of the comments from Senator Harradine relating to some of the vagaries of how it will operate. I think it is quite important that there is a review. But I support Senator Evans in his comments about where the time falls. There will be a period of adjustment, both by the medical profession and by the community generally, and therefore we will be supporting the proposal that there be a two-year period before there is a review.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech

If anything was particularly brought to the minister's attention or was abnormal, the minister could review the situation. But on the initial start-up of this part of the legislation, I agree with Senator Evans that a two-year period, bridging financial years and addressing other considerations, is probably initially the appropriate one.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I move opposition amendment No. 2:
(2)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 4 (after line 19), before section 73BDD, insert:
73BDDA  Purpose of gap cover schemes
		The purpose of a gap cover scheme is to enable a registered organisation to offer insurance coverage for the cost of particular hospital treatment and associated professional attention for the person or persons insured where:
	(a)	the cost of the treatment or attention is greater than the Schedule fee (within the meaning of Part II of the Health Insurance Act 1973) for the treatment or attention; and
	(b)	there is not a hospital purchaser-provider agreement, a medical purchaser-provider agreement or a practitioner agreement between the registered organisation and the service provider concerned; and
	(c)	the person insured pays a specified amount or percentage under a known gap policy or the full cost of the treatment or attention is covered under a no gap policy.
The bill inserts various sections into the Health Insurance Act 1973. The most significant sections form a new division, 4A. The problem in our view is that none of the new sections spells out exactly what a gap cover scheme is meant to be. There are several important criteria advanced by the proponents of these schemes which are not otherwise written into the bill. The purpose of this amendment is to crystallise the objectives of gap cover schemes so that it is apparent to those who have not been a party to the process of the development of the bill, including the Senate inquiry, what the purposes are. We think that the amendment gives more clarity to the bill, spells out exactly the purpose of gap cover schemes and is a useful amendment.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech

(3)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 5 (line 12), at the end of subsection (5), add:
	; or (d)	an index or method for measuring the inflationary impact of gap cover schemes on the total cost of treatment and the rise in private health insurance premiums.
As things get carried much more quickly if I do not speak for long, I might take that as a sign. However, I want to make a few remarks on this amendment. This amendment inserts a regulation specifying what an inflationary im-pact is. We see one of the basic risks of gap cover schemes—in the form that they are pro-vided for in this bill—as being that they might have an inflationary impact on doctors' fees and health insurance premiums. This is a subject that I covered at length in my speech during the second reading debate. These schemes will only work if both sides are restrained and if additional payments made by health funds above the Medicare schedule fee are offset by a reduction or elimin-ation of gap charges above the level of refund.
All the parties who appeared before the Sen-ate legislation committee hearing said that they were strongly committed to this prin-ciple. Dr Brand of the AMA said, as I quoted in my speech during the second read-ing debate, that if there was an inflationary effect the schemes would have failed and the minister would be entitled to revoke them. The opposition welcomes those statements of commitment and is willing to support this leg-islation on the understanding that there will not be an inflationary impact. However, there is a major problem in that nowhere is an inflationary impact defined. Health funds and doctors have no guidance as to what is an acceptable level of increase or how the combined impact of premium rises and changes in gap payments is to be judged.  
This amendment provides for the minister to adopt regulations to specify and index a method for assessing the inflationary impact of schemes and will ensure that all parties are put on a level footing. It is important that the health funds know in advance what degree of latitude they have to negotiate and it is important for doctors to be able to assess the extent to which gap fees will need to be amended under a known gap scheme where the health fund is making a payment above the MBS rate. Without the regulations provided for through this amendment, there would be no benchmark and potentially no cap on what some would argue to be non-inflationary. So we think this is a very important amendment to deal with this question of the inflationary impact. We do not want to see any benefits from this eaten away by measures which will drive up inflation and drive up the cost of premiums or the cost of medical services. We think it is a very important amendment, and we hope to get support of this chamber for it.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech

In-deed, we will be moving an amendment after this to further deal with the issue of inflation, because it is not just a risk for patients, it is also a risk for the public purse. If fee inflation does occur, we will get higher costs to consumers and, with the 30 per cent rebate in operation, we will see that the government will be expending considerably more in their rebate program. So I think this is certainly necessary. As I said, I will deal with it further in a moment when we move another amendment to deal further with this issue.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-06-06,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 1:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 5 (lines 13 to 18), omit subsection (6), substitute:
	(6)	Without limiting the criteria to be specified in regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (5)(b), criteria must include the following:
	(a)	the provision of particulars sufficient to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Minister, that the operation of the gap cover scheme for which approval is sought will not have an inflationary impact;
	(b)	the requirement that a person providing hospital treatment or associated professional attention under a gap cover scheme for which approval is sought must disclose to the insured person any financial interest that the first-mentioned person has in any products or services recommended or given to the insured person.
This amendment is in two parts. I want to deal with these parts separately now. Part (a) is the one I just mentioned as we were dealing with the related amendment from the ALP. Our amendment actually requires that regulations be made under this bill to include specific provisions related to inflation. In other words, basically the Minister for Health and Aged Care has to be satisfied that these schemes will not be fee inflationary before approval is actually given for that particular scheme. I think it is very important that the schemes are monitored as to their inflationary impact.
In the second part of our amendment we are dealing with an issue that just over the last couple of years has become a bigger and bigger issue which has been raised with us by a number of people in the medical profession and also by consumer groups. This is the concern that, where someone in themedical profession refers on to another, perhaps a specialist, for an additional consultation, there be no financial interest, that the first-mentioned person does not have any financial interest in the product or service that he or she is recommending people move on and receive. Under this legislation we can attach this only to the gap cover issue, but we will in future legislation be attaching it more broadly to health legislation so that this applies more broadly across the board in the health field. It is to deal with the problem of vertical integration.  
Looking at the difficulty this government and past governments have had containing costs in a number of areas, legislation was brought in under the last Labor government dealing with practices by doctors that were in fact overservicing. I believe we have a real issue growing where the drive for overservicing is not so much at the provision of service end but at the end where we have a referral based on a commercial interest. In other words, we are backtracking to look at the vertical integration in the health system. I have to stress here that obviously the vast majority of medical professionals would consider only the patient's best interest, but the possibility is there that financial concerns can at least influence where the patient is sent for the next round of diagnostic tests or for the operation. So I think the second part of this amendment is vital to make sure that Australia does not head down the road that some others have headed down in the area of private medicine.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-06-06,"—As I mentioned in the debate earlier, the government will be accepting the amendment proposed by the Democrats. As Senator Lees has said, that is in two parts. I repeat the comments that I made last night, particularly for Senator Harradine, with regard to the issues of the inflationary impact. I said last evening:
The approval process provided for in the legislation contains a number of protective measures that will ensure that gap cover schemes deliver maximum benefit to consumers. Most importantly, the legislation ensures that no scheme will be approved unless the health fund can demonstrate that it will not have an inflationary impact. This information will have to be provided to the minister in detail in the fund's application for scheme approval. It is worth noting that this legislation introduces protective mechanisms that do not apply to current agreements to address the gap. The current measures to address the gap which were introduced by the opposition do not address the issue of the inflationary impact at all. In contrast, this measure has been designed very deliberately to ensure that inflationary impacts are not felt throughout the health system as a result of measures to address the gap. 
I believe that we can therefore accept the amendment that has been put forward, which reinforces that particular point.
The second part of the Democrat amendment, which deals with the area of requiring a doctor providing hospital treatment under a gap cover scheme to disclose to the insured person any financial interest that the doctor has in any products and services recommended or given to the insured person, the government accepts.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-06,"—On behalf of the Labor opposition, I indicate that we also support this amendment. I have already discussed the question of the inflationary impact. That part of the amendment is consistent with the approach which Labor has taken to the bill. I also think that the provision about declaration of other interests is very useful. It is an issue I took up with the department and the HIC in Senate estimates a week or so ago, regarding some complaints about activity going on in Western Australia in particular about corporatisation of health, the role of GPs and their relationship to other services. It is an emerging issue in medicine in this country. I think the principles contained in the Democrat amendment are worthy ones which will be useful in ensuring that the needs of the patient is the paramount issue in determining other services, rather than the corporate relationship of the parties involved. We support the amendment as a useful addition.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I move:
(4)	Schedule 1, item 6 (after line 18), at the end of section 73BDD, add:
	(7) The Minister must not approve a gap cover scheme unless the scheme provides for insured persons to be informed, where the circumstances make it appropriate, of any amounts that the person can reasonably be expected to pay for treatment. 
I understand there will be a Democrat amendment to my amendment, which I will be supporting, just to confuse the situation. Over the last day or so, there has been a series of negotiations between the various parties about trying to get as much agreement as we can on this bill. That has been a very positive process. I would like to thank the government, the Democrats and Senator Harradine for their involvement in that process. I have seen a draft of the Democrats' amendment to our amendment. Provided it is what I think it is—
 (Senator Hogg)—If you can assist us by speaking for a few more minutes, the amendment has just arrived.
—I will not speak for too long. I have formally moved my amendment and that is important for the formal process. I wanted to say at the outset that we are likely to be in thunderous agreement, but there will be amendments to this amendment. The intention is to make clear that all gap cover schemes must include provisions for informed financial consent of patients. This has been a very important issue and was a very important issue in the Senate inquiry. We think this will ensure that, where the circumstances are appropriate, the patient will be told in advance what they can reasonably expect to pay—a very important principle.
There has been a lot of discussion about exactly how this provision should be expressed. We make it clear that we think it is preferable that we provide it in writing and we have supported that view. The Democrat amendment, as I understand, will help reinforce that. We acknowledge that there are circumstances when that is not possible. At the Senate inquiry, we had a debate where I and other senators tried to tease out how we could handle this issue. It is one of those things where everyone is in favour but it is very hard to get people to move on the issue because the practicalities are difficult. We are very keen to make a move on the practicalities because one of the major complaints about health insurance and gap payments is where patients are faced with bills that they were not anticipating. This undermines confidence in health insurance and puts great stress on the patient and their families when they are having to deal with bills that they did not know were coming. We think it is reasonable that patients should be told in advance what the anticipated costs would be. It is time the profession came to terms with that and worked to make sure that, as much as possible, that occurs. This could be part of the gap cover scheme. It is an important step towards full, informed financial consent. Having formally moved our amendment No. 4, I forewarn that I am likely to vote for the Democrat amendment to that amendment.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-06-06,"—This is an issue which the Democrats have been concerned about for a considerable period of time and, indeed, which successive governments have negotiated bit by bit in various ways, as we did recently. Information is now available in leaflet form through Medicare offices, telling people, basically, that thanks to a number of court cases, they should be provided with information in all circumstances if there is going to be an additional charge. Now we have the opportunity in this legislation to specifically require, for gap cover schemes, that information is provided to, as it reads here, `insured persons'. The amendment I will be moving is to insist that this is done in writing. I think that is the logical way to do it. After all, if one has a plumber into one's home, it is expected that we get some sort of a written quote. Indeed, virtually all professionals work on the system that you get a written estimate of what it is going to cost, so that you do not sign up for what you think is $35, only to get a $300 bill appearing in the mail. The benefits are for patients and for the private health insurance system generally. If we can get rid of the surprise $1,000-odd bills, then the reputation of private health insurance will improve. 
The second amendment we will be moving is to the end of this amendment, to make sure that the insured person does acknowledge receipt of the advice. The final version, as the Democrats would like to see it, would read: 
(7) The Minister must not approve a gap cover scheme unless the scheme provides for insured persons to be informed in writing, where the circumstances make it appropriate, of any amounts that the person can reasonably be expected to pay for treatment and the insured person acknowledges receipt of the advice.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-06-06,"—I am not too sure where we are at.
—I have flagged the amendments.
 (Senator Hogg)—They have not been moved, nor has Senator Lees sought leave to move those two amendments together. That is where we are at in the debate, Senator Harradine.
—I indicate my support for the foreshadowed amendments to Senator Evans's amendment. The issue here is whether the minister is to approve a gap cover scheme and whether he is to approve it without proper information being supplied to the patient, the insured person. Senator Evans's proposal is:
The Minister must not approve a gap cover scheme unless the scheme provides for insured persons to be informed—
as Senator Lees quite correctly says, in writing—
where the circumstances make it appropriate, of any amounts that the person can reasonably be expected to pay for treatment.
Senator Lees adds:
“and the insured person acknowledges receipt of the advice”.
The reason I am on my feet to ask a question of the proposer, and perhaps of the government as well if it is in mind to support this amendment, is that the amendment says, `where the circumstances make it appropriate'. The question in my mind is: when are the circumstances not appropriate and who is to determine that? Obviously, if a person is unconscious or in an exceptional situation, then of course the person could not receive the information and therefore could not acknowledge it. I am wondering whether I could have any advice from the parliamentary secretary or from the mover of the motion as to precisely what is meant by `where circumstances make it appropriate'. Does it really mean unless exceptional circumstances prevail where, for example, the consumer is not in a position to receive the information and to effectively acknowledge it?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-06-06,"—by leave—I move:
(1)	Subsection 73BDD(7), after “informed”, insert “in writing”.
(2)	At the end of subsection 73BDD(7), add “and the insured person acknowledges receipt of the advice”.
This is the issue that we have been hung up on probably for at least the last 10 years. You can go down one of two routes. You can go down the route of the detailed regulations in which you specify every single time you think it is definitely necessary, perhaps have a list of where it is probably necessary or possibly necessary and have another list where you acknowledge, as Senator Harradine just said, when someone is unconscious. Obviously if you are being wheeled into the emergency department, you are not going to be able to know what you are likely to be charged. Indeed, the procedure could be quite complex. But there are other times when it is extremely difficult, particularly up-front at the initial consultation, to give advice on anything other than that initial consultation. This often relates to times when someone actually has to go in for a lengthy period of rehabilitation. Who knows, it might take a fortnight to get over a smashed leg or it might take three months of rehabilitation. You also have other issues where there is exploratory surgery or there are various procedures done with just an understanding that these may proceed immediately to surgery and that possibly this would be the amount. The discussions that have been going on and the eventual position taken—and this is now accepted by the AMA—is to move to the other end and to leave it open and vague, to be understood. We have some other amendments on this issue, which we can talk about later, but in this particular instance the wording of `appropriate' is where we have got to in terms of the broad understanding that it is really `if at all possible' but we do not want to start having to define `possible'.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-06-06,"—It is important to acknowledge that, in trying to reach this compromise on an amendment that satisfies the criteria which the minister must take into account in the approval, the refinements now being proposed through these amendments enhance that and mean that the minister—as we have done already through substantiating the inflationary issues—must therefore be assured by the sponsor proponent of the scheme that, wherever practical, all of these issues apply. Senator Harradine raises an issue with regard to the phrase `where the circumstances make it appropriate'. That is seen as very much the exceptional circumstance of the car accident, when there are unforeseen and inevitable consequences that cannot be met in that particular circumstance. My advice is that it is attempting to make sure that that point is well and truly covered and does not hinder the application of the appropriate medical attention at that particular point. But, certainly, the intent with regard to the gap cover is that you do have available to the minister in approving the scheme initially a commitment by the sponsors that they will accept that the proposal must be in writing and acknowledged by the patient.
 (Senator Hogg)—The question is that amendments (1) and (2) moved by Senator Lees be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—The question is that amendment (4) moved by Senator Evans, as amended, be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 5 and 7 together:
(5)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 6 (after line 22), after section 73BDE, insert:
73BDEA  Regulations
		Subject to section 73BDE, the regulations may make provision relating to the operation and regulation of gap cover schemes approved by the Minister.
(7)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 5 (line 19) to page 6 (line 22), omit section 73BDE, substitute:
73BDE  Review and revocation of gap cover schemes
	(1)	Subject to regulations made for the purposes of this subsection, each registered organization must provide an annual report to the Minister and the Council in respect of any gap cover scheme that it operates.
	(2)	Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1):
	(a)	must provide for the form and content of each report; and
	(b)	must provide for the date by which each report is to be provided to the Minister and to the Council; and
	(c)	may provide for the Minister to permit the provision of a report after the date provided for under paragraph (b) in specified circumstances; and
	(d)	may provide for the initial report in respect of a gap cover scheme to be provided in respect of a period of more or less than a year in circumstances specified in the regulations; and
	(e)	may provide for reporting on the proportion of cases in which advice about the expected costs of treatment was provided to insured persons in advance.
	(3)	Where a scheme fails to perform in accordance with:
	(a)	the requirements of paragraph 73BDD(6)(b); or
	(b)	any prescribed criteria for approval; or
	(c)	any condition imposed by the Minister;
the Minister must establish a review of the operation of the scheme to determine whether it should continue to operate, or continue to operate subject to further conditions.
	(4)	The Minister may revoke a scheme if:
	(a)	the Minister has established a review of the scheme under subsection (3); and 
	(b)	a period of 12 months has elapsed since the review was completed; and
	(c)	the scheme has failed to rectify any faults identified by the review.
	(5)	A registered organization may seek variation or revocation of a scheme in prescribed circumstances and the Minister may:
	(a)	approve such variations subject to any additional conditions that he or she thinks necessary to achieve the objects of gap free schemes; or
	(b)	revoke the scheme.
I have moved these amendments together because (5) is redundant if (7) is not carried. Basically, these amendments seek to replace some regulations which we think were inadequate in the original draft of the bill. The bill provides for annual reporting but it is vague about the procedure for revocation. This amendment will require that a review be undertaken if the annual report reveals that a scheme has failed to meet the criteria applying to the scheme in a significant way. Another unresolved issue is the extent of leniency to be provided in any one year if a fund is forced to push its premiums up by more than the inflationary amount. The Consumer Health Forum proposes that a fund should have a period to rectify problems if in one period the level of inflation is excessive. The amendments give the fund 12 months to fix a default if the performance is not achieved. We think that these amendments strengthen the original propositions in the bill dealing with the revocation of schemes failing criteria and that they improve the bill. I hope the amendments gain the support of the chamber.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I move opposition amendment No. 6:
(6)	Schedule 1, page 6 (after line 22), after item 6, insert:
6A  After section 73F
Insert:
73FA  Disclosure of costs
	(1)	A medical service provider who provides a service in a hospital or day hospital must provide the person in respect of whom the service is to be provided, or a person acting on that person's behalf, with a written estimate of any amount in excess of the Schedule fee (within the meaning of Part II of the Health Insurance Act 1973) that the person can reasonably expect to be charged for that service.
	(2)	A medical service provider must provide a written estimate under subsection (1);
	(a)	before the service is provided, if practicable; or
	(b)	if it is not practicable to provide a written estimate before the service is provided—as soon after the service is provided as the circumstances reasonably permit.
	(3)	If more than one medical service provider provides services to a person in respect of the treatment of that person's condition, one provider may provide the written estimate required under subsection (1) on behalf of all the medical service provider providing services to that person.
	(4)	If a medical service provider provides a written estimate on behalf of other medical service providers, the estimate must include all amounts in excess of the Schedule fee that the person can reasonably expect to be charged for the services provided by all the medical service providers concerned.
	(5)	The Minister may issue guidelines setting out the manner and form in which a written estimate of amounts under subsection (1) should be provided.
I understand that this is where my good run comes to an end. I do not think this will enjoy as much support around the chamber, from indications I have had. This amendment seeks to extend the application of informed financial consent to all doctors. It follows on from the amendments we have just carried relating to informed financial consent in terms of the gap schemes. We think this is important, as there is an irresistible consumer pressure for improvement in the current situation where patients are frequently not properly informed of the costs they might reasonably be expected to incur. In the previous amendment this principle was incorporated as a requirement for informed financial consent to be provided as part of a gap cover scheme. For some time, the AMA has endorsed the concept of informed financial consent and has done work among its members to build support.  
As I indicated earlier, the outgoing president, Dr David Brand, told the Senate committee that he supported informed financial consent extending stepwise from the current level of 50 per cent up to 95 per cent. The opposition supports this goal and believes that informed financial consent should not only be available to those who are members of no gap schemes; it should be available to all patients and, over a period of time, all doctors should become used to providing their patients with this advice on cost up-front. The opposition supports the right of doctors to negotiate their charges directly with patients, but the patient must know what the full cost is and they should have the option of looking elsewhere if they think the fee is unreasonable. I am disappointed that the AMA does not support this particular amendment despite the efforts that have been made to express it in terms that provide the doctors involved with considerable discretion and exclude the cases where informed financial consent cannot be given in an emergency situation or for other practical reasons, as raised by Senator Harradine. I understand, as I said earlier, that this amendment may not receive the support of others in the chamber today, but I hope that the concept that is involved will be further discussed and that in the future more progress is made towards all doctors providing informed financial consent to their patients, whether or not it is related to no gap schemes or otherwise.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-06-06,"—This is the one opposition amendment that we cannot support—that is, relating to the disclosure of costs. The government has had legal advice on this amendment, and that isessentially that the amendment has no constitutional basis. The Commonwealth has no general power to regulate the activities of doctors and, for this reason, the amendment is considered unconstitutional. The advice received by the government from the Australian Government Solicitor on this particular issue reads:
The Commonwealth Parliament, of course, has no general power to regulate the activities of doctors. The principal constitutional power relied upon by the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws in relation to doctors is paragraph 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution. That paragraph authorises laws with respect to the provision of (amongst other things) `pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorize any form of civil conscription)'. In referring to the `provision' of such benefits and services, the paragraph is referring to their provision by the Commonwealth (British Medical Association v The Commonwealth (1949) 79 CLR 201). It seems to me that proposed amendments (7) and (8) have no relevant nexus with the power conferred by paragraph 51(xxiiiA). To borrow from the judgment of Gibbs J in General Practitioners Society v The Commonwealth (1980) 14:5 CLR 532 at 559, the proposed amendments have `no necessary relationship with any pharmaceutical benefit or medical services provided by the Commonwealth'.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-06-06,"—This is the issue that we have come up against before in terms of what we can do under the Constitution. I just ask the minister if it is possible under the Constitution to link Medicare payments or the ability of a doctor to access the Medicare system—or perhaps to have a provider number—to certain requirements regarding informed financial consent to ensure that the patients they will be treating using this Medicare provider number know what they are likely to be up for. I can understand that the Constitution can be interpreted to mean that a doctor in private practice without any subsidy from anywhere can do what they like. But we are talking about medical professionals that get a very large percentage of their income, particularly if they are not working in the private hospital system, from the Commonwealth, from the public purse. So I ask the minister: is it possible to link the issue of informed financial consent to Medicare provider numbers?

This issue is not necessarily attached to the gap cover bill; this is a separate issue—one that has been pursued for years and one that Senator Harradine has taken a long-term interest in as well. We could get some specific instructions and details so that we know what it is possible to do, and we should do it as soon as we can.
I do not want to sink this bill if there is a constitutional question over this one amendment. Because of the way it is drafted, with so much power vested in the minister and so much oversight and control with the minister, this bill requires an enormous level of cooperation from the medical fraternity. Obviously they are still unhappy with this, and part of that comes back to some of the constitutional issues. I suggest to Senator Evans that this is unfinished business and we can get another round of advice, and perhaps this amendment can be moved to the next health bill that comes past us.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,10,1,speech

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I want to respond briefly to some of the comments made. I recognise that this amendment is one that could be pursued in other legislation. We thought it was important to push the case about these issues and this provided a good opportunity to take that up. We were debating how we might make the gap cover scheme work and what role the doctors would play in that, and informed financial consent is very important as part of that. Labor do not accept the minister's argument that it is unconstitutional. We think the government would have to provide much more evidence to support their claim. It is very easy to say, `It's unconstitutional,' and then plead that one is not a lawyer. I am not a lawyer, either, but our lawyers are not convinced. So I think it is an issue worth pursuing. This debate has shown that there is a real consumer interest in pursuing this issue and the Labor opposition will continue to pursue it.
I take the point Senator Lees makes that she does not want to hold up this bill on this particular measure. I can count, and we will be taking that into consideration. But we will be pursuing it in other legislation and we will be demanding a much better explanation from the government as to why we cannot pursue what are allegedly shared objectives. Our view is that this constitutional defence is not as watertight as some would believe and that we do have much more room to move here than the minister indicates. I read the mood of the chamber. I also flag that this is an issue that will not go away and that the Labor opposition will be pursuing. I welcome the Democrats' commitment to also pursue it.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I move opposition amendment No. 8:
(8)	Schedule 1, item 7, page 6 (after line 30), after paragraph (bc), insert:
	(bd)	to publish on the Internet, and make available for inspection at its offices, details of all gap cover schemes approved by the Minister under section 73BDD, including details of any terms and conditions that apply to the relationship between a registered organization and individual medical providers;
This relates to the publication of the details of schemes. Public knowledge of prices is one of the most important ways to combat inflation. The ACCC urged health funds to set up their own database of specialist fees for their members to access. It expressed serious concern about a case in Western Australia where a GP wrote to 20 specialists and only one offered details of the fees charged. Many witnesses at the Senate inquiry agreed that it was the intention that agreements should be public. There was concern, particularly, that agreements between the funds and doctors might contain hidden clauses that bind doctors to behave other than in accordance with best clinical practice, for financial reasons. This bill should make this clear. The availability of the Internet makes possible what some years ago might have been seen as a complex and bureaucratic obligation to disclose. The Private Health Insurance Administration Council has a good web site on which it already displays a range of important information about health insurance. It would be a simple task to post on this site all agreements approved by the minister and thereby achieve a high degree of transparency for the new arrangements. I believe that our amendment (8) provides that capacity for transparency, that it is a good consumer measure and that it would improve the bill. I urge the chamber to support the amendment.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-06-06,"—I, too, think this is an important amendment. I think the use of the Internet in this case is to be recommended. It is a valuable tool when one wants information to be readily available. It has been a long-term concern that it is very difficult to find out what exactly doctors charge. As Senator Evans says, there is a long history of GPs not being able to find information as to what radiology services or specialist services are going to charge their patients. If they have patients on low incomes, even getting information related to whether or not bulk-billing is possible has often been a feat beyond many GPs. I fully support this amendment.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-06,"—This tariff legislation amends the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Act 1988, the Excise Act 1901, the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the Fuel Blending (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997, the Fuel Misuse (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997 and the Fuel Sale (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997. It will replace references to specific excise tariff items in those acts with generic descriptions. The Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Administration Act 1997 will also be amended to improve the ability of the government to prosecute those that are undertaking the practice of fuel substitution. This is done by changing the definition of `fuel' to cover a broader range of products and by removing the requirement for the ATO to show that the alleged illegally blended fuel has entered into home consumption.
The story of this bill is a sad story of a government dropping the ball, of a government that is so badly mismanaging the affairs of the nation that Australian motorists have been put in danger, the environment has been polluted, and taxation revenues have been significantly affected. The story starts with fuel substitution rackets that involve rogue petrol stations adding toluene, which does not attract excise, to fuel. Toluene is essentially a paint solvent which, when added to fuel, reduces engine performance, can clog fuel injectors and can even lead to a total breakdown of engines. The extent of the fuel substitution rackets can be seen from the fact that 20 million tonnes of toluene were imported into this country in a period of four months—an amount that the paint industry itself would use in a period of 12 months.
Sadly, fuel substitution rackets have been going on for some time. In 1998, the federal government acknowledged the seriousness of the problem and announced that it was taking action to stamp out the problem. On 30 January 1998, the then minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, Warren Truss, issued a statement that the government would crack down on fuel substitution rorts which avoid paying customs or excise duty. The government stated that it would be implementing strict new laws to combat the loss of revenue and that it would stamp out dangerous and illegal practices resulting from fuel substitution. Penalties of up to $50,000 were introduced and Customs officers were given the power to enter premises to audit records and test fuels using specially equipped trucks.
We in the opposition supported the government's legislation, and even went so far as to congratulate them on it. In September 1997, Ralph Willis, the then member for Gellibrand, in a debate on the fuel substitution legislation told the House:
I also note that in the Budget the Government has also provided additional resources to the Customs Service to enable it to monitor the scheme, to investigate where fuel substitution is suspected and to take necessary action against offenders. That is very much supported by the Opposition in order to make sure that the scheme is effective.
By the following year, it appeared that the scheme of investigating petrol stations using special fuel investigation trucks was having some success. In an answer given to a question in the House of Representatives in June 1998, then Customs Minister Truss stated: 
Now these concessional fuels have a chemical marker placed in them that can be detected in a simple test. I am delighted to be able to report to the House that these measures have proved to be very successful.
He went on to say that the government were saving around $10 million a month from this measure—considerably more than the $25 million per annum they had expected to save. He offered the view that it is clear that the practice of substitution has been more widespread than previously thought. He said that $35 million worth of potential fuel fraud was under investigation. He concluded that:
... this legislation is a clear demonstration that this government is tough on tax cheats, but it is also concerned about the safety and security of consumers.
But following this early success, the problems began. After the last federal election, the federal government transferred customs excise functions to the Australian Taxation Office. This was part of the government's preparations for the introduction of the GST. While the Customs Service was committed to investigating fuel substitution rorts, it appears that the Australian Taxation Office was interested only in collecting excise.
Since July 1999, when the Australian Tax-ation Office took over direct management responsibility for fuel substitution, it has tested a total of 42 sites and found fuel substitution in eight of them. This is compared with the action of Customs, which reported in its 1998-99 annual report that it had carried out 551 site tests and found 52 positive instances of fuel substitution. Let me repeat that: the tax office tested a grand total of 42 sites. The Customs Service, when it was in charge, carried out 551 tests. That is a 90 per cent reduction in the level of testing. The tax commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, said:
The Tax Office is not responsible for the quality of fuel, only for ensuring that the correct excise is paid. Consumer protection matters are the responsibility of the states and territories. 
My colleague Mr Kelvin Thomson has questioned the government rigorously on the reduction in fuel substitution investigation and in particular what has happened to the fuel investigation trucks that were supposed to carry out the investigation. The issue was first raised by Mr Kelvin Thomson, MP, in March this year, when Senator Kemp was asked a simple and direct question about where the trucks were. It took until 16 May for an answer to be provided to this question—not through Senator Kemp but as an answer to questions put by Labor senators in the Senate inquiry into this bill. For the record, out of the initial seven trucks, only five remain. Given that only 42 investigations have been made since July 1999, we must question what the remaining five trucks have been used for. 
—Senator Kemp thought you were talking about a debt truck.
—We know they have got the debt truck in hiding, Senator Campbell. That is exactly right. The debt truck, as I think someone has said, has turned into a debt semitrailer. So you will not find a debt truck hiding anywhere.
—Maybe a road train.
—It is possibly a road train by now, Senator Campbell. There is no doubt that one of the main reasons why the problem of fuel substitution has spiralled out of control is the government's lack of commitment to investigating its incidence. For the last 18 months, concerns about growing fuel substitution rackets have been raised with the government. In particular, Liberty Oil raised concerns with Customs officials, Minister Vanstone, Senator Kemp and the Australian Taxation Office that fuel substitution rackets were out of control. I will quote from Liberty Oil's letter, dated 22 June 1999, to Senator Kemp. The letter states:
Despite bringing this practice by unscrupulous operators to the attention of relevant departments, for a number of reasons, one of which is the crossover of responsibility between the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Taxation Office, no effective preventative action has been taken. Given the scale of this avoidance we respectfully request your urgent attention and assistance. 
Liberty Oil's letter to Senator Vanstone is dated 16 June 1999 and states:
I would like to bring to your attention the well-known and widespread ongoing excise avoidance practice within the oil industry that continues to flourish and which remains unhindered.
Not only is there a continuing loss of excise duty sustained, estimated to be in excess of $300 million annually, but also there is an ongoing potential health risk together with a real risk of mechanical damage to consumers' property arising from the widespread practice of mixing solvents with motor fuels. The further possibility of carcinogenic substances entering diesel and motor fuels sold to the public exists.
Despite our continuing concerns, and following meetings held with the Australian Customs Service, we remain unconvinced that the Government has the intention to or has provided the necessary resources and means to actively prevent these practices from continuing to occur and expand.
These cries went unanswered for too long. What was Senator Vanstone doing? She is happy to stand in front of a drug bust. There is lots of publicity in a drug bust. But when it comes to standing in front of a petrol station, being caught substituting toluene for petrol, she is missing in action—no pretty pictures, no press conferences, no daring night-time raids, and nothing to add a bit of colour and movement to this issue for Senator Vanstone. As we all know, Senator Vanstone is desperate to get back in cabinet. If you cannot get any publicity, there is no press conference, no head on the nightly news, and no action. At the recent Senate inquiry into this bill, Mr Mark Kevin, the Chief Executive of Liberty Oil, was asked when he had brought the issue of fuel substitution to the government's attention and what had been their response. He stated:
It was not as quick as we would like. We started talking to the tax office well over 18 months ago and then we started writing to Senator Vanstone and the Assistant Treasurer Kemp. That was about April of last year. The reaction was too slow for us. We got letters back from the government saying that they were looking into it, that they were trying to do things about it. It was too slow.
There are a number of questions that we need to ask the government in respect of the fuel substitution debacle. Why did the government take so long to investigate the problem? Were they asleep at the wheel? Why did the government stop investigations into fuel substitution? According to the tax commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, the investigations were ineffective. He stated:
Previous attempts to deal with this through the use of special chemical markers and testing involving a fleet of trucks had, in our assessment, proved ineffective. 
That is a direct contradiction of Minister Truss; I have already read Minister Truss's quotes. Mr Carmody says they were ineffective and Minister Truss says they were very effective. The Australian Automobile Association has recently stated that it believes random testing by government is essential. 
At the recent Senate inquiry into the bill, Liberty Oil suggested that fuel substitution rackets cost taxpayers $400 million last year in lost excise. It seems pretty clear that a thorough program of inspection and detection will not cost the government money; it will save the government money.
There are a number of other questions that we would like to see the government answer with respect to the bill. What is the government's response to the Australian Paint Manufacturers Federation, which is concerned that it is unfair that the paint industry should have to bear the administrative costs of the excise legislation? How will the government stop unscrupulous operators substituting toluene for petrol, even after they have claimed the rebate? Without an effective investigations unit, how will the government know whether or not fuel substitution is occurring? Is it appropriate for the tax office to have responsibility for fuel excise if it is not committed to investigating fuel substitution rorts? Is the tax office unable to fulfil its wide range of duties effectively because it is concentrating on the implementation of the GST? It is fairly clear that a massive rort has been going on, but the tax office has been too involved in its own Keystone Cops debacles—their own maladministration of the ABN number and giving away taxpayers' legitimate details and emails breaching the privacy principles, as was enunciated by the Privacy Commissioner yesterday. The tax office is in a mess. 
This is a complete and utter abrogation of the tax office's responsibilities. They say to us, `Trust us on the diesel fuel rebate. Trust us on the petrol station rebates—we can manage those,' when it is perfectly clear that they are incapable of doing the jobs they have now, never mind their new ones. The bottom line is this: this government said it would crack down on fuel substitution and instead it transferred the relevant customer staff to the tax office, which have no inclination to do inspections and which have dropped the ball completely. Almost three years after the government first introduced legislation to stop fuel substitution rackets, the problem still remains. This has cost Australian taxpayers millions of dollars in lost revenue and has resulted in increased risks of car breakdown for Australian motorists.
Whilst the opposition support this bill, we believe it is essential that investigations into fuel substitution be reinstituted. Aside from the safety issues involved, excise evasion has cost the country millions of dollars in lost excise revenues. Even with the passage of this bill, we need to ensure that fuel substitution does not occur through other avenues. The government has acknowledged that it has a responsibility on this issue. It is time it acted on its responsibilities and sorted out the tax office.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-06,"—The Democrats support the main purpose of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, which amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995. We believe that the changes that these bills introduce will improve the health and safety of the community and improve the current excise regime for petroleum products. Dealing with tobacco first, the Democrats support the introduction of a per stick rate of tariff on lightweight tobacco products to discourage smoking of high volume lightweight cigarettes. For almost 100 years, the federal government has levied excise duty on cigarettes according to their weight. This differs from most other countries, I am advised, that levy cigarette excise on a per stick rather than a weight basis.
The weight based excise system was examined by the 1995 Senate community affairs committee inquiry entitled The tobacco industry and the costs of tobacco related illness. The inquiry heard evidence that the weight based excise system enabled manufacturers to minimise excise costs by reducing the weight of each cigarette and packaging more cigarettes into larger packs. Submissions by a number of health groups argued that these types of packs encouraged smokers to smoke more cigarettes and were comparatively more attractive to price sensitive smokers, especially young people and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
I am aware that the then Department of Human Services and Health was unable to find any evidence that changing to a per stick regime would have any health benefits. Given the impost on the tobacco industry that such a change would cause, it was important to assess whether or not the change would have those health benefits. The committee recommended that the National Health and Medical Research Council review the weight based system for calculating the cigarette excise. The government accepted that recommendation and instigated a review process which was subsequently overtaken by the review of the tax system announced by the government in 1998.
As part of the government's tax review process, the Tax Consultative Task Force consulted with a range of health and medical groups on the issue of cigarette excise. A coalition of health groups provided a joint submission to the task force, which argued that changing to a per stick levy would reduce rates of smoking, particularly in key target groups with higher smoking rates. The government incorporated this into a new tax system, the ANTS package, announced in August 1998. The Democrats support the details of the excise on cigarettes outlined in the ANTS package. These include a rate of 18.872c per stick to be applied to all cigarettes with a tobacco content up to and including 0.8 gm per cigarette. An excise of $235.90 per kilogram of tobacco will be applied to all other tobacco products. The government projected that, as a result of this excise, high volume low weight cigarettes will rise in price. As a result, price sensitive smokers are expected to reduce their level of tobacco usage—a straight elasticity relationship in an economist's language.  
As decades-long advocates against smoking, the Democrats strongly support this and other measures to discourage people from smoking. Tobacco usage is the single largest cause of preventable death and disease in Australia. It kills more than 19,000 people a year in this country. This is 25 per cent more deaths in one year than from breast cancer, melanoma, diabetes, suicide, road deaths, leukaemia, cirrhosis of the liver, falls, AIDS, murder, narcotics and drowning combined.
Unfortunately, Australia still has relatively high smoking rates, with approximately 25 per cent of the population classed as regular tobacco users. Any measure that has an assessed potential to reduce this unacceptably high smoking rate should be encouraged. The Democrats would like to congratulate the government for its recent campaign targeting young smokers. I hope it will be successful in reducing the smoking uptake among Australia's youth because, if you can stop the young people smoking, of course, you improve their health for the decades of life ahead of them. I would also urge all Australian governments—that is, all nine governments in this country—to continue to focus on this important health issue through a sustained commitment to ongoing education campaigns about the serious risks of smoking.
Moving to petroleum excise, the Democrats also support the changes these bills make to petroleum excise. We believe it is important to combat the substitution of low excise petroleum products for higher excise fuel. The government has found evidence that this practice is becoming increasingly more common, and so this measure is timely to prevent it from spreading any further. It is important to be clear that the substitution of petroleum products is illegal and, in some cases, can be dangerous. The Democrats support the differential excises on petroleum products, depending upon the intended end use of the product. We were always very strong supporters of the non-leaded fuel differential. We believe there are environmental and social gains from imposing a relatively higher tariff rate on fuels intended for on-road use, such as diesel fuel and petrol. We support lower tariffs for fuel sold for non-transport uses, such as heating oils and kerosene, and the current exemptions for petroleum products sold for non-fuel use, such as solvents. It is unfortunate that the differential tariff rates have been exploited to avoid excise duty on transport fuels through the substitution or unauthorised blending of lower excise petroleum products. This has resulted in a loss of government revenue which, of course, could be used to provide much needed services such as hospitals and schools, which are always a demand on government revenue.
The practice of randomly blending or substituting fuels for on-road use can cause damage to vehicle engines, with potentially dangerous consequences. It is vital that this practice be stopped to protect consumers who unwittingly fill their cars with contaminated fuel. So it is a safety issue as well as a revenue issue. To stop that practice does not require just legislation; it requires attention to enforcement measures, and that was the focus of much of Senator Conroy's remarks. The Democrats have previously supported amendments to excise and customs legislation to address this issue. For example, we supported the 1993 reforms, which required the licensing of all premises that blend petroleum oil products, including refineries and service stations. As a result of this legislation, these businesses were also required to pay duty on the blended substances at either the diesel or the leaded petrol rate. The Democrats also supported the 1998 legislative changes, which enabled a chemical tracer to be added to fuels that attract concessional rates of excise duty. This has made it much easier for the Australian Customs Service to detect when these products are blended with, or substituted for, excisable fuel—at least, I am told that it has made it much easier.
From July 1999, responsibility for excise functions, including those related to fuel substitution matters, was transferred from Customs to the Australian Taxation Office. I am previously on record as remarking that that is a desirable move from a policy point of view, but it has to be accompanied by at least equivalent enforcement measures to those that Customs was able to employ. You cannot take on the responsibility without the obligation for enforcement. I hope that the ATO has learnt from the furore surrounding this issue that it needs to be more vigilant in monitoring and enforcing such legislation as is now before us to ensure that consumers are not put at risk from contaminated fuel and to ensure that the Commonwealth is not put at risk from the loss of revenue. 
The Democrats support the additional measures proposed by these bills to further refine the tariff regime. We believe that the three main changes proposed are sensible and that they will contribute to a more robust regulatory regime. We welcome the support from the opposition for the government's measures, as indicated in their minority report to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report on these bills. I also acknowledge that the opposition have expressed strong concerns about the bills, as raised in their minority report and in their remarks today, including the division of responsibility between the ATO and Customs in monitoring and investigating cases of fuel substitution, and I share the concerns of the opposition that the ATO does not yet appear to have given fuel substitution sufficient priority in terms of protecting the revenue base. I know, as one of the authors of the legislation we are dealing with, that they have been extremely busy over the past 12 months. However, the purpose of the Senate and the parliament in passing legislation is to keep them even busier as time goes by. So I would urge them to exercise as much vigilance in this area as possible. (Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-06,"—We are dealing with the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 and Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. The first matter I want to raise in respect of the legislation is that apparently there is no cost to revenue in the legislation. I would have thought that it would be possible for the minister to make that information available. The legislation does involve some changes to the excise arrangements for certain categories of alcohol. I do not disagree with the thrust of those changes but it seems to me that there will be some additional revenue as a result of recategorisation of some areas.
I think it is important to look at the history in chronological order of the matters relating to what has become known as the beer controversy. We are dealing here with excise legislation and, obviously, this has an important impact on the price of beer to consumers in this country. Firstly, I want to go back to the so-called ANTS package which purported to outline the impacts of the tax changes that the government put to the Australian people prior to the last election. In that ANTS package it was indicated that the price of beer was to go up by 1.9 per cent. Of course, you had to read that document quite carefully to identify the fact that apparently the 1.9 per cent referred to packaged beer. In the election campaign on a number of occasions the Prime Minister was questioned about the impact of a GST on the price of beer. There are, I think, two occasions when the Prime Minister was asked—
—Only two?
—Only two that I can find, but they were very important references to the price of beer. One was in response to Alan Jones on 14 August 1990 when the Prime Minister said, `There will be no more than a 1.9 per cent rise in ordinary beer.' Then again, apparently, the Prime Minister was also questioned on the John Laws program in respect of this matter. The question apparently did relate to packaged beer and, again, there was reference to the 1.9 per cent increase in the price of beer.
I think it is clear that the Prime Minister fudged his response. I use the term `fudged' in a gentle way because any reasonable member of the public listening to the responses by the Prime Minister on these two occasions would certainly have gained the impression that beer being sold by the glass in a club or pub was going to go up by 1.9 per cent. Of course, this is far from correct, as other events have shown.
Following the election it is well known that the Senate established a select committee to examine the various issues relating to the government's tax changes, particularly the GST. My colleague Senator Murray, who is in the chamber representing the Australian Democrats, was a member of that committee and we held numerous hearings around the country. One of the issues that was raised in the Brisbane hearings was the price of beer. We had before us witnesses—I think from the wine and spirits and brandy association—and I asked them about the price of beer and what they thought the increase would be. They indicated on that occasion that they believed the price would go up by approximately seven to eight per cent for beer and wine sold by the glass. 
Senator Murray was not there on that occasion and, as I recall, it was Senator Bartlett who was actually sitting next to me at that hearing—it is important, and I will come back to that at a later stage. That, I think, was our first indication that, in fact, the figure in the ANTS package and the comments of the Prime Minister were incorrect. I pursued in Treasury estimates this year this matter of the increase in the price of beer sold by the glass. I spoke to a Treasury official on that occasion, Monday, 7 February. I asked the Treasury officials about the price of beer in pubs and clubs and was told that their estimate was that it would go up by approximately seven per cent. I pursued the issue of the Prime Minister's comments about the price of beer going up by 1.9 per cent. The Treasury official, Mr Blair Comley, confirmed that the increase of 1.9 per cent was, in fact, only in relation to packaged beer and that was the reference in the ANTS package that had been referred to prior to the election. 
Since that estimates hearing back on Monday, 7 February, this issue of the price of beer, the commitments given by the Prime Minister of this country and the misleading comments that the Prime Minister made on this issue have been a feature of considerable public comment. What we have here is a very good example of the Prime Minister misleading Australians about the impact of the GST. This is not the only example but I think it is a very important example that highlights the incorrect and wrong information—the misleading information—that has been given in so many areas of the GST by the Liberal and National parties and by the Prime Minister and other members of his government. So we had the admission by Treasury that the price of beer in a glass was to go up by about seven per cent. 
But, of course, the story has progressed further since the admission by the Treasury officials in February this year that the price of beer would go up by about seven per cent. Sections of the brewing industry have indicated that they were very unhappy with the increase in the price of beer. So they should be, because I understand that they were given private undertakings, either by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer of this country, Mr Costello—`Don't raise this issue in the election campaign. We'll sort it out later on. Just trust us.'—and, of course, the commitments they gave on the quiet to get themselves through the election campaign—the very fudged commitments that were given—have not been honoured by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer. That is at least one of the reasons why the brewing industry is so angry with this government about the increases in the price of beer as sold by the glass. 
The brewing industry, as is well known, is running a campaign to remind the Australian people—quite rightly—of the comments by the Prime Minister that are on the record in respect of this issue. It is obvious that the campaign by the brewing industry has hit home with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The Prime Minister tends to get very angry when his integrity is questioned, and I think this is one example of where the Prime Minister did mislead the Australian public on a very, very important issue. He has got quite agitated, of course, because of the campaign that has been started in some respects by the brewing industry. The Prime Minister has refrained generally from public comment on the matter; he has left it to the Treasurer. Again, you always know when the Treasurer has some concern about his GST package by the type of response that he makes to criticism. The response by the Treasurer has been to embark on a campaign of personal abuse of sections of the brewing industry. We have had comments about sections of the brewing industry being engaged in a money campaign and that they are foreign owned. If the Treasurer is going to make that criticism about Australian companies, it could be said that there are a lot of companies in this country that are foreign owned.  
Minister Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, has raised the issue of advertising alcohol, particularly at sporting events, and I do not believe that the timing of this is coincidental. There has been a campaign of outright intimidation by the Treasurer and the minister for health on this issue, because they are extraordinarily sensitive to the exposure of the misleading comments made by the Prime Minister prior to the last election. I also notice that the Treasurer has made comments about Mr Kevan Gosper of Olympics fame being a member of the board of one of the brewing companies. What on earth that has to do with the issue, I do not know. It is just another example of the Treasurer resorting to a generalised campaign of abuse when he gets into trouble on this matter. So there has been criticism from members of the government about the brewing industry's campaign. What also concerns me about the government's approach is that it is not enough for them to spend $420-odd million of taxpayers' money promoting the GST and its aspects in this massive media campaign; through the placing of advertisements, they have also tried to restrict and indeed censor the brewing industry in its campaign. My colleague and leader, Senator Faulkner, asked a question about this matter in the Senate yesterday.
The Prime Minister has made misleading comments about the increase in the price of beer, and since then there have been some interesting developments in the price of light beer. Apparently, the GST package, whilst it requires the GST revenue to go to the states, does not deal with the issue of the payment made by the states to lower the price of light beer. The Commonwealth government is not compensating the states adequately in this area, and the price of light beer is estimated to go up by 11 per cent on 1 July as a consequence of the government's GST package. During the estimates hearings last week, I raised the issue of the price of beer with the ACCC. I believe that the ACCC should be investigating why the price of light beer is going up by more than 10 per cent. It was Professor Fels who said that 10 per cent is 10 per cent is 10 per cent and that increases in respect of GST are not to go up by more than 10 per cent. So it will be interesting to see whether the ACCC pursues this issue. I will also pay a compliment to the ACCC. At least in the documentation that they have sent to the Australian electorate, they have included an estimate of the increase in the price of a glass of beer. At least they have included it, in contrast to the grossly misleading behaviour of this government in not including that in their pre-election material. I think it is generally understood in the community that the price of beer is indicated by the price of a glass of beer, not the price of a take-away package of beer.
In Treasury estimates last week, I examined figures in Budget Paper No. 1 relating to excise increases. Here is another example of the government covering up, or attempting to cover up, this issue. If you look at Table 6 on page 5-13 of Budget Paper No. 1, you can see the increase in indirect tax. It lists other excise—beer, spirits, tobacco products—and shows the increase in revenue. That seems to be accurate. There is a 61.6 per cent increase in the excise from beer, going from $892 million to $1.441 billion. To be balanced, I should say that a significant part of that increase is due to the change in the taxation revenue collection methods, and it refers to that in that table. But what is misleading is found in Table 7 if you look at the excise rates applying from 1 August for beer. It is contained there, 16.15, and it shows the rate applying from 1 February 2000—obviously that date has passed. But it does not contain the rates to apply from 1 July this year and from 1 August this year—and yet the revenue estimates are there. I asked Treasury why we do not have the precise excise rates, and they have taken it on notice. But this is another example of the government trying to hide the information.
The Labor Party is very concerned about the issues relating to the price of beer and the misleading statements made by members of this government, the Prime Minister in particular. But their actions have caught up with them. The fact that they misled the public and the brewing industry has come back to bite this government very hard. It is yet another example of the misleading information that we have received on the GST. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-06-06,"—In speaking to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, I wish to particularly address the question of the amendments in schedule 2 that relate, in part, to the fuel substitution issue. I note with interest Senator Sherry's comments with regard to the government hitting the poor old beer drinker in the neck. However, they are not doing too much in respect of the people who are clearly breaching the law with fuel substitution. We will be supporting these bills, but the reality is that much of the action that is set out in the schedule 2 amendments and regulations that have now been introduced by the government are too little, too late. Indeed, they will not achieve too much in the future either. The bill only changes the structure of the tariffs, adding a chemical mark-up to toluene, for instance. That is okay if you are policing the practice.
I will deal first with toluene. If you look at the issue of fuel substitution, you can see it has a long history. It has probably been around since fuels started to be sold. The Assistant Treasurer claimed that this was a new problem, one that has arisen recently. Not true: it has been around for a long time. Our authorities such as Customs and the tax office, and indeed the government, should have picked up on a lot of these things a lot earlier. The reason I am specifically focusing on the toluene issue is that toluene imports took off, in effect, from 1998. It is not as though this information was not readily available even in the public domain, because a lot of it was. In 1989 toluene imports consisted of only 394,127 litres. In 1998 it was 13.9 million litres. And it did not stop there. The substituters were well and truly into the racket here. By 1999 imports went up to 20.9 million litres. For January alone this year, January 2000, it was 6.5 million litres. Yet it did not dawn on poor old Customs, those people who are charged with the responsibility of at least keeping track of things that come across our borders, that everything might not be kosher. Perhaps a whole range of people had gone into the painting industry or something, because, although toluene does go into the make-up of petrol, it is used principally, as I understand it, in the painting industry. Senator Kemp would be fully aware of that because he has been part of the process. I am pleased that the Assistant Treasurer is here.
—I came to hear you.
—I am pleased you did because, as I was pointing out before you arrived, Minister, your statement that this is a new problem is a bit off the mark. Even your boss, the Treasurer, knew it was not a new problem, because in the 1997 budget speech he actually made a big announcement about new laws and the introduction of new penalties that would apply, to the tune of $50,000. Again, Minister Truss on 30 January 1998 said:
The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, Warren Truss, has today announced a major nation-wide crackdown on fuel-substitution rorts which avoid paying customs or excise duty.
Further on he said: 
The Federal Government is implementing strict new laws, which include heavy penalties, to combat the loss of revenue and stamp out dangerous and illegal practices resulting from fuel substitution.
That is very true, because the practice of using things like toluene is very dangerous.
—But the Transport Workers Union would have known all about that. They drove the trucks. The Maritime Union of Australia would have known about this coming in. Why didn't they blow the whistle?
—I take the interjection of the senator from the west. On the one hand he wants no unions, but he now wants unions to actually monitor this and do the government's job. That is a very interesting concept from Senator Lightfoot from Western Australia. I am sure the Prime Minister will take note of that. Minister Truss continued: 
From tomorrow, operators face penalties of up to $50,000 if they are caught in fuel substitution rorts. ... Customs officers will be able to enter premises, by consent or under the authority of a judicial warrant, to audit records and test fuels to determine if the chemical marker is present.
That is very interesting, because if we go to the 1998 Customs Service annual report we see that they found that at least one in every 10 service stations was actually substituting fuel.
—I rest my case.
—Senator Lightfoot rests his case. It is not a very good case for you to rest, I can tell you. The case is, for Senator Lightfoot's benefit, that the government has failed miserably here. It has failed in every aspect. It has succeeded in having only one prosecution, and yet Customs found that one in every 10 service stations was substituting fuel. There has been one prosecution, and I am not sure that they got fined $50,000. Perhaps Senator Lightfoot might like to get up after afterwards and inform us as to whether or not they got a fine of $50,000.
—I may do that.
—It will be very good if Senator Lightfoot does get up and do that, because he might spell out specifically how successful the government's campaign has been in this respect. As I said, according to Customs, it is not very successful at all.
Then we come to the ATO, which has now been given the responsibility to run the test trucks. It has gone and scrapped all that. Whilst on the one hand you are implementing these major initiatives—if we can call them that—to stamp out fuel substitution, on the other hand you take away all the processes that you might use to actually detect it. It is a bit like looking at the ACCC's $10 million fines and $500,000 fines for people who breach the laws in respect of the implementation of the GST. You have got two hopes of prosecuting anybody: Buckley's and none.
The Assistant Treasurer is back. He said it was a new problem. We know that many in the fuel industry, and particularly those in the independent sections of the fuel industry, have written to the government. Liberty Oil and I think Apco wrote to the government as early as June 1999, but what happened about this? The imports of toluene sailed on. The government could simply have rung up to check out a few things with regard to toluene. If you go from June through to December and look at the overall imports of toluene, millions of litres continued to come in and went into fuel substitution rackets. Nothing was done about that—not one thing. Even right through to January 2000, when 6½ million litres came in in one month, still nothing had been done.
This was a very serious problem, and this government said back in 1997 and 1998 that it had introduced measures to combat fuel substitution—big fines, big search powers, et cetera—yet we allow this to continue, even with letters from within the industry itself.
—Where was the Transport Workers Union?
—For the benefit of Senator Lightfoot, we know and the government ought to know that Shell, one of the refining companies here in Australia, used to refine nearly all the domestic requirement for toluene in this country. They had knowledge, and they would have been concerned about the impact of the imports on them. I do not know whether they ever spoke to the government about it. They may have done. That would be just another reason to accuse the government of inaction.
We now have amendments which place new excises on a range of these fuels, which is a step in the right direction, but of course it will not solve the substitution problem. As recently as six or eight weeks ago, when we were conducting an investigation into a bill referred to the Senate, we heard further evidence about fuel substitution involving naphtha. It would seem that the government authorities responsible for the monitoring, checking and prosecution of such activities are still not up to the game and are still not pursuing these matters as they should. It is all well and good for governments to make claims that they are doing things. If you are to do that, then you ought to be providing the wherewithal for the authorities responsible to do it. That is the problem, I think. There is an inability on the part of the tax office—who I assume now have the principal responsibility for these things—to get on and do the job. 
It was interesting to listen to the evidence from Liberty Oil saying that they are so frustrated by this problem. It is not only a problem with respect to consumers being misled about what they are purchasing and the potential for their vehicles—the car they have saved for or may be paying off a loan for. It is a serious enough problem in itself that that is occurring. That should, of itself, jolt any government into action, to actually get on and do something about this. But oh no, we were still plodding along with this argument from Customs and from the Australian Taxation Office. In my view, they did not have the capacity to deal with the issues; that is, they simply did not have the resources to get on and do the job. In their submission to the inquiry, the Australian Taxation Office said:
Moreover, it is the judgment of the tax office that approaches relying principally on enforcement had not been effective in addressing previous fuel substitution issues.
The Treasurer seemed to think it was going to fix the case in 1997. Minister Truss, in 1998, seemed to think that that was going to fix the problem, but obviously did not tell the tax office. He did not convey the message to the tax office that we want enforcement, that we actually want these things checked out. 
At the outset, I think Senator Sherry was talking about the price of beer. It is interesting that the poor old punters who drink beer can pay more, but we can do little to deal with what is a very serious issue. I know we are proposing to pass legislation—a step in the right direction—but there is nothing to back it up. It is all well and good to have excises applicable to various fuels, but if you have nothing to back it up, if you have no mechanism in place to run checks and to find out whether substitution is actually occurring, it is a glaring example of the past where Customs have cleared imports but somehow did not switch on. The bell did not ring for them when, during 1998, 1999 and early 2000, the huge increase in toluene imports could have meant something in terms of a fuel substitution problem.
I was staggered by their evidence to the committee when they said, `It's not really something we look at.' I find that sort of approach amazing. I would hope that the government will address themselves to that and will get Customs in—the Assistant Treasurer can probably convey this to the minister responsible for Customs—or the tax office, and pass it down the line that they should look for signs when they occur. They should play a watchdog role here. Fuel substitution has been around a long time.
I have asked Customs and the tax office if they have a list of potential fuel substitutes. I understand from their response that they do. So when we get these imports coming in, I do not see why there would be a problem with them being a bit more forthright in terms of making an assessment of what the end use for the product might be and asking a few questions. They should play a bit of a detective role here. That would be even a half-baked responsible approach to take.
I hope that, as a result of these changes and with the introduction of this legislation, the Assistant Treasurer and the minister for customs will get on the job. I know the Assistant Treasurer is certainly capable of doing this—of getting on and getting the job done.
—This speech is improving. You keep going; you're getting better now.
—I have to say to you, Minister, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the activity in this respect would want to be a lot better than the answers to questions that you have given over the last four years while you have been coming in here, otherwise I might have to withdraw that statement of support. I hope that, with the introduction of these measures, the government will increase its activity substantially in the area of seeking out substitution and prosecuting it. I hope that the record will be a lot better than it has been to date.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-06,"—I probably spoke too soon when I said I thought Senator Murphy's contribution—not a great contribution, I would have to say, Senator Murphy—suddenly took a turn for the better when he started to praise me. It turned out to be very fickle praise indeed, Senator Murphy. I was going to ask you if you might like to sign up to the fan club over there. We are fairly short on members apparently. That is the advice I get. I thought you might have been a potential member, but those hopes were dashed. 
Firstly, let me make the point that we appreciate the support these bills are receiving. They are important bills and we should speed the passage. There were a lot of wild claims made. Senator Sherry went off on a frolic on something which had nothing to do with these bills. Nonetheless, these things happen in the Senate. It was a frolic which went a wild way.
—That would be like you in question time. 
—Senator, I just hope that someone some day actually notices you are here. I am not convinced that they have as yet. I will not be diverted.
These bills ratify changes to the tariff on tobacco and petroleum products that came into effect in late 1999. The first change implements the ANTS proposal to move to a per stick rate of excise and customs duty on most cigarettes, lightweight cigars, bidis and other lightweight products marketed in the stick form. The change removes the taxation advantage, which had skewed consumption towards higher volume, lightweight cigarettes, which experts considered to be more harmful on health grounds. The amendments also insert a definition of tobacco in the schedule to the excise tariff. This will clarify when tobacco leaf becomes excisable to assist in addressing illicit production. Similar provisions apply to imported leaf. These changes for tobacco have effect from 1 November 1999. 
The changes for petroleum have effect from 15 November 1999. These changes are part of a systemic solution to petroleum excise evasions occurring through fuel substitution. They are designed to restrict access to concessionally taxed and duty free products for those who can demonstrate a clear and legitimate need for these products. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee considered these measures contained in the bills to be important for countering fuel substitution activities and recommended that the Senate pass the bills. A range of issues were raised in the second reading debate, all of which have been answered extensively either before the Senate committee or in the debate in the lower house. Given the quality of some of those assertions which were made relentlessly but were always rejected, I do not propose to delay the Senate or the second reading.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I rise to speak on the Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. This bill amends the Telecommunications Interception Act 1979 and the ASIO Act 1979 to, amongst other purposes, enable the Inspector of the Police Integrity Commission of New South Wales to have access to intercepted material for the purposes of the Inspector's statutory functions, to provide for interception warrants against a named person and to provide for warrants covering foreign communications. The amendments respond in part to a practical operational difficulty arising out of essentially rapid change in the telecommunications industry. In part, they respond to the telecommunications interception policy review which was tabled in the parliament on 25 August 1999. I am informed that many of the amendments effect technical changes to the act to improve the operation of the act in view of the practical experience of law enforcement and security agencies. 
At the outset I note that it is the view of our shadow Attorney-General, Rob McClelland, that this act seeks to balance two very important objectives: (1) providing our law enforcement and security agencies with appropriate powers to carry out their functions—functions to improve the safety of the community and the Australian nation; and (2) ensuring that the rights of Australian citizens are adequately safeguarded in the process of approving warrants for telecommunications interception. These are the two considerations that quite often riddle debates in this area. They have been the considerations that have been quite important over the years as parliaments have tried to work out the balance between them and to ensure that, for instance, issues of national security are taken into account but at the same time measures are put in place to ensure adequate protection of Australian citizens.  
It is interesting to note that a Senate committee was charged with looking at this legislation. There have also been other comments made with respect to the legislation. Those same matters were raised at the Senate committee, and the view of the committee was that the changes as proposed could be accepted. It is also interesting to note that there were not all that many submissions put to that committee from people concerned about the issue of whether the balance was not struck in this legislation. That is something that in a sense may be unprecedented, given the history of this legislation over the years. 
The opposition's view is that law enforcement agencies must be provided with powers to intercept telecommunications for proper law enforcement purposes. However, our view also is that Australians are entitled to the reassurance that there are appropriate limits on the availability of warrants for these purposes. This legislation, as I said, was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for examination and report. That committee considered the need for new warrants, the adequacy of safeguards and the adequacy of reporting mechanisms. I shall refer to that committee's recommendations further down the track.
I turn to some of the key amendments, particularly to the amendments with respect to the Inspector of the Police Integrity Commission of New South Wales. The amendments in schedule 1 of the bill will enable that Inspector—which is a New South Wales government statutory entity, separate from the Police Integrity Commission—to receive intercepted information collected by other agencies and to use that information in the performance of its statutory functions. The commission itself obtained intercepting powers after the amendments to the interception act in 1997. It is the view of the opposition that these amendments do not confer any additional authority on the Inspector or the Police Integrity Commission to undertake interceptions of its own volition.
Turning to warrants, I note that the interception act was framed some 20 years ago. It is the view of the opposition that in those days everyone used a fixed-line telephone based on an analog technology provided by Telecom. Interception was, in a sense, a very simple matter. The interception act is structured around the premise of a warrant authorising the interception of a single, identified telephone service. Rapid advances in technology mean that customers may now choose from a variety of services and means of communications rather than a fixed single phone line. For example, a person may subscribe to multiple services by acquiring several prepaid mobile phone cards for use in one telephone handset, and these cards can be swapped around and discarded at will. The interception act in its present form would require an agency wishing to intercept all of the telecom services used by a particular suspect to obtain a separate warrant for each service. This bill will update the principal act to enable connections, disconnections and reconnections, in rapid succession, of interceptions of multiple services without the need to obtain a fresh warrant each time. Those multiple services, of course, would be used by a particular suspect in connection with the same matter. 
The criminals and those persons who may pose a threat to Australian security are quick to pick up new technologies with the express intention of evading investigation. Modern technology can be used to disguise the identity of users. The current legislation, which requires the individual service and each individual subscriber to be identified before a warrant can be issued, is rapidly losing its effectiveness in the modern telecom environment. Schedule 2 of the bill will amend the interception act to enable interceptions of multiple services used by a particular suspect in connection with the same offence without the need to obtain a fresh warrant each time. The schedule will provide for the interception of foreign communications and there will be three categories of warrant. The first category is that of telecommunications service warrant. These warrants are already available under existing provisions of the intercept act and they will continue unchanged. 
The next category is that of a named person warrant. This is a new category of warrant designed to overcome the problems presented by suspects using multiple services. The NCA told the Senate committee which inquired into the need for these warrants that investigations undertaken by 19 law enforcement agencies participating in the Blade National Task Force, the task force which coordinated a national effort against South-East Asian organised crime, noted an increase in use of multiple SIM cards, quite often used under false identities, and multiple mobile phone handsets amongst people involved in heroin trafficking. Persons under investigation freely switched mobile phone SIM cards using an array of phone and SIM card combinations. That is a concern that needs to be factored into the legislation formulation process. This category of warrant will authorise the agency to intercept any fixed or mobile service, telephone line, pager, et cetera used or likely to be used by the person named on the warrant. It is only available if the telecom service warrant would be ineffective in the circumstances. Any agency which aims to obtain a named person warrant must first demonstrate that a regular telecom service warrant is not adequate. The agency must still identify each particular service the named person is using or is likely to use and must notify the carrier concerned in writing before the service may be intercepted.
The existing procedures and criteria for the issue of a warrant and the record keeping and reporting requirements of the interception act will apply in full to a named person warrant. Those procedures relating to accountability, as we have shown in the debate in previous days, aim to protect the abuse of the issue of warrants and to protect privacy so far as is consistent with the legal use of interceptions. However, we note that there will be an extra requirement in this legislation: that is, the judge or members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal before issuing a named person warrant must first be satisfied that other methods of investigation, including less intrusive telecom service warrants, have been considered and are either unavailable or ineffective in the circumstances. There will also be additional reporting requirements. After the expiry of a named person warrant, the agency to which the warrant was issued will be required to report to the minister specified information about the warrant, the interceptions conducted under its authority, including a list of the services intercepted under the warrant and the reasons why it was ineffective to use a telecom service warrant.
Under the principal act, the accountability provisions are expressed to apply to Commonwealth agencies only, but section 35 provides that similar reporting will apply to a state or Northern Territory agency declared under section 34 to be able to apply for a warrant to intercept telecommunications. The responsible state minister to whom the initial reporting must be made is also required to report to the Commonwealth minister responsible for the administration of the principal act, the Attorney-General. A number of other accountability measures for Commonwealth bodies are specified in the legislation. Agencies are to keep records of warrants issued and details of warrants issued to bodies other than ASIO are to be kept on a general register maintained by the Commissioner of the AFP. The general register is to be submitted to the minister every three months. Similar requirements apply in relation to warrants that have ceased to be in force and did not lead to criminal proceedings being or likely to be commenced. The A-G must be provided with copies of warrants issued to a Commonwealth or state authority and copies of instruments revoking the warrants or warrant. This information must be provided as soon as practicable after the issue or revocation of a warrant. Where a warrant is issued or revoked, details of the usage of the warrant and to whom information gained from the warrant has been communicated, any arrests that have been made or are likely to be made because of the information gained from the warrant and the usefulness of the information obtained must be provided within three months of the issue or the revocation of the warrant. A telecom carrier must give to the minister within three months of a warrant ceasing to be in force details of the action taken by the carrier. The Commonwealth Ombudsman has the power to check the records of Commonwealth agencies to ensure that the above requirements are complied with. State agencies may only be authorised to apply for a warrant if their establishing law provides for an independent body to scrutinise the agency's records. All these measures are in place in respect of this particular category of warrant. Those measures, as I indicated earlier, are there to try and give some balance in the interest of protecting the privacy of individuals. 
The third category of warrant is the foreign intelligence warrant. A foreign intelligence warrant will enable interception of particular communications which cannot be identified by reference to specific services or named individuals. I note there is a bit of debate about the broadness of the legislation in this respect.
Moving on to the Senate committee report, on 11 May 2000 the Senate committee handed down its report on the bill. The committee made three recommendations: firstly, that the bill provide for a review of its operations within three years of it coming into effect; secondly, that a note be inserted in the bill to make it quite clear that the proposed section 75A, the section which deals with the way in which evidence obtained under warrant is given, is subject to the general rules of admissibility; and, thirdly, that the bill proceed without amendment. In response to the committee's report, the government has advised that it will commit to conducting the review within three years of the legislation coming into effect in accordance with the recommendation. We on this side of the parliament welcome that commitment. In response to recommendation 2, the government has advised that section 78 of the interception bill provides:
Nothing in Part 2A or in this Part renders information, or a restricted record, admissible in evidence in a proceeding to a greater extent than it would have been admissible in evidence in that proceeding if this Part had not been enacted.
It is the view of the shadow attorney that, as new section 75A falls within part 2A, it is considered that section 78 achieves the purposes of the committee recommendation 2. Accordingly, it is our view that it is not necessary to amend the bill. In summary, the opposition appreciates the change of circumstances that has given rise to most of these amendments to the telecom interception regime now in place, and we support the legislation.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-06-06,"—I too rise to express support for this legislation. The Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 deals with a very important matter concerning law enforcement and the process of law enforcement, and equally important matters of privacy and the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial. At its essence, telecommunications interception has become very necessary because of the criminal activity that has become more technically proficient than ever before. I noted that proponents in one of the submissions to the inquiry spoke particularly about the use—or as they would refer to it the `abuse'—of so-called SIM cards and silicon technology in today's mobile phones where it is so very easy simply to not only have a number of mobile phones and exchange them but also exchange the SIM cards within them. These cards can be purchased anonymously, making it very difficult for law enforcement agencies. But I suspect that is a sign of things to come in terms of the dramatically evolving pace of information technology in today's society.
I will not take too much of the Senate's time, but I would like to briefly add some comments to what I have already said. I want to pick up on the last time that the Senate considered telecommunications interception legislation. My colleague and then Democrats spokesperson for law and justice, Senator Andrew Murray, made the following observations:  
Clearly, the area of law enforcement which has the greatest demand for telecommunications interception warrants is drug law enforcement and I expect it will continue to be so. Villains do not have concern for civil liberties, nor do they care much for issues of privacy, the rule of law, or for that matter, the value of human life.
Indeed, the Australian Democrats have been at the forefront of the debate in trying to seek a rational, enlightened approach to the issue of heroin addiction, such as the now scuttled, but soon to be revived ACT heroin trial. The government does not have the answers, we do not think Labor has the answers and we doubt that we have the answers. But we certainly do believe that we should continue to explore methods of finding the answers.
The response of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the ACT heroin trial is the classic reactionary position of putting your head in the sand. It stands as a testament to the lack of any attempt to find new solutions to this problem.
Clearly, he was referring to a specific issue at the time—but the premise is clear. I would concur with those comments, but I would also add that the myopia experienced by the government concerning harm minimisation in a general sense is really quite distressing. Prohibition does not work. It never has worked and, while we continue as a nation to ignore the harm and suffering of those who are chemically dependent, we are by omission contributing to that suffering.
I will turn now to the matter of civilian oversight of its Australian police forces. In my comments, I am indebted to the Australian Institute of Criminology Trends and Issues paper. The Roman satirist, Juvenalis, rhetorically once asked: `Who will guard the guardians.' That in part is one of the issues that we are really dealing with here tonight—how do we keep an eye on those powers in our society that have power themselves. Historically, countries like Australia have largely preferred to trust police—and in that I include ASIO—to keep their own houses in order, with minimal guardianship administered by the courts and governments. That minimal approach was, in quite simple terms, found wanting. Numerous inquiries have demonstrated the vulnerability of policing and police officers to corruption and misconduct. Whilst it must be stated that a large number of officers in our forces are untouched by corruption, when incidents of corruption are exposed they bring into disrepute the entire administration of the criminal justice system.
There can be no doubt that constant vigilance and strong measures are required to prevent maladministration and misbehaviour becoming widespread and entrenched in policing organisations. The issue is no longer one of whether or not the guards need guarding, but that of determining the best form of guardianship. A diverse range of systems has emerged in recent years with competing claims for effectiveness. I, for one, believe we are fortunate to have a quality Australian Federal Police service, and I commend them for their continuing professionalism in that regard. At essence here is ongoing concern that has been articulated by the Australian Democrats over many years in terms of the protection of the rights and the civil liberties of the citizens—when we, as a parliament, extend powers to policing authorities, what protections are there for the citizens such as they are not subject to civil liberty abuse.
Having read through the submissions to this inquiry and having looked at the correspondence between the various offices, including the Attorney-General's office, I am confident—convinced, in fact—that those protections are there and that there is no particular extension on this occasion as to the involvement that policing services may have in terms of how and why they might go about interception possibilities. It is clear from the act and also through correspondence from the Attorney-General that those gatekeeping procedures are there to protect citizens and can and will be accessed by those people who want to make an interception application order.
I am also confident that the structure of the reporting procedures is such that citizens can have faith in the system. I note that, through the inquiry process, it was suggested that there ought to be a third year review after the implementation of this legislation. I would support that. I am given to understand that amendments to that effect will not be moved, but that the minister may be indicating that in her second reading speech. I am confident in regard to the protections in the bill. It is clear that, under the principal act, warrants can be obtained for two purposes: firstly, national security; and, secondly, law enforcement. The Attorney-General may issue warrants for the interception of telecommunications where the subject of the warrant is reasonably suspected of engaging in activities prejudicial to security. I think that is fair and reasonable. An application for such a warrant is made to the Attorney-General by ASIO's director general of security, and in certain circumstances the Director General may issue a warrant for a limited period if, for example, waiting for a response from the Attorney-General would be prejudicial to national security. 
I am also confident in the structure of the bill in terms of law enforcement agencies that can apply for interception warrants. This is also prescribed in the principal act, and the warrants are confined to the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority. The act also provides for eligible authorities such as the New South Wales Crime Commission, the NSW royal commission into police corruption, the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission, and the Anti-Corruption Commission in my home state—bodies of reasonable integrity—which might have need or cause to access information but cannot initiate an interception procedure themselves.
Without recapping what Senator Bolkus has already said, the Democrats are pleased to support this legislation. We see it as necessary with today's evolving, modern information technology. I make the point that there seems to be a catch-up, if I could call it that, in terms of the parliament feeling the need to respond to the evolution that is taking place with regard to information technology, and we have seen this played out across politics and within different pieces of legislation. I am thinking in particular of moves by the parliament to impose what is perceived to be Internet censorship in a way that, I would argue, and have argued for some years, is like trying to catch smoke with your hands. It cannot, in any real sense, be done.
Politicians are light-years behind where today's information technology is at, and Internet censorship is a case in point. Particular Australian sites which are banned or to which access is refused—because they are considered offensive by self-appointed moral guardians—can be accessed simply by going around them to sites from other countries which may be providing that material on the Internet. Simply by removing the suffix `au' on an Internet address and replacing it with another country's suffix, you can, in a matter of seconds, get to a site elsewhere.
I also refer to the crackdown on phone sex mechanisms which has occurred in this place and in the House of Representatives. It will soon be pretty much impossible to access those phone sex chat lines which 1.5 million Australians per month enjoyed. However, anybody who wants to access such a service can do so simply by phoning overseas. I think this is yet another example of politicians' response to the reality of today's world and the changing nature of information technology. 
This brings me back to the earlier point I made about the use of SIM cards in mobile phones. With the advent of mobile phone technology, I wonder—as this legislation aims to target the person rather than a fixed line of telecommunications in terms of a telephone—about the extent to which interception can be carried out. I wonder, for example, how easy it is going to be to trace a particular person who is changing mobile phones and/or SIM cards. I think we should also acknowledge that, within the next two, four or six years, we are going to have even more extraordinary developments in information technology. I do not know what will follow on from the SIM card, but I am sure something is in the pipeline. It may not be all that long before there is a form of information technology through the use of mobile phones or some other communication device which cannot, whether we like it or not, be followed.  
Given that it does not seem unreasonable at this point in time, I am confident that the civil libertarian protections in this legislation are there for the citizens and that the reporting procedures for services accessing these devices are also adequate. I do support the notion that there should be a review after three years, and I understand the minister will speak to that. Having said all that, I support the legislation, and the Australian Democrats will be voting for it.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-06-06,"—Senator Bolkus and Senator Greig have both set forward principles which we all agree with and, as a result of the approach that the parties have taken to this matter, the bill is going to be passed into law. However, I think some of the principles which Senator Bolkus and Senator Greig have raised need to be reiterated in the present context.
The Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The central provision in the act is section 7, which is headed `Telecommunications not to be intercepted'. Subsection (1) reads:
A person shall not:
(a) intercept;
(b) authorize, suffer or permit another person to intercept; or
(c) do any act or thing that will enable him or another person to intercept;
a communication passing over a telecommunications system.
So the central feature of this act is that it preserves the integrity of communications passing over electronic equipment. The act makes exceptions in certain circumstances, but the exceptions should be limited and hopefully will remain limited into the future—although there is a tendency for legislative creep in this act and more and more people get the right to use telecommunications that have been intercepted under this act. The principle to remember is that we should preserve the integrity of phone calls—and I show my age when I use that expression—or any conversation. No matter what the communication, we live in a decent, proper and humane society, and we ought to be able to communicate free from spying. 
It is the sort of thing that Sir Winston Churchill was talking about in 1938. Unfortunately, I can remember Sir Winston Churchill, certainly during the war. In 1938 he made a broadcast to the United States of America. He was then a backbencher, and the great glory that was to be his seemed to be distant, but he did make this radio broadcast to the United States on 16 October 1938. He talked about the sort of society the Nazis were creating in Germany—this was before the war. He was concerned about the culture and the climate that reigned in the society that then pertained to Germany. The great man described it as a state of society where men may not speak their minds, where children denounce their parents to the police, where businessmen or small shopkeepers ruin a competitor by telling tales about his private opinion. Sir Winston was talking about conversations between people being made available to the police, and the wrong that could arise from that unless the police were people of integrity—which the police in Australia are, particularly the Australian Federal Police. That creates the background as to why we have an act and why it is proper for us as parliamentarians to make statements such as this when the integrity of those communications is being modified.
We have talked tonight about how technology creates an environment such that changes have to be made to the law. But the principle of keeping communications safe and protected has always been there in societies that developed from the English common law system. In that context, I would like to quote from a court case, Pearse v. Pearse, that took place back in 1846—well over 150 years ago. The case was decided by the Vice-Chancellor. People had said, `We ought to have this material available. The more truth we have available to us the better.' This was in the context of communications between a client and a solicitor. I think it is very pertinent to what we are talking about tonight, the Vice-Chancellor said:
Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely—may be pursued too keenly—may cost too much. And surely the meanness and mischief of prying into a man's confidential consultations with his legal adviser, the general evil of infusing reserve and dissimulation, uneasiness, and suspicion and fear, into those communications which must take place, and which, unless in a condition of perfect security, must take place uselessly or worse, are too great a price to pay for truth itself. 
This was in a time before phones were invented, so the judge was talking about communications by letter and conversation. Since then, telephones have come about, and communications have developed to a very sophisticated extent indeed—to the extent that the law needs to be modified by the present bill. But the general principle that the judge was talking about—the principle that we ought to be able to talk to people free of other people's prying—remains. If we in Parliament House, or indeed anywhere, want to speak to our wives or to our partners; or if we are in the professions, to our clients; or if we are in business, to our customers; or just to our friends, to our coach or, indeed, to our lovers, shouldn't we be able to do so without people prying?
In a certain sense there is no logic to underpin that. That is a principle that comes from our visceral feelings as human beings. As human beings, there should be some cases whereby we can go forward and talk to people; indeed, in the case of confession we should be able to speak to our clergy, confident in their keeping our revelations safe and sound. The point I want to make is this: when we withdraw the integrity of communications to any extent, as we have in the Telecommunications Act and which we will do when we pass this bill tonight, we should do that only in the most serious of circumstances and with the understanding of what we are doing. It would be very bad if we developed a culture—if we developed a custom in the community—where we said, `If you want to listen to what Senator Hogg, Senator Ludwig, Senator Greig or Senator Alston said, that's all right.' It would be very bad if we got to that, and that is why it is very important that we as a parliament say, `Yes, we will give these powers but we give these powers reluctantly because we know it is part of human life, part of the decent way we live, that this should not happen.' One of the worst things that criminals do to us is to lead us to make these laws. As has been pointed out by previous speakers, we have to get to the point where we have to make this judgment as to what should and should not happen. Nevertheless, that is how life is and that is what happens.
In this context I will set out some principles that are contained in the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills fourth report of 2000, entitled Entry and search provisions in Commonwealth legislation. I declare an interest in this; I am chairman of the committee. I think it would be good if everybody read the profound words that are contained in this document. It deals with the issue of powers of entry and search, but it also sets out principles that I think are very pertinent to this present debate. The first one set out is this:
·	people have a fundamental right to their dignity, to their privacy, to the integrity of their person, to their reputation, to the security of their residence and any other premises, and to respect as a member of a civil society;
Of course, what should also have been put in there is: `and to the integrity of their communications with other people.' Perhaps we will take it back and rewrite it. The second dot point says:
·	no person, group or body should intrude on these rights without good cause;
And it is that good cause that we are arguing about now. It is agreed by the parliament that the good causes—and I will come to those in a minute—set out in this bill satisfy the tests that are propounded here. The third dot point states:
·	Such intrusion is warranted only in specific circumstances where the public interest is objectively served and, even where warranted, no intrusion should take place without due process;
The due process idea has been a long time in development. I think it is a worthy one. It is set out and relied on strongly in the American Constitution. I think there are due process clauses in constitutions more and more in the English speaking world. America has one in the constitution which underpins its present system of government. New Zealand has one; it is a legislated one. Canada and England each have one. We have been through this before. I will just digress a while. I think it is very important to point out that all nations comparable to ours have a bill of rights, and we have not. I think it is time we got one. I do not think it will happen readily but, nevertheless, it should, because what it does is set out certain fundamental rights which, unless they are defined and overarching, are likely to be attacked by legislative creep. 
It is easy to say that we should have integrity of communications and that we are going to make sure that the integrity of communications is preserved. We are told that, in the particular circumstances that pertain at the moment, the Police Integrity Commission of New South Wales wants access to the information obtained through telephone tapping. It is easy enough if you have a bill of rights to ask, `Does that commission satisfy the test?' But it is a lot harder when you do not have a bill of rights to say, `We haven't got a bill of rights and we can't think of any overriding principle that is expressed in law that would stop the Police Integrity Commission having it and, therefore, we will give it to the commission.' In other words, it is easier for legislative creep to occur where there is no bill of rights. If there were a bill of rights we would say, `There are all these good reasons why this particular body or person should have the right to tap your telephone but, nevertheless, there is this overriding principle that it or he or she must comply with to stop this happening.' If you have the overriding principle, it is much more difficult to allow the legislative creep to occur.
I think that is well set out in a paper from the Information Research Services of the Department of the Parliamentary Library. As a parliament I do not think we give enough acknowledgment to the Parliamentary Library for the great research that is done there. I know I have not done it enough. I would like to quote from this document because I think it sets out the situation well. I think we ought to acknowledge that it was written on 31 May 2000 by Jennifer Norberry, Law and Bills Digest Group. In talking about the background to the Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000, I think she sums up very well what happens with legislative creep. She says:
Prior to the commencement of the Telephonic Communications Act 1960 (Cwlth) there were no statutory prohibitions on telephone interception in Australia. The 1960 Act prohibited telephone interception except in very limited circumstances. Interceptions could only be carried out for national security reasons or by the Postmaster-General's Department—
there was such a department at one stage—
for technical purposes or to trace unlawful calls (eg nuisance calls). Interception for general law enforcement purposes was not permitted. The use of telephone intercepts for general law enforcement purposes `lacked a secure legal basis until the enactment of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979'1 (the Principal Act).
And so it goes on. There has been a big change since then. I notice that Mr Holland is in the advisers box. He would know this better than anyone because he was very close to it in the 1980s and 1990s, and he still is very close, with a profound mind, may I say.
What has happened for all the very best of reasons is that more and more people have gained access to telephone taps since 1979. I think we have grown used to it and, as people before me have said, the extension of the power to intercept phones is justified in this case and accordingly it will happen. As pointed out by people who came before us in the Senate committee, the technology is such that it is not nearly as useful now to try to get a particular telephone service tapped. You have to get all the services that a particular person uses, or might use, and tap those to get intelligence and evidence.
One thing I should say—and it happened in a previous inquiry that we were doing on the telephone tap—is that we should keep in mind that the police say this is a good safe means of investigation. In other words, if you are tapping a telephone you are not likely to be shot or assaulted by somebody who suddenly comes upon you. I think that is a big factor. I have talked about the rights of citizens and of enforcement officers and, of course, those rights are profoundly important. I think that is a factor in favour of allowing an extension here, knowing that people are able to be properly authorised and to get information in less dangerous situations than would otherwise be the situation.  
We agree to the legislation but we say that every time it is amended—and it will be amended again and again in the future—speeches like this ought to take place. This is the only way to keep in mind the fact that we want to live in a society that is free and where we can communicate reasonably and with confidence.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-06,"—I congratulate Senator Cooney for that speech and particularly for his concern that there is a tendency for legislative creep in this act and his concern that we have to be very vigilant about legislation like this, which is the reason I do not support it. The first parts of it which are to do with being able to more effectively tap in on criminals does not concern me, but the proposal from the second reading speech of the minister does concern me. He said:
The foreign communications warrant will enable the interception of particular communications which cannot be identified by reference to specific services or named individuals—
and he goes on to say:
This is a characteristic of the sophisticated digital technologies which are increasingly dominant in modern telecommunication systems. 
The bill limits the powers to issue this category of warrants to interception for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence. To reduce the possibility of inadvertently intercepting communications between Australians, these warrants may be issued only in relation to foreign communications.
What it does not say is that this opens up the whole arena of spying for commercial purposes and to the spying on all Australian telecommunications going overseas. We know from the remarkable Sunday program on Channel 9 called Big Brother is Listening on 23 May last year that there is enormous facility these days, particularly through the installations at Geraldton and Waihopai in New Zealand with massive computers and dictionaries to pick out calls from amongst the millions of faxes, emails and phone calls and to scan these so that every conversation going out of this country is being listened into—and, moreover, the information and the scanning of those calls can go direct to Washington without any Australian intervention. 
I will be asking the minister tomorrow to give more information about this process, this tearaway modern communication which is not dealt with under this legislation. In fact, I am very concerned that this legislation gives some legitimacy to this process of comprehensive spying which is not confined to Australia or the United States—it is carried on around the world. I believe that citizens should know about it and be aware of the enormous potential damage that can accrue from it, and tomorrow I will give the Senate some specific cases where this form of intelligence has been abused in the political arena, in the economic arena and used against the interests of ordinary citizens speaking on mobile phones in the street.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Firstly, it is pleasing to see that we have today in the Notice Paper three of the remaining RFAs—Regional Forest Agreements—that have been negotiated between the respective states and the Commonwealth. But I have to take this opportunity to correct the record—and I am sure that it is going to take me more than the four or five minutes I have on this report. Fortunately there are a couple more to come. 
The record of this government in respect of promoting and bringing about a resolution of the Regional Forest Agreement process is a very shabby one. That is not unusual because the minister responsible for forestry issues in this government is, of course, Mr Wilson Tuckey who, since he assumed the portfolio from the previous hapless minister, Mr Anderson, has simply treated the issue of forests as a political football to be kicked at his whim. 
We have seen, during the period of time that Mr Tuckey has been the minister, a situation where agreements have been negotiated and then disowned by the Commonwealth government or, in the case of Western Australia, by the state government. In fact, it has got to a point where the states really do not have any confidence in Mr Tuckey at all and they have really gone about negotiating the remaining regional forest agreements in spite of Mr Tuckey. Fortunately, they have been able to do that because they have been prepared to apply themselves to bringing about agreements between industry and the conservation movement to, first of all, protect, where appropriate, native forest estates and, secondly, to provide resource security to the industry both in terms of timber from native forests and in promoting plantation forests for the future. This agreement, the Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement, is one of those. Mr Tuckey, just after the budget was announced on 9 May, put out a portfolio summary media release which he headed `Forestry under the Coalition—1996-2000'. In that document he attempted to set out what he believed were the achievements of his government and he claimed that during the period of the Labor government we had done nothing. For instance, he made the claim that we had not signed any RFAs whilst we were in government. Of course, we all recall that it was the Labor Party, when it was in government prior to 1996, that developed the regional forest agreements process.
—Then you voted against it.
—It was the Labor Party in government actually that finally took action to remove the annual political bunfight that used to go on in the industry.
—And then you wouldn't support us.
—It was the Labor government that established a process to bring the various stakeholders together to sit down and scientifically examine the resources in this industry, to examine the environmental considerations and to promote regional forest agreements. We did that, but unfortunately we lost government in 1996 before that process was really able to get into the stage of negotiation. Mr Tuckey criticises us and Senator McGauran again shoots his mouth off, but the government were elected in March 1996 and if, as they claim, they were so good, and if they want to criticise us because they said we did not get any RFAs negotiated while we were in office, why did it then take them another 12 months to sign the first RFA? It was not until February 1997, 12 months after they got into office, that they were able to sign the first RFA. But, further to that, the target date that was set down to complete the nine RFAs—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Regional Forest Agreement: Gippsland</title>,Documents,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-06,"—In noting the Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement between the Commonwealth and the state of Victoria, the first thing I have to do is concede to the Labor Party that they were at the cutting edge of the regional forest agreement process—and how many thousands of hectares of Australia's forests have been cut since that process began? It is proceeding, of course, at the greatest rate in history but we have now had it overtaken by the Howard government, which has a reprehensible environmental record around the world. 
Just two weeks ago I delivered to the German government pictures of the firebombing and destruction of Tasmania's forests, which goes on while this government is off to the next round of meetings on global warming, pretending it does not occur, discounting it but wanting to count the seedlings that it puts in the ground as an offset to industrial pollution. It is that sort of studied ignorance and deception which the Greens will never allow to go not commented upon. In commenting on this particular agreement between the logging industry and the other logging industry—that is, the Victorian government, the Bracks government, and the Howard government, and what unholy bedfellows they make when it comes to the destruction of forests—that $333 million of taxpayers' money has gone into propping up the logging industry through the regional forest agreement process. But, as far as the production of jobs is concerned, that has not happened. In the case of the Tasmanian agreement, since it was signed in 1998, instead of jobs being secured, some 800 people have been sacked from the industry. There has not been a comment by the Tasmanian Labor government or any process of redressing that, nor will there be anything similar from the Labor government in Victoria. They are co-villains in signing these regional forest agreements—against the wishes of 80 per cent of people in all the opinion polls—with the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Howard, for the continued onslaught on native forests in places like East Gippsland. Everybody knows these days that it is not warranted, that there is a plantation establishment in Australia which already— 
—You are against plantations.
—You don't support plantations. But you wanted plantations—that is the hypocrisy of it.
—I will tell you why I do not support more plantations: we already have more than enough for this nation's needs. People on both sides of the house rip into me about this because they do not like the facts being placed before them. They will twist it, but here is a fact: there is a plantation establishment—and it has grown to maturity in Australia—which is meeting more than Australia's total wood needs. In fact, under these regional forest agreements, in the last 12 months 600,000 cubic metres of logs were exported overseas, largely to Korea, out of our plantations without downstream processing, without jobs, without the economic return that this country should have had for investment in those plantations, because the regional forest agreement process uses public money to subsidise the destruction of native forests against the wishes of the Australian people. It does that because the woodchip corporations, amongst other things, are such handy cheque writers for the coffers of the big political parties. So we have this extraordinary situation where 80 per cent of Australians want this destruction stopped because they know that it is unnecessary and that there are alternatives, but 80-plus per cent of the political establishment votes for it, like members of this chamber. There is a failure of democracy there simply because of the power of the woodchip corporations. 
—Rubbish!
—Senator, you will have your opportunity to get up and defend that statement. You do not like it, but that is the fact; that is the political dynamic of what is happening here. This regional forest agreement sells out not only the people of Gippsland but the people of Victoria as a whole.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Regional Forest Agreement: Gippsland</title>,Documents,13,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I wish to take note of the regional forest agreement for Gippsland and to say a few words about the final signing of these three regional forest agreements. It is good to see that they have finally been done. I just hope that there will be more employment as a result of these agreements being signed. I suspect that in Victoria they will probably lead to more employment because the Victorian government, both the current Labor government and the former Liberal government, has taken a different view to that taken in my home state on what we should be doing with the forest resource.
When this process started, a long period of time ago, it was intended that it would generate a significant amount of employment and that we would see an industry develop. I am talking about an industry developing in manufacturing terms, with greater utilisation of the resource that we take from the forest. But in many instances that has not occurred, and that is the sad thing about this whole process. Despite the current federal minister making a lot of claims about his proposals to assist the generation of employment, nothing has happened. I noted an interjection earlier from Senator McGauran about Labor not supporting the regional forest agreement legislation. We did not support it, simply because the current government, which had given a commitment to implement the proposals that were put forward on industry development, reneged on those issues. You did not set up the council envisaged under the former Labor government, which you committed yourselves to prior to the election. You did not stick with that commitment. You did not set up anything. You set up a bit of a forum, and then you let that lapse. That is the reason we opposed the legislation at the time. You had all the opportunity, but no. Your problem was that you could not cop a situation where workers would be represented on a council by their union, a situation that would actually drive some development in this industry. That is the only body that has driven industry development. The unions were the ones that the industry came to when the issue about access to forests was a live issue. They were the ones that rallied their members. They were the ones that rallied workers to fight for continued access to native forests. 
But what did they get for all of that, and what did the workers get? Very little, I would suggest to you. They certainly have not got job security and they certainly have not got industry development. Here we are, a country that produces a very small proportion of the world's wood products; we intended to have a great increase in manufacturing but we have seen a very significant decline in manufacturing. In particular, we are not utilising the hardwood species in this country to the extent that we should—not to anything like the extent that we should. Yet we know that there is a huge marketplace out there, particularly in the industrial hardwood area. We know that the major populations of the world, such as China, have a huge requirement for wood that we as a country could be supplying in manufacturing terms. But what are we doing? We are exporting a lot of it as woodchips and all-round wood. Frankly, I cannot accept that, and I hope that at some point in time this government will wake up and the minister will get on with the job and start heading down the road to proper and appropriate industry development and resource utilisation.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Regional Forest Agreement: Gippsland</title>,Documents,13,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-06,"—I want to make some comments about the regional forest agreement in Gippsland. Senator Brown has made a contribution on the general principles of regional forest agreements, and I want to cover a few of those aspects in the time available. Regional forest agreements were a development of the former Labor government, and they originated from initiatives developed in Tasmania under a state Labor government—that is, the so-called Salamanca process. Regrettably, with most processes you enter into with some in the environment movement—and I include Senator Brown in this—you become involved in a process to try to resolve disputes. They are significant disputes and they involve legitimate concerns about forestry in this country. But when you get close to finalising a position, the environment movement does not accept the outcome. That is Senator Brown's track record in this area. The height of hypocrisy in forestry issues is the attitude shown by Senator Brown on an issue he referred to in question time today: plantations. I can recall Senator Brown and some of his colleagues urging both state and Commonwealth, Labor and Liberal, governments to encourage the development of plantations in this country. Senator Brown has made comments to that effect on many occasions. He wanted to move forestry from native forests and old-growth forests into plantations. Of course, that is occurring to a very significant extent. There are some tax incentives to do that, and that in part is the reason for the shift to plantations. This shift was called for by Senator Brown in the past, and it is now occurring. 
Plantations are controversial. I have said on the public record on a number of occasions, before the recent controversies erupted surrounding plantations, that plantations are controversial. In Europe particularly the environment movement has had mixed views about plantations for a very long period of time. However, Senator Brown referred to firebombing the forests. I would like to make it clear to the Senate that you have to burn the waste that is left over from forestry operations, at least with respect to native forests in Tasmania. If you do not burn it, the regeneration that occurs is dreadful. The regeneration is not a balanced bush and you end up with a heap of scrub and rubbish, so you have to burn to regenerate. Fire is part of the natural cycle of a eucalypt forest.
With respect to plantations, Senator Brown alleged that dairy farms are being bulldozed, but the central issue is that farmers, certainly in my home state of Tasmania, in dairy and mixed cropping areas—potatoes, onions and other vegetables—with the possible exception of the poppy industry, are not getting a reasonable return, so many of them are turning to plantations because the returns are higher. You cannot blame them for doing that. If you are a farmer, particularly if you are a dairy farmer working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you have the option of plantations being developed on your land, and those plantations are managed by either the forestry department in your particular state or by a private operation, then it is a fairly obvious option. There is a very important principle here: I believe that you cannot tell farmers what to do with their land, and Senator Brown is effectively advocating that we should be telling farmers what to grow on their land. I just think that in principle that is an appalling position to advocate. There are legitimate concerns about chemicals and the way they are used, shade problems and fire problems. They are legitimate concerns that should be taken into account when plantations are developed in any area. But as usual Senator Brown does not take a particularly balanced view on the issue of plantations. As I illustrated earlier, there is some hypocrisy in the comments he makes in this area.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-06-06,"—I want to add some brief comments—
—Do you know where Gippsland is?
—I do not even know what we are arguing about here at all. We are in fact in agreement. Bar Senator Brown, we are all in agreement on this matter. We agree that, yes, your government were wise enough to establish the principles of RFAs. They had to do it because it followed one of the most disruptive protests ever known in Canberra. That was when the logging trucks circled—
—In Gippsland?
—They started from Gippsland and headed here to Canberra. They circled Canberra and basically blocked the parliament in for a week, and that is when the Keating government decided that we needed something a little more certain and less disruptive on this highly political issue. That is when you came up with the idea of RFAs, which we supported you on from day one. It is a good idea. It sets down the principles of certainty and balances the environmental demands with sustainability and employment in the industry. These are principles we are in agreement on, but when we came to government none had been signed. We have in front of us reports on three RFAs that have now been signed. The irony of it for a group that set up the RFAs, laid down very good principles and had our support is that not only could you not get one signed in your term of government but also, when it came to passing legislation in this parliament and supporting us in the RFAs, you refused to do so. You delayed until the union movement came out and told you to let the legislation go through the Senate. Your own union movement pushed you to support this government in the final analysis. In your whole term in opposition, whether it is the RFAs or the government's tax package, whatever it is you just oppose for the sake of it. 
Really we have always been in agreement on this. It is only Senator Brown that disagrees with the government's position on this. Look what we have before us here, Senator Brown. I know I am not going to convince you, but we have the whole area of Gippsland, the East Gippsland and Gippsland Regional Forest Agreements, now signed up. That means employment for the region and it takes out the disruption that used to come out of the East Gippsland area. There were numerous reports that the East Gippsland area had to endure under the Labor state government and the Labor federal government. There were at least a dozen environmental reports on the East Gippsland area prior to the RFA concept, and no decision was ever made. It was the most disruptive area in the forestry industry. East Gippsland now can settle down to a properly balanced industry. Senator Sherry was right about Senator Brown, that we are all utterly confused now about Senator Brown. What a mixed-up proposition he puts to us. At question time he tells us that there are now too many plantations, that dairy farms are being bulldozed—I suppose you can bulldoze a shed—and there are now too many plantations. We know only too well that he has pushed for the government to create incentives for the plantation industry, and that is exactly what we have done. It is now a growing industry; it is a market that is, quite frankly, taking off and we are very proud of that. Quite obviously the plantation industry supplements the forest industry. The more plantations you plant, the less you have to go into the forest to find your wood. What is more, we have in this country a deficit in regard to this industry— 
—Two billion dollars.
—Yes, $2 billion, as Senator Sherry says. There is so much on this that we are in agreement on. We have a $2 billion deficit, and there is only one way to turn around the deficit: by creating plantations in this country. 
Your going over to Germany, showing them pictures of fire bombing and condemning Australia is not only very unAustralian, but what a wacky bunch of Greens! The German Greens are—beside yourself—the wackiest Greens in the whole world. What is more, they run Germany. What an embarrassment. You have finally found your soul mates.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2000-06-06,"—I want to talk about a very serious subject, that is, the conflicts that Australia is privy to in its own area and those in the wider part of the globe. I believe there has rarely been a time since the Second World War when we have had so many conflicts taking place simultaneously around the world. Africa has always been a problem, at least in postwar years. When I was in Zimbabwe late last year, I tried to get up to see President Laurent Kabila in the Congo. I got as far as their border with Zambia, after going by four-wheel drive, by scheduled aircraft and by light aircraft. Unfortunately, there was a resurrection within the army there and the border posts were closed.
—Resurrection! Insurrection.
—Insurrection—thank you. I thank the senator who has been resurrected for that information! When I think of other areas around the globe, I cannot help but wonder where we are going, what part Australia can play—if any, indeed, in those wider areas—and whether in fact those conflicts are going to get worse before they get better.
I would like to speak closer to home with regard to those areas that are of much concern to me. Fiji, of course, is one of those. The Solomon Islands is another one. Bougainville is another one. West Papua, as it is called now, formerly Irian Jaya, is another one. Then there is Aceh, part of the Indonesian empire, if I can refer to it as that. In all of these conflicts around the world, whether they are the Israeli-Lebanese, whether they are the Russian-Chechnyan, whether they are in Colombia or in other parts of South America, or whether they are in Yugoslavia and the Balkans, there is a common thread or threads with which one can identify these conflicts: they arise from either sectarian or land issues or both. 
In our hemisphere I wish to speak particularly of Fiji, which is not a great land mass. It has an area of some 18,300 square kilometres, much less than Australia's eight million square kilometres, that is much, much more if you include our territories and particularly the territory of the Antarctic, or if you want to include our continental shelf, which makes us one of the biggest, if not the biggest, land areas in the world—bigger than Russia and bigger than Canada. Fiji had a population in 1997 of 800,000 people living on 18,300 square kilometres. The other area in conflict, the Solomon Islands, has 27,500 square kilometres, with a population of 280,000 in 1986 and 400,000 in 1996. If you include Indonesia in the equation to get some idea of the problems facing those countries, it has a land area of nearly two million square kilometres and had a population at the end of 1999 of nearly 208 million people. So one can see that Australia is not only relatively well off, but is extraordinarily lucky to be in the position it is in.
Can we ignore those conflicts around us? What if we did have a humanitarian program that took just one per cent as refugees from Indonesia? That would amount to 20 million people or more. What if we just said we would take 0.1 per cent as refugees from the population of Indonesia? That would amount to more than two million people. What is our responsibility? We do have a responsibility for these areas, but just what is it? To whom or what do we give preference? Do we give preference to Christians? Do we give preference to Muslims? If so, what Muslim sects do we give preference to? Do we give preference to those that are closest to us? Do we give preference to those that are English speaking or to those that are non-English speaking? Do we give preference to Papua New Guinea or to their ethnic brothers and sisters in West Papua because they were part of a closer alliance that we had when the British ruled this part of the world? Are we to stand back and continue to criticise but not help in a real sense? We know the days of sending a gunboat up the river are gone and that we cannot do that. But what is it that we can do? What is it that Australia can do, given the gifted position that it is in today, with a GDP that is probably 10 times that of all of those countries I have mentioned close to Australia? 
Are we to just offer some solutions in the form of words? Should we send in a police force or should we send in paramilitary forces, like we have in Bougainville, which is not ethnically part of Papua New Guinea? There must be some sympathy for that alone. What of the position of the ethnic Indians, Fijian born nonetheless? Between 1876 and 1916, 2,000 indentured labourers from India were brought into Fiji annually to mostly, though not exclusively, grow sugarcane. I think of my own country of Australia and its racially divided lines between black and white areas, into some of which white Australians are now not allowed to enter. Is this the lull for us before the storm that is coming? Is this relatively long period of peace, excluding the fracas or civil wars that have been going on, about to come to an end? Are the places like Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Bougainville, Aceh and West Papua the touchpaper of an explosion of more significant forces in this area of the world?
I do worry about my country. I have children of my own. I have grandchildren. I look for a solution. I think a solution could be found if it was an effort made between both sides of parliament and not a parliament that has been used, certainly in my three-and-a-bit years here, to score points, no matter whether there is relevance in a suggestion from the opposite side or whether there is relevance in that which is promoted by the coalition government of this day. Something needs to be done. It is not something that I can offer any solution to of great significance—nor would I try. But I do feel very much not only for the Fijians and those other people who have been, to some degree, dispossessed of their lands, as indeed have Australian Aborigines. I feel for Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and the problems that he is having at the moment. I know that you have personal knowledge of him, Madam President. I have met him on one occasion and I found him to be most elevating in his dialogue; a very kindly man, a highly intelligent person and one with whom I had an immediate affinity. My heart goes out to Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, not just tonight but on many nights when I look at and read media news. I am going to finish, because time is almost up, by saying that we are blessed in this country of Australia.
