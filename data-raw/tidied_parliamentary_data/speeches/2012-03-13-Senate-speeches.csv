Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:36):  I move Greens amendment (8) on sheet 7037 on the new running sheet:


(8)   Page 10 (after line 30), after Division 2, insert:


Division 2A—Requirements for ministerial decisions

   (b)   send to each stakeholder a notice:


      (i)   setting out the nature of the decision; and


      (ii)   inviting stakeholders to make submissions to the Minister about the decision within 42 days of the date of the notice; and


   (c)   publish on the department's website a copy of each submission received under this section.

   (b)   the instrument has been approved by resolution of each House.


(6)   The Minister must cause a report to be prepared setting out the reasons for making a decision.


(7)   The Minister must cause a copy of each report prepared under subsection (6) to be presented to each House of the Parliament at least 28 days before the decision to which the report relates takes effect.


The National Radioactive Waste Management Bill retains the Muckaty site nomination, which all senators are well aware was chosen without procedural fairness or any ability to review the minister's decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. These amendments reinstate procedural fairness and judicial review over the Muckaty nomination. The government have made a great deal of this in trying to run the fiction that they have in fact repealed the former Howard legislation. One of the minister's great claims was that procedural fairness and judicial review were reinstated. I will deal with the procedural fairness first.


There are no rights whatsoever for persons other than those with an interest in the land to make a submission under the terms of this bill. It is likely that people will miss notification of the submission right given that there is no requirement for any details to be provided in the notification that would identify what it was actually about. Providing rights to be heard in the written form is actually quite prejudicial to Aboriginal people, who, in the instance of Muckaty at least, will be the people primarily concerned about the potential for this project to go ahead. But the key thing really is that there are no objectives or criteria in the legislation or in the minister's decision, so it is not possible for a person to know what to make a submission about. There are no criteria by which to guide the minister's hand. There is no right for a person to see information on which the minister will base his decision—for example, anthropological studies and so on—and the minister is free to be as biased as he likes, and literally make a decision on the flip of a coin. The point I am making is that it is all very well to say that we will have procedural fairness, but there is nothing in the bill that actually mandates for it. It is nice that the words are back in there again, but essentially there are no teeth to those provisions in the bill and these Greens amendments seek to reinstate those. 


The claim that judicial review is reinstated is similarly misleading. The bill continues the essential and intentional design feature of the 2005 act in ensuring that there are no grounds on which a judicial review can be based and no access to information on which to base a review. For judicial review to actually have teeth, the minister would need criteria on which to be judged to have failed. We would need some way of saying, 'The minister, in my view, did not do what he was supposed to do, did not do what the bill mandated he do, and therefore there are grounds for review.' Of course, if there are no criteria, as there are not—if it just the minister sitting in a room by himself making up his mind—then there is no possibility of judicial review proceedings getting anywhere near a court. In the context of this uniquely defective piece of legislation, the term 'procedural fairness' is, I gather, by the government, interpreted to mean the ability to make a submission to the minister, which he is then free to ignore. I commend these amendments to the Senate.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:40):  The government will not be supporting this amendment. To be clear, the Minister for Resources and Energy is not the final decision maker for the location of the facility. The minister is responsible for selecting a volunteered site, which must then be referred to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the chief executive of ARPANSA for approval. If a selected site under this bill fails to meet environmental and nuclear regulatory approvals, a facility cannot be constructed on this site. The Greens' proposal, we think, is far too broad and is not accepted by the government.

The CHAIRMAN
 (12:41):   Senator Ludlam, we have a revised running sheet and we have overlooked amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7200. Do you wish to deal with those?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-03-13,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:41):  Chair, I was going to run through the balance of the amendments first. Those amendments that you have noted are the only piece of good news that we will be hearing today, so I was going to save those till last. I seek leave to move together amendments (9), (18), (19), (21) and (28) on sheet 7037. 


Leave granted. 




Senator LUDLAM:
  I move Greens amendments (9), (18), (19), (21) and (28):


(9)   Clause 9, page 11 (lines 3 and 4), omit "", in his or her absolute discretion,"".


(18)   Clause 14, page 17 (lines 11 and 12), omit "", in his or her absolute discretion,"".


(19)   Clause 14, page 17 (lines 19 and 20), omit "", in his or her absolute discretion,"".


(21)   Clause 17, page 18 (line 25), omit "", in his or her absolute discretion,"".


(28)   Clause 27, page 29 (line 7), omit "", in his or her absolute discretion,"".


I will not detain the chamber unnecessarily with these amendments because effectively they go to many of the same issues that I have already dealt with in some detail—essentially, the absolute discretion of the minister. If there are no processes, rules and guidelines, and if there is nothing in the bill to guide the minister's discretion, he is free to ignore geotechnical advice, anthropological advice and indeed the will of the parliament. He is free to ignore anything whatsoever, including submissions from whatever such consultative groups that he might stand up. He has absolute discretion. That is what effectively makes it impossible for a court to review a decision of the minister because there will not be anything by which a court or potential applicants can say the minister did wrong. The minister is free under the terms of this legislation to effectively just toss a coin and there will be no way that we will know (a) that that was the process or (b) that there is any way of reviewing the decision. There is no requirement to provide reasons. We do not think an approval or a declaration of this kind should be subject to such unfettered ministerial discretion.


I am well aware that this effectively sets a slew of processes in motion under the ARPANS Act and EPBC Act, that this bill effectively fires the starting gun on a nomination, on a place from where all these processes will then flow. If the minister does not do his job properly and chooses a flawed site, as of course Muckaty is, we could go through two or three years of process under the ARPANS Act and under environmental impact assessment before realising that the process itself is flawed. There must be some criteria by which to guide the minister. This gets even scarier if we consider that when the Muckaty nomination falls over, as of course it will, we will then be looking for some other presumably impoverished Aboriginal community, perhaps at the behest of a land council, perhaps not, to accommodate the nation's toxic radioactive waste—which is somehow so unsafe it cannot remain where it is but will be safe enough when we have parked it on an Aboriginal community's land. We do not think that a bill that establishes such a process should go ahead without any form of discretion to guide the minister. I commend these amendments to the Senate.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:44):  As Senator Ludlam indicated, we have had this debate earlier in the debate on this bill. We do not accept that the minister has untethered or unaccountable decision-making powers under the bill. In this administrative law context, 'absolute discretion' identifies who is entitled to exercise powers under the bill. The absolute discretion clauses therefore make it unambiguously clear that the minister is the responsible decision maker. As we know, this has been contained in other bills. It does not in any way limit the capacity for courts to review those decisions, and they will infer limitations on the ministerial discretion from the structure and purpose of the legislation.


Question negatived.

(23)    Clause 18, page 20 (lines 3 to 7), subclause (5) TO BE OPPOSED.


These amendments go to precisely what I have spoken of already at a deal of length and complete the process of removing limitations on procedural fairness.


Again, we have attempted in good faith to improve on the fact that this bill vests total discretion with the minister and sets up the fiction that judicial review and procedural fairness now apply. I do not think the government should be allowed to get away with that fiction. Quite clearly there are gaping holes in the ability of people who are concerned—not necessarily just in the instance of the Muckaty bill but as sites are volunteered down the track. They will have been told by the minister that procedural fairness applies. They will realise when they read the legislation that it is simply there in name only. I commend these two amendments to the chamber.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:47):  The government does not support the amend­ments. The site selection process is guided by procedural fairness. That is a requirement that applies to all government decision making. It is also the case that the Administrative Review Council, a statutory body which was established to advise the Commonwealth Attorney-General on a broad range of matters related to the Common­wealth system of administrative law, made a submission on the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill and recommended that, rather than excluding procedural fairness, the bill should extend procedural fairness to parties with a specified interest in the decision to select the site for a facility. Those recommendations have now been incorporated into the decision-making processes under the bill. We do not believe the Greens' proposed amendments are consistent with how procedural fairness has been interpreted by the courts and therefore we will not be supporting the amendments.

  The question is that clauses 10(7) and 18(5) stand as printed.

These amendments go to something that we have not spoken of in so much detail, so I will advise the chamber of why we are moving them. An aspect of the campaign that has been led, I think quite appropriately, by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is a very strong objection to the Territory being targeted for the location of a radioactive waste dump effectively because of its constitutional vulnerability. However, the government has sought to cover the field. These amendments relate to the fact that the bill shoulders aside the application of all state and territory laws that may be relevant to siting a radioactive waste dump, whether it is in the Territory or elsewhere. The bill displaces, wholesale, entire bodies of law to the extent that they would regulate, hinder or prevent key matters pertaining to the facility, including its siting, its construction, its operation and the transport of material to or from the facility.


Legal experts have cautioned against the Commonwealth arbitrarily stripping powers from the states and territories by suspending the application of all state and territory laws. That includes environmental protection laws and regs, Aboriginal heritage laws, and health and safety standards. The Northern Territory Chief Minister and his government are firmly opposed. They note the obvious flaws in the Commonwealth strategy of suspending the operation of laws designed to safeguard public health, heritage and the environment.


It is unbelievably obnoxious that the government should think it would be a good idea to simply bulldoze aside laws that have been put there for the protection of the public good, of public health, of the environment and of Aboriginal heritage. There will be, obviously, insufficient Commonwealth controls because the Commonwealth has not regulated these matters before. Traditionally, locations, siting and regulation of hazardous waste facilities or installations have been regulated by the state. The Commonwealth does not have an equivalent body of law. There is nothing in any Commonwealth act that you can tell me that regulates personnel or infrastructure in any remote area dump, so suspending the state and territory bodies of law that were designed precisely to regulate these things is completely unacceptable.


This approach fails to take into consideration the fact that state or territory emergency service personnel and infrastructure will be needed should an accident or incident arise and that nuclear waste will be transported past the doors of many Australian homes, often on roads prone to accidents and extreme weather conditions, particularly flooding. In their submission on the bill, lawyers from the Northern Territory EDO argued that the bill should be changed to ensure that state and territory laws apply so as to assist to manage the environmental impacts and risks as thoroughly as possible. The EDO stressed the absurdity of suspending particularly any regulation of the transport of nuclear waste. The ARPANS Act is based on the existence of complementary state and territory regulation, so it is not able to address issues that are not directly related to radioactivity. So the last thing you would want to do would be to push aside the bodies of law that have been instituted by the states and territories to address those gaps in Commonwealth law. It is utterly negligent. Without the state and territory laws applying, it is possible that surrounding land uses could be inadequately controlled to prevent issues developing at the facility.


Dr Patrick Emerton suggested in the inquiry that even if it is conceded that the management of radioactive waste raises particular issues that cannot be resolved within the framework of ordinary environmental or heritage protection laws—which is in itself a pretty contentious claim—it should be possible for the bill to make much more specific provision in respect of the suspension of such laws. Specifically, our amendments assert that it is possible to institute a regime under which such laws are prima facie operative but in certain circumstances—for example, following the failure of negotiations between the Commonwealth and the state or territory in question—those laws could be suspended by regulation in respect of a particular activity. So there is still a get-out clause. We have engaged here in good faith. The presumption should be that these laws apply, and the government should be able to apply for specific exemptions for specific reasons. I think that is a way of getting what the government is after without simply ram-raiding these entire bodies of law. Specific and piecemeal suspension consequent on narrowly specified circumstances would thereby replace the current provisions without undermining the purposes of the bill. I commend these amendments to the chamber.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:52):  I feel some conflict here—I am arguing, against the Greens, for Commonwealth powers, while they are supporting states' rights. It is a very unusual position for Senator Ludlam to take in these debates. We do not think his propositions are workable. Provisions in the bill which override state and territory laws operate only to the extent necessary for the facility to be established and to operate as intended. An Australian government facility such as this would normally be regulated through Commonwealth laws. State and territory laws would normally have no role to play. Obviously allowing those laws to apply would permit their legislation to prohibit the siting of a facility and transporting waste. We think that would produce a conflicting outcome that is inimical to the objective of the bill, which is to provide for the establishment of a national radioactive waste management facility.


The other issues that Senator Ludlam refers to can be accommodated through cooperative arrangements with state and territory agencies such as law enforcement and fire brigade organisations et cetera. It is important that it be clear in the bill that the Commonwealth law will apply, and that is the approach the government prefers very much to what I think would be a very complicated matrix that could undermine the whole objective of the bill if the Greens amendments were supported.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:54):  It is a little rich at this late stage of the day to start proposing cooperative arrangements with the states and territories. This has been a profoundly uncooperative approach by the government. They have caused extreme resentment in the Territory government and the Territory ALP, and the Chief Minister is on the record over and over again saying how uncooperative the government have been. What has the government done to ensure cooperation in the very important examples that have been identified, such as emergency services and police?

This will establish a regime that makes things clear, and, as happens in a multitude of other cases, the normal negotiations about operational issues where state and territory agencies are involved will occur.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:56): by leave—I move government amendments (1) to (3) on sheet CN227:


(1)   Clause 17, page 18 (line 26), at the end of subclause (1), add “or (4)”.


(2)   Clause 17, page 18 (line 29), after “14(2)” insert “or (4)”.


(3)   Clause 17, page 19 (lines 2 and 3), omit “that was, immediately before the revocation, the selected site”, substitute “that was the subject of the revoked declaration”.


These amendments relate to the revocation of the minister's declaration. By way of background, the bill currently provides that the minister may declare a volunteered site as the site for a radioactive waste management facility. A declaration has the effect of acquiring any rights or interests in the selected site to construct and operate a radioactive waste management facility on that site subject to environmental and regulatory approvals.


The minister may also make a similar declaration for the purposes of acquiring all-weather road access to the site. Clause 17 provides that the minister may revoke a declaration to acquire a site for the facility. This provision reverses a decision to select a site in the event that the site fails to meet regulatory approvals. In its current draft the bill does not allow the same revocation to also be made for all-weather road access to the site. This problem was originally identified in the Parliamentary Library Bills Digest. There is no policy justification that would require the Commonwealth to continue a declaration for road access to a site that would not be the location of the facility, and therefore these amendments address what was a minor oversight and clear up something that ought to be fixed. I encourage the chamber to support the amendments.

In my opening comments some time ago I foreshadowed that the Greens would be moving not simply to oppose the bill and not simply, failing that, to improve the bill but also, failing even that, to propose alternatives to the bill. As I have said before, the only aspect of this debate with which I strongly agree with the minister is that this is an extremely difficult and vexed issue that has plagued governments of both of the old persuasions for many years. We thought that the government was on the right track in the comments it made before the election and that some sense would be restored to the debate—but no such luck; the government failed to implement its election promise and its own policy platform to establish a consensual process for site selection based on science and based on consultation on the basis that the Australian Greens would attempt to implement the government's policy. That is what this amendment addresses. We propose an independent commission on the long-term safe storage, transport and management of Australia's radioactive waste. That is how we should responsibly deal with the 4,020 cubic metres of so-called low-level and short-lived intermediate-level radioactive waste and the approximately 600 cubic metres of long-lived waste in this country. The Greens take very seriously the responsibility of dealing with the 32 cubic metres of spent research reactor fuel which is returning to Australia in 2015-16 after reprocessing in France and the UK, although I do note that the government is well within its legal rights to seek an extension of time should the establishment of processes here in Australia for the disposal or storage of that waste not be concluded by then.


An independent commission is the best way to go about this—to actually learn from international best practice. The phrase 'international best practice' has been flipped around relentlessly in this debate so far. So let us put on the public record exactly what best practice on radioactive waste management is. There has been 60 years of case history, of the experience of countries dealing with far more of this material than Australia. From that case history we can actually get a reasonably good idea as to who is doing it well and, more importantly, who is doing it badly. The roles of the commission, therefore, would be to establish this best practice, to establish an inventory of the waste which needs to be stored and of the waste management procedures currently used by the state and the Commonwealth, and to undertake a proper audit of the volumes, activity and contractual arrangements. I think the first two of those are reasonably well understood, but there is some ambiguity around the contractual arrangements. The government has been hopping up and down saying that that was the urgency and then we later found out that there is in fact no such urgency since the material can safely be stored at Lucas Heights—so we are told by the government—or we can renegotiate with our overseas partners for a deferral for a short period of time. The commission should also publicly canvass the community, it should hear independent expert views and it should also hear from the industry. From all that, the commission should make recommendations on how we can provide ongoing scrutiny of the implementation of the decisions arrived at through this proper independent process. 



Hansard will not record whether or not the minister and the government advisers are collectively rolling their eyes down at the other end of the chamber over the proposal to establish yet another commission, another inquiry, another working party or another look at the issue. I want to go into some detail about why we would do that. The reason we need to have this debate is that Australia has never had it before. Every single process which has been attempted in Australia over the last two decades for the storage and the management of radioactive waste has started with the assumption that it needs to be on a remote dump somewhere and that it needs to be on Aboriginal land—perhaps on a site that has been volunteered or perhaps just dumped on a site the government has settled on coercively. The common theme has been that it needs to be a remote store somewhere in the outback of Australia. We need to start a different conversation without a predetermined outcome. That is the key thing here—that a process with some genuine independence would not automatically assume that we need to chase up a disadvantaged Aboriginal community to host this material. But that is where these processes inevitably seem to run when they are guided by politics. As I was told by ANSTO officials more than two years ago now, this is just politics—there is no engineering reason for dumping it; this is being guided by the urgent perceived need to get it the hell away from the cities. That is an appalling way to deal with this material.


The proposed commission will obviously not work unless it is genuinely independent and unless the people conducting the study bring an open mind and a willingness to listen to a variety of views. The amendment we have proposed is complex and I will just sketch out briefly what it does. We have proposed that the commission be genuinely independent; that it can inform itself in any way it sees fit; that it can consult with whomever it sees fit; that it can receive written and oral information; that it can hold public seminars, conduct workshops and establish other taskforces or working groups; that it must reflect a variety of viewpoints representing alternative approaches to addressing the subject; and, perhaps most importantly, that it is not subject to control or direction by the minister—that is, that it is truly independent. That means that its findings will enjoy authority and confidence. These qualities are the best ingredients for social licence. We envisage the commission being made up of five people, appointed by the Governor-General, on a full-time basis for 15 months. After that period of time, the commission would have to deliver an initial report to the minister. That is a reasonable period of time, I think, to do this sort of process well.


The government keep on saying that there is an urgency to resolve this matter, but they waited two years before acting to repeal the Howard legislation. The government then tried to hold an inquiry of only 11 working days—and here we are, two years later. By not going about this properly, by attempting to perpetuate the ram-raid that the Howard government began, the government has wasted years. By ignoring the experience of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the British government, the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and, most recently, that of the United States at Yucca Mountain, the government have wasted a great deal of time. We should take the time to do this properly. There is no compelling reason for us to be suddenly in a huge hurry to do this badly. Establishing the commission is how to do it properly.


The International Atomic Energy Agency told the government in 2007 that governments, having used undemocratic methods lacking public involvement and acceptance, 'have had to reconsider their programs'. That sounds familiar, does it not? That is exactly the path we are on here. One of the conclusions of the study was that reassessment can become necessary because past decisions were not reached through socially acceptable processes. Does that sound familiar to anyone down that end of the chamber? It is very rarely that I would come in here and quote the IAEA in shades of anything approaching approval, but they say:


… there is a need for public involvement in the decision-making process, adequate financial provisions, clear integrated plans on how spent fuel and radioactive waste will be managed to ensure continued safety into the future—


this could be for decades—


to avoid creating a legacy situation that would impose undue burden on future generations.


That—a situation which imposes undue burden on future generations—is precisely the sort of set-up being put forward right here in this chamber this afternoon. After 20 years of failing with this kind of approach, somehow the government believes it is now going to succeed. In a statement, the UK Committee on Radioactive Waste Management said:


There is growing recognition that it is not ethically acceptable to impose a radioactive waste facility on an unwilling community.


This is of course precisely what the government proposes to do with this legislation. The minister might still be harbouring some kind of strange delusion—from his office down in Melbourne or cocooned away here in Canberra—that he does have social licence, that he does have a willing community, that he has a signature on a piece of paper and that therefore everybody is happy with the process. He can perhaps maintain that fiction because he has refused to meet with anybody with a different point of view. He has not met with them at his office. He does not return correspondence anymore. Therefore, perhaps he still believes that it is simply going to sail through just because he has got his bill.


The UN Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, to which Australia is a party, notes that public consultation on radioactive waste management strategies was not only a good practice to follow but also essential for the development of a successful and sustainable policy. So it is very difficult to miss the emphasis placed by the IAEA, the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the EU, the UK and the Japanese government on winning public confidence and obtaining social licence and community consent for the siting of radioactive waste facilities. Minister, I put to you that you do not have any of those things. You do not have public confidence, you do not have social licence and you do not have community consent. It has been demonstrated all the way through the passage of this bill. Once the bill passes—and I believe it will, perhaps even later on this afternoon—you will realise just how much you lack those essential things.


Australia is either a member of these institutions and treaties or we have strong relationships with those countries considered to be like-minded on many fronts—for example, considered to be democracies—which makes it all the more regrettable that Australia lags behind on this aspect of international best practice: the obtaining and securing of community consent. To do that you need to build confidence that you are not simply going to kick down the front door and dump waste somewhere whether people are happy with that or not. We need to learn from the understandings of principles on transparency, community participation and stakeholder involvement in decision making around nuclear waste. Instead, in the inquiry into this bill, a good long while ago now—the minister may not have this quote in front of him—ANSTO claimed, 'We are not experts on these matters'. I had asked them: who is in charge of consent; who do I talk to about consultation, building of social licence and building of confidence in the community? ANSTO claimed at that point, 'Hmm, we're not experts on these matters in the areas of public consultation that relate to this.' Of course they are not; they are engineers. They build stuff. They look after the waste. It must be somebody else's job.


Despite ANSTO's CEO being charged with the responsibility to take into account best international practice, the answer effectively is that it is nobody's job. I am interested to know who is responsible for making sure that when the words 'world's best practice' are again uttered in this chamber or in the minister's press release—and I will put this question to you directly, Minister—if it is not ANSTO's job to ensure that social licence is created and that confidence is built in the community around the siting of these materials, whose job is it? It would be helpful if it were the responsibility of either a ministerial portfolio or the Public Service—anybody at all. Whose job is it to ensure that consent is obtained for a dump such as this?

"Evans, Sen Christopher",ALP,2012-03-13,"



Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:10):  I thank Senator Ludlam for his contribution, although he knows I will not be supporting the amendment. The first thing to say is that it is very easy to talk about these processes as though somehow there is a unanimity of view and a consensus is going to be able to be reached. This is a highly controversial subject matter. Quite frankly, Senator, I suspect I could spend 10 years searching for social licence and you would still be opposing the dump, because that is your strongly held view. I respect that view. You somehow think that we are going to be able to get to a position where everyone is in total support of a view. Part of what you do is to try and undermine confidence in the process, because you raise your serious concerns about it. So I am not sure that it is therefore fair to say, if you have not got there, if you have not convinced everyone, you cannot do anything. We have gone through a very long process, a long gestation, with this legislation to try and get to a landing point, and there is a long way to go yet, once the bill is agreed, if it is agreed, by the Senate.


From what we can see, the amendment seeks to establish a commission whose principal functions are largely already performed by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, ARPANSA. ARPANSA incorporates international best practice in its approach to radiation protection and nuclear safety. From its inception, ARPANSA established the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council, the Radiation Health Committee and the Nuclear Safety Committee, whose functions are—and I note—'to represent the interests of the general public, to advise on matters relating to nuclear safety and the safety of control facilities and to identify emerging issues relating to radiation protection and nuclear safety'. So I think in broad terms the answer to your main query is ARPANSA. In deciding to issue a licence, ARPANSA must take into account specified regulations and international best practice in relation to radiation protection and nuclear safety. Thus, if you like, ARPANSA is the arbiter of international best practice in the Australian context.


We think the commission proposed in the Greens' amendment is pretty woolly, pretty vague. The only thing it is actually mandated to do is prepare a report. We think the current regime provides a better answer than that proposed by the Greens. As I said, it is largely already performed by ARPANSA and we do not think the commission adds to the overall architecture we are putting in place. As I said, I understand the concerns and issues you raise, Senator Ludlam, but I do not think anyone could suggest that this has not been a long and involved process in which many people have put their views. But, in the end, this parliament has to decide on a piece of legislation. I think we have had five major inquiries. It has been a long and detailed process. As I said, the government will not be supporting the amendment. We think the current architecture is a preferable one.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:13):  I thank the minister for those comments. As profoundly unsatisfying as they may be, at least they are on the record. The minister made a couple of points that cannot go unanswered. Just because we have been at this process for a while, Minister—through you, Chair—that does not make it a good process. It is a process that, from opposition, you described as 'sordid' and 'profoundly shameful'. It was something on which you attacked coalition MPs, including Senator Scullion—good afternoon, Senator Scullion—who has joined us to conclude the debate. Minister, you attacked the coalition when they instituted this precise process. So, yes, it has been going for years and, yes, we have been opposing it, because it is a rotten process.


   I think it thoroughly exemplifies all the things that you could do poorly. The reason it has taken so long is that people have been pouring sand into the gears, whether they are legal challenges in the Federal Court, demonstrations right around the country, resolutions by quite powerful unions around the country or a fantastic community campaign that has sprung up to oppose this thing. A big part of the reason that you are so far behind is that you are going the wrong way. We have effectively been trying to save the government from itself, simply bringing it back to where it was in opposition, which we supported. As soon as Labor got into government it turned around and simply perpetuated a rotten process that was not starting from the point of view of consent at all.


You note that ARPANSA are the ones who will be responsible for organising the social licence and the community consent that I was talking about. Does the minister consider that it might be somewhat backwards for the minister to say it is going to Muckaty, 'There you go, ARPANSA. Go and consult'? There is something a little bit awkward about the cause and effect there—that the government will decide where it will go and then it will consult at you until you consent. That is why this process has gone so badly off the rails. Perhaps the minister did not recognise exactly what it was that the Greens were trying to do, because we do not have a foregone conclusion. There is nothing in this amendment that says: 'At the end of this commission's process it will go where we decided it was going to go all along.' There is no preordained conclusion to this amendment. The idea is to come at it with an open mind and not ask: 'Which remote Aboriginal community should host radioactive waste until the end of time?'


You will not find a target or a postcode or a set of geographical coordinates in our amendment, because they are not there. We are not ready to make the decision to dump this material in a remote community. That case has never been made. In fact, the opposite case has been made. Witnesses from ANSTO told me: 'Look, this is just political. This is not about engineering. It is about getting it as far from white people as possible.' That is a horrendous agenda. The language of the bill that we are looking at has many references to Aboriginal communities and land councils. Why? What is the assumption that it has to be as far away from the centres of population as possible? That is what people are asking me when I go to Tennant Creek. That is what they would ask Minister Ferguson if he took the time to go there as well.


This process has been dismissed, more or less, out of hand by the minister, as the government have already made up their minds: 'It's going to go there. We'll consult once the minister's decided where it's going to go.' That is why you have a fight on your hands. I commend these amendments to the chamber.


Question negatived.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (13:17):  I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7111 standing in my name:


 (1)   Page 33 (after line 15), after Part 6, insert:


Part 6A—National Repository Capital Contribution Fund


34A  Application of Part


      This Part applies if:


   (a)   the Minister has made a declaration under subsection 14(2) that a site in a State or Territory (the relevant State or Territory) is selected as the site for a facility; and


   (b)   a facility has been constructed at the site.


34B  National Repository Capital Contribution Fee


(1)   An entity wishing to use the facility, other than the following entities:


   (a)   the Commonwealth;


   (b)   the relevant State or Territory; 


   (c)   an authority of the Commonwealth or the relevant State or Territory;


must pay such fee (the Capital Contribution Fee) as is prescribed by the regulations as a capital contribution towards the cost of the facility before being eligible to have radioactive waste accepted by the facility for storage, management or any other purpose.


The background to this amendment is that, when the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 was first introduced, I had some concerns that there were a number of jurisdictions that we thought were pretty much getting a free hit. High on my list of those getting a free hit was South Australia. Despite the assurances of my colleague from the Greens, who says that we basically always said it should go to Muckaty, it is quite the contrary. After millions of dollars of investment, Australia decided that the very best place for it to go was, in fact, in section 52 of the Officer Basin in South Australia. There was a huge amount of investment from everybody and, fundamentally, an agreement—a difficult agreement but an agreement across every state and territory that there would be a national task to find the best place, and the best place, as I said, was in South Australia.


We all know the history. The previous Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, in a rush of political blood to his head during an election, decided: 'No. After all that work, it's not going to the best place in Australia. It's not coming to South Australia.' The Commonwealth, unsurprisingly, was caught pretty left-footed, as was everybody else. This process started with the Labor government, then the process went across to the conservative government and now it is back with the Labor government. It has gone on for a very long time. The fundamental point about why we are here today is the failure of Mike Rann to accept an absolute ironclad agreement with everybody. Every state and territory signed up to the fact that we would invest millions of dollars ensuring that it went to the best place. Scientists decided where the best place was for a whole range of reasons—transportation, the level of amenities and all those sorts of things—and, very sadly, that is why we are here today.


I put the original amendment forward to say: 'Since this has been foisted on us and since nobody else seems to want to have it, the only jurisdictions that can keep the materials here are the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth. Every other jurisdiction will have to sort themselves out, because we're not going to cop it.' We have always copped it as a territory, and that is because we are not a state. We are dictated to about what happens in the Northern Territory. Let's face it: that we are a territory is the only reason it has been able to be put there. So the amendment was put forward to ensure that no other jurisdiction, apart from the Commonwealth, was able to keep their material there.


It has come to my attention over the last little while that there were, in fact, some rumblings about jurisdictions. Even South Australia was saying, 'I know what we'll do: we'll gift it to the Commonwealth and that will get us around Scullion's amendment. We'll gift all our material from the other jurisdictions to the Commonwealth. That gets around the amendment and it is then the Commonwealth's material and they'll be able to store it.' My thinking process was along the lines of this: 'We built something to the amenity of everywhere.' I was pretty cranky at the time. Let's face it, you cannot go to sleep in the Commonwealth; you have to go to sleep in a state or territory. Every state and territory certainly benefits in some way from having a research reactor at Lucas Heights. On that basis, if any other jurisdiction wants to store material there—the Territory has made the contribution, and it certainly was not voluntary—the Commonwealth is paying the money and the other states and territories should do the same. This amendment effectively establishes the capital contribution fund, which is to provide enhanced public services or infrastructure to any state or territory. It is not just to the Territory, because if somebody can eventually capitulate—particularly the current Premier of South Australia, who still stands up today and says, 'Look, I'm terribly sorry; we got it all wrong'—South Australia will be able to have a capital contribution fund that will be paid into. So this is not about Muckaty; this is about a capital contribution fund for whatever state or territory takes this repository. Wherever it is sited, this repository will provide safe and suitable storage for national and possibly, should they pay, state and territory material.


The key feature of this amendment is that the fund will stand in credit of $10 million, and that is prior to the acceptance of any material from any source. So before any material arrives from the Commonwealth, the Territory or anywhere else, $10 million has to be in the fund that is available to a board consisting, pretty much, of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and some people with some expertise in health, particularly in infrastructure. Again, the use of the fund was motivated only since the provision of some $32 million by the Howard government, and it is well on the record that that was levered between David Tollner and me. Basically, at that stage, if you had cancer you knew you had to be on a flight to Adelaide. No matter where you came from—whether you came from Alice, Katherine, Tennant Creek or wherever—you knew you had to be on a flight to Adelaide, because that was simply the closest amenity. That was only a few years ago. So what everyone else in Australia took for granted we just did not have access to in the Northern Territory. We now have an oncology unit in the Northern Territory. In places like Adelaide, because they have had oncology services for so long, they are training people in oncology services and have a large population of people who are ready to staff it. But that is not the case in the Territory, and we need very much to grow our own staff to ensure that we provide the same level of amenity that people take for granted in every other part of Australia.


It all comes down to some sort of justice for Territorians. We are still having this foisted on us, and that certainly cost the previous coalition government some $32 million. That will never be enough because it is never going to compensate us for how we feel as Territorians, and I acknowledge that. This amendment deals with closing the equity gap, if you like, to ensure that Territorians actually get the same level of oncology services enjoyed by others.


Just before I sit down—and I understand there are some agreements to ensure that we do not keep this debate going—let me say to Senator Ludlam that I not only have visited ANSTO but have spoken to ANSTO staff extensively, and I have never heard them say that it is not a case of just not wanting to put the dump near white people. Now, mate, I am a mate of yours, and you can check the Hansard, but that is what you have said. All I am saying is that I have been here for a fair while longer through this particular debate, and I have never had that put to me. I am just putting it on the record for you that I have never had that put to me, and I have extensively questioned it, both personally in the pub and across the committee bench. I just thought I would put that on the record.


This is a very important amendment, particularly to Territorians, so that we can try to close the gap between access to health services. I commend the amendment to the house.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-03-13,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:26):  I will briefly respond to some of Senator Scullion's comments and also indicate that the Greens will not be supporting this amendment. That is somewhat moot, of course, because this bill will get up with us or without us, but I do not think it is appropriate for us to sit on the same side of the chamber as Senator Scullion on this particular amendment. As much as you might say that it is wonderful that you have managed to score 10 million bucks from the Commonwealth government in order for the Territory to cop it, I want to back up a bit to your earlier remarks about South Australia, because they go precisely to the point that I was making just before you rose, which was that that study started on the assumption that the waste will be going to a remote bit of country somewhere. Which bit of faraway country from the cities is best for it? They looked at geology, geophysics, earthquakes, rainfall, groundwater, access to transport corridors and so on, starting on the premise that, sooner or later, it would go to some remote piece of land, and that is precisely what I am trying to avoid with the amendment that the Senate just negatived. I am very happy to put it back up again if you are going to have second thoughts, although I am not sure I can do that. It started on the assumption that it is going to a remote bit of land. It started on the terra nullius premise, and guess what? When you got there the Cooper Pedy Kungas were there, saying, 'No, you don't.' They were not asked, but a bunch of scientists were asked: if we are going to put this stuff in a remote shed, where should the remote shed be? It was started on a premise that pre-empted the outcome of an honest inquiry, which is what we are putting up. When you got there, it was not empty land; the Kungas were there, and they said, 'No thanks; we're not having it.' They put up a very, very strong campaign, which is effectively the template for what the Muckaty are up to now, calling in people from around the country, and indeed around the world, to say: 'If this stuff is safe in Sydney, perhaps it should stay in Sydney; if it is not safe in Sydney, why the hell are you bringing it to our block?' Where is the case for this stuff to go remote?


With great respect, Senator Scullion—and you were involved in that process back then—I was on the other side of the debate supporting the Kungas from a long way away in Western Australia. This is not a NIMBY approach. From a Western Australian perspective maybe they should have just copped it. But of course not; they are out there; it was their flock. They were not consulted and neither were the Muckaty mob.


In terms of the substance of this amendment, the Chief Minister branded the $10 million rent money for the dump as offensive. He said it was a bone being thrown at us to try to get us to roll over.




Senator Scullion:
  Let's see him knock it back.




Senator LUDLAM:
  He is not going to have the choice. The minister was saying before about how cooperative this is all going to be once the bill passes—that we will cooperatively engage with Territory police and emergency services so that they can cooperatively deal with a disaster, if there is one, after we have pushed the laws aside regulating transport of this material. It is all going to get nice and cooperative after we have passed this law. If they have no choice in taking the $10 million fund, I am sure they will put it to good use. The Territory is not rolling in cash; I hope they do put it to good use. But it absolutely is offensive. I think that is an entirely appropriate word for the idea that for 10 million bucks you are somehow over the line. Senator Scullion, join us on this side of the chamber when we vote against this bill. It should not be going into your electorate. It should not be going up to the Muckaty block, and that is what this bill sets in train. I have put as clearly as I possibly can that the Greens will not be supporting this amendment when it is put.

(30)   Page 35 (after line 28), after clause 37, insert:


37A Obligation to minimise production of waste


      Despite any other law, any agreement between the Commonwealth and another party or parties involving the production of radioactive waste must be made subject to the condition that each contracting party must take appropriate steps to ensure that the generation of radioactive waste is kept to the minimum practicable.


This is an amendment that I am sure will get late support from both the government and the opposition, so I do not intend to call a division. What it does is provide an obligation to minimise production of waste, and who could possibly disagree with that? I am sure if you are proposing to vote against this amendment you will stand up and pat me on the head and say that I am well intentioned, or that this is a great idea but you will be voting against it. 


We are proposing to minimise the production of this material in the first place which, I hazard to guess, is probably the only area of agreement between every party in here in this entire debate, because it is such an intractable headache for people and has been for so many years. One thing we should all be able to agree on is to minimise the generation of it in the first place. It does not absolve us of responsibility to look after what we already have, but let us move away from the misleading concept of disposal towards a sense of stewardship and harm minimisation. Of course, the first thing you would do if that were your interest would be to minimise the production of this stuff in the first place. I strongly commend this amendment to the Senate.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:31):  I hate to disappoint Senator Ludlam, but I cannot support this amendment. Not to patronise him, I think we have a joint objective of minimising the radioactive waste material that we have to deal with, but we would argue that that waste minimisation process is already taking place. There are obligations for the producers of the waste, and we therefore see the amendment as being unnecessary and creating a range of other complications.

 (Western Australia) (13:32):  Minister, in that spirit, can you describe for us what the Australian government is doing to phase out the use of reactor sourced isotopes, as is happening in Europe and Canada, and phase in alternative sources of medical isotope production that do not rely on reactors, such as particle accelerators? If we are all on board with this agenda of waste minimisation, what are you doing specifically?

We are obviously looking to learn from any experiences that they have, but the suggestion is that this is still at a very early stage.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:33):  Our waste minimisation strategy is to sit around and see if the Canadians come up with anything? I take it our strategy is not to do anything ourselves. I could come up with plenty of other examples of how we do not have a waste minimisation culture when it comes to radioactive waste in any sense of the word. But I think I made my point simply in looking at the case of radioisotopes. In my closing remarks I will read some statements from medical professionals who have demanded that the government and coalition stop using medical isotopes as a fig leaf of justification for producing this waste in the first place. We do not need it. It is not really good enough for the minister to stand up and say, 'The Canadians are up to something and we will give it some thought.' Recognising that you are here in a representational capacity and you are not expected to be an instant expert in everything, I would have thought the advisers could provide you with something a little more substantial than you will wait and see what the Canadians get up to. I think I have made my point and I commend this amendment very, very strongly to the chamber.

It is clearly in everyone's interest to minimise the amount of waste. There are costs and issues involved with the management, so it is a key driver of behaviour. In terms of the international experience, we are interested in any developments that will help inform best practice in Australia. But we are not in a position to respond to those at this time.

(3)   To avoid doubt, section 10 of the new radioactive waste law, and the new ADJR Act, apply in relation to a nomination or an approval continued in force by this item.


I will speak very briefly to this one as I have already given the chamber the benefit of my views on the fiction of judicial review in this bill. This is the final amendment to put some teeth into the bill that I propose, so that some judicial review is applicable—namely, that the minister should have some criteria by which to be judged on whether or not he did what the bill said he should do.


At the moment, the bill essentially says if he were to throw a dart at a board in the privacy of his office and decide that that was where the dump was going, that would not be a reviewable decision even if he published a photograph of the dartboard. We do not think that that is appropriate, so I commend this amendment to the Senate.

Senator Ludlam made the point we have had this argument, and the government do not accept the core Greens argument that we think procedural fairness will not be followed.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-03-13,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:36):  I come back to where we began—that is, I move Greens amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7200, concerning clause 4 on the definition of 'controlled material':


(1)   Clause 4, page 3 (line 1), after “1998”, insert “that is of domestic origin”.


(2)   Clause 4, page 3 (line 2), at the end of the definition of controlled material, add “For this purpose, controlled material is of domestic origin if it has been used in Australia, generated by activities in Australia, or sent to Australia under contractual arrangements relating to the conditioning or reprocessing of ANSTO spent nuclear fuel (within the meaning of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987).


This amendment is the only piece of good news that I can announce to the chamber this afternoon. The government has apparently agreed with the substance if not the detailed wording of my arguments in the debate before last on importation of international radioactive waste. I am glad Senator Scullion is still here, and I am hoping we can get consensus so this one will not need to go to a vote. Despite some of the more remarkable commentary from some of the more unhinged members in the other place—if that term could be considered parliamentary—proposing that we import radioactive waste from overseas as a commercial proposition, I am glad to have the understanding that the government has agreed with the sentiments that I raised: that we should formally preclude this from occurring, that it should not simply exist in regulation and that it should be in Australian legislation as it is in the instance of building nuclear power plants, recognising that there is a small fringe of people in this parliament who think that that would also be a good idea. We have come back with wording, which I understand the government will be supporting, to more accurately define what we mean by international waste.


For example, if there are fears that we are seeking to legally preclude the return of Australian obligated reprocessing waste from France and the UK, that is not the intention. I think it is still an open question as to whether that material should return and when, but we are not seeking to legally ban it. We are seeking to legally ban a Pangea-style international commercial radioactive waste dump. I have fairly close experience with such a proposition, because that lunatic idea was actually landed upon Western Australians in 1999. I would be very pleased to have the support of the chamber in formally precluding such a proposition.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:38):  Can I say, Mr Chairman, that Senator Ludlam has worn me down, and I have finally seen the light and have agreed to support these amendments. Earlier in the debate Senator Ludlam moved a similar motion about which the government had concerns about the technical effects but, because I know his views are genuinely held and we thought there was a meeting of minds, we have been able to accept the reworked amendment from Senator Ludlam. It has been the position of successive Australian governments that Australia will not accept other countries' radioactive waste. As a fellow Western Australian, I lived through the same experience Senator Ludlam did, with a proposal that I think Western Australians generally regarded as pretty offensive.


The Greens amendments effectively restricts access to the national radioactive waste management facility of waste that originates from use of radioactive materials and nuclear activities in Australia. In particular, it permits waste arising from overseas reprocessing of Australian research reactor fuel to be accepted at the facility. It complements controls under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and the prohibition already in the bill on acceptance of high-level waste, preventing the facility from accepting used power reactor fuel. As I said, this has been a policy of successive Australian governments. It is one that this government is committed to, and we are very happy to have that reflected in the bill and the act. That will ensure that the parliament would have to debate this issue before there were any change in policy in that regard. I think it strengthens the bill, so the government will support the amendment.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (13:40):  Senator Ludlam, you are probably one of the few people around who would be aware of my original 10 amendments to this bill, one of which was pretty much identical to your amendment today. As I said the other day, I did not lose the fight, but I was compelled by the argument that this could be protected under the Customs Act. I agreed to that, but you know the way these sorts of things go.


One of the issues that we deal with in this place, Senator Ludlam, is providing comfort to those who might be concerned about something. Even if we have one particular piece of legislation that says quite specifically that you cannot import something under the Customs Act because it is existing legislation, people will feel happier if we have a particular piece of legislation that actually says, above and beyond whatever particular act that we have quite reasonably used to prevent any import, that we specifically proscribe something that gets rid of that particular fear.


That was one of the 10 points that served as the amendments to the original bill. So I commend you very highly on convincing the government in a way I was not able to convince my government, I have to admit. I think this is certainly something that those people who argue that there is still some possibility of somebody else's international waste coming into Australia can now put to bed. We will be supporting the amendments.

Senator Furner
):  Order! The public is reminded that there are no comments in the public gallery, thank you. Senator Ludlam has the call.

Senator LUDLAM:
  Yes, indeed. I just note the interjections from the public gallery. I am not sure whether Hansard or Broadcasting will record it, actually, but a number of people who obviously feel very strongly about the campaign just dropped a banner from the public gallery. This is just the beginning, Minister. For the minister's advisers who have come down and will shortly be—



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  I had no idea that was on its way, Senator Bernardi, but good on them for coming in here, because quite clearly the parliament is about to fail on this vote in its duty of care to the people of the Northern Territory, and particularly to the people on the front line in Tennant Creek, which I have been very fortunate to visit a couple of times. They have spent plenty of time here in parliament. They have come down when we thought this bill might get up in the past. It is a long way for them to travel down here. There are many people who are very much here with us in spirit. They are bearing witness, they are observing what is going on here and they are sending to the government and to the opposition a very clear message: you have won the vote today—you are probably about to win the vote today unless there is a late-breaking change and things are going better than expected—but you are going to lose the campaign. That dump is not going to Muckaty.


What has happened, in fact, is that there has been targeting of four separate sites. One thing that I will acknowledge this bill does is take three of those Defence sites off the table. Those people are being let off the hook. They have all pledged to line up and support the Muckaty mob. They are taking a collective approach that, if it had landed on their site or their block, they know that the people of the Territory would have been behind them. The government here has provoked a fight that it did not need to pick, and there are many, many groups around the country and around the world who will now step up, because while debate was suspended in this parliament perhaps there was some hope that sense would prevail. We are about to profoundly fail in our duty of care to those people.


There is a wonderful photo exhibition that was launched in Sydney in January called Manuwangku, Under the Nuclear Cloud. 'Manuwangku' is the way that the mob pronounce the bit of land that we are calling 'Muckaty' in here. It was cosponsored by Amnesty International and the Beyond Nuclear Initiative. Sandy Edwards, who is the curator, recalls one of the most evocative images of this gorgeous collection of photos by Jagath Dheerasekara: 'Three women dressed in brightly coloured garments dance in the shadow of a big black drum with a yellow nuclear symbol on it. The message is clear. We can only hope that the Manuwangku community is spared this terrible fate and that these photographs will help the outcome.' I wonder if the minister got a copy of that book or whether he took the time to go along to the exhibition. That is Amnesty International, who fight around the world on horrific abuses of human rights, taking a position on the way that this particular community has been treated and trying to spread their message.


Oxfam, in a recent press statement, said:


With key issues of ownership, traditional owner consent and affected community support for the radioactive waste facility currently before the Federal Court, the Gillard Government should defer debate on this controversial legislation.


Oxfam took a position not on the particular siting decision but on the process, which is what I have been doing.


As a signatory to the Declaration—


on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples—


Australia has committed to obtaining the free, prior, and informed consent of Indigenous peoples before adopting laws and policies which may affect them.


That was Oxfam. Obviously there is no free, prior and informed consent.


The minister is seeking unanimity. You will never find it, but what you have in this instance is unanimity of opposition. Perhaps you would be able to do a little bit better than that. There have been very strong positions taken by the union movement. There is probably not a huge amount that they could do while we are in here debating the process, but when it actually comes to putting equipment on the ground and shipping the material in through Australian ports perhaps the government will realise the kind of fight that it has picked. Unions NT resolved as long ago as the 12th of last April to fight the radioactive waste dump. NT ETU organiser Michael Haire said at the time:


Unions NT pledged to continue the campaign in solidarity with Traditional Owners and the community of Muckaty and Tennant Creek.


We strongly oppose the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill—


which they thought might pass the Senate last May—


and reject any legislation which would continue to target Muckaty Station, or any site in the Northern Territory for a nuclear waste dump.


I would like to also acknowledge the many campaigners from Friends of the Earth and particularly the ACE Collective in Melbourne, who have done wonderful work in bringing this campaign right up to Minister Martin Ferguson's doorstep. If he thought he was being inconvenienced up to now then I suspect he has not seen anything yet, because these are extremely creative, passionate and determined people who will not lie down simply because this parliament failed in its duty of care.


I do not think the Northern Territory government are planning on folding either. I think this campaign has a long way to run. February 2010 was the earliest press release that I could find. The Chief Minister, Paul Henderson, who has courageously opposed this project since it was proposed by the Howard government, said:


I am disappointed the Federal Government has decided to push ahead with legislation that will override Territory legislation … I was informed this week that—


the Howard—


legislation would be repealed and our environmental heritage and appeal rights would be restored. We have now had a chance to examine the new legislation and this is not the case.


What they did was to realise that Minister Ferguson just cut and pasted the bill that Senator Scullion's government had carriage of and then tried to pretend that it was something new. How absurd. They must think we are idiots.


I referenced the Public Health Association of Australia before in terms of medical professionals saying, 'Stop using medical procedures and medical radiopharmaceuticals as a shield and a pretence that we need the dump. This is about spent fuel. This is not about medical wastes.' I think the Public Health Association of Australia brought to the minister's and the government's attention the fact that there are other ways of producing radiopharmaceuticals, and the medical procedures obviously do not need to be put at risk by this campaign to prevent the nuclear waste dump getting up. The government has taken, in my view, quite a shameful stance in pretending somehow that kids will get cancer if Dianne Stokes does not get a radioactive waste dump up at Muckaty. It is utterly offensive to put that kind of thing on the people up there.


I have been profoundly moved by taking part in this campaign over the last couple of years, and it is clear that we are just beginning. The dispute over the land tenure itself is still in the Federal Court, but I think the deeper argument about why we continually assume that an Aboriginal community in some remote part of Australia should host this waste is the deeper question, irrespective of the outcome of the vote we are to take here this afternoon and the action in the Federal Court. Why do we always insist that this dump needs to be somewhere remote?


The final words for this stage of this campaign, of course, must go to Dianne Stokes, but I did not want to pass without acknowledging some of the people who have put their heart and soul into this campaign over far, far too many years. Natalie Wasley has effectively put her life on hold and helped run an extraordinary campaign. Dave Sweeney from ACF has been working overtime on this campaign for years and years and is, I think, one of the smartest and cleverest antinuclear campaigners that I have ever come across. I would particularly like to mention Gerry McCarthy in the Northern Territory government, who I think has gone above and beyond in challenging the coercive attitude of his federal colleagues who seem to think that they can just ram this thing through.


The last words, of course, are to Dianne. She says in the introduction to the Manuwangku, Under the Nuclear Cloud booklet: 'This waste dump needs to stop. Martin Ferguson needs to start listening to us. He'd better do that because he doesn't know what's going to happen at the other end. There's a fight waiting and that's my promise. I will always be a strong person to fight against it.' That is the unnecessary fight that this government has picked in a bipartisan consensus with the opposition that proposed it in the first place, and this is the beginning of the campaign to stop Muckaty, not the end.

8A  Application of Division


(1)   This Division applies to each decision to be made by the Minister in relation to the nomination, selection and approval of sites under this Act, including (but not limited to) each of the following:


   (a)   a decision to make a declaration under section 6;


   (b)   a decision to approve land, or a specified part of land, under section 9;

8B  Requirements in relation to decisions


(1)   A decision to which this Division applies must comply with the provisions of this section.


(2)   Before the Minister makes a decision, the Secretary of the Department must:


   (a)   publish on the department's website a notice:


      (i)   setting out the nature of the decision; and


      (ii)   inviting persons to make submissions to the Minister about the decision within 42 days after the notice is published; and


   (b)   send to each stakeholder a notice:


      (i)   setting out the nature of the decision; and


      (ii)   inviting stakeholders to make submissions to the Minister about the decision within 42 days of the date of the notice; and


   (c)   publish on the department's website a copy of each submission received under this section.


(3)   In making a decision, the Minister must:


   (a)   have regard to the submissions in relation to the decision received under subsection (2); and

   (c)   hydrology;


   (d)   community consent;


   (e)   international best practice;


   (f)   such additional criteria (if any) as are specified by the Minister under subsection (5).


(5)   The Minister may, by legislative instrument, specify additional criteria in relation to a decision for the purposes of paragraph (4)(f), but must not apply those criteria in making a decision until either:


   (a)   the period for the disallowance of the instrument has expired in each House of the Parliament; or 


   (b)   the instrument has been approved by resolution of each House.


(6)   The Minister must cause a report to be prepared setting out the reasons for making a decision.


(7)   The Minister must cause a copy of each report prepared under subsection (6) to be presented to each House of the Parliament at least 28 days before the decision to which the report relates takes effect.


The National Radioactive Waste Management Bill retains the Muckaty site nomination, which all senators are well aware was chosen without procedural fairness or any ability to review the minister's decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. These amendments reinstate procedural fairness and judicial review over the Muckaty nomination. The government have made a great deal of this in trying to run the fiction that they have in fact repealed the former Howard legislation. One of the minister's great claims was that procedural fairness and judicial review were reinstated. I will deal with the procedural fairness first.


There are no rights whatsoever for persons other than those with an interest in the land to make a submission under the terms of this bill. It is likely that people will miss notification of the submission right given that there is no requirement for any details to be provided in the notification that would identify what it was actually about. Providing rights to be heard in the written form is actually quite prejudicial to Aboriginal people, who, in the instance of Muckaty at least, will be the people primarily concerned about the potential for this project to go ahead. But the key thing really is that there are no objectives or criteria in the legislation or in the minister's decision, so it is not possible for a person to know what to make a submission about. There are no criteria by which to guide the minister's hand. There is no right for a person to see information on which the minister will base his decision—for example, anthropological studies and so on—and the minister is free to be as biased as he likes, and literally make a decision on the flip of a coin. The point I am making is that it is all very well to say that we will have procedural fairness, but there is nothing in the bill that actually mandates for it. It is nice that the words are back in there again, but essentially there are no teeth to those provisions in the bill and these Greens amendments seek to reinstate those. 


The claim that judicial review is reinstated is similarly misleading. The bill continues the essential and intentional design feature of the 2005 act in ensuring that there are no grounds on which a judicial review can be based and no access to information on which to base a review. For judicial review to actually have teeth, the minister would need criteria on which to be judged to have failed. We would need some way of saying, 'The minister, in my view, did not do what he was supposed to do, did not do what the bill mandated he do, and therefore there are grounds for review.' Of course, if there are no criteria, as there are not—if it just the minister sitting in a room by himself making up his mind—then there is no possibility of judicial review proceedings getting anywhere near a court. In the context of this uniquely defective piece of legislation, the term 'procedural fairness' is, I gather, by the government, interpreted to mean the ability to make a submission to the minister, which he is then free to ignore. I commend these amendments to the Senate.

To be clear, the Minister for Resources and Energy is not the final decision maker for the location of the facility. The minister is responsible for selecting a volunteered site, which must then be referred to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the chief executive of ARPANSA for approval. If a selected site under this bill fails to meet environmental and nuclear regulatory approvals, a facility cannot be constructed on this site.

If there are no processes, rules and guidelines, and if there is nothing in the bill to guide the minister's discretion, he is free to ignore geotechnical advice, anthropological advice and indeed the will of the parliament. He is free to ignore anything whatsoever, including submissions from whatever such consultative groups that he might stand up. He has absolute discretion. That is what effectively makes it impossible for a court to review a decision of the minister because there will not be anything by which a court or potential applicants can say the minister did wrong. The minister is free under the terms of this legislation to effectively just toss a coin and there will be no way that we will know (a) that that was the process or (b) that there is any way of reviewing the decision. There is no requirement to provide reasons. We do not think an approval or a declaration of this kind should be subject to such unfettered ministerial discretion.


I am well aware that this effectively sets a slew of processes in motion under the ARPANS Act and EPBC Act, that this bill effectively fires the starting gun on a nomination, on a place from where all these processes will then flow. If the minister does not do his job properly and chooses a flawed site, as of course Muckaty is, we could go through two or three years of process under the ARPANS Act and under environmental impact assessment before realising that the process itself is flawed. There must be some criteria by which to guide the minister. This gets even scarier if we consider that when the Muckaty nomination falls over, as of course it will, we will then be looking for some other presumably impoverished Aboriginal community, perhaps at the behest of a land council, perhaps not, to accommodate the nation's toxic radioactive waste—which is somehow so unsafe it cannot remain where it is but will be safe enough when we have parked it on an Aboriginal community's land. We do not think that a bill that establishes such a process should go ahead without any form of discretion to guide the minister. I commend these amendments to the Senate.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:44):  As Senator Ludlam indicated, we have had this debate earlier in the debate on this bill. We do not accept that the minister has untethered or unaccountable decision-making powers under the bill. In this administrative law context, 'absolute discretion' identifies who is entitled to exercise powers under the bill. The absolute discretion clauses therefore make it unambiguously clear that the minister is the responsible decision maker. As we know, this has been contained in other bills. It does not in any way limit the capacity for courts to review those decisions, and they will infer limitations on the ministerial discretion from the structure and purpose of the legislation.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:46):  The Greens oppose clauses 10(7) and 18(5) in the following terms:

(23)    Clause 18, page 20 (lines 3 to 7), subclause (5) TO BE OPPOSED.


These amendments go to precisely what I have spoken of already at a deal of length and complete the process of removing limitations on procedural fairness.


Again, we have attempted in good faith to improve on the fact that this bill vests total discretion with the minister and sets up the fiction that judicial review and procedural fairness now apply. I do not think the government should be allowed to get away with that fiction. Quite clearly there are gaping holes in the ability of people who are concerned—not necessarily just in the instance of the Muckaty bill but as sites are volunteered down the track. They will have been told by the minister that procedural fairness applies. They will realise when they read the legislation that it is simply there in name only. I commend these two amendments to the chamber.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:47):  The government does not support the amend­ments. The site selection process is guided by procedural fairness. That is a requirement that applies to all government decision making. It is also the case that the Administrative Review Council, a statutory body which was established to advise the Commonwealth Attorney-General on a broad range of matters related to the Common­wealth system of administrative law, made a submission on the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill and recommended that, rather than excluding procedural fairness, the bill should extend procedural fairness to parties with a specified interest in the decision to select the site for a facility. Those recommendations have now been incorporated into the decision-making processes under the bill. We do not believe the Greens' proposed amendments are consistent with how procedural fairness has been interpreted by the courts and therefore we will not be supporting the amendments.

These amendments go to something that we have not spoken of in so much detail, so I will advise the chamber of why we are moving them. An aspect of the campaign that has been led, I think quite appropriately, by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is a very strong objection to the Territory being targeted for the location of a radioactive waste dump effectively because of its constitutional vulnerability. However, the government has sought to cover the field. These amendments relate to the fact that the bill shoulders aside the application of all state and territory laws that may be relevant to siting a radioactive waste dump, whether it is in the Territory or elsewhere. The bill displaces, wholesale, entire bodies of law to the extent that they would regulate, hinder or prevent key matters pertaining to the facility, including its siting, its construction, its operation and the transport of material to or from the facility.


Legal experts have cautioned against the Commonwealth arbitrarily stripping powers from the states and territories by suspending the application of all state and territory laws. That includes environmental protection laws and regs, Aboriginal heritage laws, and health and safety standards. The Northern Territory Chief Minister and his government are firmly opposed. They note the obvious flaws in the Commonwealth strategy of suspending the operation of laws designed to safeguard public health, heritage and the environment.


It is unbelievably obnoxious that the government should think it would be a good idea to simply bulldoze aside laws that have been put there for the protection of the public good, of public health, of the environment and of Aboriginal heritage. There will be, obviously, insufficient Commonwealth controls because the Commonwealth has not regulated these matters before. Traditionally, locations, siting and regulation of hazardous waste facilities or installations have been regulated by the state. The Commonwealth does not have an equivalent body of law. There is nothing in any Commonwealth act that you can tell me that regulates personnel or infrastructure in any remote area dump, so suspending the state and territory bodies of law that were designed precisely to regulate these things is completely unacceptable.


This approach fails to take into consideration the fact that state or territory emergency service personnel and infrastructure will be needed should an accident or incident arise and that nuclear waste will be transported past the doors of many Australian homes, often on roads prone to accidents and extreme weather conditions, particularly flooding. In their submission on the bill, lawyers from the Northern Territory EDO argued that the bill should be changed to ensure that state and territory laws apply so as to assist to manage the environmental impacts and risks as thoroughly as possible. The EDO stressed the absurdity of suspending particularly any regulation of the transport of nuclear waste. The ARPANS Act is based on the existence of complementary state and territory regulation, so it is not able to address issues that are not directly related to radioactivity. So the last thing you would want to do would be to push aside the bodies of law that have been instituted by the states and territories to address those gaps in Commonwealth law. It is utterly negligent. Without the state and territory laws applying, it is possible that surrounding land uses could be inadequately controlled to prevent issues developing at the facility.


Dr Patrick Emerton suggested in the inquiry that even if it is conceded that the management of radioactive waste raises particular issues that cannot be resolved within the framework of ordinary environmental or heritage protection laws—which is in itself a pretty contentious claim—it should be possible for the bill to make much more specific provision in respect of the suspension of such laws. Specifically, our amendments assert that it is possible to institute a regime under which such laws are prima facie operative but in certain circumstances—for example, following the failure of negotiations between the Commonwealth and the state or territory in question—those laws could be suspended by regulation in respect of a particular activity. So there is still a get-out clause. We have engaged here in good faith. The presumption should be that these laws apply, and the government should be able to apply for specific exemptions for specific reasons. I think that is a way of getting what the government is after without simply ram-raiding these entire bodies of law. Specific and piecemeal suspension consequent on narrowly specified circumstances would thereby replace the current provisions without undermining the purposes of the bill. I commend these amendments to the chamber.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:52):  I feel some conflict here—I am arguing, against the Greens, for Commonwealth powers, while they are supporting states' rights. It is a very unusual position for Senator Ludlam to take in these debates. We do not think his propositions are workable. Provisions in the bill which override state and territory laws operate only to the extent necessary for the facility to be established and to operate as intended. An Australian government facility such as this would normally be regulated through Commonwealth laws. State and territory laws would normally have no role to play. Obviously allowing those laws to apply would permit their legislation to prohibit the siting of a facility and transporting waste. We think that would produce a conflicting outcome that is inimical to the objective of the bill, which is to provide for the establishment of a national radioactive waste management facility.


The other issues that Senator Ludlam refers to can be accommodated through cooperative arrangements with state and territory agencies such as law enforcement and fire brigade organisations et cetera. It is important that it be clear in the bill that the Commonwealth law will apply, and that is the approach the government prefers very much to what I think would be a very complicated matrix that could undermine the whole objective of the bill if the Greens amendments were supported.

What has the government done to ensure cooperation in the very important examples that have been identified, such as emergency services and police?

This will establish a regime that makes things clear, and, as happens in a multitude of other cases, the normal negotiations about operational issues where state and territory agencies are involved will occur.

(2)   Clause 17, page 18 (line 29), after “14(2)” insert “or (4)”.


(3)   Clause 17, page 19 (lines 2 and 3), omit “that was, immediately before the revocation, the selected site”, substitute “that was the subject of the revoked declaration”.


These amendments relate to the revocation of the minister's declaration. By way of background, the bill currently provides that the minister may declare a volunteered site as the site for a radioactive waste management facility. A declaration has the effect of acquiring any rights or interests in the selected site to construct and operate a radioactive waste management facility on that site subject to environmental and regulatory approvals.


The minister may also make a similar declaration for the purposes of acquiring all-weather road access to the site. Clause 17 provides that the minister may revoke a declaration to acquire a site for the facility. This provision reverses a decision to select a site in the event that the site fails to meet regulatory approvals. In its current draft the bill does not allow the same revocation to also be made for all-weather road access to the site. This problem was originally identified in the Parliamentary Library Bills Digest. There is no policy justification that would require the Commonwealth to continue a declaration for road access to a site that would not be the location of the facility, and therefore these amendments address what was a minor oversight and clear up something that ought to be fixed. I encourage the chamber to support the amendments.

In my opening comments some time ago I foreshadowed that the Greens would be moving not simply to oppose the bill and not simply, failing that, to improve the bill but also, failing even that, to propose alternatives to the bill. As I have said before, the only aspect of this debate with which I strongly agree with the minister is that this is an extremely difficult and vexed issue that has plagued governments of both of the old persuasions for many years. We thought that the government was on the right track in the comments it made before the election and that some sense would be restored to the debate—but no such luck; the government failed to implement its election promise and its own policy platform to establish a consensual process for site selection based on science and based on consultation on the basis that the Australian Greens would attempt to implement the government's policy. That is what this amendment addresses. We propose an independent commission on the long-term safe storage, transport and management of Australia's radioactive waste. That is how we should responsibly deal with the 4,020 cubic metres of so-called low-level and short-lived intermediate-level radioactive waste and the approximately 600 cubic metres of long-lived waste in this country. The Greens take very seriously the responsibility of dealing with the 32 cubic metres of spent research reactor fuel which is returning to Australia in 2015-16 after reprocessing in France and the UK, although I do note that the government is well within its legal rights to seek an extension of time should the establishment of processes here in Australia for the disposal or storage of that waste not be concluded by then.


An independent commission is the best way to go about this—to actually learn from international best practice. The phrase 'international best practice' has been flipped around relentlessly in this debate so far. So let us put on the public record exactly what best practice on radioactive waste management is. There has been 60 years of case history, of the experience of countries dealing with far more of this material than Australia. From that case history we can actually get a reasonably good idea as to who is doing it well and, more importantly, who is doing it badly. The roles of the commission, therefore, would be to establish this best practice, to establish an inventory of the waste which needs to be stored and of the waste management procedures currently used by the state and the Commonwealth, and to undertake a proper audit of the volumes, activity and contractual arrangements. I think the first two of those are reasonably well understood, but there is some ambiguity around the contractual arrangements. The government has been hopping up and down saying that that was the urgency and then we later found out that there is in fact no such urgency since the material can safely be stored at Lucas Heights—so we are told by the government—or we can renegotiate with our overseas partners for a deferral for a short period of time. The commission should also publicly canvass the community, it should hear independent expert views and it should also hear from the industry. From all that, the commission should make recommendations on how we can provide ongoing scrutiny of the implementation of the decisions arrived at through this proper independent process. 



Hansard will not record whether or not the minister and the government advisers are collectively rolling their eyes down at the other end of the chamber over the proposal to establish yet another commission, another inquiry, another working party or another look at the issue. I want to go into some detail about why we would do that. The reason we need to have this debate is that Australia has never had it before. Every single process which has been attempted in Australia over the last two decades for the storage and the management of radioactive waste has started with the assumption that it needs to be on a remote dump somewhere and that it needs to be on Aboriginal land—perhaps on a site that has been volunteered or perhaps just dumped on a site the government has settled on coercively. The common theme has been that it needs to be a remote store somewhere in the outback of Australia. We need to start a different conversation without a predetermined outcome. That is the key thing here—that a process with some genuine independence would not automatically assume that we need to chase up a disadvantaged Aboriginal community to host this material. But that is where these processes inevitably seem to run when they are guided by politics. As I was told by ANSTO officials more than two years ago now, this is just politics—there is no engineering reason for dumping it; this is being guided by the urgent perceived need to get it the hell away from the cities. That is an appalling way to deal with this material.


The proposed commission will obviously not work unless it is genuinely independent and unless the people conducting the study bring an open mind and a willingness to listen to a variety of views. The amendment we have proposed is complex and I will just sketch out briefly what it does. We have proposed that the commission be genuinely independent; that it can inform itself in any way it sees fit; that it can consult with whomever it sees fit; that it can receive written and oral information; that it can hold public seminars, conduct workshops and establish other taskforces or working groups; that it must reflect a variety of viewpoints representing alternative approaches to addressing the subject; and, perhaps most importantly, that it is not subject to control or direction by the minister—that is, that it is truly independent. That means that its findings will enjoy authority and confidence. These qualities are the best ingredients for social licence. We envisage the commission being made up of five people, appointed by the Governor-General, on a full-time basis for 15 months. After that period of time, the commission would have to deliver an initial report to the minister. That is a reasonable period of time, I think, to do this sort of process well.


The government keep on saying that there is an urgency to resolve this matter, but they waited two years before acting to repeal the Howard legislation. The government then tried to hold an inquiry of only 11 working days—and here we are, two years later. By not going about this properly, by attempting to perpetuate the ram-raid that the Howard government began, the government has wasted years. By ignoring the experience of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the British government, the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and, most recently, that of the United States at Yucca Mountain, the government have wasted a great deal of time. We should take the time to do this properly. There is no compelling reason for us to be suddenly in a huge hurry to do this badly. Establishing the commission is how to do it properly.


The International Atomic Energy Agency told the government in 2007 that governments, having used undemocratic methods lacking public involvement and acceptance, 'have had to reconsider their programs'. That sounds familiar, does it not? That is exactly the path we are on here. One of the conclusions of the study was that reassessment can become necessary because past decisions were not reached through socially acceptable processes. Does that sound familiar to anyone down that end of the chamber? It is very rarely that I would come in here and quote the IAEA in shades of anything approaching approval, but they say:


… there is a need for public involvement in the decision-making process, adequate financial provisions, clear integrated plans on how spent fuel and radioactive waste will be managed to ensure continued safety into the future—


this could be for decades—


to avoid creating a legacy situation that would impose undue burden on future generations.


That—a situation which imposes undue burden on future generations—is precisely the sort of set-up being put forward right here in this chamber this afternoon. After 20 years of failing with this kind of approach, somehow the government believes it is now going to succeed. In a statement, the UK Committee on Radioactive Waste Management said:


There is growing recognition that it is not ethically acceptable to impose a radioactive waste facility on an unwilling community.


This is of course precisely what the government proposes to do with this legislation. The minister might still be harbouring some kind of strange delusion—from his office down in Melbourne or cocooned away here in Canberra—that he does have social licence, that he does have a willing community, that he has a signature on a piece of paper and that therefore everybody is happy with the process. He can perhaps maintain that fiction because he has refused to meet with anybody with a different point of view. He has not met with them at his office. He does not return correspondence anymore. Therefore, perhaps he still believes that it is simply going to sail through just because he has got his bill.


The UN Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, to which Australia is a party, notes that public consultation on radioactive waste management strategies was not only a good practice to follow but also essential for the development of a successful and sustainable policy. So it is very difficult to miss the emphasis placed by the IAEA, the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the EU, the UK and the Japanese government on winning public confidence and obtaining social licence and community consent for the siting of radioactive waste facilities. Minister, I put to you that you do not have any of those things. You do not have public confidence, you do not have social licence and you do not have community consent. It has been demonstrated all the way through the passage of this bill. Once the bill passes—and I believe it will, perhaps even later on this afternoon—you will realise just how much you lack those essential things.


Australia is either a member of these institutions and treaties or we have strong relationships with those countries considered to be like-minded on many fronts—for example, considered to be democracies—which makes it all the more regrettable that Australia lags behind on this aspect of international best practice: the obtaining and securing of community consent. To do that you need to build confidence that you are not simply going to kick down the front door and dump waste somewhere whether people are happy with that or not. We need to learn from the understandings of principles on transparency, community participation and stakeholder involvement in decision making around nuclear waste. Instead, in the inquiry into this bill, a good long while ago now—the minister may not have this quote in front of him—ANSTO claimed, 'We are not experts on these matters'. I had asked them: who is in charge of consent; who do I talk to about consultation, building of social licence and building of confidence in the community? ANSTO claimed at that point, 'Hmm, we're not experts on these matters in the areas of public consultation that relate to this.' Of course they are not; they are engineers. They build stuff. They look after the waste. It must be somebody else's job.


Despite ANSTO's CEO being charged with the responsibility to take into account best international practice, the answer effectively is that it is nobody's job. I am interested to know who is responsible for making sure that when the words 'world's best practice' are again uttered in this chamber or in the minister's press release—and I will put this question to you directly, Minister—if it is not ANSTO's job to ensure that social licence is created and that confidence is built in the community around the siting of these materials, whose job is it? It would be helpful if it were the responsibility of either a ministerial portfolio or the Public Service—anybody at all. Whose job is it to ensure that consent is obtained for a dump such as this?

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:10):  I thank Senator Ludlam for his contribution, although he knows I will not be supporting the amendment. The first thing to say is that it is very easy to talk about these processes as though somehow there is a unanimity of view and a consensus is going to be able to be reached. This is a highly controversial subject matter. Quite frankly, Senator, I suspect I could spend 10 years searching for social licence and you would still be opposing the dump, because that is your strongly held view. I respect that view. You somehow think that we are going to be able to get to a position where everyone is in total support of a view. Part of what you do is to try and undermine confidence in the process, because you raise your serious concerns about it. So I am not sure that it is therefore fair to say, if you have not got there, if you have not convinced everyone, you cannot do anything. We have gone through a very long process, a long gestation, with this legislation to try and get to a landing point, and there is a long way to go yet, once the bill is agreed, if it is agreed, by the Senate.


From what we can see, the amendment seeks to establish a commission whose principal functions are largely already performed by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, ARPANSA. ARPANSA incorporates international best practice in its approach to radiation protection and nuclear safety. From its inception, ARPANSA established the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council, the Radiation Health Committee and the Nuclear Safety Committee, whose functions are—and I note—'to represent the interests of the general public, to advise on matters relating to nuclear safety and the safety of control facilities and to identify emerging issues relating to radiation protection and nuclear safety'. So I think in broad terms the answer to your main query is ARPANSA. In deciding to issue a licence, ARPANSA must take into account specified regulations and international best practice in relation to radiation protection and nuclear safety. Thus, if you like, ARPANSA is the arbiter of international best practice in the Australian context.


We think the commission proposed in the Greens' amendment is pretty woolly, pretty vague. The only thing it is actually mandated to do is prepare a report. We think the current regime provides a better answer than that proposed by the Greens. As I said, it is largely already performed by ARPANSA and we do not think the commission adds to the overall architecture we are putting in place. As I said, I understand the concerns and issues you raise, Senator Ludlam, but I do not think anyone could suggest that this has not been a long and involved process in which many people have put their views. But, in the end, this parliament has to decide on a piece of legislation. I think we have had five major inquiries. It has been a long and detailed process. As I said, the government will not be supporting the amendment. We think the current architecture is a preferable one.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:13):  I thank the minister for those comments. As profoundly unsatisfying as they may be, at least they are on the record. The minister made a couple of points that cannot go unanswered. Just because we have been at this process for a while, Minister—through you, Chair—that does not make it a good process. It is a process that, from opposition, you described as 'sordid' and 'profoundly shameful'. It was something on which you attacked coalition MPs, including Senator Scullion—good afternoon, Senator Scullion—who has joined us to conclude the debate. Minister, you attacked the coalition when they instituted this precise process. So, yes, it has been going for years and, yes, we have been opposing it, because it is a rotten process.


   I think it thoroughly exemplifies all the things that you could do poorly. The reason it has taken so long is that people have been pouring sand into the gears, whether they are legal challenges in the Federal Court, demonstrations right around the country, resolutions by quite powerful unions around the country or a fantastic community campaign that has sprung up to oppose this thing. A big part of the reason that you are so far behind is that you are going the wrong way. We have effectively been trying to save the government from itself, simply bringing it back to where it was in opposition, which we supported. As soon as Labor got into government it turned around and simply perpetuated a rotten process that was not starting from the point of view of consent at all.


You note that ARPANSA are the ones who will be responsible for organising the social licence and the community consent that I was talking about. Does the minister consider that it might be somewhat backwards for the minister to say it is going to Muckaty, 'There you go, ARPANSA. Go and consult'? There is something a little bit awkward about the cause and effect there—that the government will decide where it will go and then it will consult at you until you consent. That is why this process has gone so badly off the rails. Perhaps the minister did not recognise exactly what it was that the Greens were trying to do, because we do not have a foregone conclusion. There is nothing in this amendment that says: 'At the end of this commission's process it will go where we decided it was going to go all along.' There is no preordained conclusion to this amendment. The idea is to come at it with an open mind and not ask: 'Which remote Aboriginal community should host radioactive waste until the end of time?'


You will not find a target or a postcode or a set of geographical coordinates in our amendment, because they are not there. We are not ready to make the decision to dump this material in a remote community. That case has never been made. In fact, the opposite case has been made. Witnesses from ANSTO told me: 'Look, this is just political. This is not about engineering. It is about getting it as far from white people as possible.' That is a horrendous agenda. The language of the bill that we are looking at has many references to Aboriginal communities and land councils. Why? What is the assumption that it has to be as far away from the centres of population as possible? That is what people are asking me when I go to Tennant Creek. That is what they would ask Minister Ferguson if he took the time to go there as well.


This process has been dismissed, more or less, out of hand by the minister, as the government have already made up their minds: 'It's going to go there. We'll consult once the minister's decided where it's going to go.' That is why you have a fight on your hands. I commend these amendments to the chamber.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (13:17):  I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7111 standing in my name:


 (1)   Page 33 (after line 15), after Part 6, insert:


Part 6A—National Repository Capital Contribution Fund


34A  Application of Part


      This Part applies if:


   (a)   the Minister has made a declaration under subsection 14(2) that a site in a State or Territory (the relevant State or Territory) is selected as the site for a facility; and


   (b)   a facility has been constructed at the site.


34B  National Repository Capital Contribution Fee


(1)   An entity wishing to use the facility, other than the following entities:


   (a)   the Commonwealth;


   (b)   the relevant State or Territory; 


   (c)   an authority of the Commonwealth or the relevant State or Territory;


must pay such fee (the Capital Contribution Fee) as is prescribed by the regulations as a capital contribution towards the cost of the facility before being eligible to have radioactive waste accepted by the facility for storage, management or any other purpose.


The background to this amendment is that, when the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 was first introduced, I had some concerns that there were a number of jurisdictions that we thought were pretty much getting a free hit. High on my list of those getting a free hit was South Australia. Despite the assurances of my colleague from the Greens, who says that we basically always said it should go to Muckaty, it is quite the contrary. After millions of dollars of investment, Australia decided that the very best place for it to go was, in fact, in section 52 of the Officer Basin in South Australia. There was a huge amount of investment from everybody and, fundamentally, an agreement—a difficult agreement but an agreement across every state and territory that there would be a national task to find the best place, and the best place, as I said, was in South Australia.


We all know the history. The previous Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, in a rush of political blood to his head during an election, decided: 'No. After all that work, it's not going to the best place in Australia. It's not coming to South Australia.' The Commonwealth, unsurprisingly, was caught pretty left-footed, as was everybody else. This process started with the Labor government, then the process went across to the conservative government and now it is back with the Labor government. It has gone on for a very long time. The fundamental point about why we are here today is the failure of Mike Rann to accept an absolute ironclad agreement with everybody. Every state and territory signed up to the fact that we would invest millions of dollars ensuring that it went to the best place. Scientists decided where the best place was for a whole range of reasons—transportation, the level of amenities and all those sorts of things—and, very sadly, that is why we are here today.


I put the original amendment forward to say: 'Since this has been foisted on us and since nobody else seems to want to have it, the only jurisdictions that can keep the materials here are the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth. Every other jurisdiction will have to sort themselves out, because we're not going to cop it.' We have always copped it as a territory, and that is because we are not a state. We are dictated to about what happens in the Northern Territory. Let's face it: that we are a territory is the only reason it has been able to be put there. So the amendment was put forward to ensure that no other jurisdiction, apart from the Commonwealth, was able to keep their material there.


It has come to my attention over the last little while that there were, in fact, some rumblings about jurisdictions. Even South Australia was saying, 'I know what we'll do: we'll gift it to the Commonwealth and that will get us around Scullion's amendment. We'll gift all our material from the other jurisdictions to the Commonwealth. That gets around the amendment and it is then the Commonwealth's material and they'll be able to store it.' My thinking process was along the lines of this: 'We built something to the amenity of everywhere.' I was pretty cranky at the time. Let's face it, you cannot go to sleep in the Commonwealth; you have to go to sleep in a state or territory. Every state and territory certainly benefits in some way from having a research reactor at Lucas Heights. On that basis, if any other jurisdiction wants to store material there—the Territory has made the contribution, and it certainly was not voluntary—the Commonwealth is paying the money and the other states and territories should do the same. This amendment effectively establishes the capital contribution fund, which is to provide enhanced public services or infrastructure to any state or territory. It is not just to the Territory, because if somebody can eventually capitulate—particularly the current Premier of South Australia, who still stands up today and says, 'Look, I'm terribly sorry; we got it all wrong'—South Australia will be able to have a capital contribution fund that will be paid into. So this is not about Muckaty; this is about a capital contribution fund for whatever state or territory takes this repository. Wherever it is sited, this repository will provide safe and suitable storage for national and possibly, should they pay, state and territory material.


The key feature of this amendment is that the fund will stand in credit of $10 million, and that is prior to the acceptance of any material from any source. So before any material arrives from the Commonwealth, the Territory or anywhere else, $10 million has to be in the fund that is available to a board consisting, pretty much, of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and some people with some expertise in health, particularly in infrastructure. Again, the use of the fund was motivated only since the provision of some $32 million by the Howard government, and it is well on the record that that was levered between David Tollner and me. Basically, at that stage, if you had cancer you knew you had to be on a flight to Adelaide. No matter where you came from—whether you came from Alice, Katherine, Tennant Creek or wherever—you knew you had to be on a flight to Adelaide, because that was simply the closest amenity. That was only a few years ago. So what everyone else in Australia took for granted we just did not have access to in the Northern Territory. We now have an oncology unit in the Northern Territory. In places like Adelaide, because they have had oncology services for so long, they are training people in oncology services and have a large population of people who are ready to staff it. But that is not the case in the Territory, and we need very much to grow our own staff to ensure that we provide the same level of amenity that people take for granted in every other part of Australia.


It all comes down to some sort of justice for Territorians. We are still having this foisted on us, and that certainly cost the previous coalition government some $32 million. That will never be enough because it is never going to compensate us for how we feel as Territorians, and I acknowledge that. This amendment deals with closing the equity gap, if you like, to ensure that Territorians actually get the same level of oncology services enjoyed by others.


Just before I sit down—and I understand there are some agreements to ensure that we do not keep this debate going—let me say to Senator Ludlam that I not only have visited ANSTO but have spoken to ANSTO staff extensively, and I have never heard them say that it is not a case of just not wanting to put the dump near white people. Now, mate, I am a mate of yours, and you can check the Hansard, but that is what you have said. All I am saying is that I have been here for a fair while longer through this particular debate, and I have never had that put to me. I am just putting it on the record for you that I have never had that put to me, and I have extensively questioned it, both personally in the pub and across the committee bench. I just thought I would put that on the record.


This is a very important amendment, particularly to Territorians, so that we can try to close the gap between access to health services. I commend the amendment to the house.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:26):  I will briefly respond to some of Senator Scullion's comments and also indicate that the Greens will not be supporting this amendment. That is somewhat moot, of course, because this bill will get up with us or without us, but I do not think it is appropriate for us to sit on the same side of the chamber as Senator Scullion on this particular amendment. As much as you might say that it is wonderful that you have managed to score 10 million bucks from the Commonwealth government in order for the Territory to cop it, I want to back up a bit to your earlier remarks about South Australia, because they go precisely to the point that I was making just before you rose, which was that that study started on the assumption that the waste will be going to a remote bit of country somewhere. Which bit of faraway country from the cities is best for it? They looked at geology, geophysics, earthquakes, rainfall, groundwater, access to transport corridors and so on, starting on the premise that, sooner or later, it would go to some remote piece of land, and that is precisely what I am trying to avoid with the amendment that the Senate just negatived. I am very happy to put it back up again if you are going to have second thoughts, although I am not sure I can do that. It started on the assumption that it is going to a remote bit of land. It started on the terra nullius premise, and guess what? When you got there the Cooper Pedy Kungas were there, saying, 'No, you don't.' They were not asked, but a bunch of scientists were asked: if we are going to put this stuff in a remote shed, where should the remote shed be? It was started on a premise that pre-empted the outcome of an honest inquiry, which is what we are putting up. When you got there, it was not empty land; the Kungas were there, and they said, 'No thanks; we're not having it.' They put up a very, very strong campaign, which is effectively the template for what the Muckaty are up to now, calling in people from around the country, and indeed around the world, to say: 'If this stuff is safe in Sydney, perhaps it should stay in Sydney; if it is not safe in Sydney, why the hell are you bringing it to our block?' Where is the case for this stuff to go remote?


With great respect, Senator Scullion—and you were involved in that process back then—I was on the other side of the debate supporting the Kungas from a long way away in Western Australia. This is not a NIMBY approach. From a Western Australian perspective maybe they should have just copped it. But of course not; they are out there; it was their flock. They were not consulted and neither were the Muckaty mob.


In terms of the substance of this amendment, the Chief Minister branded the $10 million rent money for the dump as offensive. He said it was a bone being thrown at us to try to get us to roll over.




Senator Scullion:
  Let's see him knock it back.




Senator LUDLAM:
  He is not going to have the choice. The minister was saying before about how cooperative this is all going to be once the bill passes—that we will cooperatively engage with Territory police and emergency services so that they can cooperatively deal with a disaster, if there is one, after we have pushed the laws aside regulating transport of this material. It is all going to get nice and cooperative after we have passed this law. If they have no choice in taking the $10 million fund, I am sure they will put it to good use. The Territory is not rolling in cash; I hope they do put it to good use. But it absolutely is offensive. I think that is an entirely appropriate word for the idea that for 10 million bucks you are somehow over the line. Senator Scullion, join us on this side of the chamber when we vote against this bill. It should not be going into your electorate. It should not be going up to the Muckaty block, and that is what this bill sets in train. I have put as clearly as I possibly can that the Greens will not be supporting this amendment when it is put.

37A Obligation to minimise production of waste


      Despite any other law, any agreement between the Commonwealth and another party or parties involving the production of radioactive waste must be made subject to the condition that each contracting party must take appropriate steps to ensure that the generation of radioactive waste is kept to the minimum practicable.


This is an amendment that I am sure will get late support from both the government and the opposition, so I do not intend to call a division. What it does is provide an obligation to minimise production of waste, and who could possibly disagree with that? I am sure if you are proposing to vote against this amendment you will stand up and pat me on the head and say that I am well intentioned, or that this is a great idea but you will be voting against it. 


We are proposing to minimise the production of this material in the first place which, I hazard to guess, is probably the only area of agreement between every party in here in this entire debate, because it is such an intractable headache for people and has been for so many years. One thing we should all be able to agree on is to minimise the generation of it in the first place. It does not absolve us of responsibility to look after what we already have, but let us move away from the misleading concept of disposal towards a sense of stewardship and harm minimisation. Of course, the first thing you would do if that were your interest would be to minimise the production of this stuff in the first place. I strongly commend this amendment to the Senate.

But I think I made my point simply in looking at the case of radioisotopes. In my closing remarks I will read some statements from medical professionals who have demanded that the government and coalition stop using medical isotopes as a fig leaf of justification for producing this waste in the first place. We do not need it. It is not really good enough for the minister to stand up and say, 'The Canadians are up to something and we will give it some thought.' Recognising that you are here in a representational capacity and you are not expected to be an instant expert in everything, I would have thought the advisers could provide you with something a little more substantial than you will wait and see what the Canadians get up to.

This is the final amendment to put some teeth into the bill that I propose, so that some judicial review is applicable—namely, that the minister should have some criteria by which to be judged on whether or not he did what the bill said he should do.


At the moment, the bill essentially says if he were to throw a dart at a board in the privacy of his office and decide that that was where the dump was going, that would not be a reviewable decision even if he published a photograph of the dartboard.

(1)   Clause 4, page 3 (line 1), after “1998”, insert “that is of domestic origin”.


(2)   Clause 4, page 3 (line 2), at the end of the definition of controlled material, add “For this purpose, controlled material is of domestic origin if it has been used in Australia, generated by activities in Australia, or sent to Australia under contractual arrangements relating to the conditioning or reprocessing of ANSTO spent nuclear fuel (within the meaning of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987).


This amendment is the only piece of good news that I can announce to the chamber this afternoon. The government has apparently agreed with the substance if not the detailed wording of my arguments in the debate before last on importation of international radioactive waste. I am glad Senator Scullion is still here, and I am hoping we can get consensus so this one will not need to go to a vote. Despite some of the more remarkable commentary from some of the more unhinged members in the other place—if that term could be considered parliamentary—proposing that we import radioactive waste from overseas as a commercial proposition, I am glad to have the understanding that the government has agreed with the sentiments that I raised: that we should formally preclude this from occurring, that it should not simply exist in regulation and that it should be in Australian legislation as it is in the instance of building nuclear power plants, recognising that there is a small fringe of people in this parliament who think that that would also be a good idea. We have come back with wording, which I understand the government will be supporting, to more accurately define what we mean by international waste.


For example, if there are fears that we are seeking to legally preclude the return of Australian obligated reprocessing waste from France and the UK, that is not the intention. I think it is still an open question as to whether that material should return and when, but we are not seeking to legally ban it. We are seeking to legally ban a Pangea-style international commercial radioactive waste dump. I have fairly close experience with such a proposition, because that lunatic idea was actually landed upon Western Australians in 1999. I would be very pleased to have the support of the chamber in formally precluding such a proposition.

Earlier in the debate Senator Ludlam moved a similar motion about which the government had concerns about the technical effects but, because I know his views are genuinely held and we thought there was a meeting of minds, we have been able to accept the reworked amendment from Senator Ludlam. It has been the position of successive Australian governments that Australia will not accept other countries' radioactive waste. As a fellow Western Australian, I lived through the same experience Senator Ludlam did, with a proposal that I think Western Australians generally regarded as pretty offensive.


The Greens amendments effectively restricts access to the national radioactive waste management facility of waste that originates from use of radioactive materials and nuclear activities in Australia. In particular, it permits waste arising from overseas reprocessing of Australian research reactor fuel to be accepted at the facility. It complements controls under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and the prohibition already in the bill on acceptance of high-level waste, preventing the facility from accepting used power reactor fuel. As I said, this has been a policy of successive Australian governments. It is one that this government is committed to, and we are very happy to have that reflected in the bill and the act. That will ensure that the parliament would have to debate this issue before there were any change in policy in that regard. I think it strengthens the bill, so the government will support the amendment.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (13:40):  Senator Ludlam, you are probably one of the few people around who would be aware of my original 10 amendments to this bill, one of which was pretty much identical to your amendment today. As I said the other day, I did not lose the fight, but I was compelled by the argument that this could be protected under the Customs Act. I agreed to that, but you know the way these sorts of things go.


One of the issues that we deal with in this place, Senator Ludlam, is providing comfort to those who might be concerned about something. Even if we have one particular piece of legislation that says quite specifically that you cannot import something under the Customs Act because it is existing legislation, people will feel happier if we have a particular piece of legislation that actually says, above and beyond whatever particular act that we have quite reasonably used to prevent any import, that we specifically proscribe something that gets rid of that particular fear.


That was one of the 10 points that served as the amendments to the original bill. So I commend you very highly on convincing the government in a way I was not able to convince my government, I have to admit. I think this is certainly something that those people who argue that there is still some possibility of somebody else's international waste coming into Australia can now put to bed. We will be supporting the amendments.

Given that the Prime Minister has now on two occasions made it very clear that she does not consider Minister Smith fit to serve as the foreign minister and that it is now very clear that he is not up to it as Minister for Defence, why is a man who is not in the Prime Minister's view adequate to be foreign minister good enough to be the defence minister?

After 38 years as a soldier and as a commander, I'd learned to read people, quickly and accurately. Reflecting on Smith's visit, the abiding impression I was left with was that he merely tolerated people like me and the troops I commanded.


In light of Major-General Cantwell's damning appraisal of the minister's performance, is it not time that the Prime Minister appointed someone who is capable of respecting and supporting our uniformed personnel?

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:02):  I have great pleasure in rejecting the assertions made in Senator Johnston's question. It is just an attempt to slur up a very hardworking, dedicated and competent minister.


Minister Smith did an excellent job serving the government as foreign affairs minister. He was well regarded throughout the international community as being highly competent, and since taking on the defence job he has again proved to be a diligent and hardworking minister. So the government and the Prime Minister have complete confidence in Minister Smith in his role as Minister for Defence. I work very closely with him, being a fellow Western Australian minister, and I understand how dedicated he is to the job at hand and to the very complex issues confronting Australia, and particularly to the real challenge that supporting our troops in Afghanistan provides.


We all understand the terrible circumstances in Afghanistan. We accept that we are making progress but we know also that our troops are under constant threat and that we have had some very sad losses of personnel and some terrible injuries incurred by others in recent years. Minister Smith is absolutely focused on the task of the coalition effort in Afghanistan. He is very much focused on ensuring protection for our troops and on making sure they have the support they need to do their vital work.


I think that Mr Smith is doing an excellent job as defence minister. He has the support of the Prime Minister and the government—very strong support. I think that the attempt to slur the minister up, as was undertaken in Senator Johnston's question, does him no credit and does not advance the interests of political debate in Australia, nor the interest of the defence forces.

It is absolutely wrong. Minister Smith has great belief in our troops. He provides enormous support and commitment to those troops and he has always respected the role that they play. As I said, I have discussed with Minister Smith on many occasions issues relating to defence and deployment of our troops and I know for a fact that he feels very deeply when we have had the loss of a soldier serving in Afghanistan or when we have had serious injuries to our serving personnel. I know he feels that very deeply and feels the responsibilities very deeply. So I absolutely reject the accusations made.


Minister Smith is very committed to supporting our troops, very respectful of the role they play and is doing everything he can to advance their and Australia's national interests.

Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  What the Australian community wants is a defence minister who stands up for the right thing, who not only respects and supports our troops but ensures that a young woman who has been subject of a terrible assault has her rights protected. He stood up very strongly for those rights. I think he did it as a lawyer, as a father and as a minister, and I am very proud of the stand he took. It reflected his very firm views and his strong response to what he thought was an error of judgment. He stands by that judgement he took. He stands by those views. He has my full support in making them. If you talk to any parent of ADF serving personnel, they strongly support the stance he took, too, because they want a minister who stands up for the rights of their children while they are serving in the ADF.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Johnston today relating to the Minister for Defence (Mr Smith).


I want to make the point that there is only one portfolio in government where those representing the Commonwealth within that portfolio actually commit their own personal safety, and sometimes their lives—that is, the Defence portfolio. The parliament, its members and senators adhere universally to one tenet—that is, each one of us, or so I thought, supports the troops. Many of us go further and admire our men and women in uniform and we enjoyed their company.


It is distressing for me to read major General Cantwell's op-ed piece in the Sydney Morning Herald last Saturday. I find his account of Minister Smith's attitude when touring the battlefields of Afghanistan most unacceptable. I contrast that with his description of Senator Faulkner:


First, Faulkner was genuinely concerned about the soldiers he met in Afghanistan. He spoke sincerely to them of his gratitude for the sacrifices they were making. 


He went on to say:


Second, he took the deaths of Australian soldiers very personally. When I briefed him on the circumstances of the deaths of two of our soldiers, killed by a roadside bomb, he was visibly pained …


Major General Cantwell went on to describe the attitude of a minister who was a successful Minister for Defence, albeit a Labor minister, Senator Faulkner. I commend him for the words Major General Cantwell delivered in the public domain. In stark contrast he said of Minister Smith:


I provided a frank assessment of the quality of Afghanistan security forces we were training. Throughout, Smith sat immobile, taking no notes, making no comment. At the conclusion of this briefing, to which the then chief of the Defence Force Angus Houston added his insights, I asked if he had any questions. There were none. It must have been a cracking brief.


He goes on to say that later in the tour, in front of 20 or 30 Australian and American officers, having received a briefing of the daily battles, the ordeals, the fights, the brawls being conducted in life-and-death combat with the Taliban, the Australian and American officers looked to Minister Smith for:


… comments, questions, words of encouragement. His response? ''No, thank you'', followed by a glance at me with the question, ''What's next?''


He goes on to say:


… I escorted Smith to one of our forward patrol bases, which were established when we expanded our operations into an area previously covered by Dutch and French troops, who had recently departed. The CO of the mentoring taskforce had sensibly rebalanced his force to cover the new territory. But the Australian and Afghan troops there had been in constant and occasionally heavy contact with the enemy. They were under the pump.


We gathered the dirty, tired Diggers together at the end of Smith's tour. Media crews travelling with the minister turned on their cameras and he made a lacklustre speech clearly pitched at the audience back home. He talked ''at'' the soldiers, not to them. He then turned to walk back to the helicopter pad. ''Minister,'' I said, ''perhaps you might take a couple of questions from the soldiers before you go?'' The look I got in response was poisonous. ''Well, are there any questions?'' he asked the soldiers.


''Yes, sir,'' one said. ''We got moved out here earlier than we were supposed to and we're spread a bit thin on the ground. Can we get some additional troops sent out from Australia?'' It was a reasonable question, at least from the perspective of a soldier fighting in a scrubby valley in Afghanistan. Smith launched into a long spiel about supporting the coalition and fighting terrorism and building capacity in the Afghan security forces and making a contribution and all the phrases that work well in Canberra. It didn't work so well when delivered to blokes who would soon start another patrol along paths hiding improvised bombs designed to kill them. There were no other questions.


Walking towards the helicopter for the ride back to Tarin Kowt, Smith said to me, ''Don't set me up with unscheduled questions like that again''. He was not happy.


After 38 years as a soldier and as a commander, I'd learned to read people, quickly and accurately. Reflecting on Smith's visit, the abiding impression I was left with was that he merely tolerated people like me and the troops I commanded. I cast around in my mind for the element that seemed to be missing in his dealings with the men and women of the ADF who I led. Then I had it: respect. Smith had no respect for those who chose to serve in uniform for their country. It was an uncomfortable insight.


This is one of the saddest, most unacceptable articles I have read in my 10 years in the Senate. It is disgraceful and the minister should be moved. (Time expired)

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-03-13,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (15:06):  I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Chris Evans regarding Minister Stephen Smith. Firstly, there is at least one point that we agree on, and that is that this is indeed a sad and unfortunate set of circumstances. I have had the privilege in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary for Defence to work with Major General Cantwell and meet with him on a number of occasions, and I would only ever say, publicly and privately, that he is a distinguished former officer of the ADF, that he has given exemplary service to his country and that he is a person of outstanding record. That is the basis upon which I think all of us should reflect upon him.


Major General Cantwell has obviously written a long piece that has appeared in the newspapers, and I am sure all of us have read it. For those us who have not read it, the shadow minister for defence just managed to spend 2½ of his three minutes rereading it to us. That offers us no insights above and beyond the fact that Major General Cantwell wrote an article which is deeply regrettable and, I guess, offers a set of reflections on the Minister for Defence which I say are unfortunate and regrettable. Let us be clear here about the context.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator FEENEY:
  I will take that interjection, Mr Deputy President. The interjection is: why are they regrettable? They are regrettable because they make reflections upon the Minister for Defence which are unfair, untrue and indefensible.


We are obviously at a point where there is a great public controversy around the circumstances of the Kirkham report and events at ADFA. Those events and those circumstances are well known to all of us. The Minister for Defence at the time of the so-called ADFA Skype scandal made clear his view that it was an error of judgment, inappropriate and unhelpful for a young woman, who was then the subject of certain allegations and certain concerns around the Skype incident which were being publicly ventilated, to concurrently be subjected to various disciplinary hearings. The minister put that on the record then and he has made it plain since that he does not resile from that opinion.


I think it is fair to say that the Kirkham report had some areas in it which made clear the fact that that was a controversial element of what transpired at ADFA.




Senator Humphries:
  That wasn't what Kirkham said.




Senator FEENEY:
  Again, I will take that interjection, Mr Deputy President. I think that if you look at what Kirkham said you will see very clearly that that was an area of concern and Kirkham made it clear that there were several ways that matter could have been handled.




Senator Humphries:
  He also made clear that Kafer did nothing wrong.




Senator FEENEY:
  Again, I will take that interjection, Mr Deputy President: he also made it clear that Kafer had done nothing wrong. Again, in my capacity I have had the opportunity to meet with Commodore Kafer on several occasions. He is a fine and distinguished officer who has indeed been reinstated to his position.


Is it helpful or appropriate to have the partisan opposition—particularly in the defence space, where they struggle to ever say anything of interest or concern—climb into these issues of great sensitivity? Of course it is not, but it is going to happen. That is politics; that is the politics of no, as personified by the opposition. But let us be clear: Stephen Smith, in the conduct of his duties, deserves nothing but our highest acclaim and praise. He has done a fine and outstanding job not only in defending the interests of Defence when that is required but also in making sure that the public of this country have absolute confidence in the ADF and the institutions that sustain the ADF. We on this side are very proud and pleased that not only have we supported our Defence and ADF men and women in their work and in the dangerous things they do on our behalf but we also believe that the values they espouse must be supported and consistently backed. That is what the Minister for Defence has done here.


The Minister for Defence is not going to be railroaded into any kind of apology or any kind of backdown on the back of all of you on the other side suggesting that he owes this country an apology because he has defended the rights of a victim. These matters are complex. We on this side are not interested in finding any senior officer or any other person as a scapegoat. We on this side are not interested in bringing the world of partisan politics into defence. That is a matter for you. But what we on this side are clear about is that we are not going to attack any of the senior officers who have entered this debate. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2012-03-13,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:11):  Senator Feeney is right to suggest that these are quite exceptional circumstances, but they are circumstances that are entirely appropriately raised by the opposition in the Senate today, because we face a most extraordinary situation. It is a situation where a very senior member, recently retired, of the Australian Defence Force, General John Cantwell, has criticised very directly the Minister for Defence for not just his competency but also the lack of respect that he has engendered from members of the Australian Defence Force. He is joined in that criticism by a host of other senior figures within the defence space, particularly General Peter Leahy, former Chief of the Army, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday; General Jim Molan, a very highly respected member of the Defence Force who has also made criticisms of the performance of the minister; and, in effect, the present Chief of the Defence Force, General Hurley, who saw fit when the Kirkham report was brought down to immediately reinstate Commodore Kafer to his role of Commandant of ADFA, notwithstanding the fact that the minister said, 'I stand by my criticisms'. In effect, General Hurley indicated his disagreement with the approach the minister was taking.


So we have here several key figures within the Defence Force, or at least recently part of the Defence Force, making criticisms, and the point that the government needs to get—which it obviously has not got to this point—is that General Cantwell, General Leahy, General Molan and, to the extent that I have attributed his remarks in the same direction, General Hurley, speak for the Defence Force. They speak for the members of the Defence Force, the men and women in uniform who do not have confidence in this minister. It is not a pleasant thing to have to say that those people who are in the field, who serve in uniform across this country and beyond its shores, have reached a serious point where they do not have support for or confidence in their minister, but I know from conversations I have had with many members of the Defence Force that that is true. I ask members of the government, if they believe that Mr Smith enjoys the support of members in uniform in this country, to go and talk to some of them and ask them what they think, because I do not think they will have any doubt about the answers they will receive. Earlier today Minister Ludwig lectured us in question time on how we must respect the independent investigation being conducted by Fair Work Australia. Well, we have another independent investigation, the Kirkham report. It was exhaustive and it went on for a long period of time. It sat on the minister's desk for three months, but the minister saw fit not to release that report, leaving the tarnish on Commodore Kafer's reputation while he did so, and eventually released the report when it was obvious he was not going to get shifted out of the portfolio. He could not shovel this responsibility onto somebody else, so he decided that he had to release it himself—a report which extensively exonerates Commodore Kafer in respect of the Skype affair. And where is the apology to Commodore Kafer? It is not forthcoming. It is behaviour like that which makes the minister so on the nose within the Australian Defence Force.


It is not just in this area, however, where he deserves condemnation. He has now been sitting on a decision about replacement with Australia's future submarines for several years. He is like a rabbit caught in the headlights, unable to make this big decision about what we do to replace the Collins class submarines, which are ageing. This minister needs to make that decision, but he seems incapable of doing that. It is for reasons like that that the minister needs to go.


The minister clearly does not want to be in the Defence portfolio. He made that very clear, not just—presumably—to the Prime Minister but to all who would listen before the recent reshuffle. It is equally clear from the field evidence that the Defence Force do not want him to be their minister. The fact that he, in the words of Senator Feeney, 'defended the rights of a victim' is not the point. That is not the issue on which Mr Smith is currently being condemned. It is his failure to acknowledge that in that process he did the wrong thing by Commodore Kafer, who handled himself well, dealt with the issue appropriately within ADFA and got no credit for it from the minister. That kind of behaviour simply cannot be tolerated. That kind of behaviour has brought the minister to this low point, and he ought to read the signs and do something about it.

Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (15:16):  I must say that I was quite intrigued that the shadow minister for defence, Senator Johnston, spent four minutes and 27 seconds of his five minutes reading from a newspaper article. He left himself 33 seconds out of five minutes to think about it, to analyse it, to draw a conclusion and to offer a comment. It was so important to the shadow minister for defence that all he could do was refer to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald and, for four minutes and 27 seconds, read out from it. I have never seen such a poor attack on a minister of the Crown in my entire life.


But, having said that, let us give some consideration to the article referred to by Senator Johnston. I was amazed when I read it over the weekend. Let me say here on the public record that the article and the report were vicious, they were contrived, they were equally vacuous and they had no point. In an attack on a minister of the Crown, making those sorts of remarks, the writer and the newspaper operators knew that no minister of the Crown would descend into the gutter and respond to that sort of commentary coming from a former two-star or three-star general—who, I might posit the proposition, never, ever thought to make a complaint to his line commanders when he was a serving officer and never thought to make a memo up the line to the Chief of Defence Force or the Chief of Army on what he thought he saw in Afghanistan and other places, but now, some two years after the event, is put up to make some sort of set of allegations against a minister of the Crown in a context where the minister cannot defend himself.


Let us now, having dismissed that nonsense article from a former officer in the Defence Force, turn to the incident at ADFA. No other person in this place has more familiarity with the arguments, debates and history of military justice than I. There is no other person. I have been intimately involved in the discussions, debates and reports for 10 years—firstly under Minister Hill for a good five years, and then subsequently under a set of Labor Party ministers. Each of those men put a lot of effort and a lot of heart into reforming what is generally recognised as a then poor culture in Defence which resulted in a large number of public and Senate inquiries into unnecessary deaths and a series of assaults, cases of sexual malfeasance against women and other high-level offences. Those matters were the subject of public inquiry. They have been the subject of public report. They have been the subject of efforts by successive governments, successive capability managers within the Defence Force and successive ministers of defence to remedy them.


Let me tell you something in the context of the ADFA report and the ADFA complaint: in the last four years—since this government came into power, but the trend line started in the last 12 months of the previous government—the incidence of reports of the nature I referred to a minute ago has gone right down. Once upon a time there were dozens and dozens of reports every year to the offices of members of parliament by writing, by email, by texts or by phone conversations. I lost count of the number of parents who came to see me in my office in Perth and here, crying over a range of incidents. It has stopped completely. It stopped completely under previous ministers of defence, starting with Senator Hill and then Mr Fitzgibbon, Senator Faulkner and Mr Smith. All of the issues that were the subject of serious address were reformed. The incident that occurred at ADFA at best can be described as now an aberration, which is a reflection of the good work that is being done.


So is there confidence in Mr Smith as Minister for Defence from this government and the wider defence community? Yes. I have not received one text, one email or one letter complaining about his behaviour from members of the Defence Force. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:21):  The arrogance and disrespect shown to our fighting men and women in uniform, displayed by Mr Smith in his recent activities, was repeated by Senator Bishop in this debate this afternoon. The very personal attack Senator Bishop has just made on a distinguished, courageous and competent former officer, Major General Cantwell, is very typical of how some in the Labor Party view our men and women in uniform. I enter this debate, I shadow Senator Feeney and I am also a Queensland senator. Senators would know that Queensland is a state where there is a large number of serving people. My office is in Townsville, the home of Australia's largest Army base.


The disrespect shown by Minister Smith to the Defence Force, generally, which has been noted increasingly by senior officers, is also being commented upon by the diggers on the ground. As I travel around North Queensland—around Townsville where there are a lot of diggers, around Cairns which is the home of Australia's second largest naval base on the east coast, around Brisbane where there are a great number of soldiers at Enoggera—I hear a general distrust of Minister Smith. My colleagues in Queensland are well in tune with the thoughts, aspirations and feelings of the troops on the ground as well as with the officers. The feeling is coming through that Mr Smith has no respect for people in uniform. The publicised accounts of how Mr Smith showed no respect when he was in Afghanistan is being reflected at all levels.


I know people in the Defence Material area. I dare not mention their names lest they befall the same fate as Major General Cantwell who, because he dares to say what he believes to be the truth, is personally attacked by the likes of Senator Bishop in this chamber where he has parliamentary privilege. Who would dare to criticise anyone in the Labor Party? It is the same in my state of Queensland. With anything that involves the Labor government in Queensland, if you dare raise your head and criticise the clear mismanagement—mismanagement that borders on corruption in Queensland—you get the whole force of the Labor Party turned upon you. I think it is a terrible day for the bipartisan control and support for the Defence Force that you have Senator Bishop going on with that quite disgraceful, personal attack on a distinguished officer and former commander of our armed forces.


My colleagues have mentioned Mr Smith's ill-considered and hasty comments on the ADFA chief, Commodore Kafer. They have said, which I will repeat, what Mr Kirkham QC found:


... in the circumstances it was reasonable for ADFA staff, including Commodore Kafer and the Deputy Commandant, to reach the conclusion that it was appropriate to proceed with and conclude the two disciplinary charges against the female Officer Cadet.


Commodore Kafer was completely exonerated by that independent inquiry, yet Mr Smith cannot see it within his being to apologise for the slur that he cast on the career, future and past, of a distinguished soldier.


Mr Smith clearly did not want this job. He wanted to be foreign minister. Ms Gillard thought he was incapable and incompetent to be foreign minister so she brought in someone from outside. I think Ms Gillard should look a bit more closely—not only is Mr Smith incapable of being foreign minister, he is incapable of being the defence minister. (Time expired)

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (15:39):  I move:


That the Senate—


   (a)   notes:


      (i)   footage of animal cruelty at the Temur Petir and Cakung abattoirs in Jakarta that was aired on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation television program Lateline on 28 February 2012 shows serious and systematic breaches of the Government's new Export Supply Chain Assurance System,


      (ii)   the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals [RSPCA] Chief Scientist has identified 61 observed incidents of non-compliance with the Government's own supply chain assurance elements at the Temur Petir and Cakung abattoirs,


      (iii)   the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) has refused to publicly reveal whether Australian cattle are being exported to the Temur Petir and Cakung abattoirs,


      (iv)   that making this information public would not compromise any departmental investigation, and without it the public can have no confidence that the Government's new system to protect animal welfare is being monitored and enforced,


      (v)   a Perth-based cattle exporter, International Livestock Exports, announced on 29 February that it had suspended shipments to one of the Indonesian abattoirs in question, placing the industry response ahead of the Government's response to the situation, and


      (vi)   that animal rights activists such as Animals Australia and the Indonesian activists who filmed the Jakarta abattoirs are to be congratulated for exposing the continuing cruelty in the live export industry and the failure of Australia's new regulatory regime; and


   (b)   calls on the Government to:


      (i)   confirm whether Australian cattle are being exported to the Temur Petir and Cakung abattoirs,


      (ii)   publicly disclose the names of any companies involved in exporting live cattle to the Temur Petir and Cakung abattoirs in Jakarta,


      (iii)   immediately suspend the export licences of those companies involved in exporting live cattle to the Temur Petir and Cakung abattoirs in Jakarta until an investigation has been conducted,


      (iv)   urgently put more resources into monitoring and enforcement of the supply chain assurance system to ensure that animal welfare is prioritised in the Government's new regulatory regime, and


      (v)   move to introduce a ban on live animal exports.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that Senator Rhiannon's motion be agreed to.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT
 (15:46):  I inform the Senate that at 8.30 am today Senators Fifield and Siewert each submitted a letter in accordance with standing order 75 proposing a matter of public importance. The question of which proposal would be submitted to the Senate was determined by lot. As a result, I inform the Senate that the following letter has been received from Senator Fifield:


Pursuant to standing order 75, I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion:


The Gillard Government's waste, mismanagement and profligacy which is undermining hope, reward and opportunity for Australians.


Is the proposal supported?




More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places—

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-03-13,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:47):  I remember hearing the Prime Minister say this:


We are the people who share and stick together.


You would have to have been living under a rock in the last month to have seen that, because at the moment they might be the people who share and hit people with sticks or hit each other in the head with sticks but they hardly stick together. It has been an absolute debacle as we see one attack the other, as we see deliberations, as we see changes—even today, in the next manifestation of it, over there we have the new Senator Bob Carr. The trouble with Senator Bob Carr is that he has taken Mr Stephen Smith's job, but Mr Stephen Smith is a bit unhappy about that. He thought he was lined up to be the Minister for Defence but it did not actually happen. They talk about mateship and having a fair go. We have never, ever seen that. But the most peculiar thing was this statement made by Prime Minister Julia Gillard:


We follow it simply because we are us.


'We are us.' What on earth does that mean? Who else could you be? 'We are somebody else'? 'Somebody else is us'? It is a very strange thing to say. It is a job for Inspector Clouseau. 'We are us.' What could this possibly mean?


I will tell you one thing for sure: we are not them. We are definitely not them. We are not them, because what they are in the ALP both in Queensland and at a federal level is just a complete and utter fiasco. I should start at the first one. In the last four weeks the Labor Party have borrowed—and you can see this on the AOFM, Australian Office of Financial Management, website under Australian government securities outstanding—an extra $10 billion. That is just in the last four weeks. Let us paint a picture of what that is. Ten billion dollars would buy about 20,000 houses in Brisbane or, if you were out in the country, I suppose you would buy close to 35,000 houses. Each house has about two and a bit people in it, so it is equivalent to about a regional town of 70,000 people, just in the last four weeks. This shows what a disaster they are. In the last four weeks it is like they have bought all the houses in Roma, St George, Goondiwindi, Dalby, Kingaroy, Charters Towers and probably a few others thrown in—just in the last four weeks. But no, it is not a problem; everything is under control. Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, is the Treasurer of the millennium. He is a stroke of genius. We are so lucky to be blessed with him, to be endowed with his presence, even though we are currently about $18 billion away from bouncing our cheques and hitting our next limit of a quarter of a trillion dollars.


It does not matter where you go. Wherever the Labor Party go they have this Midas touch backwards. I do not know—what is a Midas touch backwards? Sadim, I suppose—a very peculiar way of sending the show upside down. In Queensland they have lost their credit rating, even though, when you think about it, that is the state that gave us Joh Bjelke-Petersen, whose government built all the highways and built the dams—which the Labor Party complained about. They said the dams were too big; Wivenhoe was too big; it was profligate. It put aside the country for Wolffdene. It built the universities. It got the universities up and running. It got the international airports up and running. It built the motorways, sealed the roads and electrified Central Queensland before they had even finished electrifying the suburban network in Sydney. And the amazing thing about Joh Bjelke-Petersen is that, when he left, the Treasury was absolutely overflowing with money.


The people are the same. They are the same Queenslanders who were there before. The minerals are still there. They did not disappear. In fact, they went into a minerals boom. The Great Barrier Reef is just basically where we left it, still off the coast of North Queensland. The bauxite is still there. The copper is still there. We have developed the cotton areas—there is actually more of that—but we did that with private money. We could not rely on the government; we did that with private money.


So what changed? How could the government go out the back door? How could they find themselves $62.3 billion in debt, heading towards $85.4 billion in gross debt? What is different between then and now?


It is quite simple: it is them; it is the Australian Labor Party; it is the management of the Labor Party. That is what has taken people out the back door. That is the only thing we have to worry about. The Labor Party says, 'We are us,' whatever that means. Our mantra is simple: 'We are not them'. We are definitely not them.


These are the people who also built the Tugun desalination plant. That is incredible; it is like a work of art. It sits down there at Tugun but it does not work. It is a $1 billion piece of modern art on the Gold Coast. Nothing has ever worked—the seals have never worked; they could never get it up and running. But that is the Labor Party; that is the 'We are us' people. But we are not them. We do not send the place broke. We do not build things that just do not work.


Then we had the Mary River dam. It was going to cost about $1.7 billion in construction costs, and then they had to move all the people, and then move the highway, and then move the railway line. The trouble was that the dam was going to be less than five metres deep at its maximum, with a yield of around 150,000 megalitres. The all-up cost was around $4 billion—the most expensive swamp on the planet. Maybe they were creating a Ramsar site. How could it be such a fiasco? It is their mantra—'We are us'. But we, on this side, are not them. The LNP is not them.


Then we had the Tahitian prince. Where would a health department be without a Tahitian prince? Where did the Tahitian prince come from? A man strolls into the health building and says, 'Aloha'—or whatever they say in Tahiti—'here I am, I am a Tahitian prince.' The health department was so fortunate to have a Tahitian prince working for it. Anyway, he managed to walk out the door with the princely sum of $15 million. That is what happens under Labor. What is a department without a little Tahitian prince in it? Of course that is believable, of course Wayne Swan is on top of the books and of course there are no fractious relationships in the Labor Party. It is all so believable. Why is it believable? Because, they say, 'We are us.' They are obviously Tahitian princes.


The thing for people to remember is that we are not them. When they go to this election they will be asking themselves what it is all about. As they walk up the path and into the ballot box, they will be thinking about the Labor Party saying, 'We are us,' and they will be thinking about the Labor Party saying, 'We are broke,' and they will be thinking about the Labor Party saying, 'We believe in Tahitian princes,' and they will be thinking about the Labor Party saying, 'We believe in the Tugun desalination plant'—a new piece of modern art on the Gold Coast. They will be thinking about, 'We believe in the Mary River dam,' and they will be thinking about, 'We believe in tree-clearing guidelines'—the guidelines that took away the property rights of so many Queenslanders—and they will be thinking about, 'We believe in coal seam gas licences,' when the Labor Party ran out of money and so sold the licences for everything they could possibly conjure up out from underneath the rights of so many farmers. The people will be thinking about those things as they walk up the path, and will be saying, 'That's right, they are them—they are a complete and utter disaster.' The Labor Party up there at the moment are trying to dive away from their policies, because now it is not about the Labor Party; it is about keeping Kate and keeping Bill and keeping Pam—about keeping everything, but do not say anything about the Labor Party because if you mention the fact that they are actually in the Australian Labor Party people will not vote for them. People just think they are completely shoddy.


We have to think about a party that has taken a powerhouse state to the point where it has one of the highest unemployment rates—5.7 per cent is the unemployment rate in Queensland today. How do they manage to go broke and put everybody out of a job with all that was left to them at the start? It is simple. Whenever you want to know the answer, you just have to listen to Julia Gillard's speech and hear her say, 'We are us'—whatever that means. It is a fantastic statement. This is going to be an interesting election in a couple of weeks time. The people of Queensland are not fools. They understand that, if they keep Kate, they keep the Labor government. If they keep Kerry Shine, they keep the Labor government. If they keep Mr Fraser—they would almost have to be committed for that—they keep the Labor government. We cannot keep the people who have caused the problems. We have to get rid of those people to get Queensland back on the rails and doing what it did before, which was being the powerhouse of our nation.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-03-13,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (15:57):  I walked late into this matter of public importance debate. I thought I had come in for the wrong debate because I heard very little from Senator Joyce about the subject of the matter of public importance or about issues associated with the federal government or the federal economy. I heard a lot about Queensland but very little about our nation and our government. This matter of public importance really is one of the greatest ironies I have ever witnessed in my very brief time in this very esteemed chamber. If one wants to talk about waste, mismanagement and profligacy undermining hope, reward and opportunity for Australians, one need look no further than those opposite.


One should be suspicious of a motion that includes the word 'profligacy'. One can only imagine where this particular topic we are debating today—supposedly a matter of public importance—would have been dreamed up by those opposite. Perhaps it came from the offices of Senator Brandis. One can only imagine Senator Brandis and his mates—some of his barrister mates or his Senior Counsel or Queen's Counsel mates; whatever they call themselves these days—sitting around in their wigs and gowns, chewing on their cigars and sipping their cognac, trying to work out how they could get the word 'profligacy' into a motion in the Senate. And here is Senator Brandis—great timing. Perhaps he can explain how the word 'profligacy' got into this matter of public importance today. I would suggest that it is designed to bamboozle and to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australia public about the fact that those opposite are not willing to debate issues of policy in this chamber—and for good reason. When we do talk about issues of policy, when we do talk about real matters of public importance, those opposite come up woefully short.


One need only look at the coalition's record on economic management, particularly their attempts at the last election to justify their election costings. When their costings were submitted, they came up $11 billion short—an $11 billion black hole in their election costings. Yet they come in here and criticise this government about its record on economic management.


The MPI seeks to criticise the government for undermining hope and reward. I wonder how the coalition's accountants are feeling and what they are thinking in the wake of their performance in 2010. What sorts of rewards did they get out of teaming up with the Liberal Party and analysing their election costings? What sorts of rewards did the firm of accountants in Perth get for analysing the coalition's election costings? They got a wonderful reward. It came in the form of a $5,000 fine for breaches of professional standards—simply for teaming up with the coalition and providing analysis of their election costings. One cannot blame the firm of accountants; they were being asked to do things that were simply not possible. The money was just not there. That came out in the audit by the professional standards body.


The MPI from those opposite talks about the government's waste and mismanagement and how this is a destroyer of hope and opportunity. There is no greater destroyer of hope and opportunity than the Liberal Party. If you look at the budget cuts they are intending to make when they come to government, you get a pretty good indicator of future destruction of hope and reward by the coalition. They are planning to cut $70 billion from the budget. What will that mean for working Australians and their families? It will mean that important government programs, such as the childcare rebate—support which is critical for helping people with young children to survive, to get by from week to week—are on the chopping block. For senior Australians, there is no greater reward for the efforts they have put in over their working lives than an adequate pension. Yet who opposed the increase in the pension when it was put forward by the Labor Party? Those opposite.


There are Australians who are single parents, there are families who require support and there are Australians who are trying to get back on their feet after facing difficult circumstances. Instead of hope and opportunity, they face, from the coalition, the prospect of $70 billion worth of cuts to the services they rely on every day of the week. Yet the coalition seek to criticise us for destroying hope and opportunity.


This comes from the party who take every opportunity they get to talk down the Australian economy. They claim that there are sovereign debt risks in our economy. They claim that our level of net debt is unsustainable when they know very well that our economy has one of the lowest levels of net debt in the OECD. They ignore facts—such as the fact that Australia has a rolled gold AAA credit rating. For the first time, all three ratings agencies have us as AAA; all three have given us the tick of approval.




Senator Brandis:
  Who do we have to thank for that? Peter Costello!




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  Senator Brandis mentions Peter Costello. The real saviours of the Australian economy were the Keating and Hawke governments. They were the ones who built the bridge upon which—




Senator Brandis:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy President: I am not sure what standing order it is which prohibits senators misleading the chamber, but Senator Thistlethwaite has disregarded the fact that Australia's credit rating was downgraded twice during the Hawke and Keating governments.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, there is no point of order. That is a debating point.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  The strength of the Australian economy at the moment is directly related to the reforms made by the Hawke and Keating governments. They were the ones who built the bridge over which the train driven by Peter Costello travelled. They were the ones who opened up our economy, floated the dollar, reduced tariffs and opened up our banking sector and our bond market to competition. All of these were reforms introduced by the Labor government.


The great irony is the posturing of the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. He claims that he can balance the budget; cut income taxes; reduce the company tax rate; increase pensions; spend more on infrastructure; deliver new social programs, such as an unfair and unfunded parental leave scheme, a national disability insurance scheme and a Medicare dental scheme; and restore the private health insurance rebate for high-income earners whilst at the same time cutting carbon emissions in our economy by five per cent by 2020—without a market based mechanism. He claims that he will scrap the minerals resource rent tax and he claims that he will do this while still providing reductions in the company tax rate. He will not say how he will fund any of these promises. And he will not say that he will support an independent process to cost their budget promises through the Parliamentary Budget Office.


This MPI is another admission from those opposite that they are not interested in debating the issues that really affect Australians—keeping our economy strong and providing adequate services that support working families in this country. We are happy to discuss policy on any occasion in this place. We are happy to discuss hope, reward and opportunity for Australians. We talk about hope, opportunity and reward; we delivered that during the global financial crisis. We protected jobs in our economy. When we talk about opportunity, we need look no further than the government's Building the Education Revolution program. It provided $16 billion worth of investment in better education facilities. I have visited some of those facilities, and the greatest irony of all is the coalition MPs turning up at them and sneaking their heads in the photos being taken when the plaques are unveiled. They were not too shy to come along to the openings of those new facilities. (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2012-03-13,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (16:08):  We now know that after 4½ years of Labor government the principal problem for the Australian Labor Party and our country is not that the government breaks its promises but that it tries to keep them. The genesis of Labor's failure is not only the make-up of its policies but that Labor has been totally ineffective in implementing them. You see, what always happens in the Labor Party is that some prepubescent adviser in the Prime Minister's office gets an idea, a brain-snap. Their main consideration is never good public policy, such as: will the idea work; is it in the national interest? No, it is all about: will this be a good six-second grab on Channel 9 or Channel 7, or will it make a good headline? That is what they are about. There is no cost-benefit analysis. There never is. There is no budgeting. And there is never a workable timetable. That has been the story of the Labor Party for 4½ years. Ideas are pushed off to departments and never seen again. Implementation is a shambles. And then the government is onto the next good thing. That has been its story for 4½ years.


Of course, just like prepubescent children, the government does not know and, indeed, does not care where the money comes from. Daddy will pay. In this case the 'daddy' is the taxpayer. Senator Thistlethwaite mentioned something very interesting before. He used the phrase 'the great daddy of them all'. The greatest shambles this government has been responsible for thus far—I think there are more coming—is the Building the Education Revolution program, the school halls debacle. It is one of the greatest public policy failures in Australian federal history. It is certainly one of the most expensive failures. I well remember the Labor Party handing over the task of analysing the success of the program to poor old Mr Brad Orgill. When he finally reported back he found that government schools, state schools, cost nearly twice as much per square metre as independent and Catholic schools did. That is a disgrace. It meant that kids attending state schools received half as much as kids attending non-government schools. I was once one of those kids and I would not have been terribly impressed. Why? Because the state schools missed out.


The government's greatest failure did not receive a lot of publicity, and it is this: the Auditor-General's office said that the Commonwealth department of education was culpable for this failure because it did not have in place the oversight mechanisms to determine whether in fact state governments were securing value for money for state government school halls. That is the greatest failure of this government thus far. Can you imagine spending $14 billion—$14 thousand million—and not having a Commonwealth department sufficiently up to speed, with sufficient oversight mechanisms, so that it could be sure that state governments were getting value for money? That is the greatest failure of this government's 4½ year tenure. It got the Public Service to do something it did not even know how to do. How much money was it? It was $14 thousand million. That is what the Auditor-General's office found. The government has spent all that money—$14 billion.


You might think with the government spending $14 billion on this program that somehow our school children would be getting better test results. You would think that, after the government has spent $14 billion on this program, comparative school testing across the world would show Australian schoolchildren going forward. What in fact have the international test results showed? They have shown Australia going backwards not only relatively but absolutely in this area. That is an absolute indictment. We are moving backwards absolutely and relatively against all our major competitors. You spend $14 billion and what is the outcome? Kids do less well in international comparative examinations. It is nearly unbelievable but that is a fact. This government can spend $14 billion and our schoolkids are actually worse off. It is nearly unbelievable but that is the outcome of its policies. And it does not stop there.


It is nearly a debacle a day with this lot. There is the great new carbon tax, the centrepiece of their economic reform. I read today that Australia faces a $30 billion hit to growth by 2018. Why? Because the price of carbon is too high? We learnt that today. And this lot is the only political party—sorry, not the only political party, there is that lot too: the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party are the only political parties on earth that believe that in an energy-rich, trade-exposed nation it is a good idea to act unilaterally; that irrespective of whether any other nation does anything, they believe that we should have a carbon tax.


Let me say that again, slowly, because it is nearly unbelievable. They believe—the government of this country believe—that even if no other nation on earth has a carbon tax we should have one. It is nearly unbelievable. We are in an energy-rich, trade-exposed nation. Do you think that comparable countries will do anything like that? Do you think that the Canadians are about to do that? Or the Brazilians? Or the Russians? No. This lot believe that. When you compare us with similar nations—not countries like Luxembourg that do not export energy but energy-rich, trade-exposed nations like Australia—we are the only one. And, even worse, they believe we should do it even if no nation on earth does it as well. It is nearly unbelievable!


But what do we know now about the Australian Labor Party? We know this: every time the Labor Party are forced from office they always leave Australia further in debt. I have mentioned this many times before in this place: every time since 1901 when the Labor Party are forced from office the nation is further in debt. It has been so since 1901. The Labor Party always talk about social justice—they always do. Is it socially equitable to leave a nation further in debt on every occasion since 1901 that they have lost office? Is it socially just to make intergenerational debt—to lump our kids and our grandkids with debt? Because that is what they have done whenever in government since 1901.


The heads always go down now, and do you know why? Because it is true. Every time they leave office Australia is further in debt. It has been so since 1901—through wars, through peace, through good times and bad times—always further in debt every time the Labor Party lose office. Every single time! There has never, ever been, I might add, an exception. Most Australians believe they want to build wealth for their kids and leave a bequest, don't they? They want to build up property and leave a bequest to their children. What does Labor leave Australia's children? Debt. They leave our children debt. That is Labor's family values.


They talk about working families. What does Labor leave working families? Debt. It always has been and it always will be. The Labor Party will never change their spots and they never have since 1901. The one thing that runs through Labor DNA is that four-letter word: debt. Always has been, always will be.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2012-03-13,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:18):  Mr Deputy President, I can tell you where I think the profligacy in this chamber is coming from: it is coming from the coalition and from wordy and meaningless motions like this—motions that offer no substantive policy critique whatsoever but, rather, just throw words around. We also see it in question time here in this chamber day after day.



Senator Boyce interjecting—




Senator PRATT:
  There is nothing substantive in your arguments whatsoever. You want to talk about waste, mismanagement and profligacy? You need look no further than the coalition's policies, or their lack of policies and the lack of fiscal discipline. We know, for example, that Mr Tony Abbott has confirmed that the opposition will keep secret their planned $70 billion in cuts to services. They will keep their cuts secret until after the next election. In his 30-minute speech to the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Abbott—




Senator Brandis:
  He never said that. That's not the truth, that's a lie!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Brandis, you will have to withdraw that remark.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I heard Senator Pratt say that Mr Abbott had said that the coalition's economic plan would be kept secret until after the election. I called it a lie; I withdraw that. But it is not the truth.




Senator PRATT:
  Mr Abbott, in his speech to the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, offered no policies, no costings to fund his pledges and gave no explanation of how he would manage our nation's economy. All he offered Australians were an audit, more slogans and the same old negativity.


On the one hand, shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey promised us two days ago that the opposition's $70 billion worth of cuts would be made public before the next election, whereas Mr Abbott told the Australian people just a few days ago that they will have to elect him into office first. Clearly, the coalition is in disarray on this question.


We know that shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey has recently said that the opposition has in fact finalised its policies and costings, including its $70 billion planned cut in services, but refuses to tell Australians what and where they are. A journalist asked Mr Hockey: 'As recently as last Tuesday Tony Abbott said Australia needs an election and that he called on Julia Gillard to have one as soon as possible. Does that mean that your policies that you would take to this election that could be held in 33 days are done, costed and ready to roll out?' Mr Hockey said:


Based on what we know now we are doing all the costings. All our policies are costed …


The journalist asked, 'So you have found those savings you are looking for?' and Mr Hockey said:


Yes, we have found the savings we were looking for.


I say to you that if the opposition have truly finalised its costings then they need to come clean with the Australian people. They cannot just think they will coast into government on slogans and negativity: they need to come clean now. They need to reveal what they want to cut and how; how much their policies cost; and where they plan to get the money to fund their undeliverable promises.


Mr Hockey has in fact contradicted his own shadow finance spokesperson, Andrew Robb, who said less than 10 days ago that the opposition had not finalised any of their major policies. So, if the opposition cannot even agree between their Treasury and finance spokespersons which of their policies are ready to go, how is it that they will be able to come clean with the Australian people? Tell me how it is that they will have a plan for our future. Does Mr Abbott truly think he can slide into government without telling people how he will manage our budget, where $70 billion will come from? From health? From education? From skills? Perhaps from the national disability support scheme? Where are his policies?


Let's talk about hope, opportunity and reward, shall we? It is what the coalition has sought to put forward today. I can tell you there is a great deal of hope, opportunity and reward in the more than 700,000 jobs that Labor have created since we were first elected, in the fact that we have bulletproofed our Australian economy and kept it out of recession in the worst economic downturn in three-quarters of a century. Our economy's fundamentals have remained strong—




Senator Brandis:
  What is the unemployment rate today, Louise?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Ignore the interjection.




Senator PRATT:
  I do not have to take your interjection. Our economy's fundamentals have remained strong, with outstanding employment growth, a record investment pipeline and a budget position the envy of our peers.


Where is the hope and reward for Australian families? It is right here in Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme, with 18 weeks pay at the minimum wage. More than 130,000 working parents have already benefited, and I think that is fantastic.


What I also think is fantastic—and there is a great deal of hope, reward and opportunity in this one—are the increased payments of up to $4,200 a year from 1 January this year to help with the costs of raising teenage children. I know, like everyone in this chamber would know, that raising teenagers costs a lot of money. Indeed, for too long we have punished families at the tail end of those child-rearing years just as children get more expensive. So there is a great deal of hope, opportunity and reward in that.


And what about the future opportunity that will come with our National Broadband Network? It is affordable high-speed broadband to all Australians and Australian businesses no matter where they live. It will mean better education, better health care and better access for Australian businesses to the biggest marketplace in Australian human history. That is the kind of infrastructure opportunity and reward that our nation should be aspiring to.


And what about hope? What about the hope that comes with getting the health care that you need? A healthcare agreement between the states and the Commonwealth delivers more doctors, more nurses and more beds with less waste and waiting time.


What about the importance of the agreement on carbon price when it comes to hope for the future? There is a plan to cut pollution, cut taxes, increase the pension and create clean energy jobs. Most importantly from a hope point of view, I think, is hope that we can move from being part of the problem in climate change to being part of the solution. That is my great hope.


What about the minerals resource rent tax? What about the hope and opportunity that comes from giving Australians a fair share of the mining boom, a boost to retirement savings, tax breaks for small business and a company tax cut? There is a great deal of reward, opportunity and hope in that. It frees up money to invest in states like WA so that we can keep our economy moving and invest in the generation of future wealth for our nation.


What about the hope and opportunity that comes with doubled investment in school education, upgraded facilities at every school and the provision of more information to parents than ever before? I think that is fantastic. We have also created 130,000 new training places. What do we speak to when we speak of hope, opportunity and reward for Australians? It gives them the opportunity to make the most of the opportunities that are in our growing economy today in states like Western Australia that have a huge demand for skilled people. We must invest in these skilled training places to make the most of the opportunities that are before us as a nation. That is why we created these 130,000 new training places. It was exactly so we could deliver hope, opportunity and reward to Australians.


What about hope, opportunity and reward for seniors? What about the historic increase to the Australian pension? What about the fact that we are now looking at improving aged care to give older people more choice and more control? What about the record investment of more than $36 billion in projects around the country? What about the flood levy—the fact that we needed to deliver tough savings to provide the $5.8 billion to flood affected regions in Queensland, Victoria and my home state of Western Australia? What about the hope that comes for those families that are really looking forward to Australia's first national disability insurance scheme?

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (16:28):  I hate to disappoint Senator Pratt, but I would like to point out that, in fact, our policies and costings are not going to be released so that they can be a template for this government to try to worm its way out of the image it has as being wasteful, mismanaging and profligate. I am afraid there is no opportunity for you to fix your terrible mismanagement reputation on the back of our policies. It was late last year when the current Prime Minister caused a great deal of derision amongst the Australian public by her wonderful line to the Labor Party conference saying, 'We are us.' The general reaction I have had is that she actually meant to say, 'We are useless.' That would have been quite true. They are useless, they are wasteful, they mismanage, they are profligate.


If you look at Labor's record to date—and I would like to thank Senator Mason and others for the information he has given us—not only have they never, ever left a surplus in the bank when they have been thrown out of office but also they have not handed down a surplus since they won office in 2007. They have accumulated $167 billion of budget deficits in less than five years. It will take the coalition government, when we are re-elected, up to a decade once again to pay off their debt. 


Let us look, though, at what this wasteful and mismanaging profligate government actually means for people in the streets. When it undertook the review of the Fair Work Act, it forgot to include productivity in the terms of reference. It is no wonder it forgot. Every retail outlet and manufacturer in Australia could tell the government that productivity was the way forward. It was interesting that Senator Pratt used a number of social welfare policies as examples of what the government has done. Yes, social welfare policies are necessary and good, but hope, reward and opportunity do not come out of government handouts; they come out of government policies that give people in manufacturing, industry and small business the chance to develop their own businesses. That is where you get genuine hope, reward and opportunity—from the innovation, the entrepreneurialism of Australians—and not from government handouts.


Of course, the troglodytes on the other side did not include productivity in their terms of reference for the Fair Work review. We discovered one of the reasons in an academic survey that has recently been released that shows that the success rate for employees undertaking unfair dismissal claims against Labor's Fair Work Act is running at 51 per cent. More than half of the unfair dismissal cases succeed. That is more than 17,000 a year. The troglodytes on the other side of the house would perhaps like to suggest that this means that small business have been lousy employers.




Senator Ludwig:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order in that Senator Boyce did reflect upon members in the other chamber quite adversely. I am not going to use the phrase that she did, but I ask you to look at the word and ask for it to be withdrawn.




Senator Brandis:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: with respect, you should rule against that point of order for this reason: it appears to be an attempt to invoke standing order 193. Subrule (3) says: 


A senator shall not use offensive words against either House of Parliament—


the senator was not using offensive words against the House of Representatives—


or of a House of a state or territory parliament—


which obviously is inapplicable here—


or any member of such House …


Then it goes on to refer to other things as well. That standing order, as I am sure the Clerk will advise you, has always been understood to prohibit reflections on individual named or identifiable members of the House of Representatives or of other parliaments. If, for example, I were to say the Australian Labor Party is full of scoundrels that would not be unparliamentary, but if I were to say a particular Labor member of the House of Representatives was a scoundrel that would be. Senator Boyce was referring in general categories to members of the House of Representatives in aggregate, not identifiable members of the House of Representatives. Therefore, the standing order does not apply to her.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fisher
):  Thank you, Senator Brandis. I am advised by the Clerk that the standing order is not as clear as Senator Brandis would have it be. That said, it is able to be interpreted as explained by Senator Brandis. Senator Boyce, perhaps you would care to reflect on your language and continue.




Senator BOYCE:
  I will not use that particular term again, although it does not change my view that members on the other side in both houses of the parliament do not have a clear view of how to build a proper and productive economy. I will continue to suggest that they certainly are not living in the real world or in the real commercial world, that they are behind the times in understanding what drivers are needed to make the Australian economy strong and to make Australian businesses, services and industry strong. They just do not get it.


I was talking about the lack of concern by this government to productivity and the massive increase in the number of successful unfair dismissal claims by employees since this government put its Fair Work Act through. As I said, some of the less sophisticated people on the other side of the House might want to suggest that this is simply because small business unfairly dismisses staff at a great rate of knots. I am sorry, but Senator Pratt cannot have it both ways. She cannot have a wonderful employment rate and suggest that people are being unfairly dismissed all the time by their employers. What is happening is that a minority of employees are finding a little treasure trove that takes us back to the sorts of institutionalised misbehaviours that went on before the Howard-Costello government came to office, when employers often paid do-not-come-back money to employees simply to save themselves the cost and the time involved in going to court. There is an example in today's Financial Review of a Wagga Wagga businessman, Martyn Tapfield, who has had two cases taken out by employees against him—both of which he has won. But he points out that, with the time and the stress involved, if it happens again he is likely to close his business. How productive is that for Australia! How much would anyone on the other side of the house know or care about that sort of waste, mismanagement and profligacy?


I would like to turn to one of the most unproductive aspects of this government's behaviour over the last 4½ years—in tandem with that of the Bligh Labor government in Queensland, which has managed to end up with a downgrade on its credit rating despite record earnings from royalties from the mining industry. In terms of waste, mismanagement and profligacy the two of them deserve to be in the same bucket. Let us look at the Bruce Highway, which is the main highway running through Queensland—the main source of productive distribution of products within Queensland—and what has happened to it as a result of the many floods and cyclones we have had recently. If it were a one-in-100-year flood or cyclone, fine; you would expect problems with the highway. But that is not how it is in Queensland with the Bruce Highway. Earlier this month, the Bruce Highway was cut in three places south of Gympie. For those who do not understand Queensland geography, this is close to the major heartland of distribution throughout Queensland. From south-east Queensland to Townsville and through Gympie is one of the major traffic areas in Queensland for distributing items of transport.


I was driving from Cairns to Innisfail earlier this year. It had not rained. In fact, people were pleased that it had not rained and that a cyclone was not on the cards. But there were the flashing signs on the Bruce Highway telling you where the closures were going to be—where the road, the national highway between Brisbane and Cairns, was going to be down to a single lane. If you travelled it three or four months after the cyclones—




Senator Faulkner:
  They should have been on the Hume Highway last night, like I was. At Marulan there was an 18-kilometre traffic jam.




Senator BOYCE:
  I will take that interjection. An 18-kilometre traffic jam might be preferable to 20 or 30 road closures with the highway being reduced to a single lane, which increased the time for a truck to travel from Brisbane to Cairns by more than 30 per cent. This is not just a one-off problem; this is an ongoing problem. Once again, this government just does not get what it is that will create hope, reward and opportunity.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (16:41):  Today the business of the Senate—in fact, an hour of the Senate's very valuable time—is being used to promote the Liberal Party of Australia's new advertising catchcry and slogan about hope, reward and opportunity. I do predict that this debate will receive precisely no publicity. It will not be reported in tomorrow's newspapers, because, frankly, this is such an amateurish exercise from the opposition. It is just so banal. Just think: some spivvy advertising spin merchant from the Liberal Party of Australia has thumbed their way through Roget's Thesaurus and pulled out three words, I assume at random, and attached them to the Liberal Party to give it this new whiz-bang advertising catchcry: hope, reward and opportunity. How cliched can you get! It is so unimaginative—even for the Liberal Party. Just as easily, the same Liberal spin merchant could probably have taken some time off from trying to sell the Sydney Harbour Bridge to some poor, unsuspecting tourist and might have come up with three better words to encapsulate the contemporary Liberal Party and its approach to politics. We have not had that effort put in by anyone from the Liberal Party, so of course I am here to help.


The antonyms for 'hope', 'reward' and 'opportunity' seem to fit the bill. I think I can sum it up quite easily for the Liberal Party. This is what I think that they stand for: not hope, but hopeless. The dictionary definition is along these lines: providing no hope; desperate; not able to learn or act or perform as desired. That sounds like the Liberal Party to me. Not reward, but punishment; severe handling or treatment; or subject to pain, loss and confinement; and so forth. Again, it sounds like the Liberals to me. Not opportunity, but misfortune. Think about misfortune—adverse fortune, mischance or mishap—does that not also ring true of the opposition? 


I think it is worthwhile looking at this new advertising slogan from the Liberals. I do not think there is any doubt that they are hopeless. There was the $70 billion black hole, cooked up by the three stooges of Liberal Party economic policy. Remember all those leaked internal minutes from the shadow ministry that revealed how the opposition planned to make up $70 billion in cuts to vital services over four years to pay for this growing list of promises. That is hopeless. Mr Abbott himself pointed out how abysmal the opposition is at handling the field of foreign affairs, commending Mr Josh Frydenberg of all people as the only Liberal MP who understood foreign policy. That is hopeless. The opposition opposed measures that protected Australia from the worst effects of the global financial crisis and kept over 200,000 Australians in work. They opposed it. That was hopeless on their part. Mr Abbott, of course, is really committed to three-word slogans. We know that he believes a three-word slogan is an effective substitute for policy: 'stop the boats' is yet another example. He thinks that is an effective policy for dealing with the issue of asylum seekers. That is hopeless, too.


You really get to grips with the Liberal Party when you look at punishment, not reward. Punishment, they love it. They love being punishers; they love beating up on people, particularly the defenceless. What would the Liberals do if elected? They would bring back Work Choices; they would strip away basic workplace protections again; cut penalty rates, overtime, holiday, shift allowances and meal breaks. That is not reward; it is punishment. What about the automotive industry? The Liberals would slash vital support there as well, costing 46,000 jobs. That is not reward; it is the sort of punishment that the Liberals like. The Liberals would rip up the National Broadband Network, punishing Australians again with a substandard and costly internet service.


What else would the Liberals do? They would punish struggling borrowers by saying 'no' to the banning of exit fees on home mortgages by banks. The Liberals are determined to punish Australians by saying 'no' to Medicare, 'no' to national health reform, 'no' to public hospital funding. The opposition would also want to punish students, not reward them, by scrapping the Computers for Schools program and trade training centres. They would really enjoy doing that. That is not reward; it is punishment.


Then there is misfortune: the adverse fortune and missed opportunities Australians would face if we ever experienced an Abbott government. It would be 'no' to pricing carbon and missing the opportunity to finally taking action on climate change. In fact, Mr Abbott, as we know, thinks that climate change is 'absolute crap'. He is missing the opportunities of the mining boom by not giving Australians a fair share of our country's mineral wealth. He is missing the opportunity to increase contributions to individual superannuation funds and cutting the company tax rate. And so it goes on. 


How trite to use the valuable time of the Senate as a sounding board for the latest Liberal Party slogan. How disrespectful of the Senate that is and how contemptuous of the proper role of the Australian parliament. You can see it now: some snake-oil salesman from the Liberal Party shovelled away in some advertising agency—some slick, trendoid, pinstripe suited, bow-tied individual—coming up with these three words to try to switch the political play from negative, which of course characterises Mr Abbott and the opposition, to a couple of positive words. They were rifling through the dictionary, rifling through the thesaurus, to see what they could come up with. My suggestion to this person is: try to do a bit better than that. It is abysmal.

The Department of Human Services (DHS) currently describes its risk based audit methodology in its annual publication of the Health and Aged Care Compliance Program (the Compliance Program). The Compliance Program provides information on DHS' compliance approach including:


Risk identification and assessment methods;


Education and support;


Audit and investigation activities;


Stakeholder engagement; and


Key areas of focus and priorities for compliance activities.


DHS will ensure that any changes or improvements to its audit methodology will be published in the annual Compliance Program and relevant stakeholders across the wider medical community will be informed through stakeholder engagement activities.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that agencies involved in health policy and regulation review their online information policies and procedures to ensure that changes in important information, regulations and policies affecting stakeholders are regularly updated on agency web pages.




Response





Accepted



Relevant Government agencies will review the information on their web pages and update accordingly.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that there be a simplification of the ways in which official lists of professions, specialties and sub-specialties are constructed. It recommends that, at a minimum, all bodies that use lists with a statutory basis be required to publish only the current version of such a list.




Response





Accepted



Relevant Government agencies will work together to explore ways of reducing the complexity of the lists of professional specialties and sub-specialties.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that the March 2011 changes be reviewed one year after their


implementation and this should be carried out in consultation with all relevant medical professional bodies, and other key stakeholders such as the MDOs and consumer representative organisations. The findings of the review should be publicly available.




Response





Accepted



The Professional Services Review Advisory Committee (PSRAC) will review the March 2011 Guidelines after one year of their implementation.


The Committee recommends that the government liaise further with stakeholders to ascertain the desirability for a legally qualified person to be involved in the PSR process.

Government Response to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration 





Annual reports (No. I of 2008)





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the government implement the committee's updated 2005 recommendations regarding the publication of an annual report on government advertising expenditure.


Responses to updated recommendations 10 to 12 of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee, Government Advertising and Accountability Report, December 2005




Updated Recommendation 10



The Committee recommends that the Department of Finance and Deregulation publish an annual report on government advertising, commencing in 2007-08. The annual report should be modelled on the Annual Report on the Government of Canada's Advertising Activities 2003-04. It should include:


a total figure for government expenditure on advertising activities;


total figures by agency for expenditure on advertising activities;


figures for expenditure on media placement by type and media placement by month; and


detailed information about major campaigns, including a statement of the objectives of the campaign, the target audience, a detailed breakdown of media placement, evaluation of the campaign including information about the methodology used and the measurable results, and a breakdown of the costs into 'production', 'media placement' and 'evaluation research'.




Response



Agreed in principle. Following the introduction of new advertising guidelines in July 2008, and updated guidelines in March 2010, Finance has published five reports related to campaign advertising expenditure.


Three of these reports were Half Year Reports on Campaign Advertising by Australian Government Departments and Agencies, covering media expenditure costs for campaigns that ran during the first six months of a financial year (from 1 July to 31 December). The first report was tabled in March 2009.


The remaining two reports were Full Year Reports on Campaign Advertising by Australian Government Departments and Agencies, covering both direct campaign advertising expenditure and associated indirect expenditure such as campaign research, consultancy services and other costs. The Full Year reports provide a summary of individual campaigns in terms of target audiences and campaign objectives. Full Year Reports cover the period 1 July to 30 June in each financial year and the most recent was tabled in October 2010.




Updated Recommendation 11 



The Committee recommends that from 2007-08, the annual reports of each government agency must include:


a total figure for the agency's advertising expenditure; and


a consolidated figure for the cost for each campaign managed by that agency.




Response



Agreed in principle, but at a whole of government level. This recommendation will be delivered as Finance publishes whole of government biannual reports on Campaign Advertising by Australian Government Departments and Agencies.




Updated Recommendation 12



The Committee recommends that from 2007-08 the annual reports of each government agency must include:


a total figure for departmental expenditure on public opinion research;


a breakdown of the type of research, including the expenditure on research for advertising as a percentage of total research costs;


highlights of key research projects; and


a listing of research firms used by business volume.




Response



Agreed in part. The full year report on campaign advertising includes information on the campaign research costs, the research firms involved as well as other campaign related costs.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that the government comply with the Senate Order relating to agency advertising and public information projects of 29 October 2003.




Response



See response to Recommendation 1, in particular, the response to updated Recommendation 10 of the Committee's 2005 Report.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that Centrelink review its current outcome and output structure with a view to their modification to better reflect the comprehensive nature of Centrelink's operations and functions.




Response



The recommendation is superseded by the review of financial structures in the lead up to integration of the Department of Human Services.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that the Australian River Company Limited provide the committee (on a confidential basis if necessary) with a written explanation as to;


what issues have prevented the completion of the deliberations;


when the Australian River Company expects the deliberations to sell the company will be finalised; and


why it has not been possible to wind up the company on a commercially supportable basis since May 2002.




Response



The Australian River Co. Limited (ARCo) was created to hold the residual assets and liabilities of the Australian National Line group (ANL), formerly the Australian Shipping Commission, which were not able to be included in the Government's sale in 1998-99 of most of the ANL operations.


Since May 2002 ARCo has operated under a 'charter' from the Government (represented by the Minister responsible for the 'Finance' portfolio) to manage the remaining operations of the company with a view to winding it down at the earliest opportunity on a commercially supportable basis, including the pursuit of any sale opportunities.


In 2004-05 the then Board was able to complete the sale to Patrick Shipping Pty Ltd of two 'roll on / roll off' vessels operating across the Bass Strait. The net profit on the sale of approximately $2.3m was paid to the Commonwealth as a dividend. SeaRoad Holdings Pty Ltd continues to operate these vessels between Melbourne and Devonport.


A wind down of ARCo's remaining operations must deal with two separate and largely unrelated aspects of the residual assets and liabilities. In both cases characteristics which would have influenced the original exclusion from a commercial sale remain relevant.


The first aspect is the appropriate future management of insurance settlements for ARCo's ongoing legal liability to former employees of ANL for the period 1946 to 1997. The ARCo annual report for the year to 30 November 2010 shows a gross provision for these claims of $18.9m based on an annually updated actuarial review of the company's claims exposure going forward. When ARCo's insurance arrangements are taken into account, the net provision reported in November 2010 is an estimated $3.6m. The actuarial review notes that some claims may take up to 40 years to settle. The potential for asbestos related disease is a factor in this analysis.


This insurance liability for former employees is largely covered by long standing insurance agreements which could not be expected to be replaced on favourable terms. Continuation of this insurance policy cover is dependent on the workers' compensation liability remaining with ARCo. This effectively precludes alternative arrangements involving a liquidation of the company, such as a transfer of the liability to the Commonwealth insurer Comcare, from being commercially supportable at this time. The uncertainty and sensitivity surrounding the liability, with its exposure to asbestos disease, means that a disposal of ARCo shares by the Commonwealth that includes the necessary safeguards for former ANL employees would necessarily be on terms unattractive to the Commonwealth.


The second aspect is the future of the two remaining vessels owned by ARCo and operated between Weipa and Gladstone by Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) on a yearly renewable charter basis. These bulk ore carriers, the River Boyne and the River Embley, were specifically designed for this task, including a shallow draught for operation within the Great Barrier Reef, and the use of coal fired turbine propulsion, now virtually unique in commercial maritime operations. Two similar ships, which together with the ARCo owned ships were dedicated to the Weipa I Gladstone operation, were recently retired and sold for scrap.


The ARCo Board was restructured in 2007, with two of the three positions being filled with senior executives of the Department of Finance and Deregulation, The Board continued to explore the divestment option for both the company's legal liabilities and the two remaining ships. As a result of this process, the Board has concluded that the retention of the net insurance liabilities within the legal entity of ARCo, and the retention and continued operation of the ships until the end of their economic lives with QAL (expected to be in 2012-13), is the appropriate commercial course for the company. The Board considers this optimises the Commonwealth's financial position and other risks in relation to its ARCo shareholding.


The Government has agreed to an ARCo wind down strategy that involves the sale of the two ore carriers in 2012-13, with the expectation that this will reflect scrap value. This has been the long-standing basis for valuation of the vessels, reflecting the realities of the ships' role and configuration. The administration of the workers' compensation liability will continue for the foreseeable future under the existing insurance arrangements and through the entity of ARCo under Commonwealth ownership.


Following the sale of the ships and the crystallisation of ARCo's financial position, the Government will determine in consultation with the Board, the dividends payable to the Commonwealth and the financial and governance arrangements appropriate for the administration of the insurance settlements process going forward. It is expected that the long standing practice of contracting this role to the private sector under broad ARCo Board supervision will continue. It is also anticipated that the use of the ARCo entity under Commonwealth ownership to manage the insurance settlements would be subject to periodic review having regard to changes in the claims portfolio, the insurance arrangements or the regulatory framework.




Recommendation 5



The committee recommends that the Australian River Company Limited provide a comprehensive description of its principal activities in all future annual reports.




Response



ARCo has taken the committee's recommendations into consideration in preparing its subsequent annual reports, including reporting on the progress made regarding divestment of assets and future management of residual liabilities. The 2010-11 report will include the strategy referred to in the response to Recommendation 4.




Recommendation 6



The committee recommends that the Australian River Company Limited provide the committee with an explanation as to:


what measures were taken to ensure that there was no real or perceived conflict of interest in the appointment of the Secretary; and on the basis upon which the Australian River Company Limited made the decision to pay for the services of a company in which an Australian River Company Limited Director is a shareholder and director.




Response



The ARCo Company Secretary was an employee of ANL Container Lines Pty Ltd (ANLCL). ANLCL was contracted by ARCo to provide management, secretariat and financial reporting services, including administration of the insurance settlements process. At the time the contract was signed, ARCo analysed the different industry sectors in which the two companies operated (bulk carrier transport for ARCo and container transport for ANLCL) and formed the view that the interests of ANLCL and ARCo were not in conflict. As a result, ARCo does not consider that there is any actual or perceived conflict of interest in this arrangement. If such a conflict had emerged the arrangement would have been reviewed.


For commercial reasons only, there has been a change in the contract allocation, with ASP Ship Management Pty Ltd currently providing these services. ARCo is satisfied there is no actual or perceived conflict of interest in this arrangement.


In relation to services purchased by ARCo from a company in which an ARCo Director is a shareholder and director, at the time the decision was made to purchase these services, they were expected to be minor in extent and cost and uncertain in relation to scope and nature. In these circumstances ARCo considered that the interests of the company would best be served by purchasing the services as and when required directly from Acton Corporate Partners Limited (Acton Partners). ARCo considered that this would most likely deliver best value for money for the company. The ARCo director that had an ownership interest in Acton Partners was excluded from all deliberations relating to the engagement.




Recommendation 7



The committee recommends that:


all agencies review the level of detail provided in their annual reports in order to fully comply with the reporting requirements under section 516A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.


agencies, where appropriate, adopt the practice of reporting on environmental impacts and mitigation measures as outlined in the 2006-07 annual reports of the Department of Parliamentary Services and the Department of Health and Ageing.




Response



Departmental annual reports must be prepared in accordance with guidelines approved on behalf of the Parliament by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA).


The 2009 Report of the Independent Review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the Review) recommended that the requirements for section 516A reporting be amended to provide more detail to government agencies regarding the type of information that should be reported and to give the reporting requirements greater force. The government response to the Review agrees to amend the Act to allow the minister to specify the requirements for this reporting in regulations under the amended Act. This will provide further guidance in order to improve the quality of reporting and the community's understanding of Commonwealth actions to contribute to improved sustainability. Consistent with its election commitment, the government will introduce amendments to the Parliament in 2012.


 




Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network





Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network





First Report





Australian Government Response to the Committee's First Report of 31 August 2011





February 2012



INTRODUCTION


In March 2011 the Parliament established the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network (the Committee) to enable the ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of all aspects relating to the rollout of the NBN. The Committee is required to report to the Parliament on the rollout of the NBN on a six monthly basis until the completion of the project.


The Committee has been asked to provide progress reports on:


the rollout of the NBN;


the achievement of take-up targets as set out in NBN Co Limited's (NBN Co) Corporate Plan;


network rollout performance including service levels and faults;


the effectiveness of NBN Co in meeting its obligations as set out in its Stakeholder Charter;


NBN Co's strategy for engaging with consumers and handling complaints;


NBN Co's risk management processes, and


any other matter pertaining to the NBN rollout that the Committee considers relevant.


The Committee's first report was informed by four public hearings held in a number of locations throughout Australia, and public consultation which attracted twenty one submissions and eleven exhibits. As part of the review the Committee also conducted two infrastructure inspections in Broken Hill and Melbourne on 27 and 28 July 2011. On


31 August 2011, the Committee tabled its first report, entitled Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network The report made five recommendations ranging across: future reporting arrangements; government readiness to take advantage of the NBN; the impact of the Definitive Agreement process on timing of the rollout; the expected productivity, jobs and competitive benefits of the NBN; and timeframes for regional and remote rollout and satellite service levels. The Committee has since released its second report on the rollout of the NBN to the Parliament on 24 November 2011, to which the government will provide a separate response.


BACKGROUND


The Australian Government believes that access to affordable, high-speed broadband is increasingly essential to the way Australians communicate and do business. It will help drive productivity, improve education and health service delivery and connect our cities and regional centres.


The Australian Government has established NBN Co to design, build and operate a new high-speed NBN. The NBN will be the single largest infrastructure investment made by an


Australian Government and will be accompanied by historic reforms to the telecommunications sector. The NBN is about more than having a faster internet connection. The productivity gains associated with this investment will mean that the full benefits will continue to flow for decades beyond the completion of the project.


NBN Co's central objectives, as set out by the government are to:


deliver significant improvements in broadband service quality to all Australians


address the lack of high-speed broadband in Australia, particularly outside metropolitan areas, and


reshape the telecommunications sector.


In implementing the government's policy initiative, NBN Co's specific objectives include:


providing access to broadband to 100 per cent of Australian addressable premises


connecting 93 per cent of homes, schools and businesses with a high-speed fibre network capable of providing NBN Co's retail service provider customers with download speeds of up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps)* at the wholesale level. As outlined in the Statement of Expectations, the government expects NBN Co to upgrade the NBN. NBN Co expects future services over the upgraded fibre network to enable wholesale download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) within the fibre footprint


serving all remaining premises by a combination of leading edge fixed-wireless and satellite technologies capable of providing NBN Co's retail service provider customers with peak download speeds of up to 12 Mbps at the wholesale level*


establishing a wholesale-only, open-access network, subject to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) scrutiny, to support the government's objective of structural market reform


offering open and equivalent access to wholesale services via Layer 2 bitstream services, which in time will help enable multi-operator delivery of data, voice and video services


charging retail service provider customers uniform national wholesale pricing within technologies and uniform national entry level pricing across technologies consistent with the government objective of providing uniform national wholesale prices. Where new technologies become available, NBN Co will seek to maintain this principle.


The NBN will be Australia's first national, wholesale-only, open access broadband network offering equivalent terms and conditions to all access seekers. This means NBN Co will roll out the network and sell wholesale services to retail service providers, who will then provide services to end users. This represents a significant structural change in the


telecommunications industry and will support vibrant retail competition. The NBN will be built and operated on a commercial basis, at arm's-length from government, by NBN Co.


AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE


The Australian government has considered the Committee's first report and provides the following response to the recommendations.




Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the NBN Co together with the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, commencing for the first quarter 2011-2012, provide a six-monthly report on the progress of the rollout of the National Broadband Network, using established Key Performance Indicators and performance measures, no later than three months before the committee is due to report to the Parliament.


The government supports this recommendation and submitted its first report to the Committee on 23 September 2011.


The government will submit six-monthly reports to the Committee and adopt this reporting pattern on an ongoing basis. The reports will provide quantitative and qualitative advice outlining NBN Co's key performance information across the following areas:


progress on the rollout


deployment and installation


take up rates


key financial information: profit and loss statement; balance sheet; cash flow statement; and cash flow reconciliation


quality of service including service levels and faults


industry and consumer consultation including complaint handling


issues associated with health, safety and environment.


The information provided to the Committee will become more meaningful as the rollout progresses and more premises are connected and as NBN Co's operating and business systems come online during 2012.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that Government agencies take measures to ensure they are ready for the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN), prior to receiving and working with the NBN for service delivery.


The government supports this recommendation.


The government outlined its vision for the NBN-enabled digital economy in its release of the National Digital Economy Strategy, including the goal that by 2020, four out of five Australians will choose to engage with the government through the internet or other type of online service.


Significant progress is already being made in Australia to expand delivery of government services and programs online. Recently, the government released a draft Strategic Vision for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) that outlines a long term plan for the government's use of ICT to support increased public sector productivity.


The Strategic Vision for ICT and its implementation will include measures to ensure that government agencies are ready for the rollout of the NBN.


In addition to this the government has announced several new initiatives to advance the digital economy goals outlined in the National Digital Economy Strategy. A number of these initiatives relate to government services delivery including:


Whole of Government Service Delivery Reform - the government is undertaking investigation and testing of some preliminary developments to improve people's ease of use and access across government services. The government will examine service delivery reforms that will enable individuals to manage their government transactions and personal information via a single on-line account and provide the basis for a range of new services. It is expected that the NBN will allow greater flexibility and long-term adoption of innovative interactive experiences between the public and government that can be linked to Whole of Government Service Delivery Reforms.


Service Delivery Reform - to ensure government service delivery is modern and flexible, the government has committed to Service Delivery Reform initiatives within the Human Services portfolio that will transform the way people receive services and interact with government. Over time, this work may leverage the NBN through the increased use of real-time interactive customer service tools, including, for example, using the voice-over the Internet protocol (VOIP) and high-definition video conferencing to access services in regional and remote areas of Australia.


Digital Local Government program - to assist local governments to deliver innovative online services - in particular to homes and businesses, the Digital Local Government program will provide funding to local governments in communities that first benefit from the NBN. The program encourages the development of online services that are repeatable and scalable, and that other local governments across Australia can adapt for their purposes.


Telehealth Trials - to support Australia's health system to effectively integrate digital technologies and broadband-delivered services to drive efficiency, improve patient outcomes and temper the rate of growth in hospital and other admissions, the government will conduct two Telehealth trials. One trial will occur in Armidale and Kiama and focus on the delivery of high-quality NBN-enabled telehealth services to older Australians living at home with chronic medical conditions, The other trial will be conducted in Townsville and will deliver high-quality monitoring and video-conferencing services to people suffering type 2 diabetes.


NBN Enabled Telehealth Pilots Program —to support the provision of high quality health care services, particularly aged care, cancer care and palliative care services, utilising NBN-enabled telehealth services to the home. By providing better access to health services to homes within NBN early release sites, this $20.6 million program will investigate and demonstrate opportunities for the extension of telehealth services in the future and the business case for doing so.


NBN Regional Legal Assistance program - to demonstrate the ability of NBN-based collaborative activities to strengthen and improve access to legal assistance services for people living in regional Australia and support professional staff delivering these services.


NBN-Enabled Education and Skills Services program - to support the goal of expanded online education, the four year $27.2 million NBN-enabled education and skills services program will support the development and trialling of innovative online and interactive education and skills services that take advantage of the high-speed broadband connections made available through the NBN, This program will contribute to the development of services that connect teachers and learners to increase access to information and enhance collaboration; to address skills shortages, and improve teaching and learning experiences as well as improving professional development, enhancing community links, and facilitating workplace training to improve workplace productivity. This program is complemented by the work undertaken through the Australian Flexible Learning Framework with $1 million provided to support the development of NBN e-learning programs.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that NBN Co Limited publish a detailed account of impacts on timing and cost of the National Broadband Network as a result of the time taken and resources used to complete the Binding Definitive Agreements between NBN Co and Telstra and NBN Co and Optus, and the decision to increase the number of Points of Interconnect from 14 to 121.


The government notes this recommendation.


The Definitive Agreements between NBN Co and Telstra and NBN Co and Optus are currently being scrutinised by the ACCC and are therefore not yet finalised.


At the time that NBN Co's 2011-2013 Corporate Plan was finalised, there were a number of issues which — due to their complexity — had implications that could not fully be anticipated. These issues included the time needed to finalise the Definitive Agreements, the impact of the government's acceptance of the agreement between NBN Co and the ACCC to have 121 points of interconnect and the suspension of the construction tender process.


While the agreement with Telstra was extremely complex and took longer than first anticipated, the government is confident that these agreements will protect the interests of Australian taxpayers and support the NBN rollout by providing access to existing infrastructure, minimising overhead cabling and reducing the overall costs of the NBN. Further, NBN Co will proactively manage the construction timetable over the life of the project to minimise and overcome any delays.


In line with Commonwealth Government Business Enterprise Governance and Oversight Guidelines (October 20111, NBN Co is required to submit a corporate plan to Shareholder Ministers each year. NBN Co is currently developing its second Corporate Plan 2012-15 which will take into account any impact there may be on the timing and cost of the NBN as a result of agreements with Optus and Telstra and other factors.


Following the finalisation of the agreements the government will consider the


recommendation, but notes that any decision to publish details of the impacts would need to be taken following finalisation of the ACCC consideration and take into account the extent to which the legitimate commercial interests of parties, including Telstra and Optus would be compromised by publication.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the


Digital Economy publish a detailed statement outlining the productivity, jobs and competitive benefits of:


the overall rollout of the National Broadband Network for the cost-efficient provision of basic broadband infrastructure for all Australians;


how competitive markets will operate at the wholesale and retail levels, with particular reference to the impact on small, existing internet service providers and other fibre deployment companies; and


the impact on wholesale and retail competition of the increase of the Points of Interconnect from 14 to 121.


The government supports this recommendation in principle and this Statement outlines those productivity, jobs and competitive benefits of the NBN. It also provides comments on how competitive markets will operate at the wholesale and retail levels, and summarises the impact on competition of the increase of Points of Interconnect from 14 to 121.


The NBN will give 100 per cent of Australian addressable premises access to high-speed* broadband and will provide the enabling infrastructure to support Australia becoming one of the world's leading digital economies by 2020. High-speed* broadband will be available to 93 per cent of Australian homes, school and business premises via fibre to the premises technology; the remaining 7 per cent of premises will be connected via a combination of leading edge fixed-wireless and satellite technologies. This represents a significant step change over broadband speeds currently experienced by users of this technology today.


The establishment of NBN Co to build and operate a National Broadband Network followed a decision by government to terminate the NBN Request for Proposals (RFP) process. The government conducted a robust open competitive process in accordance with the requirements of the RFP [and the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines], which included rigorous analysis and evaluation of proposals, with the aim of selecting a preferred proponent to build and operate the NBN. The decision to terminate followed advice from the panel of experts that none of the national proposals submitted offered value for money for the Commonwealth against the criteria set out in the RFP. The government decided that as the private sector was unable to provide an acceptable solution for Australia's broadband needs, the government would establish NBN Co to build and operate the NBN and provide the infrastructure the economy was demanding.


With the release by NBN Co of its first 12-month construction timetable on 18 October 2011 the NBN is rapidly moving to realise tangible benefits for productivity, jobs and competition:


NBN services are currently available in eight communities


NBN construction is underway in 19 communities


The 12-month plan identified 49 locations, 28 of which were new, covering approximately 485,000 premises across all states and territories where construction is expected to commence before September 2012 — with a further 63 500 premises included for where the rollout is already underway.


To remain competitive in our region as the world moves to a 21st century digital economy, Australia needs to maintain the momentum and make this investment.


The most recent OECD statistics (for June 2011) indicate that Australia is ranked 21st out of 34 countries in terms of its number of fixed broadband subscribers per 100 inhabitants.1


Other OECD statistics indicate that Australians pay more for broadband than most other OECD countries. Regarding average subscription prices (as at September 2010), Australia is:


3rd most expensive for low-speed connections (out of 24 countries),2


14th most expensive for high-speed connections (out of 33 countries),3 and


12th most expensive for very high-speed connections (out of 28 countries).4


These OECD statistics are further evidence that Australia cannot afford not to reform industry structure and infrastructure.


The demand for higher bandwidth will continue to grow. Cisco estimates that Australia's internet traffic will grow six-fold by 2015.5 This is a compound annual growth rate of 41 per cent. Cisco says that:


When coupled with the Government's National Digital Economy Strategy, the results reveal that Australia is on the verge of a substantial evolution in how new jobs, businesses and even new public services will be enabled by a broadband-enabled economy' (News Release - Cisco Visual Networking Index Forecast (2010-2015), 9 August 2011).


The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that fixed line networks carried 93 per cent of the data downloaded over the internet in Australia in June 2011 and fixed line downloads grew by 79.7 per cent over the 12 months between June 2010 and June 2011.6 Our telecommunications systems are increasingly relying on fixed networks to do the heavy lifting in a high growth operating environment.


The UN Broadband Commission Report released on 6 June 2011 states:


'Developing isolated projects or piecemeal, duplicated networks is not only inefficient, it delays provision of infrastructure that is becoming as crucial in the modern world as roads or electricity supplies'7


The Chief Executive of Singapore Telecommunications was reported in The Australian (10 June 2011) as supporting the competitive opportunities arising with the NBN:


'If you look at NBN in Australia, that presents an excellent opportunity for a fixed communications network ...with NBN, which will be an open access network, I think you will be able to see the entire fixed telecommunications industry reshaped and I think you'll see more competition and a lot more innovation, and with that, improved productivity for businesses and added convenience for consumers'.8


Productivity benefits


The NBN is a key nation-building project; it will help drive Australia's productivity in business, education, health, and government service delivery; and improve social inclusion through fast and reliable broadband services to our cities, regional centres and rural communities.


The NBN will play a significant role in enabling new ways of doing business, participating in work, gaining an education and access to services across regional Australia and in our economy as a whole.


In a recent paper 'Business Innovation and the Use of Information and Communications Technology', the Australian Bureau of Statistics has analysed the effects of sophisticated information and communications technology use — which is reliant on reliable high-speed broadband — on business growth and productivity. It has concluded:


'Business innovation is regarded as a key determinant of both individual business success and national economic growth. At the micro level, business innovation has the potential to increase consumer demand through improved product or service quality and simultaneously decrease production costs. At the macro level, strong business innovation can increase multifactor productivity, thus lifting international competitiveness, economic growth and real per capita incomes. It is thus of great interest to businesses and policy makers to identify those factors which stimulate innovation and to understand how these factors interact.


We expect that ICT plays an important role as a source of business innovation because it enables closer communication and collaboration between the business and other organisations, allowing businesses to more quickly exploit opportunities for innovation. It also provides a platform from which businesses can build innovations, and provides significant efficiency gains. We find strong evidence that businesses which use ICT more intensely are more likely to innovate and furthermore, develop more types of innovation and also more novel innovations'.9


The NBN will enable households to access a range of online services and participate in a range of activities simultaneously. Evidence shows that households are continuing to increase the amount of data that they consume, with the recent Australian Bureau of Statistics Internet Activity Survey as at 30 June 201110 showing there is strong and growing demand from Australians for broadband services. Evidence for this includes:


Australians are quick to take up technology, with access for household and business internet connections increasing an estimated 80 per cent over 2007 -2010, and use of the Internet by households, business, and government more than doubling over the same period,11


Australians continue to embrace the digital economy with the increasing adoption of social media. During June 2011, approximately 8.6 million Australians accessed social networking and user-generated content sites from home, this compares to under 8 million during June 2010,12


Australia has demonstrated a high level of broadband adoption by businesses compared to the OECD average; with 90 per cent of businesses with 10 or more employees having a broadband connection in 2007 (OECD 20 I0),13


79 per cent of Australian households now have access to the internet at home — with almost all of them — 6.2 million households (73 per cent), representing almost three quarters of all Australian households — having access to broadband at home. This is an increase of over one million households with broadband from the situation in 2008-09,14


the phasing out of dial-up Internet connections, with 95 per cent of internet connections now being broadband,15


Australians continuing to access increasingly fast download speeds, with 87 per cent of access connections advertising download speeds of 1.5 megabits per second or greater,16


the number of internet subscriptions at speeds less than 1.5 Mbps has consistently decreased between September 2006 and June 2011,17 and


increases in the domestic market mirror global trends in international demand growth, Global IP traffic having increased eightfold over the past five years.18


The NBN will also provide opportunities and incentives for businesses to innovate in the way they provide goods and services to consumers, advertise, collaborate with business partners, and interact with customers more broadly.


As noted in the NBN Implementation Study, for Australia's small businesses (SMEs) in particular, 'fibre connectivity is a productivity enabler'.19 On 8 November 2011 NBN Co announced that 'as Australia's two million small businesses look at alternative ways to reach new markets, boost their efficiency, and cut costs ... NBN Co intends to offer telcos and internet service providers new high-speed* wholesale broadband services which telcos and internet service providers can tailor to the specific needs of the Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) and small business market' (News Release — NBN Co to offer new services to ISPs tailored to small business, 8 November 2011).


SMEs will be particular beneficiaries of the NBN as they are currently unable to access the high-speed fibre connections available to large businesses located in Central Business Districts. SMEs will benefit from both themselves being connected to high-speed broadband as well as their Australian customers being connected to high-speed broadband.


A McKinsey Global Institute survey of SMEs in 12 countries20 found that:


SMEs utilising web technologies grew more than twice as fast as those with a minimal presence.


On average the internet enabled a 10 per cent increase in profitability. The impact came half from increased revenues, and half from lower costs of goods sold and lower administrative costs.


The NBN will make it easier for some businesses to compete nationally, particularly in relation to projects that they would not normally compete for because it was previously geographically impractical. Increased competition is likely to deliver lower prices and other benefits to consumers.


High-speed broadband has the potential to remove barriers to online transactions and encourage more businesses and consumers to participate in online retail. A 2010 Access Economics report found that about 23 per cent of dissatisfied, and 18 per cent of dissuaded, online shoppers cite lack of speed as a factor in their dissatisfaction or failure to complete a transaction.21 Online retail can boost efficiencies for businesses and allow consumers to buy quality products at more affordable prices.


The NBN can also provide Australian businesses with opportunities to expand into new export markets. Businesses can set up high quality websites that act as a salesperson accepting orders and enquiries 24/7. Businesses that work with graphics, videos, animation and other digital media, which have large file sizes, can upload and send these products to their clients faster and more reliably, while businesses can also reduce IT costs by utilising emerging cloud computing technologies. These technologies will also encourage greater remote collaboration between businesses. The government has announced the following new initiative to support Australian businesses in maximising the benefits of the NBN:


Digital Enterprise program — to enable more Australian businesses and not-for-profit organisations in communities which will first benefit from the NBN, particularly those located in non-metropolitan areas, to leverage the benefits of broadband-empowered online engagement. This initiative will assist these organisations to achieve cost savings, productivity enhancements and improved marketing through greater online engagement.


The government has also set the digital economy goal that by 2020, Australia will rank in the top five OECD countries in the portion of households that connect to broadband at home. This will deliver positive benefits for Australian families and communities in the form of improved access to business and job opportunities, health, education and government services. To help reach this goal the government has announced the following new initiative:


Digital Hubs program — to help more Australian households get online and to narrow the gap between Australian households and businesses in capital cities and those in regional, rural and remote Australia. Through Digital Hubs being provided in communities which will first benefit from the NBN, local residents will be able to experience the NBN and receive training to develop the digital skills necessary to participate safely and securely and have trust and confidence in the digital economy.


Evidence confirms investment in high-speed broadband delivers productivity gains. For example, The Economic Journal provides an estimate of the effect of broadband infrastructure on economic growth in the panel of OECD countries in 1996-2007, suggesting '...that a 10 percentage point increase in broadband penetration raised annual per capita growth by 0.9-1.5 percentage points'.22


As superfast broadband penetration and use increases, and more innovative online services are developed by government agencies and the private sector, people in regional Australia will have more opportunities to access first class services delivered online to their own homes. In time, regional Australians will be accessing education, health and consumer services and employment opportunities that were previously only available to those in larger centres. The NBN will deliver economic benefits to rural and regional Australia through greater employment opportunities and better access to information and services. A 2010 Allen Consulting report found that on average a 10 per cent increase in internet connectivity increased regional output by 0.53 per cent. This is significantly greater than the 0.38 per cent increase for metropolitan areas. 23


The ubiquity of the NBN will allow addressable household and business premises in regional Australia to have access to high-speed* broadband services provided by retail service providers who can acquire wholesale services from NBN Co at a uniform national wholesale price. NBN Co proposes to deliver speeds on fibre of up to 1000 Mbps*.downstream and 400 Mbps* upstream.24 In a regional sense, NBN Co has brought forward the introduction of wireless and satellite services so that regional and rural Australia can get access to better broadband as soon as possible.


Teleworking


By establishing the NBN the government will transform the way Australians work. The NBN has the potential to widen the pool of skills and talent available to all employees by making teleworking a viable option. Proximity to a physical workplace will be less important. Access Economics has found that if 10 per cent of Australian employees were to telework 50 per cent of the time, the total annual gains from teleworking would be $1.4-$1.9 billion a year.25


Online education and training


The NBN fibre network will change the way our education system accesses information, collaborates and communicates, in addition to improving connections to the household for students to engage with learning institutions. Experts, academics and industry leaders are endorsing the NBN as a driver for improved learning which in turn will result in productivity benefits. For example, the Australian Information and Communications Technology in Education Committee views access to affordable high-speed broadband as essential to realising the transform­ative potential of ICT in education and training and hence to advancing Council of Australian Governments' wider productivity agenda.26


Overseas experience is showing that online education can produce better results than traditional learning. Carnegie Mellon University's Open Learning model, for example, is resulting in as much as a 50 per cent reduction in the time it takes to learn a subject, with course completion rates twice as high.27 Cornell University has established eCornell offering a wide ranging curriculum authored by an Ivy League faculty. This is just the start of an online global tertiary studies market.


A British schools study found students with broadband access in their classroom achieved better results in national tests than those without. Further to this 86 per cent of teachers believed pupils were more motivated and attentive when computers and the internet were used in class.28


This was confirmed anecdotally by Patrick Bakes, Principal of Tasmania's Circular Head Christian School in Sinithton, the first school connected to the NBN. He said, 'We are finding that students are engaged, they can move from one task to another much more quickly, and they can access a range of media when they are researching...' 29


These benefits also apply to work-based training. The greater bandwidth capacity offered by the NBN will allow businesses to up-skill workers through participating in webinars and online forums or by watching online videos or utilising interactive or immersive technologies. Workers can engage in online learning to access specialised courses being run in different locations without the need of the financial and time cost to businesses of travel.


Online training programs can also offer unemployed jobseekers the opportunity to develop the skills and knowledge that will help them get back into the workforce faster.


Health services


The NBN will support health reform and has the potential to raise productivity in the health sector through more timely diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients. Video conferencing technologies will mean that specialist doctors can assess patients in regional and rural locations without the need for time-consuming travel. Remote diagnosis and home-care may also reduce the need for people to travel to hospitals. Higher bandwidth will allow reliable, faster transfer of high definition images and videos, which will enable clinicians to collaborate and consult on diagnosis and care for their patients. Reliable and ubiquitous broadband will also facilitate better access to the personally controlled electronic health record system. eHealth and telehealth, supported by access to fast, reliable broadband, are key enablers of health reform, and essential in addressing the increasing burden of an ageing population and rising levels of chronic disease in the Australian health system.


The NBN rollout has already sparked the development of new applications in the delivery of health services. Trials are underway in a number of areas to first benefit from the NBN and include the monitoring and in-home treatment of various ailments. For example, an Australian-developed health solution that can be delivered over the NBN was showcased at the 29 July 2011 launch of the Kiama first release site. Developed by Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), the application is delivered via broadband to the home and has the potential to help decrease the incidence of injury among the elderly caused by falls. The 1 September 2011 launch of the Townsville first release site also showcased ways that the NBN will provide the connectivity to allow telehealth to become part of the primary healthcare system between a patient at home and their GP in profiling an application to assist people living with diabetes.


Government services


The NBN also offers significant opportunities to increase productivity and reduce costs for the delivery of government services. PricewaterhouseCoopers has found the average cost of an online transaction in the UK was £0.08 (about $A0.12), compared to £10.53 (about $A16) for face-to-face transactions, £3.39 (about $A5.15) for telephone engagement and £12.10 ($A 18.40) for engagement by mail.30


Video conferencing and telepresence can be used in meetings and stakeholder consultation, reducing the need for travel. Shared platforms through cloud computing could enhance the quality, timeliness and variety of government services available, as well as reducing the time and cost of government agencies developing their own platforms. Faster, more reliable broadband will also help speed up the resolution of government enquiries and transactions.


Jobs benefits


The NBN is the national infrastructure project that will form the basis of Australia's prosperity in the information economy. The government established NBN Co Limited to design, build and operate the nation's new high-speed* National Broadband Network, a process that will create jobs in upstream industries as new applications are developed to utilise the network, as well as create new jobs in related sectors supplying to NBN Co and its subcontractors in the construction, manufacturing, 1T and telecommunications industries.


NBN Co projects that between 16 000 and 18 000 construction jobs alone will be created at the peak of the rollout. At 30 September 2011, NBN Co employed 1170 people. This number is likely to grow to 2000 direct employees over the life of the rollout.


On 20 December 2010, the government publicly released its Statement of Expectations to NBN Co. The document highlighted the govern­ment's expectation that NBN Co will actively promote opportunities for small and medium enterprises to participate fully in this project in meaningful and continuing ways. In support of this, NBN Co is working with the Industry Capability Network—a government funded web portal set up to put builders of major projects and buyers of industry goods and services in touch with potential suppliers—to help regional businesses find contracts within the project.


Australian companies have already been contracted to assist with the rollout of the NBN. On 17 January 201 I, NBN Co awarded three equipment contracts worth over $1.6 billion to Australian located companies to supply passive network infrastructure to build the NBN during the next five years. On 15 November 2011, NBN Co announced contracts worth up to $635 million over the next five years to six companies operating in Australia to provide an array of equipment for installation in homes and businesses as part of an NBN connection. Corning Cable Systems, which was awarded an equipment contract with NBN Co, is also expected to add 300 to 400 new staff over the next couple of years as a result of its NBN deal.


NBN Co has also recently entered into a number of significant construction agreements which pave the way for the large scale deployment of NBN optic fibre. For example:


in June 2011 NBN Co entered into a ten-year contract with Ericsson (which already has a large Australian presence) worth up to $1.1 billion to design, build and operate a 4G fixed-wireless network to serve premises outside the fibre footprint in regional and rural Australia


in June 2011, NBN Co signed construction contracts with Silcar to begin rolling out the NBN in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT


in September 201 I, NBN Co announced agreements with Transfield Services for the rollout of the NBN in Victoria, and Syntheo (a Lend Lease/Service Stream joint venture) for work in Western Australia


in November 2011, NBN Co signed construction contracts with Syntheo to begin rolling out the NBN in South Australia and the Northern Territory.


The process adopted by NBN Co to engage multiple contractors and civil works vendors in a project of this scale, 'help[s] create competitive tension between suppliers to drive productivity improvements and bring costs down'.31


The rollout of the NBN will also provide opportunities for upstream industries, for example, the NBN has stimulated job growth in the research and development sector. The Institute for a Broadband Enabled Society, a cross-disciplinary research institute dedicated to products, services, and innovations that maximise the benefit of new broadband technologies to Australian society, was established in 2009 in the wake of the NBN announcement.


This institute grants PhD scholarships and employs researchers such that in 2010-11, 169 Melbourne University researchers and 46 external collaborators contributed to the Institute's research.


The government is also committed to ensuring there is a well trained and accredited workforce for Australia's largest infrastructure project. The Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) is working with the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE) and industry stakeholders including NBN Co to identify the employment opportunities for job seekers associated with the NBN rollout,


DEEWR will support NBN Co to bring together Second Release Site Principal Contrac­tors, State Government and Common­wealth representatives, including Local Employ­ment Coordinators and Regional Education, Skills and Jobs Coordinators, to develop a coordinated state and regional approach to working together. This will ensure that employment and training oppor­tunities created by the NBN rollout are identified and can be maximised for job seekers and existing workers.


In addition, in support of the Definitive Agreements between Telstra and NBN Co, the government has entered into an agreement with Telstra to provide funding of $100 million to assist it in the retraining and redeployment of Telstra staff affected by reforms to the structure of the telecommunications industry, including to enable their transition to employment in deploying and supporting a fibre network.


The funding will ensure that Telstra's workforce, including technicians and engineers, is appropriately skilled. This will contribute to the level of skilled and experienced workers available for the rollout of the NBN.


Under the Retraining Deed, Telstra will give priority to retraining staff who currently work on the copper and hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) networks and staff whose roles are linked to supporting the copper and HFC networks, including the wholesale copper workforce and the direct field support workforce. Telstra will give priority to retraining these employees in NBN related technical, process and system activities.


The rollout of the NBN will also assist in developing new and wider workforce oppor­tunities in regional areas in the sectors of health and education, and with the greater use of new online markets. In the health sector, the growth of the digital economy is providing new opportun­ities to train world class doctors for regional Australia. The University of New England's (UNE) partnership with University of California's Irvine School of Medicine will connect health care professionals in regional areas with world class medical teaching institutions via broadband to share teaching resources and share simulation facilities.32 Fast broadband enables high-speed data exchange, meaning health care students will now have access to resources that would otherwise be impossible to access in regional Australia.33


Competition benefits


One of the government's key policy objectives in establishing the NBN is to address the -structural problems in the Australian telecom­munications industry which have hindered the development of effective competition and better outcomes for consumers.


By establishing the NBN as an open access platform and providing uniform national wholesale pricing the government has enabled the telecommunications sector to provide more competitive and innovative services to Australian consumers. The structural separation of Telstra's copper customer network and its HFC network will be achieved through Telstra's Structural Separation Undertaking and Migration Plan (subject to approval by the ACCC) and the progressive migration of customer services to the NBN. As Graeme Samuel, then ACCC Chairman, confirmed in a speech delivered in April 2011, 'this provides the opportunity to remedy the errors of the past, reshape the industry and ensure that the underlying structural foundations encourage investment and competition as we transition to the NBN'.34


As a result, Australia will have a wholesale-only fibre network that will connect homes and businesses across the country. This network will not be controlled by any retail company. The resulting separation between the network provider and retail providers will mean better and fairer access for service providers, regardless of size, and greater retail competition and better services for consumers and businesses.


To ensure that there is robust retail competition, the NBN is subject to company-specific legislation to ensure it operates now and into the future on an open-access, non-discriminatory and wholesale only basis and that it is subject to close scrutiny by the ACCC. As Graeme Samuel said As we transition to the NBN the framework is now in place to make a major break from the past and remove underlying struct­ural impediments to investment and competition development in the telecommunications industry. The structural separation of Telstra and NBN Co being a wholesale only provider could go a long way towards delivering the more competitive telecommunications sector that was envisaged when the industry was first opened up to competition'.35


The competitive benefits of the NBN are emerging. As Australia's first national, wholesale-only, open access fixed-line network, the NBN will provide a platform for more vigorous competition between retail service providers, leading to better and more choice for consumers and businesses. Australia's prices are currently high by international standards.36 Strong retail competition will put downward pressure on prices.


On 30 November 2011, following extensive consultation with industry, NBN Co released an executable version of its Wholesale Broadband Agreement (WBA). As of December 2011, Aardvark Internet, AARNet, Ace Internet Ser­vices, Adam Internet, Club Telco, Eftel, Engin, EscapeNet, Exetel, iiNet, Internode, Internet Solutions, iPrimus, mVoice, North Queensland Telecom, NuSkope, Optus, Redback Communi­cations, Rivertel, SkyMesh, Telstra and Westnet were listed on NBN Co's website37 as active certified service providers in first release sites and new developments. Many of these certified service providers have signed or are now signing NBN Co's WBA.


Retail service providers have publicised attractive pricing packages for the NBN-based services, including those announced by Exetel, Internode, iiNet, iPrimus and Optus. These prices compare very favourably with prices in the market for similar products particularly noting that NBN-based services do not require payment of additional line rental fees, offer superior performance with the option to upgrade to faster speeds not available over the copper network and that some providers include access to telephony at no extra cost or for a small additional fee that typically includes phone calls.


Such pricing includes, for example:


Exetel, offering a basic 12/1 Mbps* plan with a 20 Gigabit (GB) data limit for $35.00 per month, which includes access to a VoIP telephone service. Exetel's top-of-the-range plan with 100/40 Mbps* speed with a 150 GB limit costs $60.00 per month.38


Australia's second biggest DSL provider39, iiNet, has a range of offers from a basic 12/1 Mbps* plan with a 40 GB (20GB peak + 20GB off-peak) data limit for $49.95 per month up to a high end 100/40 Mbps* plan with 1,000 GB (500GB peak + 500GB off-peak) data limit for $99.95 — all plans can be upgraded to include a VoIP service for an additional $9.95 per month, which includes all local and national calls40; and


Optus is offering a range of packages including a basic 12/1 Mbps* plan with a 40 GB (20GB peak + 20GB off-peak) data limit for $39.99 per month when bundled with a $19 per month mobile phone plan — Optus also offers 12/1 Mbps* plan with a 120 GB (50GB peak + 70GB off-peak)' data limit and home phone, including $30 worth of calls, for $64.94 per month.41


On 18 October 2011, WhistleOut42, a comparison website, released its analysis of NBN-based prices versus ADSL2+ prices. This analysis concluded that users could pay up to 43 per cent less for a broadband service deployed over the NBN than what they pay today for an ADSL2+ service in the 200 GB to 1000 GB per month data allowance range. We are seeing evidence that the NBN is welcomed with NBN Co expecting the majority (52 per cent) of residential consumers who sign up to broadband plans in the 2012 financial year to take up retail services based on NBN Co's entry-level wholesale 12/1* Mbps service.43


The government's objective is that the NBN will provide access to high-speed*, affordable broadband for all Australians. The NBN has the potential to advance competition in the telecom­munications sector by creating a wholesale-only high-speed broadband network that all providers may access on equal terms.


A strong wholesale aggregator market is already emerging to take advantage of the NBN. Nextgen Networks and ISPone are already offering services, and companies such as AAPT, Platform Networks, Optus and Telstra are expecting to offer services. These intermediary wholesale providers are developing products for retail service providers, particularly smaller providers, by integrating products and reducing costs through aggregating services.


In June 2011 Nextgen Networks announced44 its NBN Connect product, which offers wholesale Virtual ISP Service to small and medium consumer and business service providers. Nextgen Networks also expects its service will be used by larger service providers, particularly in the early rollout stages of the NBN.


On 5 December 2011, NBN Co submitted a special access undertaking (SAU) to the ACCC. Within this document, NBN Co has proposed a regulatory framework for it to establish the price and non-price conditions required for its investors to recover rollout costs. The document also provides details of the ACCC's oversight role. The ACCC has initiated a public consultation process and will consider whether or not to accept NBN Co's SAU.


Operating as a wholesale-only provider, NBN Co will solve the current structural issues in the telecommunications sector where one provider owns the only ubiquitous fixed-line network in Australia and competes against its wholesale customers in downstream retail markets.


Maintaining a clear distinction between the separate roles of the NBN and service providers will deliver better and fairer access for service providers, greater retail competition and better services for consumers and businesses.


Points of Interconnect


The government is determined to create an NBN that promotes competition, optimises NBN Co's network design, gives opportunities for smaller providers and delivers sustainable uniform wholesale pricing for the benefit of users in regional, rural and remote Australia. NBN Co and the ACCC have a role in promoting sustain­able competition, and have demonstrated this with advice in relation to where to locate and the number of Points of Interconnect (POIs). In considering this network structure issue and the ACCC's analysis, the government was seeking to optimise retail and infrastructure based competi­tion and to ensure national uniform wholesale pricing could be delivered.


POIs are locations where traffic is exchanged between one network and another. The number and placement of POIs is important in determining the cost structure of competing access seekers or retail services providers.


In 2010, the government requested the ACCC and NBN Co to undertake a process, including public consultation, on the number and location of initial POIs for the NBN that would best meet the long-term interests of end-users. In response, the ACCC advised the government that the semi-distributed model of approximately 121 POIs would best promote retail and wholesale competition across all geographic markets.


The ACCC concluded the semi-distributed model will result in:


'POIs being established in all locations where transmission services are workably competitive and it is technically and operationally feasible',45 and


'the most efficient use of existing infrastructure and will minimise the amount of stranding of competitive transmission assets that will occur through the transition from copper to fibre'.46


In supporting the semi-distributed model, recommended by the ACCC, the government was seeking a balance between:


NBN Co optimising its network design and technical operation with a view to reducing its costs and maximising its ability to deliver uniform national wholesale pricing; and


minimising the disruption to existing investment in competitive backhaul and thereby leveraging competition in the supply of such backhaul to put downward pressure on backhaul prices and, by keeping backhaul prices relatively low (and thus a small proposition of overall costs), supporting uniform national retail pricing overall.


The semi-distributed POI model enables small providers to service a discrete area using a limited number of POIs. For example, each POI will service around 80 000 to 100 000 premises. Pro­viders wanting to deliver direct services nation­ally will need to interconnect with all POIs. Smaller broadband providers not wanting to inter­connect with all POIs can use a wholesale aggre­gator to provide services over a wider area of the NBN. There is already a strong wholesale aggre­gator market emerging providing backhaul and other services to small providers who wish to compete on a wider scale. For example, as NBN Co announced on 1 September 2011, Townsville-based service providers Internet Solutions and North Queensland Telecom have started connect­ing some of their customers to the NBN via NBN Co customer and wholesaler Nextgen Networks.47 This illustrates the potential competitive benefits to the telecommunications sector of having an open access network like the NBN.


A number of service providers have signed up to the NBN trial to offer ready-made services to smaller retail service providers for them to resell to consumers and businesses. This means that small, or even some larger service providers, have the potential to enter parts of the telecom­munications market with a reduced requirement to invest in their own infrastructure to interconnect with the NBN. Such flexibility has the potential to support a range of wholesale and retail business models and is expected to facilitate lower barriers to entry for service providers and to open tip competition — both in major centres and in regional areas like North Queensland. This flexibility will in turn support the critical role of the fixed network in meeting growth in demand for data transmission.


The government has set itself a goal of making Australia one of the world's leading digital economies by 2020. This goal will be achieved by the productivity, jobs and competitive benefits delivered by the NBN. In 2020 Australia will rank in the top five OECD countries in terms of businesses and not-for-profit organisations using high-speed broadband to drive efficiency and pro­ductivity improvements; expand their customer base and enable growth. The NBN will provide equitable outcomes for Australians in regional, rural and remote Australia and improve access to business and job opportunities, health services, education, social and government services.


Recommendation 5


The Committee recommends that NBN Co:


publish timeframes for the rollout of National Broadband Network (NBN) services to regional and remote areas and communicate these to the areas to which they apply;


investigate the impact of the transition to the NBN on currently available levels of service for satellite technology; and


taking into consideration findings of this investigation, formulate contingency plans against potential reduction of capacity in regional and remote areas as a consequence of the NBN rollout, if required.


The government supports these recommenda­tions in principle. Rollout Timeframes


On 18 October 2011, NBN Co released its first 12-month national construction rollout plan. The schedule lists the communities in each state and territory where work on the fibre network will begin before September 2012. This marks the end of the NBN trial phase and the beginning of the volume rollout to Australian premises.


In the year to September 2012 NBN Co will have started construction on a high-speed* fibre network to nearly half a million Australian premises.


The schedule includes 28 newly-released sites across the country as well as locations containing over 63 000 premises where work is currently underway, including second release sites, such as Geraldton, Western Australia and extensions of first release sites such as Townsville, Queensland. The time taken from start of construction to services being available is about 12 months. The schedule will be updated each quarter to include new locations.


The 12-month national rollout plan and more detailed information is available at www.nbnco.com.autour-network/rollout-planittmI


In the first quarter of 2012 NBN Co will also issue its first three-year indicative schedule of the rollout, which will be updated annually until the rollout is complete.


Service levels supported over NBN Co's long term satellite service


NBN Co's leading edge satellite services will represent a step change, both in terms of speed and reliability, compared with existing satellite services.


The services will be significantly better for the 3 per cent of Australians in remote areas receiving services from the satellite broadband network. Applications that are utilised by satellite users today, such as the NT School of the Air will be supported over the long term satellite service that will offer vastly improved services to residential and small business users and commercial grade services.


Residential and small business grade satellite services are currently typically provisioned at 10 kilobits per second (Kbps) average busy hour throughput.


NBN Co's interim satellite service is offering NBN Co's retail service provider customers broadband speeds of up to 6 Mbps downlink and 1 Mbps uplink speed* and 30 Kbps average busy hour throughput at the wholesale level.


The interim satellite service has been well received with many end users providing positive feedback on the standard of equipment and the quality of service received from NBN Co. One Whirlpool user commented that 'As anticipated, the NBN first release satellite service has been an absolute model of reliability and consistency'.


For the long term satellite service, designed to offer NBN Co's retail service provider customers broadband speeds of up to 12 Mbps downlink and I Mbps uplink* at the wholesale level, NBN Co anticipates that the service will support average busy hour throughput speeds of 300 Kbps at the wholesale level.


The new satellites will have multiple focused high-capacity beams that maximise spectral usage. NBN Co will also use the next generation of ground equipment and acceleration techniques to maximise performance.


NBN Co has also recently provided more detail about the capabilities of the long-term satellite service in relation to e-health services which demonstrates just what a step-change in experience its long term satellite service will offer to end users.48 For example, it will be able to support content streaming and applications such as delivering training videos for remote health certification.


NBN Co's long term satellite product roadmap will include various features such as increased capacity and return path speeds that are designed to support large file transfers and real time video communications.


Over time, it is expected that further services will be supported as NBN Co upgrades its networks and through other technological improvements. There is no expected reduction in capacity in regional areas as a result of the NBN rollout, but rather an expectation of significant improvement in capacity. It is unlikely that current commercial services will be withdrawn in advance of the rollout because demand for these services is expected to'only


increase as regional and rural Australians use of broadband technologies increases.49 These communities will be able to take advantage of the increased capabilities offered by the long term satellite service.


* NBN Co is designing the NBN to be capable of delivering these speeds to NBN Co's wholesale customers (RSPB). Speeds actually achieved by retail customers (end users) will depend on a number of factors including the quality of their equipment and in-premises connection, the broadband plans offered by their RSP and how their RSP designs its network to cater for multiple end users.

Senate Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee Inquiry Report on the Airports Amendment Bill 2010




Introduction



On 30 September 2010, the Airports Amendment Bill 2010 was referred for inquiry to the Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee (the Committee) on the recommendation of the Senate Selection of Bills Committee.


On 18 November 2010 the Committee deliv­ered its report on the Bill and made two formal recommendations on the Bill. These two recom­mendations covered the development of guide­lines covering the preparation of airport master plans and the Committee's concurrence, noting some minor technical amendments, to the passage of the Bill.


Coalition senators also made three additional recommendations on the Bill covering the pro­posed establishment of additional guidelines and in relation to registration of these guidelines on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments.


The Government provided initial advice to the Committee on these recommendations on 23 June 2011 pending the completion of consultation with key stakeholders on the preparation of the proposed guidelines.


The Government's final response to each of the recommendations in the report is now outlined below.




Formal Recommendations 





Recommendation 1



The Committee recommends the Department of Infrastructure and Transport develop guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders to clarify the level of detail and analysis to be included in airport master plans in order to satisfy the requirements set out in paragraph 71(2)(h) and 71(3)(h) of the Airports Amendment Bill 2010.




Response



The Government accepts this recommendation.


Master Plan Amendment Guidelines were approved by the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, in January 2012, following consultation with key stakeholders.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that, subject to the amendments foreshadowed by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport in correspondence to the Committee dated 15 November 2010, the Bill be passed.




Response



The Government supports this recom­mendation and the Airports Amendment Act 2010 received Royal Assent on 17 December 2010.




Additional Recommendations





Additional Recommendation 1



Coalition Senators recommend that the Depart­ment of Infrastructure and Transport develop guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders to clarify the level of detail and analysis to be included in airport master plans in order to satisfy the requirements set out in paragraph 71(2)(h) and 71(3)(h) of the Airports Amendment Bill 2010. For the avoidance of doubt, such guidelines should be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and subject to the tabling and disallowance requirements of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.




Response



As indicated in the response to Recommen­dation 1, the Government supports and has imple­mented the recommendation to develop these guidelines.


However the Department of Infrastructure and Transport's legal advice confirms the guidelines are not legislative instruments for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and there­fore, registering the guidelines on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments is not consid­ered appropriate. 


The Department will publish the guidelines on its website. 




Additional Recommendation 2



Coalition Senators recommend that the Depart­ment of Infrastructure and Transport develop guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders to clarify the range of developments that may be considered to be of a kind that is likely to have a significant impact on the local or regional com­munity for the purposes of paragraph 89(1)(n) of the Airports Amendment Bill 2010. For the avoidance of doubt, such guidelines should be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and subject to the tabling and disallowance requirements of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.




Response



The Government accepts the recommendation to develop guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders.


Significant Impact on the Local or Regional Community Guidelines were approved by the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, in January 2012, following consultation with industry stakeholders.


As outlined in the response to Additional Recommendation 1, the guidelines will not be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments but will be made available on the Department's website.




Additional Recommendation 3



Coalition Senators recommend that the Department of Infrastructure and Transport develop guidelines in consultation with key stake­holders to clarify the structure, composition, agenda and reporting requirements of Community Aviation Consultation Groups and of Planning Coordination Forums. For the avoidance of doubt, such guidelines should be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and subject to the tabling and disallowance require­ments of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.




Response



The Government accepts the recommendation to develop these guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders.


Community Aviation Consultation Group and Planning Coordination Forum Guidelines were approved by the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, in February 2011.


As outlined in the response to Additional Recommendation 1 the guidelines will not be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments but have been promulgated widely and are available on the Department's website.


 




Australian Government Response to Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee 
Inquiry into Rural and Regional Access to Secondary and Tertiary Education Opportunities
.





Introduction



The Australian Government notes the findings of the Senate Inquiry into Rural and Regional Access to Secondary and Tertiary Education Opportunities. The Australian Government has demonstrated a commitment to improving educational access and opportunities for students and their families who experience geographical disadvantage, through specific initiatives and its broader social inclusion agenda. The Australian Government's vision of a socially inclusive society is one in which all Australians feel valued and have the opportunity to participate fully in the life of our society.


The importance of this issue is highlighted by the large number of submissions to the Inquiry (over 750), including one by the Australian Government Department of Education, Employ­ment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR). As outlined in the DEEWR submission, ""rural and regional students and their families are recognised and targeted by the Australian Government, and State and Territory education authorities, as a group who have special educational needs and may not be adequately assisted through general education assistance"". DEEWR's submission discussed Australian Government initiatives that cater for this need. The Committee's report comprised a majority report along with a minority dissenting report by Government Senators. The Government is disappointed that the elements of the minority report appear largely not reflected in the majority report.


The Australian Government believes that every student should have access to a world-class education no matter where they live. In the Commitment to Regional Australia (the Commitment), agreed with the Independent Members Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor on 7 September 2010, the Australian Government renewed its commitment to regional education by strengthening national policies to ensure that they effectively meet the needs of students across the country. 


The Commitment identifies specific new education and skills commitments and builds on work already underway by the Australian Government. In September 2010, the Office of Regional Education, Skills and Jobs was established, to better drive and coordinate DEEWR's efforts for regional Australia, including those initiatives detailed in the Commitment to Regional Australia. These initiatives have been included below relevant to the specific recommendations.




Response to Recommendations





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the Australian Government commission an investi­gation into the barriers to rural and regional secondary educational opportunities with a view to developing a long-term strategy to address the inequity in secondary educational opportunities in rural and regional Australia. 



Response: Supported, initiatives already in place. As outlined in the Government Senators Dissenting Report, the Australian Government has been proactive in addressing barriers faced by students from rural and regional areas in accessing secondary and tertiary education opportunities. 


For example, legislation under the auspices of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support for Students) Act 2009 that was passed by the Parliament on 18 March 2010 mean significant improvements for many students and their families living in rural and regional areas in accessing education and training opportunities. 


In particular, to assist young people disadvantaged by the geographic location of their home from educational institutions, students living in Outer Regional Australia, Remote Australia, or Very Remote Australia who are required to live away from home to study, are able to access the second and third elements of the former workforce participation criterion. The workforce participation criterion comprise: full-time employment averaging 30 hours or more per week for at least 18 months over a two year period; worked part-time (at least 15 hours each week) for two years since last leaving secondary school; or had cumulative earnings totalling at least 75% of Wage Level A of the National Training Wage schedule included in a modern award ($21,009 in 2011) in 18 months since last leaving secondary school.


From 1 January 2011, these young people have been able to qualify for payment by meeting any of the three elements of the workforce participation criterion for independence, provided their parents' income is less than $150 000 per annum (in the case of the second and third elements). With the Review of Student Income Support Reforms now complete, the Australian Government introduced the Social Security Amendment (Student Income Support Reforms) Bill 2011 on 21 September 2011 to further extend this provision to students living in Inner Regional areas who are required to live away from home to study from 1 January 2012.


The DEEWR submission outlined several Australian Government programs in place that directly assist students living in rural and regional Australia and their families. This is also in the context of the Government's initiatives under the COAG productivity agenda in relation to school retention and increasing the skills base of those entering the workforce. Along with existing assistance, these initiatives already form part of the Australian Government's long-term strategy in this area.




Recommendation 2 



In developing a long-term strategy to address the inequity in secondary education opportunities in rural and regional Australia, the committee recommends that consideration should be given to strategies for ensuring that literacy and numeracy programs, once introduced into schools, are able to be maintained within those schools. 



Response: Supported, initiatives already in place. The Government Senators Dissenting Report notes the Australian Government has made available funding of $540 million through the Smarter Schools – National Partnership Agreement on Literacy and Numeracy. 


The National Partnership supports states and territories to implement evidence-based practices that will deliver sustained improvement in literacy and numeracy outcomes for all students, especially those who are most in need of support. States and territories, in collaboration with non-government education authorities identified the schools and students to be targeted under this National Partnership. The funding support and reform initiatives to be implemented were negotiated with each participating school. 


This National Partnership focuses on the key areas of teaching literacy and numeracy, stronger school leadership and the effective use of student performance information to identify where students need support. This will lead to improvements in literacy and numeracy outcomes for all students, with a priority focus on those primary aged students most in need of support. 


Of the schools participating in this National Partnership, approximately 430 (48 per cent) are located in regional Australia. Under this National Partnership, each Partnership school has identified their priorities and developed an implementation plan tailored to the needs of students at that school. 




Recommendation 3 



The committee recommends that as part of the investigation into the barriers to rural and regional secondary educational opportunities with a view to developing a long-term strategy to address the inequity in secondary educational opportunities in rural and regional Australia, consideration should be given to whether the current level of funding under the AIC Scheme is appropriate. 



Response: Not Supported. The Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme helps isolated families of primary, secondary and certain tertiary students with additional educational costs because they are unable to attend an appropriate government school on a daily basis. 


The AIC Scheme has five allowance types which are tailored to assist a range of education options for isolated families. The applicable allowance for a student will normally reflect the student's living arrangements while they undertake an approved course. In 2009, 11,098 students received AIC allowances at a cost of $59.9 million. 



As noted in the Majority Committee report, the DEEWR submission points to a variety of payment types with an annual basic boarding allowance of $7,141 (2011 rate) along with possible additional allowances (for example the Additional Boarding Allowance of $2,366 in 2011). The Australian Government recognises that the Majority Committee report wishes to consider the appropriateness of the particular rate for each allowance, however the Government believes the Scheme provides adequate assistance to students and their families. 


The assistance provided under the AIC Scheme is demand driven and is uncapped, with applications assessed by the Department of Human Services – Centrelink in line with established program guidelines and eligibility criteria. There is therefore no limit placed on the number of families assisted per year, provided they meet the eligibility criteria. The Scheme is funded under a special appropriation authorised under the Student Assistance Act 1973.


It should also be noted that assistance under the AIC should not be treated in isolation. For example, as discussed in detail within the DEEWR submission, there are other forms of Australian Government assistance for schools in rural or regional areas and their students. 


One notable Australian Government initiative is the Country Areas Program that assists schools and school communities in improving the educational outcomes and opportunities of students who are educationally disadvantaged because of their geographical isolation. 


Other Australian Government generic initiatives that assist schools in rural or regional areas include funding for new facilities and refurbishments through the Building the Education Revolution (BER) and the Australian Government's Capital Grants Program for non-government schools. In terms of the latter, the Australian Government provided approximately $106 million in funding to schools in remote, rural and regional areas in 2008-2011. This includes funding for government schools in 2008 and funding for non-government schools in 2008-2011. From 2009, Australian Government funding for government schools is delivered through the intergovernmental funding framework under the National Education Agreement (NEA) with states and territories.


Under the Commitment, schools in regional Australia will be the first to receive funding, including a minimum funding entitlement based on the population share, equating to around 32 per cent of available funding. This funding will be in the form of at least $125 million of the $388 million of payments being awarded under the Rewards for School Improvement initiative to the schools in regional Australia that have shown the most improvement in student outcomes. 


The government has also committed $480.5 million by 2018 to increase the capacity of schools to make decisions at a local level under the Empowering Local Schools (ELS) initiative. Approximately one third of the 1000 schools expected to participate in ELS over 2012 and 2013 will be located in regional areas. Participating schools will receive start-up grants of $40,000-$50,000 to assist them to manage their increased decision making responsibilities effectively.




Recommendation 4 



The committee strongly recommends that the Australian Government introduce a Tertiary Access Allowance for students who are required to move away from home to access tertiary education.



Response: Not Supported.


In the Commitment to Regional Australia, the Government noted that it has reformed student income support to expand access by including: 150,000 new scholarships; an increase to the parental income test which will benefit over 100,000 students; and a review of student income support to be brought forward by 12 months. 


As identified in the Government Senators Dissenting Report, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support for Students) Act 2010, significantly reformed income support for students. On 1 April 2010, Relocation Scholarships were introduced for eligible university students receiving Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY who have to live away from the family home for study. The Relocation Scholarship assists dependent rural and regional students, in particular, with relocation for study.


The Review of Student Income Support Reforms was presented to the Government on 8 July 2011. The Government tabled the Report in Parliament on 14 September 2011 and introduced the Social Security Amendment (Student Income Support Reforms) Bill 2011 on 21 September 2011 to eliminate regional eligibility distinctions for Youth Allowance from 1 January 2012.


The Social Security Amendment (Student Income Support Reforms) Bill 2011 introduced on 21 September 2011 provides for the value of Relocation Scholarships for non-regional students to be $4000 in the first year they are required to live away from home to study and $1000 in subsequent years from 1 January 2012. In recognition of the higher costs of relocation for regional students and subject to the passage of legislation, Relocation Scholarship values for eligible dependent regional higher education students will be reset to provide more assistance in the second and third years of living away from home to study. The 2012 values will be $4000 in the first year of living away, $2000 in each of the second and third years and $1000 in any subsequent years of study. The Scholarship is indexed by CPI annually. Many students will also qualify for Rent Assistance. 


From 1 January 2012, the value of Student Start-up Scholarships available to university students receiving Youth Allowance, Austudy or ABSTUDY will be reset to $2,050 in 2012 and indexed by CPI thereafter. The DEEWR submission pointed out that these scholarships would assist with the costs of textbooks and specialised equipment. 


The existing reforms also include relaxation of the parental income test threshold and associated withdrawal taper rates increasing access to Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY. As students living away from home also attract a higher rate of payment and generally Rent Assistance as well, this reform particularly benefits rural students, who are more likely to come from low-to-middle income families. 


While the Australian Government believes that parents, where they are able, should support their children until they reach financial independence, through the measures contained in the Social Security Amendment (Student Income Support Reforms) Bill 2011, students from Inner Regional areas will be able to access independent Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY under the same rules that apply to students from Outer Regional, Remote and Very Remote Areas from 1 January 2012.


Students accessing the second and third elements of the workforce participation criterion must have parental income of less than $150,000 per annum. 


The Australian Government is already providing substantial support for students who need to move away from home to study. The Australian Government considers that a Tertiary Access Allowance as described by the Committee, without any means testing in place, would be costly (impacting on provision in other areas of educational need), inequitable and possibly open to abuse.




Recommendation 5 



The committee recommends that the Australian Government investigate the establishment of a capital works program to assist tertiary institutions to increase the stock of affordable housing for students. 



Response: Not Supported. The Government Senators Dissenting Report notes that since taking office the Australian Government has committed almost $5 billion in capital funding for tertiary institutions to support the development and renewal of campus infrastructure. 


As the Dissenting Report also notes, the guidelines of the Better Universities Renewal Funding (BURF) and Teaching and Learning Capital Fund for Higher Education (TLC-HE) funds, worth $1 billion in total, were broad enough to allow universities to spend this on student housing. A number of institutions have taken the opportunity to do so. For example, the Australian National University used       $4 million of its BURF allocation to develop student accommodation on campus. 


The involvement of the private sector in the development and/or provision of student accommodation is widespread. For example, a 507 bed student accommodation complex opened by the University of Canberra in 2009 was developed through a partnership between the University and Campus Living Villages. The private rental market, 'homestay' programs and independent residential colleges will also continue to play important roles in responding to the housing needs of students. 


In line with the Commitment, the Government will provide $400 million in funding for the Structural Adjustment Fund: $200 million to meet universities' capital requirements of $10 million or more and $200 million to meet non-recurrent requirements. This funding is to assist universities, particularly those in regional and outer metropolitan areas to adapt to the new student focused university funding system being introduced in 2012. 


The Government has also reviewed the Regional Loading paid by the Government to eligible higher education providers in recognition of the higher cost of providing places at regional campuses. In the 2011-12 Budget the Government announced that it would increase the regional loading by $109.9 million over four years (for a total of $249.4 million over four years). The regional loading funding will be distributed through a new formula that is transparent and responsive to student demand.


Another potential source of funding for student accommodation is the Education Investment Fund (EIF). While the focus of EIF is on large-scale strategic infrastructure projects for teaching, learning and research, it does not exclude funding for student accommodation if it can be demonstrated that the accommodation is integral to fully delivering the intended outcomes of the project.




Recommendation 6 



The committee therefore recommends that the Australian Government investigate the implementation of a form of temporary income support for students while they are on clinical placements or block release. 



Response: Noted. The Australian Government has committed, in response to the Review of Student Income Support, to undertake development work on the feasibility and merit of an income-contingent loan scheme targeted specifically at students who are required to move away from home to undertake formal clinical practicums or other formal practicum periods as part of their course.


The Government's reforms to student income support include a Student Start-up Scholarship as an entitlement for higher education students receiving Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY and Austudy. This scholarship, valued at $2,050 in 2012, is intended to assist with education expenses, including text books, laptops, field trips and practicums or placements. 


Students eligible to receive Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY or Austudy will continue to receive these payments while undertaking practicums or clinical placements that are a requirement of their course. Some dependent students receiving the 'at home' rate of Youth Allowance may claim the 'away from home' rate when moving away from home to undertake a practicum. These students may also be able to claim Rent Assistance, but this would depend upon whether a rental agreement was in place while they were living away from home during the practicum.


If a student receiving income support is engaged in a tertiary external course that has a compulsory residential component, including practicums, they are entitled to Fares Allowance which includes reimbursement for one return trip from their permanent home to the institution and back. A student is eligible for Fares Allowance for each external course or practicum undertaken during a year that requires attendance at an institution for a residential component.


ABSTUDY students may also claim 'Away from Base' assistance to help cover the cost of practicums (up to a maximum of $2,080 for Masters and PhD students) per year. 


Students receiving Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY and Austudy may also obtain an advance of up to $500, if required. 


Universities offer limited support in some courses through scholarships and bursaries to assist with the additional costs associated with practicums. State Governments also offer scholarships and loan schemes to assist students undertaking practicums. This assistance may not be tied to receipt of student income support payments.




Recommendation 7 



The committee recommends that a review be undertaken in 2013 to assess the impact of funding compacts, student-driven demand funding and the Structural Adjustment Fund on regional universities.



Response: Supported in principle, initiatives already in place. The Australian Government regularly monitors the impact of policy changes on universities.  


Ongoing discussions with universities as part of the compacts process will inform the Government of the impact of its higher education reforms on individual universities and regional universities generally. 


The Australian Government regularly monitors higher education enrolments. Early indications are that demand driven funding for undergraduate student places is of benefit to regional areas. Growth in enrolments has been strong, with regional universities together enrolling 10 per cent more students in 2011 than in 2009. This equals the 10 per cent growth at metropolitan universities over the same period.


In response to the Review of Regional Loading, the Government announced in the 2011-12 Budget that it would increase the regional loading by $109.9 million over four years (for a total of $249.4 million over four years). The regional loading funding will be distributed through a new formula that is transparent and responsive to student demand. These changes will start in 2012. The new regional loading formula will involve annual monitoring of enrolments at regional campuses.


The Structural Adjustment Fund was announced in May 2009 with funding of $400 million to assist universities to prepare for the new operational requirements of a demand driven funding system with new quality measures in place.  


Regional universities and TAFEs will have access to a Regional Priorities Round of funding from the Education Investment Fund of $500 million. Infrastructure projects funded through the Education Investment Fund are monitored regularly during their implementation and grant recipients are required to participate in project evaluation activities following the completion of projects. The implementation of projects may not be complete by 2013.


The Australian Government has also made fresh commitments to governance and transparency reform which will ensure that regional Australia gets a fair hearing and a fair return from its national government. This includes developing a spatial accounting model which will provide greater visibility into Government spending and service delivery by regional location.




Recommendation 8 



The committee recommends that the Australian Government investigate options for attracting students to regional institutions, and encouraging graduates to work in rural and regional locations, through programs which provide for reduced HECS-HELP liability.



Response: Supported in part, initiatives already in place. The Government Senators' Dissenting Report notes that there are already a range of HECS remission policies in place which have already been adopted by this Government to encourage graduates to work in priority fields or areas. The Australian Government provides incentives for targeted areas such as medicine and early childhood education. 


Incentives for medicine include:


the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship;


the Rural Retention Program;


the Practice Incentives Program; and 


the MBS Bulk Bill Incentive Items. 


Incentives for early childhood education include:


a HECS-HELP Benefit for early childhood education teachers, which has a location-based eligibility criterion targeted at regional areas. The Benefit allows eligible early childhood education teachers who work in an area of particular need to reduce their HECS-HELP debt.


As universities are self-accrediting institutions that decide the courses they offer, they are best placed in terms of attracting students to their regional institutions or campuses. The Australian Government already provides significant support to these institutions through initiatives (many of which are detailed in the DEEWR submission) such as regional loading. 


The Australian Government also provides incentives for international students to study at regional institutions or campuses. For the purposes of the General Skilled Migration program administered by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC), inter­national students can claim migration eligibility points for having lived and studied full time at a campus located in regional Australia or a low population growth metropolitan area for at least 2 years prior to lodging an application for skilled migration visa.  


Governments currently provide a range of incentives to teachers to encourage them to take positions in rural and remote areas. Under this scenario, if a State Government chooses, incentives for teachers to take positions in rural and regional areas could include a scholarship or payment to be directed to the repayment of a person's HECS-HELP debt.


Under the Commitment the Australian Government will develop Regional Education, Skills and Jobs Plans in 2011, in response to the 2010 DEEWR report on access to and participation in higher education in regional Australia. Thirty-four Education, Skills and Jobs Coordinators will be deployed into regional communities to work with local stakeholders to develop the Plans. These Plans will include strategies to increase the participation rates for higher education, where relevant to the needs identified by the local stakeholders and community.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:54):  I seek leave to take note of the response regarding the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report Rural and regional access to secondary and tertiary education opportunities.


Leave granted.




Senator NASH:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


We received today from the government their response to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into rural and regional access to secondary and tertiary education opportunities. This inquiry was held in 2009. The rural and regional committee reported in December 2009. I chaired that inquiry. It is interesting to note that it has taken the government over two years to provide the Senate with a response of fewer than 12 pages. The response is hardly timely, and I suggest that indicates the lack of understanding that the government has of this issue.


The government indicate in their response:


The Australian Government believes that every student should have access to a world-class education no matter where they live.


I would suggest to the government that perhaps they would like to put their money where their mouth is and ensure that that actually happens, because the response they have given to the committee report in no way does that. The response shows yet again that the government has a complete lack of understanding when it comes to the needs of regional students and the very real issue of inequity.



Recommendation 1 of the committee report is that there be 'an investigation into the barriers to rural and regional secondary educational opportunities' thatexist for regional students. What is extraordinary is that in the response the governmentsay they have been proactive in doing this and yet almost the entire response to recommendation 1—that we look at the barriers for regional students—relates to the changes that the governmentmade to the independentyouth allowance. Madam Acting Deputy President Fisher, you and others wouldknow thatthose were the unfair changes that the governmentput in place in 2010 thatmeant that students in inner regional areas did not have the same criteria applied to them for accessing independentyouth allowance as other regional students did—simply unfair. In the response, the governmentare claiming the reversal of thatunfair changeat the end of last year—that they themselves put in place in 2010—as a win and as somehow addressing the barriers thatexist for regional students. How stupid is that?




This government


should never have made those changes to independent


youth allowance in the first place. They should never have treated regional students differently simply because of where they lived according to lines on a map. And yet here we have the government


in response to the committee report recommendations claiming that


the change back to treating all 
regional students fairly is some wonderful win for the government, that they have made this great change and that that somehow indicates the government


are looking to remove the barriers for rural and regional students to educational opportunities. It is simply extraordinary that


the government


would


do that—that


they would


try to claim that as a win. The changes should never have been made in the first place.





That


is virtually the entire response to that


particular recommendation. It just goes to show that this government


simply does not understand


the issue of the inequity for regional students when it comes to their opportunities to educational access compared to those of city students and students in metropolitan areas. The problem is very simple. Regional students so often have no choice but to relocate to attend university


or further tertiary education, and that


comes at a cost of around $20,000 a year. That is a cost that


city students who have the opportunity to live at home, as they very often do, do not have to bear. That is the inequity that


this government


simply cannot get its head around. It is through no fault of the regional students that they have to relocate.




The government


say that they have addressed some of these issues


through some of the changes to the independent youth allowance. I have to admit, as I have before, that the changes to the threshold were a good thing. But that


does not address the issue for regional students who fall outside of the criteria for assistance through independent


youth allowance. We are talking about those with middle-income parents. What this government


have done is apply a $150,000 parental income test cap to independent


youth allowance. That


means that those students whose parents' income combined comes to $150,000 are not eligible for independent


youth allowance.

How illogical and, again, how stupid is that? These students are proving themselves to be independent of their parents. To then put a parental income test in place is treating this as a welfare measure, and independent youth allowance is not that.


Indeed, it has become quite obvious over time that the government put the cap in place only to free up funding for other areas, which means that regional students are bearing the cost. Let's just look at that for a moment. That $150,000 is combined income before tax. We are not talking about wealthy people. We are talking about, quite possibly, a police officer or a schoolteacher out in a regional area who is going to receive absolutely no assistance from the government for their students to travel away and attend university. It is an absolute mockery when the government say that they believe every student should have access to a world-class education, no matter where they live, when the policies that they have put in place directly contradict that statement. The government say that one of the recommendations was to put in place a tertiary access allowance, which would provide funding for students to assist them with relocation when they have no choice but to relocate to attend tertiary education. The government indicated in their response that that is not supported. Again, this just indicates that the government are not listening to the thousands of regional families who are telling them that the current policies do not work. Indeed, the government put in place enormous barriers for those students to go on to tertiary education, and that is simply not fair.


The ICPA have been pushing for a tertiary access allowance for many years, as have I. This is the way for regional students to be able to have some equity when it comes to accessing education, when we compare them to city students who do not have to bear that financial burden. The government in their response talk about the relocation scholarships that were introduced, saying that is providing funding. Relocation scholarships do not even apply to students on independent youth allowance. They talk about the fact that the government eliminated the regional eligibility distinctions for youth allowance from 1 January 2012. The government brought those changes in in the first place. They should never, ever have been put in place, and now we see the government again crying that this is some great win for regional students. They disenfranchised an entire two-year cohort of year 12 students who fell into the gap before the government fixed their absolutely appalling mistake, and that is simply not on.


The inequity that exists for those regional students will not be addressed until the government recognises that this is not a means-testing welfare issue. This is about the comparison between the regional student who has to bear the cost of that $20,000 a year when they have no choice but to relocate to attend university and the city student who does not bear that cost. It does not matter if the parents are earning $10,000, $50,000, $100,000 or $150,000—that is not the point. The point is the inequity for the regional students because the families have to bear the costs that other students do not. Until the government pulls its head out of the sand and recognises this as an issue, those students are still going to face those barriers. Those students are still going to face those enormous financial difficulties that are preventing so many of our students from going on to tertiary education. Only 33 per cent of regional students go on to tertiary education compared to 55 per cent of students in the cities. The evidence clearly shows that it is because of the financial burden. The government simply has to admit that its measures have not addressed those barriers. It must clearly start to recognise that there is a huge inequity for regional students and that it has to be addressed.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-03-13,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:04):  I join Senator Nash in expressing my concern at the very late response by the government to the inquiry chaired by Senator Nash. Let me give you these statistics by way of evidence. It is a comparison between the dates of 1984 and 2007 regarding people from rural communities and people in the wider community with tertiary qualifications. In 1984, four per cent of people in the rural communities of Australia had a tertiary qualification, whereas 2½ times that figure, 10 per cent, in the wider community had such a qualification. By 2007, the number of people in the wider community having a tertiary qualification had gone up from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. Those in rural communities having tertiary qualifications went from a lamentable four per cent to an even more lamentable seven per cent—equal to the lowest in the OECD, and this is supposed to be the smart country. If one were to actually examine those 2007 figures out to 2012, one would only see a further widening of that gap. This is what the inquiry went to, and we see a gross deficiency in the government's response.


In the last three weeks I have had the opportunity, with my colleague Senator Colbeck, to talk to rural communities about education and agricultural education in Tasmania. In Victoria, two weeks ago, I had that same opportunity with representatives of Marcus Oldham College, and last week throughout rural Western Australia I addressed the same questions in the wheatbelt areas. We have a lamentable and pathetic circumstance that must be handled, must be addressed and surely must be bipartisan. We cannot leave rural communities in the sad demise they are in at the moment.


Senator Nash spoke about independence from parents. How is it that an 18-year-old can vote and can be called up to participate in military service, and yet an 18-, 19-, 20- or 21-year-old somehow or other is beholden to their parents' income when it comes to addressing the question of independent youth allowance?


I will not go back over the words that Senator Nash used except to reflect on the three criteria, the first of which is working full-time for 30 hours a week for 18 months. Where are the full-time jobs in rural Australia, working 30 hours a week over 18 months—not seasonally adjusted, but 30 hours every week? They do not exist, Madam Acting Deputy President Fisher, a fact you know well yourself from your experience in the Dales. In fact, it was in Brookton that we started our visits last week.


The second alternative is part-time work for greater than 15 hours a week for two years after leaving school. We all know about the wastage that occurs when, instead of going on to higher study, a student takes a gap year and particularly a second gap year. They might go on to tertiary study if they have one gap year but it is very, very unlikely if they have two gap years. And who are those who are represented most highly in the group who do not go on to tertiary study after a two-year gap? You guessed it; they are from rural communities. The third group comprise those who might have total savings of greater than 75 per cent of the necessary $21,000 over 18 months.


The question I ask, of course, is: why, at all, are they beholden to their parents' combined incomes? As Senator Nash said, a policeman and a teacher in a country town may well accumulate $150,000 of annual salary—they may work overtime, get some form of penalties or some form of zone allowance in the magical, mystical $150,000—but you would have an argument on your hands if you were to say that such people were wealthy enough to send children away from home. The criterion must be: does that person have to leave their home to access higher education? The answer is yes.


Only last week did I have many people in the rural communities—towns you would know well: Brookton, Kondinin, Hyden—asking me: 'What is the solution to this dilemma? We have to get our children away for higher education, and we have to get them away for upper secondary education but we cannot afford it; it's $40-odd thousand, at least, after tax per student.' This is not for the top boarding schools in the cities, as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, but that is the least cost. In many instances, the farmer's wife shifts to the city so that she can be with the children in the city, and that is breaking up the family because we know that, on the weekend, the children also remain in the city. Where does the farmer end up? One farmer said to me, 'Unfortunately, Senator Back, all too often where the farmer ends up is on the end of a rope in his shearing shed.' That was said to me last Tuesday in your old home town of Brookton, Madam Acting Deputy President.


So we have the circumstance, unfortunately, in this country of a wide disparity now between the educational aspirations of those in the cities and those in the country. Those of us who have watched this process for many, many years know that, if a family remains in the country, the educational outcome for their students in years 11 and 12 going into higher education are much lower. We know that. They are much lower than they would be if the family were able to make the decision to move to the city. Of course, we now see that farming families cannot do this. In so many rural communities now, professionals such as doctors, dentists and others—and, in my own case, my wife and I—make the decision very early to be in a city somewhere by the time their oldest child goes to secondary school. Right across each of the states that I have been in that is the case. It is not just an educational issue; it is an issue right across society, because when that doctor or that dentist leaves that community, as we all know, a valuable person is lost, a valuable family is lost to that community.


These are issues that are not being addressed, yet we see the questions raised. Recommendations were made in this report for external students to try to make their circumstances easier. They did not receive an adequate response from the government. What we now have are compulsory student union fees payable also by external students who can never, ever access the services for which they are subsidising their city cousins and those who are in city based institutions.


We had a circumstance in Queensland—Senator Nash may remember it—in which one of the university vice-chancellors said to us that he was aware of cases where those leaving school at the end of year 12 were saying to the principal: 'Don't tell my parents that I am bright enough or that I have qualified to go to a city university to study, because I don't want to put that pressure on my parents and on my siblings.' This is a wealthy country. What a lamentable circumstance in which a year-12 student says to the school principal, 'I don't want my parents knowing that I am capable of going on to higher studies.' Very often these people from a regional area, a rural area, even a remote area, are the people who come back and provide professional services upon graduation. These are particularly important issues and should not have been the subject of so much delay.


Time does not permit me to go further into the whole question of agricultural and agribusiness education. As you know, that is the subject of a Senate inquiry at this moment, and it is creating an enormous amount of interest. I am delighted that Senator Gallacher is here in the chamber and has participated in the first hearing—and, hopefully, will participate in other hearings. But, again, all it is pointing to is the absolute demise of tertiary institutions. I was at Marcus Oldham College in Geelong the other day, now the only private sector college that is still operating in the same way as it did it in the 1980s. Look at those that have closed: Hawkesbury could not have first-year students this year; Muresk in Western Australia is closed; and Gatton and Roseworthy are largely now veterinary schools with some agricultural education. We are graduating fewer than 700 graduates in agricultural science for an annual demand of at least 3,500. This is not the way that Australia is going to achieve what it needs to achieve to provide food and fibre for the region into the future. These are critically important issues and they are far more deserving of rigour, study and examination than this response has indicated.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (16:53):  I present government responses to committee reports as listed at item 15(b) on today's Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to have the documents incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The documents read as follows—





Government Response to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration 





Annual reports (No. I of 2008)





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the government implement the committee's updated 2005 recommendations regarding the publication of an annual report on government advertising expenditure.


Responses to updated recommendations 10 to 12 of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee, Government Advertising and Accountability Report, December 2005




Updated Recommendation 10



The Committee recommends that the Department of Finance and Deregulation publish an annual report on government advertising, commencing in 2007-08. The annual report should be modelled on the Annual Report on the Government of Canada's Advertising Activities 2003-04. It should include:


a total figure for government expenditure on advertising activities;


total figures by agency for expenditure on advertising activities;


figures for expenditure on media placement by type and media placement by month; and


detailed information about major campaigns, including a statement of the objectives of the campaign, the target audience, a detailed breakdown of media placement, evaluation of the campaign including information about the methodology used and the measurable results, and a breakdown of the costs into 'production', 'media placement' and 'evaluation research'.




Response



Agreed in principle. Following the introduction of new advertising guidelines in July 2008, and updated guidelines in March 2010, Finance has published five reports related to campaign advertising expenditure.


Three of these reports were Half Year Reports on Campaign Advertising by Australian Government Departments and Agencies, covering media expenditure costs for campaigns that ran during the first six months of a financial year (from 1 July to 31 December). The first report was tabled in March 2009.


The remaining two reports were Full Year Reports on Campaign Advertising by Australian Government Departments and Agencies, covering both direct campaign advertising expenditure and associated indirect expenditure such as campaign research, consultancy services and other costs. The Full Year reports provide a summary of individual campaigns in terms of target audiences and campaign objectives. Full Year Reports cover the period 1 July to 30 June in each financial year and the most recent was tabled in October 2010.




Updated Recommendation 11 



The Committee recommends that from 2007-08, the annual reports of each government agency must include:


a total figure for the agency's advertising expenditure; and


a consolidated figure for the cost for each campaign managed by that agency.




Response



Agreed in principle, but at a whole of government level. This recommendation will be delivered as Finance publishes whole of government biannual reports on Campaign Advertising by Australian Government Departments and Agencies.




Updated Recommendation 12



The Committee recommends that from 2007-08 the annual reports of each government agency must include:


a total figure for departmental expenditure on public opinion research;


a breakdown of the type of research, including the expenditure on research for advertising as a percentage of total research costs;


highlights of key research projects; and


a listing of research firms used by business volume.




Response



Agreed in part. The full year report on campaign advertising includes information on the campaign research costs, the research firms involved as well as other campaign related costs.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that the government comply with the Senate Order relating to agency advertising and public information projects of 29 October 2003.




Response



See response to Recommendation 1, in particular, the response to updated Recommendation 10 of the Committee's 2005 Report.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that Centrelink review its current outcome and output structure with a view to their modification to better reflect the comprehensive nature of Centrelink's operations and functions.




Response



The recommendation is superseded by the review of financial structures in the lead up to integration of the Department of Human Services.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that the Australian River Company Limited provide the committee (on a confidential basis if necessary) with a written explanation as to;


what issues have prevented the completion of the deliberations;


when the Australian River Company expects the deliberations to sell the company will be finalised; and


why it has not been possible to wind up the company on a commercially supportable basis since May 2002.




Response



The Australian River Co. Limited (ARCo) was created to hold the residual assets and liabilities of the Australian National Line group (ANL), formerly the Australian Shipping Commission, which were not able to be included in the Government's sale in 1998-99 of most of the ANL operations.


Since May 2002 ARCo has operated under a 'charter' from the Government (represented by the Minister responsible for the 'Finance' portfolio) to manage the remaining operations of the company with a view to winding it down at the earliest opportunity on a commercially supportable basis, including the pursuit of any sale opportunities.


In 2004-05 the then Board was able to complete the sale to Patrick Shipping Pty Ltd of two 'roll on / roll off' vessels operating across the Bass Strait. The net profit on the sale of approximately $2.3m was paid to the Commonwealth as a dividend. SeaRoad Holdings Pty Ltd continues to operate these vessels between Melbourne and Devonport.


A wind down of ARCo's remaining operations must deal with two separate and largely unrelated aspects of the residual assets and liabilities. In both cases characteristics which would have influenced the original exclusion from a commercial sale remain relevant.


The first aspect is the appropriate future management of insurance settlements for ARCo's ongoing legal liability to former employees of ANL for the period 1946 to 1997. The ARCo annual report for the year to 30 November 2010 shows a gross provision for these claims of $18.9m based on an annually updated actuarial review of the company's claims exposure going forward. When ARCo's insurance arrangements are taken into account, the net provision reported in November 2010 is an estimated $3.6m. The actuarial review notes that some claims may take up to 40 years to settle. The potential for asbestos related disease is a factor in this analysis.


This insurance liability for former employees is largely covered by long standing insurance agreements which could not be expected to be replaced on favourable terms. Continuation of this insurance policy cover is dependent on the workers' compensation liability remaining with ARCo. This effectively precludes alternative arrangements involving a liquidation of the company, such as a transfer of the liability to the Commonwealth insurer Comcare, from being commercially supportable at this time. The uncertainty and sensitivity surrounding the liability, with its exposure to asbestos disease, means that a disposal of ARCo shares by the Commonwealth that includes the necessary safeguards for former ANL employees would necessarily be on terms unattractive to the Commonwealth.


The second aspect is the future of the two remaining vessels owned by ARCo and operated between Weipa and Gladstone by Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) on a yearly renewable charter basis. These bulk ore carriers, the River Boyne and the River Embley, were specifically designed for this task, including a shallow draught for operation within the Great Barrier Reef, and the use of coal fired turbine propulsion, now virtually unique in commercial maritime operations. Two similar ships, which together with the ARCo owned ships were dedicated to the Weipa I Gladstone operation, were recently retired and sold for scrap.


The ARCo Board was restructured in 2007, with two of the three positions being filled with senior executives of the Department of Finance and Deregulation, The Board continued to explore the divestment option for both the company's legal liabilities and the two remaining ships. As a result of this process, the Board has concluded that the retention of the net insurance liabilities within the legal entity of ARCo, and the retention and continued operation of the ships until the end of their economic lives with QAL (expected to be in 2012-13), is the appropriate commercial course for the company. The Board considers this optimises the Commonwealth's financial position and other risks in relation to its ARCo shareholding.


The Government has agreed to an ARCo wind down strategy that involves the sale of the two ore carriers in 2012-13, with the expectation that this will reflect scrap value. This has been the long-standing basis for valuation of the vessels, reflecting the realities of the ships' role and configuration. The administration of the workers' compensation liability will continue for the foreseeable future under the existing insurance arrangements and through the entity of ARCo under Commonwealth ownership.


Following the sale of the ships and the crystallisation of ARCo's financial position, the Government will determine in consultation with the Board, the dividends payable to the Commonwealth and the financial and governance arrangements appropriate for the administration of the insurance settlements process going forward. It is expected that the long standing practice of contracting this role to the private sector under broad ARCo Board supervision will continue. It is also anticipated that the use of the ARCo entity under Commonwealth ownership to manage the insurance settlements would be subject to periodic review having regard to changes in the claims portfolio, the insurance arrangements or the regulatory framework.




Recommendation 5



The committee recommends that the Australian River Company Limited provide a comprehensive description of its principal activities in all future annual reports.




Response



ARCo has taken the committee's recommendations into consideration in preparing its subsequent annual reports, including reporting on the progress made regarding divestment of assets and future management of residual liabilities. The 2010-11 report will include the strategy referred to in the response to Recommendation 4.




Recommendation 6



The committee recommends that the Australian River Company Limited provide the committee with an explanation as to:


what measures were taken to ensure that there was no real or perceived conflict of interest in the appointment of the Secretary; and on the basis upon which the Australian River Company Limited made the decision to pay for the services of a company in which an Australian River Company Limited Director is a shareholder and director.




Response



The ARCo Company Secretary was an employee of ANL Container Lines Pty Ltd (ANLCL). ANLCL was contracted by ARCo to provide management, secretariat and financial reporting services, including administration of the insurance settlements process. At the time the contract was signed, ARCo analysed the different industry sectors in which the two companies operated (bulk carrier transport for ARCo and container transport for ANLCL) and formed the view that the interests of ANLCL and ARCo were not in conflict. As a result, ARCo does not consider that there is any actual or perceived conflict of interest in this arrangement. If such a conflict had emerged the arrangement would have been reviewed.


For commercial reasons only, there has been a change in the contract allocation, with ASP Ship Management Pty Ltd currently providing these services. ARCo is satisfied there is no actual or perceived conflict of interest in this arrangement.


In relation to services purchased by ARCo from a company in which an ARCo Director is a shareholder and director, at the time the decision was made to purchase these services, they were expected to be minor in extent and cost and uncertain in relation to scope and nature. In these circumstances ARCo considered that the interests of the company would best be served by purchasing the services as and when required directly from Acton Corporate Partners Limited (Acton Partners). ARCo considered that this would most likely deliver best value for money for the company. The ARCo director that had an ownership interest in Acton Partners was excluded from all deliberations relating to the engagement.




Recommendation 7



The committee recommends that:


all agencies review the level of detail provided in their annual reports in order to fully comply with the reporting requirements under section 516A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.


agencies, where appropriate, adopt the practice of reporting on environmental impacts and mitigation measures as outlined in the 2006-07 annual reports of the Department of Parliamentary Services and the Department of Health and Ageing.




Response



Departmental annual reports must be prepared in accordance with guidelines approved on behalf of the Parliament by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA).


The 2009 Report of the Independent Review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the Review) recommended that the requirements for section 516A reporting be amended to provide more detail to government agencies regarding the type of information that should be reported and to give the reporting requirements greater force. The government response to the Review agrees to amend the Act to allow the minister to specify the requirements for this reporting in regulations under the amended Act. This will provide further guidance in order to improve the quality of reporting and the community's understanding of Commonwealth actions to contribute to improved sustainability. Consistent with its election commitment, the government will introduce amendments to the Parliament in 2012.


 




Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network





Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network





First Report





Australian Government Response to the Committee's First Report of 31 August 2011





February 2012



INTRODUCTION


In March 2011 the Parliament established the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network (the Committee) to enable the ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of all aspects relating to the rollout of the NBN. The Committee is required to report to the Parliament on the rollout of the NBN on a six monthly basis until the completion of the project.


The Committee has been asked to provide progress reports on:


the rollout of the NBN;


the achievement of take-up targets as set out in NBN Co Limited's (NBN Co) Corporate Plan;


network rollout performance including service levels and faults;


the effectiveness of NBN Co in meeting its obligations as set out in its Stakeholder Charter;


NBN Co's strategy for engaging with consumers and handling complaints;


NBN Co's risk management processes, and


any other matter pertaining to the NBN rollout that the Committee considers relevant.


The Committee's first report was informed by four public hearings held in a number of locations throughout Australia, and public consultation which attracted twenty one submissions and eleven exhibits. As part of the review the Committee also conducted two infrastructure inspections in Broken Hill and Melbourne on 27 and 28 July 2011. On


31 August 2011, the Committee tabled its first report, entitled Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network The report made five recommendations ranging across: future reporting arrangements; government readiness to take advantage of the NBN; the impact of the Definitive Agreement process on timing of the rollout; the expected productivity, jobs and competitive benefits of the NBN; and timeframes for regional and remote rollout and satellite service levels. The Committee has since released its second report on the rollout of the NBN to the Parliament on 24 November 2011, to which the government will provide a separate response.


BACKGROUND


The Australian Government believes that access to affordable, high-speed broadband is increasingly essential to the way Australians communicate and do business. It will help drive productivity, improve education and health service delivery and connect our cities and regional centres.


The Australian Government has established NBN Co to design, build and operate a new high-speed NBN. The NBN will be the single largest infrastructure investment made by an


Australian Government and will be accompanied by historic reforms to the telecommunications sector. The NBN is about more than having a faster internet connection. The productivity gains associated with this investment will mean that the full benefits will continue to flow for decades beyond the completion of the project.


NBN Co's central objectives, as set out by the government are to:


deliver significant improvements in broadband service quality to all Australians


address the lack of high-speed broadband in Australia, particularly outside metropolitan areas, and


reshape the telecommunications sector.


In implementing the government's policy initiative, NBN Co's specific objectives include:


providing access to broadband to 100 per cent of Australian addressable premises


connecting 93 per cent of homes, schools and businesses with a high-speed fibre network capable of providing NBN Co's retail service provider customers with download speeds of up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps)* at the wholesale level. As outlined in the Statement of Expectations, the government expects NBN Co to upgrade the NBN. NBN Co expects future services over the upgraded fibre network to enable wholesale download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) within the fibre footprint


serving all remaining premises by a combination of leading edge fixed-wireless and satellite technologies capable of providing NBN Co's retail service provider customers with peak download speeds of up to 12 Mbps at the wholesale level*


establishing a wholesale-only, open-access network, subject to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) scrutiny, to support the government's objective of structural market reform


offering open and equivalent access to wholesale services via Layer 2 bitstream services, which in time will help enable multi-operator delivery of data, voice and video services


charging retail service provider customers uniform national wholesale pricing within technologies and uniform national entry level pricing across technologies consistent with the government objective of providing uniform national wholesale prices. Where new technologies become available, NBN Co will seek to maintain this principle.


The NBN will be Australia's first national, wholesale-only, open access broadband network offering equivalent terms and conditions to all access seekers. This means NBN Co will roll out the network and sell wholesale services to retail service providers, who will then provide services to end users. This represents a significant structural change in the


telecommunications industry and will support vibrant retail competition. The NBN will be built and operated on a commercial basis, at arm's-length from government, by NBN Co.


AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE


The Australian government has considered the Committee's first report and provides the following response to the recommendations.




Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the NBN Co together with the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, commencing for the first quarter 2011-2012, provide a six-monthly report on the progress of the rollout of the National Broadband Network, using established Key Performance Indicators and performance measures, no later than three months before the committee is due to report to the Parliament.


The government supports this recommendation and submitted its first report to the Committee on 23 September 2011.


The government will submit six-monthly reports to the Committee and adopt this reporting pattern on an ongoing basis. The reports will provide quantitative and qualitative advice outlining NBN Co's key performance information across the following areas:


progress on the rollout


deployment and installation


take up rates


key financial information: profit and loss statement; balance sheet; cash flow statement; and cash flow reconciliation


quality of service including service levels and faults


industry and consumer consultation including complaint handling


issues associated with health, safety and environment.


The information provided to the Committee will become more meaningful as the rollout progresses and more premises are connected and as NBN Co's operating and business systems come online during 2012.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that Government agencies take measures to ensure they are ready for the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN), prior to receiving and working with the NBN for service delivery.


The government supports this recommendation.


The government outlined its vision for the NBN-enabled digital economy in its release of the National Digital Economy Strategy, including the goal that by 2020, four out of five Australians will choose to engage with the government through the internet or other type of online service.


Significant progress is already being made in Australia to expand delivery of government services and programs online. Recently, the government released a draft Strategic Vision for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) that outlines a long term plan for the government's use of ICT to support increased public sector productivity.


The Strategic Vision for ICT and its implementation will include measures to ensure that government agencies are ready for the rollout of the NBN.


In addition to this the government has announced several new initiatives to advance the digital economy goals outlined in the National Digital Economy Strategy. A number of these initiatives relate to government services delivery including:


Whole of Government Service Delivery Reform - the government is undertaking investigation and testing of some preliminary developments to improve people's ease of use and access across government services. The government will examine service delivery reforms that will enable individuals to manage their government transactions and personal information via a single on-line account and provide the basis for a range of new services. It is expected that the NBN will allow greater flexibility and long-term adoption of innovative interactive experiences between the public and government that can be linked to Whole of Government Service Delivery Reforms.


Service Delivery Reform - to ensure government service delivery is modern and flexible, the government has committed to Service Delivery Reform initiatives within the Human Services portfolio that will transform the way people receive services and interact with government. Over time, this work may leverage the NBN through the increased use of real-time interactive customer service tools, including, for example, using the voice-over the Internet protocol (VOIP) and high-definition video conferencing to access services in regional and remote areas of Australia.


Digital Local Government program - to assist local governments to deliver innovative online services - in particular to homes and businesses, the Digital Local Government program will provide funding to local governments in communities that first benefit from the NBN. The program encourages the development of online services that are repeatable and scalable, and that other local governments across Australia can adapt for their purposes.


Telehealth Trials - to support Australia's health system to effectively integrate digital technologies and broadband-delivered services to drive efficiency, improve patient outcomes and temper the rate of growth in hospital and other admissions, the government will conduct two Telehealth trials. One trial will occur in Armidale and Kiama and focus on the delivery of high-quality NBN-enabled telehealth services to older Australians living at home with chronic medical conditions, The other trial will be conducted in Townsville and will deliver high-quality monitoring and video-conferencing services to people suffering type 2 diabetes.


NBN Enabled Telehealth Pilots Program —to support the provision of high quality health care services, particularly aged care, cancer care and palliative care services, utilising NBN-enabled telehealth services to the home. By providing better access to health services to homes within NBN early release sites, this $20.6 million program will investigate and demonstrate opportunities for the extension of telehealth services in the future and the business case for doing so.


NBN Regional Legal Assistance program - to demonstrate the ability of NBN-based collaborative activities to strengthen and improve access to legal assistance services for people living in regional Australia and support professional staff delivering these services.


NBN-Enabled Education and Skills Services program - to support the goal of expanded online education, the four year $27.2 million NBN-enabled education and skills services program will support the development and trialling of innovative online and interactive education and skills services that take advantage of the high-speed broadband connections made available through the NBN, This program will contribute to the development of services that connect teachers and learners to increase access to information and enhance collaboration; to address skills shortages, and improve teaching and learning experiences as well as improving professional development, enhancing community links, and facilitating workplace training to improve workplace productivity. This program is complemented by the work undertaken through the Australian Flexible Learning Framework with $1 million provided to support the development of NBN e-learning programs.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that NBN Co Limited publish a detailed account of impacts on timing and cost of the National Broadband Network as a result of the time taken and resources used to complete the Binding Definitive Agreements between NBN Co and Telstra and NBN Co and Optus, and the decision to increase the number of Points of Interconnect from 14 to 121.


The government notes this recommendation.


The Definitive Agreements between NBN Co and Telstra and NBN Co and Optus are currently being scrutinised by the ACCC and are therefore not yet finalised.


At the time that NBN Co's 2011-2013 Corporate Plan was finalised, there were a number of issues which — due to their complexity — had implications that could not fully be anticipated. These issues included the time needed to finalise the Definitive Agreements, the impact of the government's acceptance of the agreement between NBN Co and the ACCC to have 121 points of interconnect and the suspension of the construction tender process.


While the agreement with Telstra was extremely complex and took longer than first anticipated, the government is confident that these agreements will protect the interests of Australian taxpayers and support the NBN rollout by providing access to existing infrastructure, minimising overhead cabling and reducing the overall costs of the NBN. Further, NBN Co will proactively manage the construction timetable over the life of the project to minimise and overcome any delays.


In line with Commonwealth Government Business Enterprise Governance and Oversight Guidelines (October 20111, NBN Co is required to submit a corporate plan to Shareholder Ministers each year. NBN Co is currently developing its second Corporate Plan 2012-15 which will take into account any impact there may be on the timing and cost of the NBN as a result of agreements with Optus and Telstra and other factors.


Following the finalisation of the agreements the government will consider the


recommendation, but notes that any decision to publish details of the impacts would need to be taken following finalisation of the ACCC consideration and take into account the extent to which the legitimate commercial interests of parties, including Telstra and Optus would be compromised by publication.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the


Digital Economy publish a detailed statement outlining the productivity, jobs and competitive benefits of:


the overall rollout of the National Broadband Network for the cost-efficient provision of basic broadband infrastructure for all Australians;


how competitive markets will operate at the wholesale and retail levels, with particular reference to the impact on small, existing internet service providers and other fibre deployment companies; and


the impact on wholesale and retail competition of the increase of the Points of Interconnect from 14 to 121.


The government supports this recommendation in principle and this Statement outlines those productivity, jobs and competitive benefits of the NBN. It also provides comments on how competitive markets will operate at the wholesale and retail levels, and summarises the impact on competition of the increase of Points of Interconnect from 14 to 121.


The NBN will give 100 per cent of Australian addressable premises access to high-speed* broadband and will provide the enabling infrastructure to support Australia becoming one of the world's leading digital economies by 2020. High-speed* broadband will be available to 93 per cent of Australian homes, school and business premises via fibre to the premises technology; the remaining 7 per cent of premises will be connected via a combination of leading edge fixed-wireless and satellite technologies. This represents a significant step change over broadband speeds currently experienced by users of this technology today.


The establishment of NBN Co to build and operate a National Broadband Network followed a decision by government to terminate the NBN Request for Proposals (RFP) process. The government conducted a robust open competitive process in accordance with the requirements of the RFP [and the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines], which included rigorous analysis and evaluation of proposals, with the aim of selecting a preferred proponent to build and operate the NBN. The decision to terminate followed advice from the panel of experts that none of the national proposals submitted offered value for money for the Commonwealth against the criteria set out in the RFP. The government decided that as the private sector was unable to provide an acceptable solution for Australia's broadband needs, the government would establish NBN Co to build and operate the NBN and provide the infrastructure the economy was demanding.


With the release by NBN Co of its first 12-month construction timetable on 18 October 2011 the NBN is rapidly moving to realise tangible benefits for productivity, jobs and competition:


NBN services are currently available in eight communities


NBN construction is underway in 19 communities


The 12-month plan identified 49 locations, 28 of which were new, covering approximately 485,000 premises across all states and territories where construction is expected to commence before September 2012 — with a further 63 500 premises included for where the rollout is already underway.


To remain competitive in our region as the world moves to a 21st century digital economy, Australia needs to maintain the momentum and make this investment.


The most recent OECD statistics (for June 2011) indicate that Australia is ranked 21st out of 34 countries in terms of its number of fixed broadband subscribers per 100 inhabitants.1


Other OECD statistics indicate that Australians pay more for broadband than most other OECD countries. Regarding average subscription prices (as at September 2010), Australia is:


3rd most expensive for low-speed connections (out of 24 countries),2


14th most expensive for high-speed connections (out of 33 countries),3 and


12th most expensive for very high-speed connections (out of 28 countries).4


These OECD statistics are further evidence that Australia cannot afford not to reform industry structure and infrastructure.


The demand for higher bandwidth will continue to grow. Cisco estimates that Australia's internet traffic will grow six-fold by 2015.5 This is a compound annual growth rate of 41 per cent. Cisco says that:


When coupled with the Government's National Digital Economy Strategy, the results reveal that Australia is on the verge of a substantial evolution in how new jobs, businesses and even new public services will be enabled by a broadband-enabled economy' (News Release - Cisco Visual Networking Index Forecast (2010-2015), 9 August 2011).


The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that fixed line networks carried 93 per cent of the data downloaded over the internet in Australia in June 2011 and fixed line downloads grew by 79.7 per cent over the 12 months between June 2010 and June 2011.6 Our telecommunications systems are increasingly relying on fixed networks to do the heavy lifting in a high growth operating environment.


The UN Broadband Commission Report released on 6 June 2011 states:


'Developing isolated projects or piecemeal, duplicated networks is not only inefficient, it delays provision of infrastructure that is becoming as crucial in the modern world as roads or electricity supplies'7


The Chief Executive of Singapore Telecommunications was reported in The Australian (10 June 2011) as supporting the competitive opportunities arising with the NBN:


'If you look at NBN in Australia, that presents an excellent opportunity for a fixed communications network ...with NBN, which will be an open access network, I think you will be able to see the entire fixed telecommunications industry reshaped and I think you'll see more competition and a lot more innovation, and with that, improved productivity for businesses and added convenience for consumers'.8


Productivity benefits


The NBN is a key nation-building project; it will help drive Australia's productivity in business, education, health, and government service delivery; and improve social inclusion through fast and reliable broadband services to our cities, regional centres and rural communities.


The NBN will play a significant role in enabling new ways of doing business, participating in work, gaining an education and access to services across regional Australia and in our economy as a whole.


In a recent paper 'Business Innovation and the Use of Information and Communications Technology', the Australian Bureau of Statistics has analysed the effects of sophisticated information and communications technology use — which is reliant on reliable high-speed broadband — on business growth and productivity. It has concluded:


'Business innovation is regarded as a key determinant of both individual business success and national economic growth. At the micro level, business innovation has the potential to increase consumer demand through improved product or service quality and simultaneously decrease production costs. At the macro level, strong business innovation can increase multifactor productivity, thus lifting international competitiveness, economic growth and real per capita incomes. It is thus of great interest to businesses and policy makers to identify those factors which stimulate innovation and to understand how these factors interact.


We expect that ICT plays an important role as a source of business innovation because it enables closer communication and collaboration between the business and other organisations, allowing businesses to more quickly exploit opportunities for innovation. It also provides a platform from which businesses can build innovations, and provides significant efficiency gains. We find strong evidence that businesses which use ICT more intensely are more likely to innovate and furthermore, develop more types of innovation and also more novel innovations'.9


The NBN will enable households to access a range of online services and participate in a range of activities simultaneously. Evidence shows that households are continuing to increase the amount of data that they consume, with the recent Australian Bureau of Statistics Internet Activity Survey as at 30 June 201110 showing there is strong and growing demand from Australians for broadband services. Evidence for this includes:


Australians are quick to take up technology, with access for household and business internet connections increasing an estimated 80 per cent over 2007 -2010, and use of the Internet by households, business, and government more than doubling over the same period,11


Australians continue to embrace the digital economy with the increasing adoption of social media. During June 2011, approximately 8.6 million Australians accessed social networking and user-generated content sites from home, this compares to under 8 million during June 2010,12


Australia has demonstrated a high level of broadband adoption by businesses compared to the OECD average; with 90 per cent of businesses with 10 or more employees having a broadband connection in 2007 (OECD 20 I0),13


79 per cent of Australian households now have access to the internet at home — with almost all of them — 6.2 million households (73 per cent), representing almost three quarters of all Australian households — having access to broadband at home. This is an increase of over one million households with broadband from the situation in 2008-09,14


the phasing out of dial-up Internet connections, with 95 per cent of internet connections now being broadband,15


Australians continuing to access increasingly fast download speeds, with 87 per cent of access connections advertising download speeds of 1.5 megabits per second or greater,16


the number of internet subscriptions at speeds less than 1.5 Mbps has consistently decreased between September 2006 and June 2011,17 and


increases in the domestic market mirror global trends in international demand growth, Global IP traffic having increased eightfold over the past five years.18


The NBN will also provide opportunities and incentives for businesses to innovate in the way they provide goods and services to consumers, advertise, collaborate with business partners, and interact with customers more broadly.


As noted in the NBN Implementation Study, for Australia's small businesses (SMEs) in particular, 'fibre connectivity is a productivity enabler'.19 On 8 November 2011 NBN Co announced that 'as Australia's two million small businesses look at alternative ways to reach new markets, boost their efficiency, and cut costs ... NBN Co intends to offer telcos and internet service providers new high-speed* wholesale broadband services which telcos and internet service providers can tailor to the specific needs of the Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) and small business market' (News Release — NBN Co to offer new services to ISPs tailored to small business, 8 November 2011).


SMEs will be particular beneficiaries of the NBN as they are currently unable to access the high-speed fibre connections available to large businesses located in Central Business Districts. SMEs will benefit from both themselves being connected to high-speed broadband as well as their Australian customers being connected to high-speed broadband.


A McKinsey Global Institute survey of SMEs in 12 countries20 found that:


SMEs utilising web technologies grew more than twice as fast as those with a minimal presence.


On average the internet enabled a 10 per cent increase in profitability. The impact came half from increased revenues, and half from lower costs of goods sold and lower administrative costs.


The NBN will make it easier for some businesses to compete nationally, particularly in relation to projects that they would not normally compete for because it was previously geographically impractical. Increased competition is likely to deliver lower prices and other benefits to consumers.


High-speed broadband has the potential to remove barriers to online transactions and encourage more businesses and consumers to participate in online retail. A 2010 Access Economics report found that about 23 per cent of dissatisfied, and 18 per cent of dissuaded, online shoppers cite lack of speed as a factor in their dissatisfaction or failure to complete a transaction.21 Online retail can boost efficiencies for businesses and allow consumers to buy quality products at more affordable prices.


The NBN can also provide Australian businesses with opportunities to expand into new export markets. Businesses can set up high quality websites that act as a salesperson accepting orders and enquiries 24/7. Businesses that work with graphics, videos, animation and other digital media, which have large file sizes, can upload and send these products to their clients faster and more reliably, while businesses can also reduce IT costs by utilising emerging cloud computing technologies. These technologies will also encourage greater remote collaboration between businesses. The government has announced the following new initiative to support Australian businesses in maximising the benefits of the NBN:


Digital Enterprise program — to enable more Australian businesses and not-for-profit organisations in communities which will first benefit from the NBN, particularly those located in non-metropolitan areas, to leverage the benefits of broadband-empowered online engagement. This initiative will assist these organisations to achieve cost savings, productivity enhancements and improved marketing through greater online engagement.


The government has also set the digital economy goal that by 2020, Australia will rank in the top five OECD countries in the portion of households that connect to broadband at home. This will deliver positive benefits for Australian families and communities in the form of improved access to business and job opportunities, health, education and government services. To help reach this goal the government has announced the following new initiative:


Digital Hubs program — to help more Australian households get online and to narrow the gap between Australian households and businesses in capital cities and those in regional, rural and remote Australia. Through Digital Hubs being provided in communities which will first benefit from the NBN, local residents will be able to experience the NBN and receive training to develop the digital skills necessary to participate safely and securely and have trust and confidence in the digital economy.


Evidence confirms investment in high-speed broadband delivers productivity gains. For example, The Economic Journal provides an estimate of the effect of broadband infrastructure on economic growth in the panel of OECD countries in 1996-2007, suggesting '...that a 10 percentage point increase in broadband penetration raised annual per capita growth by 0.9-1.5 percentage points'.22


As superfast broadband penetration and use increases, and more innovative online services are developed by government agencies and the private sector, people in regional Australia will have more opportunities to access first class services delivered online to their own homes. In time, regional Australians will be accessing education, health and consumer services and employment opportunities that were previously only available to those in larger centres. The NBN will deliver economic benefits to rural and regional Australia through greater employment opportunities and better access to information and services. A 2010 Allen Consulting report found that on average a 10 per cent increase in internet connectivity increased regional output by 0.53 per cent. This is significantly greater than the 0.38 per cent increase for metropolitan areas. 23


The ubiquity of the NBN will allow addressable household and business premises in regional Australia to have access to high-speed* broadband services provided by retail service providers who can acquire wholesale services from NBN Co at a uniform national wholesale price. NBN Co proposes to deliver speeds on fibre of up to 1000 Mbps*.downstream and 400 Mbps* upstream.24 In a regional sense, NBN Co has brought forward the introduction of wireless and satellite services so that regional and rural Australia can get access to better broadband as soon as possible.


Teleworking


By establishing the NBN the government will transform the way Australians work. The NBN has the potential to widen the pool of skills and talent available to all employees by making teleworking a viable option. Proximity to a physical workplace will be less important. Access Economics has found that if 10 per cent of Australian employees were to telework 50 per cent of the time, the total annual gains from teleworking would be $1.4-$1.9 billion a year.25


Online education and training


The NBN fibre network will change the way our education system accesses information, collaborates and communicates, in addition to improving connections to the household for students to engage with learning institutions. Experts, academics and industry leaders are endorsing the NBN as a driver for improved learning which in turn will result in productivity benefits. For example, the Australian Information and Communications Technology in Education Committee views access to affordable high-speed broadband as essential to realising the transform­ative potential of ICT in education and training and hence to advancing Council of Australian Governments' wider productivity agenda.26


Overseas experience is showing that online education can produce better results than traditional learning. Carnegie Mellon University's Open Learning model, for example, is resulting in as much as a 50 per cent reduction in the time it takes to learn a subject, with course completion rates twice as high.27 Cornell University has established eCornell offering a wide ranging curriculum authored by an Ivy League faculty. This is just the start of an online global tertiary studies market.


A British schools study found students with broadband access in their classroom achieved better results in national tests than those without. Further to this 86 per cent of teachers believed pupils were more motivated and attentive when computers and the internet were used in class.28


This was confirmed anecdotally by Patrick Bakes, Principal of Tasmania's Circular Head Christian School in Sinithton, the first school connected to the NBN. He said, 'We are finding that students are engaged, they can move from one task to another much more quickly, and they can access a range of media when they are researching...' 29


These benefits also apply to work-based training. The greater bandwidth capacity offered by the NBN will allow businesses to up-skill workers through participating in webinars and online forums or by watching online videos or utilising interactive or immersive technologies. Workers can engage in online learning to access specialised courses being run in different locations without the need of the financial and time cost to businesses of travel.


Online training programs can also offer unemployed jobseekers the opportunity to develop the skills and knowledge that will help them get back into the workforce faster.


Health services


The NBN will support health reform and has the potential to raise productivity in the health sector through more timely diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients. Video conferencing technologies will mean that specialist doctors can assess patients in regional and rural locations without the need for time-consuming travel. Remote diagnosis and home-care may also reduce the need for people to travel to hospitals. Higher bandwidth will allow reliable, faster transfer of high definition images and videos, which will enable clinicians to collaborate and consult on diagnosis and care for their patients. Reliable and ubiquitous broadband will also facilitate better access to the personally controlled electronic health record system. eHealth and telehealth, supported by access to fast, reliable broadband, are key enablers of health reform, and essential in addressing the increasing burden of an ageing population and rising levels of chronic disease in the Australian health system.


The NBN rollout has already sparked the development of new applications in the delivery of health services. Trials are underway in a number of areas to first benefit from the NBN and include the monitoring and in-home treatment of various ailments. For example, an Australian-developed health solution that can be delivered over the NBN was showcased at the 29 July 2011 launch of the Kiama first release site. Developed by Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), the application is delivered via broadband to the home and has the potential to help decrease the incidence of injury among the elderly caused by falls. The 1 September 2011 launch of the Townsville first release site also showcased ways that the NBN will provide the connectivity to allow telehealth to become part of the primary healthcare system between a patient at home and their GP in profiling an application to assist people living with diabetes.


Government services


The NBN also offers significant opportunities to increase productivity and reduce costs for the delivery of government services. PricewaterhouseCoopers has found the average cost of an online transaction in the UK was £0.08 (about $A0.12), compared to £10.53 (about $A16) for face-to-face transactions, £3.39 (about $A5.15) for telephone engagement and £12.10 ($A 18.40) for engagement by mail.30


Video conferencing and telepresence can be used in meetings and stakeholder consultation, reducing the need for travel. Shared platforms through cloud computing could enhance the quality, timeliness and variety of government services available, as well as reducing the time and cost of government agencies developing their own platforms. Faster, more reliable broadband will also help speed up the resolution of government enquiries and transactions.


Jobs benefits


The NBN is the national infrastructure project that will form the basis of Australia's prosperity in the information economy. The government established NBN Co Limited to design, build and operate the nation's new high-speed* National Broadband Network, a process that will create jobs in upstream industries as new applications are developed to utilise the network, as well as create new jobs in related sectors supplying to NBN Co and its subcontractors in the construction, manufacturing, 1T and telecommunications industries.


NBN Co projects that between 16 000 and 18 000 construction jobs alone will be created at the peak of the rollout. At 30 September 2011, NBN Co employed 1170 people. This number is likely to grow to 2000 direct employees over the life of the rollout.


On 20 December 2010, the government publicly released its Statement of Expectations to NBN Co. The document highlighted the govern­ment's expectation that NBN Co will actively promote opportunities for small and medium enterprises to participate fully in this project in meaningful and continuing ways. In support of this, NBN Co is working with the Industry Capability Network—a government funded web portal set up to put builders of major projects and buyers of industry goods and services in touch with potential suppliers—to help regional businesses find contracts within the project.


Australian companies have already been contracted to assist with the rollout of the NBN. On 17 January 201 I, NBN Co awarded three equipment contracts worth over $1.6 billion to Australian located companies to supply passive network infrastructure to build the NBN during the next five years. On 15 November 2011, NBN Co announced contracts worth up to $635 million over the next five years to six companies operating in Australia to provide an array of equipment for installation in homes and businesses as part of an NBN connection. Corning Cable Systems, which was awarded an equipment contract with NBN Co, is also expected to add 300 to 400 new staff over the next couple of years as a result of its NBN deal.


NBN Co has also recently entered into a number of significant construction agreements which pave the way for the large scale deployment of NBN optic fibre. For example:


in June 2011 NBN Co entered into a ten-year contract with Ericsson (which already has a large Australian presence) worth up to $1.1 billion to design, build and operate a 4G fixed-wireless network to serve premises outside the fibre footprint in regional and rural Australia


in June 2011, NBN Co signed construction contracts with Silcar to begin rolling out the NBN in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT


in September 201 I, NBN Co announced agreements with Transfield Services for the rollout of the NBN in Victoria, and Syntheo (a Lend Lease/Service Stream joint venture) for work in Western Australia


in November 2011, NBN Co signed construction contracts with Syntheo to begin rolling out the NBN in South Australia and the Northern Territory.


The process adopted by NBN Co to engage multiple contractors and civil works vendors in a project of this scale, 'help[s] create competitive tension between suppliers to drive productivity improvements and bring costs down'.31


The rollout of the NBN will also provide opportunities for upstream industries, for example, the NBN has stimulated job growth in the research and development sector. The Institute for a Broadband Enabled Society, a cross-disciplinary research institute dedicated to products, services, and innovations that maximise the benefit of new broadband technologies to Australian society, was established in 2009 in the wake of the NBN announcement.


This institute grants PhD scholarships and employs researchers such that in 2010-11, 169 Melbourne University researchers and 46 external collaborators contributed to the Institute's research.


The government is also committed to ensuring there is a well trained and accredited workforce for Australia's largest infrastructure project. The Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) is working with the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE) and industry stakeholders including NBN Co to identify the employment opportunities for job seekers associated with the NBN rollout,


DEEWR will support NBN Co to bring together Second Release Site Principal Contrac­tors, State Government and Common­wealth representatives, including Local Employ­ment Coordinators and Regional Education, Skills and Jobs Coordinators, to develop a coordinated state and regional approach to working together. This will ensure that employment and training oppor­tunities created by the NBN rollout are identified and can be maximised for job seekers and existing workers.


In addition, in support of the Definitive Agreements between Telstra and NBN Co, the government has entered into an agreement with Telstra to provide funding of $100 million to assist it in the retraining and redeployment of Telstra staff affected by reforms to the structure of the telecommunications industry, including to enable their transition to employment in deploying and supporting a fibre network.


The funding will ensure that Telstra's workforce, including technicians and engineers, is appropriately skilled. This will contribute to the level of skilled and experienced workers available for the rollout of the NBN.


Under the Retraining Deed, Telstra will give priority to retraining staff who currently work on the copper and hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) networks and staff whose roles are linked to supporting the copper and HFC networks, including the wholesale copper workforce and the direct field support workforce. Telstra will give priority to retraining these employees in NBN related technical, process and system activities.


The rollout of the NBN will also assist in developing new and wider workforce oppor­tunities in regional areas in the sectors of health and education, and with the greater use of new online markets. In the health sector, the growth of the digital economy is providing new opportun­ities to train world class doctors for regional Australia. The University of New England's (UNE) partnership with University of California's Irvine School of Medicine will connect health care professionals in regional areas with world class medical teaching institutions via broadband to share teaching resources and share simulation facilities.32 Fast broadband enables high-speed data exchange, meaning health care students will now have access to resources that would otherwise be impossible to access in regional Australia.33


Competition benefits


One of the government's key policy objectives in establishing the NBN is to address the -structural problems in the Australian telecom­munications industry which have hindered the development of effective competition and better outcomes for consumers.


By establishing the NBN as an open access platform and providing uniform national wholesale pricing the government has enabled the telecommunications sector to provide more competitive and innovative services to Australian consumers. The structural separation of Telstra's copper customer network and its HFC network will be achieved through Telstra's Structural Separation Undertaking and Migration Plan (subject to approval by the ACCC) and the progressive migration of customer services to the NBN. As Graeme Samuel, then ACCC Chairman, confirmed in a speech delivered in April 2011, 'this provides the opportunity to remedy the errors of the past, reshape the industry and ensure that the underlying structural foundations encourage investment and competition as we transition to the NBN'.34


As a result, Australia will have a wholesale-only fibre network that will connect homes and businesses across the country. This network will not be controlled by any retail company. The resulting separation between the network provider and retail providers will mean better and fairer access for service providers, regardless of size, and greater retail competition and better services for consumers and businesses.


To ensure that there is robust retail competition, the NBN is subject to company-specific legislation to ensure it operates now and into the future on an open-access, non-discriminatory and wholesale only basis and that it is subject to close scrutiny by the ACCC. As Graeme Samuel said As we transition to the NBN the framework is now in place to make a major break from the past and remove underlying struct­ural impediments to investment and competition development in the telecommunications industry. The structural separation of Telstra and NBN Co being a wholesale only provider could go a long way towards delivering the more competitive telecommunications sector that was envisaged when the industry was first opened up to competition'.35


The competitive benefits of the NBN are emerging. As Australia's first national, wholesale-only, open access fixed-line network, the NBN will provide a platform for more vigorous competition between retail service providers, leading to better and more choice for consumers and businesses. Australia's prices are currently high by international standards.36 Strong retail competition will put downward pressure on prices.


On 30 November 2011, following extensive consultation with industry, NBN Co released an executable version of its Wholesale Broadband Agreement (WBA). As of December 2011, Aardvark Internet, AARNet, Ace Internet Ser­vices, Adam Internet, Club Telco, Eftel, Engin, EscapeNet, Exetel, iiNet, Internode, Internet Solutions, iPrimus, mVoice, North Queensland Telecom, NuSkope, Optus, Redback Communi­cations, Rivertel, SkyMesh, Telstra and Westnet were listed on NBN Co's website37 as active certified service providers in first release sites and new developments. Many of these certified service providers have signed or are now signing NBN Co's WBA.


Retail service providers have publicised attractive pricing packages for the NBN-based services, including those announced by Exetel, Internode, iiNet, iPrimus and Optus. These prices compare very favourably with prices in the market for similar products particularly noting that NBN-based services do not require payment of additional line rental fees, offer superior performance with the option to upgrade to faster speeds not available over the copper network and that some providers include access to telephony at no extra cost or for a small additional fee that typically includes phone calls.


Such pricing includes, for example:


Exetel, offering a basic 12/1 Mbps* plan with a 20 Gigabit (GB) data limit for $35.00 per month, which includes access to a VoIP telephone service. Exetel's top-of-the-range plan with 100/40 Mbps* speed with a 150 GB limit costs $60.00 per month.38


Australia's second biggest DSL provider39, iiNet, has a range of offers from a basic 12/1 Mbps* plan with a 40 GB (20GB peak + 20GB off-peak) data limit for $49.95 per month up to a high end 100/40 Mbps* plan with 1,000 GB (500GB peak + 500GB off-peak) data limit for $99.95 — all plans can be upgraded to include a VoIP service for an additional $9.95 per month, which includes all local and national calls40; and


Optus is offering a range of packages including a basic 12/1 Mbps* plan with a 40 GB (20GB peak + 20GB off-peak) data limit for $39.99 per month when bundled with a $19 per month mobile phone plan — Optus also offers 12/1 Mbps* plan with a 120 GB (50GB peak + 70GB off-peak)' data limit and home phone, including $30 worth of calls, for $64.94 per month.41


On 18 October 2011, WhistleOut42, a comparison website, released its analysis of NBN-based prices versus ADSL2+ prices. This analysis concluded that users could pay up to 43 per cent less for a broadband service deployed over the NBN than what they pay today for an ADSL2+ service in the 200 GB to 1000 GB per month data allowance range. We are seeing evidence that the NBN is welcomed with NBN Co expecting the majority (52 per cent) of residential consumers who sign up to broadband plans in the 2012 financial year to take up retail services based on NBN Co's entry-level wholesale 12/1* Mbps service.43


The government's objective is that the NBN will provide access to high-speed*, affordable broadband for all Australians. The NBN has the potential to advance competition in the telecom­munications sector by creating a wholesale-only high-speed broadband network that all providers may access on equal terms.


A strong wholesale aggregator market is already emerging to take advantage of the NBN. Nextgen Networks and ISPone are already offering services, and companies such as AAPT, Platform Networks, Optus and Telstra are expecting to offer services. These intermediary wholesale providers are developing products for retail service providers, particularly smaller providers, by integrating products and reducing costs through aggregating services.


In June 2011 Nextgen Networks announced44 its NBN Connect product, which offers wholesale Virtual ISP Service to small and medium consumer and business service providers. Nextgen Networks also expects its service will be used by larger service providers, particularly in the early rollout stages of the NBN.


On 5 December 2011, NBN Co submitted a special access undertaking (SAU) to the ACCC. Within this document, NBN Co has proposed a regulatory framework for it to establish the price and non-price conditions required for its investors to recover rollout costs. The document also provides details of the ACCC's oversight role. The ACCC has initiated a public consultation process and will consider whether or not to accept NBN Co's SAU.


Operating as a wholesale-only provider, NBN Co will solve the current structural issues in the telecommunications sector where one provider owns the only ubiquitous fixed-line network in Australia and competes against its wholesale customers in downstream retail markets.


Maintaining a clear distinction between the separate roles of the NBN and service providers will deliver better and fairer access for service providers, greater retail competition and better services for consumers and businesses.


Points of Interconnect


The government is determined to create an NBN that promotes competition, optimises NBN Co's network design, gives opportunities for smaller providers and delivers sustainable uniform wholesale pricing for the benefit of users in regional, rural and remote Australia. NBN Co and the ACCC have a role in promoting sustain­able competition, and have demonstrated this with advice in relation to where to locate and the number of Points of Interconnect (POIs). In considering this network structure issue and the ACCC's analysis, the government was seeking to optimise retail and infrastructure based competi­tion and to ensure national uniform wholesale pricing could be delivered.


POIs are locations where traffic is exchanged between one network and another. The number and placement of POIs is important in determining the cost structure of competing access seekers or retail services providers.


In 2010, the government requested the ACCC and NBN Co to undertake a process, including public consultation, on the number and location of initial POIs for the NBN that would best meet the long-term interests of end-users. In response, the ACCC advised the government that the semi-distributed model of approximately 121 POIs would best promote retail and wholesale competition across all geographic markets.


The ACCC concluded the semi-distributed model will result in:


'POIs being established in all locations where transmission services are workably competitive and it is technically and operationally feasible',45 and


'the most efficient use of existing infrastructure and will minimise the amount of stranding of competitive transmission assets that will occur through the transition from copper to fibre'.46


In supporting the semi-distributed model, recommended by the ACCC, the government was seeking a balance between:


NBN Co optimising its network design and technical operation with a view to reducing its costs and maximising its ability to deliver uniform national wholesale pricing; and


minimising the disruption to existing investment in competitive backhaul and thereby leveraging competition in the supply of such backhaul to put downward pressure on backhaul prices and, by keeping backhaul prices relatively low (and thus a small proposition of overall costs), supporting uniform national retail pricing overall.


The semi-distributed POI model enables small providers to service a discrete area using a limited number of POIs. For example, each POI will service around 80 000 to 100 000 premises. Pro­viders wanting to deliver direct services nation­ally will need to interconnect with all POIs. Smaller broadband providers not wanting to inter­connect with all POIs can use a wholesale aggre­gator to provide services over a wider area of the NBN. There is already a strong wholesale aggre­gator market emerging providing backhaul and other services to small providers who wish to compete on a wider scale. For example, as NBN Co announced on 1 September 2011, Townsville-based service providers Internet Solutions and North Queensland Telecom have started connect­ing some of their customers to the NBN via NBN Co customer and wholesaler Nextgen Networks.47 This illustrates the potential competitive benefits to the telecommunications sector of having an open access network like the NBN.


A number of service providers have signed up to the NBN trial to offer ready-made services to smaller retail service providers for them to resell to consumers and businesses. This means that small, or even some larger service providers, have the potential to enter parts of the telecom­munications market with a reduced requirement to invest in their own infrastructure to interconnect with the NBN. Such flexibility has the potential to support a range of wholesale and retail business models and is expected to facilitate lower barriers to entry for service providers and to open tip competition — both in major centres and in regional areas like North Queensland. This flexibility will in turn support the critical role of the fixed network in meeting growth in demand for data transmission.


The government has set itself a goal of making Australia one of the world's leading digital economies by 2020. This goal will be achieved by the productivity, jobs and competitive benefits delivered by the NBN. In 2020 Australia will rank in the top five OECD countries in terms of businesses and not-for-profit organisations using high-speed broadband to drive efficiency and pro­ductivity improvements; expand their customer base and enable growth. The NBN will provide equitable outcomes for Australians in regional, rural and remote Australia and improve access to business and job opportunities, health services, education, social and government services.


Recommendation 5


The Committee recommends that NBN Co:


publish timeframes for the rollout of National Broadband Network (NBN) services to regional and remote areas and communicate these to the areas to which they apply;


investigate the impact of the transition to the NBN on currently available levels of service for satellite technology; and


taking into consideration findings of this investigation, formulate contingency plans against potential reduction of capacity in regional and remote areas as a consequence of the NBN rollout, if required.


The government supports these recommenda­tions in principle. Rollout Timeframes


On 18 October 2011, NBN Co released its first 12-month national construction rollout plan. The schedule lists the communities in each state and territory where work on the fibre network will begin before September 2012. This marks the end of the NBN trial phase and the beginning of the volume rollout to Australian premises.


In the year to September 2012 NBN Co will have started construction on a high-speed* fibre network to nearly half a million Australian premises.


The schedule includes 28 newly-released sites across the country as well as locations containing over 63 000 premises where work is currently underway, including second release sites, such as Geraldton, Western Australia and extensions of first release sites such as Townsville, Queensland. The time taken from start of construction to services being available is about 12 months. The schedule will be updated each quarter to include new locations.


The 12-month national rollout plan and more detailed information is available at www.nbnco.com.autour-network/rollout-planittmI


In the first quarter of 2012 NBN Co will also issue its first three-year indicative schedule of the rollout, which will be updated annually until the rollout is complete.


Service levels supported over NBN Co's long term satellite service


NBN Co's leading edge satellite services will represent a step change, both in terms of speed and reliability, compared with existing satellite services.


The services will be significantly better for the 3 per cent of Australians in remote areas receiving services from the satellite broadband network. Applications that are utilised by satellite users today, such as the NT School of the Air will be supported over the long term satellite service that will offer vastly improved services to residential and small business users and commercial grade services.


Residential and small business grade satellite services are currently typically provisioned at 10 kilobits per second (Kbps) average busy hour throughput.


NBN Co's interim satellite service is offering NBN Co's retail service provider customers broadband speeds of up to 6 Mbps downlink and 1 Mbps uplink speed* and 30 Kbps average busy hour throughput at the wholesale level.


The interim satellite service has been well received with many end users providing positive feedback on the standard of equipment and the quality of service received from NBN Co. One Whirlpool user commented that 'As anticipated, the NBN first release satellite service has been an absolute model of reliability and consistency'.


For the long term satellite service, designed to offer NBN Co's retail service provider customers broadband speeds of up to 12 Mbps downlink and I Mbps uplink* at the wholesale level, NBN Co anticipates that the service will support average busy hour throughput speeds of 300 Kbps at the wholesale level.


The new satellites will have multiple focused high-capacity beams that maximise spectral usage. NBN Co will also use the next generation of ground equipment and acceleration techniques to maximise performance.


NBN Co has also recently provided more detail about the capabilities of the long-term satellite service in relation to e-health services which demonstrates just what a step-change in experience its long term satellite service will offer to end users.48 For example, it will be able to support content streaming and applications such as delivering training videos for remote health certification.


NBN Co's long term satellite product roadmap will include various features such as increased capacity and return path speeds that are designed to support large file transfers and real time video communications.


Over time, it is expected that further services will be supported as NBN Co upgrades its networks and through other technological improvements. There is no expected reduction in capacity in regional areas as a result of the NBN rollout, but rather an expectation of significant improvement in capacity. It is unlikely that current commercial services will be withdrawn in advance of the rollout because demand for these services is expected to'only


increase as regional and rural Australians use of broadband technologies increases.49 These communities will be able to take advantage of the increased capabilities offered by the long term satellite service.


* NBN Co is designing the NBN to be capable of delivering these speeds to NBN Co's wholesale customers (RSPB). Speeds actually achieved by retail customers (end users) will depend on a number of factors including the quality of their equipment and in-premises connection, the broadband plans offered by their RSP and how their RSP designs its network to cater for multiple end users.

Senate Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee Inquiry Report on the Airports Amendment Bill 2010




Introduction



On 30 September 2010, the Airports Amendment Bill 2010 was referred for inquiry to the Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee (the Committee) on the recommendation of the Senate Selection of Bills Committee.


On 18 November 2010 the Committee deliv­ered its report on the Bill and made two formal recommendations on the Bill. These two recom­mendations covered the development of guide­lines covering the preparation of airport master plans and the Committee's concurrence, noting some minor technical amendments, to the passage of the Bill.


Coalition senators also made three additional recommendations on the Bill covering the pro­posed establishment of additional guidelines and in relation to registration of these guidelines on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments.


The Government provided initial advice to the Committee on these recommendations on 23 June 2011 pending the completion of consultation with key stakeholders on the preparation of the proposed guidelines.


The Government's final response to each of the recommendations in the report is now outlined below.




Formal Recommendations 





Recommendation 1



The Committee recommends the Department of Infrastructure and Transport develop guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders to clarify the level of detail and analysis to be included in airport master plans in order to satisfy the requirements set out in paragraph 71(2)(h) and 71(3)(h) of the Airports Amendment Bill 2010.




Response



The Government accepts this recommendation.


Master Plan Amendment Guidelines were approved by the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, in January 2012, following consultation with key stakeholders.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that, subject to the amendments foreshadowed by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport in correspondence to the Committee dated 15 November 2010, the Bill be passed.




Response



The Government supports this recom­mendation and the Airports Amendment Act 2010 received Royal Assent on 17 December 2010.




Additional Recommendations





Additional Recommendation 1



Coalition Senators recommend that the Depart­ment of Infrastructure and Transport develop guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders to clarify the level of detail and analysis to be included in airport master plans in order to satisfy the requirements set out in paragraph 71(2)(h) and 71(3)(h) of the Airports Amendment Bill 2010. For the avoidance of doubt, such guidelines should be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and subject to the tabling and disallowance requirements of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.




Response



As indicated in the response to Recommen­dation 1, the Government supports and has imple­mented the recommendation to develop these guidelines.


However the Department of Infrastructure and Transport's legal advice confirms the guidelines are not legislative instruments for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and there­fore, registering the guidelines on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments is not consid­ered appropriate. 


The Department will publish the guidelines on its website. 




Additional Recommendation 2



Coalition Senators recommend that the Depart­ment of Infrastructure and Transport develop guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders to clarify the range of developments that may be considered to be of a kind that is likely to have a significant impact on the local or regional com­munity for the purposes of paragraph 89(1)(n) of the Airports Amendment Bill 2010. For the avoidance of doubt, such guidelines should be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and subject to the tabling and disallowance requirements of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.




Response



The Government accepts the recommendation to develop guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders.


Significant Impact on the Local or Regional Community Guidelines were approved by the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, in January 2012, following consultation with industry stakeholders.


As outlined in the response to Additional Recommendation 1, the guidelines will not be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments but will be made available on the Department's website.




Additional Recommendation 3



Coalition Senators recommend that the Department of Infrastructure and Transport develop guidelines in consultation with key stake­holders to clarify the structure, composition, agenda and reporting requirements of Community Aviation Consultation Groups and of Planning Coordination Forums. For the avoidance of doubt, such guidelines should be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and subject to the tabling and disallowance require­ments of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.




Response



The Government accepts the recommendation to develop these guidelines in consultation with key stakeholders.


Community Aviation Consultation Group and Planning Coordination Forum Guidelines were approved by the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, in February 2011.


As outlined in the response to Additional Recommendation 1 the guidelines will not be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments but have been promulgated widely and are available on the Department's website.


 




Australian Government Response to Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee 
Inquiry into Rural and Regional Access to Secondary and Tertiary Education Opportunities
.





Introduction



The Australian Government notes the findings of the Senate Inquiry into Rural and Regional Access to Secondary and Tertiary Education Opportunities. The Australian Government has demonstrated a commitment to improving educational access and opportunities for students and their families who experience geographical disadvantage, through specific initiatives and its broader social inclusion agenda. The Australian Government's vision of a socially inclusive society is one in which all Australians feel valued and have the opportunity to participate fully in the life of our society.


The importance of this issue is highlighted by the large number of submissions to the Inquiry (over 750), including one by the Australian Government Department of Education, Employ­ment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR). As outlined in the DEEWR submission, ""rural and regional students and their families are recognised and targeted by the Australian Government, and State and Territory education authorities, as a group who have special educational needs and may not be adequately assisted through general education assistance"". DEEWR's submission discussed Australian Government initiatives that cater for this need. The Committee's report comprised a majority report along with a minority dissenting report by Government Senators. The Government is disappointed that the elements of the minority report appear largely not reflected in the majority report.


The Australian Government believes that every student should have access to a world-class education no matter where they live. In the Commitment to Regional Australia (the Commitment), agreed with the Independent Members Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor on 7 September 2010, the Australian Government renewed its commitment to regional education by strengthening national policies to ensure that they effectively meet the needs of students across the country. 


The Commitment identifies specific new education and skills commitments and builds on work already underway by the Australian Government. In September 2010, the Office of Regional Education, Skills and Jobs was established, to better drive and coordinate DEEWR's efforts for regional Australia, including those initiatives detailed in the Commitment to Regional Australia. These initiatives have been included below relevant to the specific recommendations.




Response to Recommendations





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the Australian Government commission an investi­gation into the barriers to rural and regional secondary educational opportunities with a view to developing a long-term strategy to address the inequity in secondary educational opportunities in rural and regional Australia. 



Response: Supported, initiatives already in place. As outlined in the Government Senators Dissenting Report, the Australian Government has been proactive in addressing barriers faced by students from rural and regional areas in accessing secondary and tertiary education opportunities. 


For example, legislation under the auspices of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support for Students) Act 2009 that was passed by the Parliament on 18 March 2010 mean significant improvements for many students and their families living in rural and regional areas in accessing education and training opportunities. 


In particular, to assist young people disadvantaged by the geographic location of their home from educational institutions, students living in Outer Regional Australia, Remote Australia, or Very Remote Australia who are required to live away from home to study, are able to access the second and third elements of the former workforce participation criterion. The workforce participation criterion comprise: full-time employment averaging 30 hours or more per week for at least 18 months over a two year period; worked part-time (at least 15 hours each week) for two years since last leaving secondary school; or had cumulative earnings totalling at least 75% of Wage Level A of the National Training Wage schedule included in a modern award ($21,009 in 2011) in 18 months since last leaving secondary school.


From 1 January 2011, these young people have been able to qualify for payment by meeting any of the three elements of the workforce participation criterion for independence, provided their parents' income is less than $150 000 per annum (in the case of the second and third elements). With the Review of Student Income Support Reforms now complete, the Australian Government introduced the Social Security Amendment (Student Income Support Reforms) Bill 2011 on 21 September 2011 to further extend this provision to students living in Inner Regional areas who are required to live away from home to study from 1 January 2012.


The DEEWR submission outlined several Australian Government programs in place that directly assist students living in rural and regional Australia and their families. This is also in the context of the Government's initiatives under the COAG productivity agenda in relation to school retention and increasing the skills base of those entering the workforce. Along with existing assistance, these initiatives already form part of the Australian Government's long-term strategy in this area.




Recommendation 2 



In developing a long-term strategy to address the inequity in secondary education opportunities in rural and regional Australia, the committee recommends that consideration should be given to strategies for ensuring that literacy and numeracy programs, once introduced into schools, are able to be maintained within those schools. 



Response: Supported, initiatives already in place. The Government Senators Dissenting Report notes the Australian Government has made available funding of $540 million through the Smarter Schools – National Partnership Agreement on Literacy and Numeracy. 


The National Partnership supports states and territories to implement evidence-based practices that will deliver sustained improvement in literacy and numeracy outcomes for all students, especially those who are most in need of support. States and territories, in collaboration with non-government education authorities identified the schools and students to be targeted under this National Partnership. The funding support and reform initiatives to be implemented were negotiated with each participating school. 


This National Partnership focuses on the key areas of teaching literacy and numeracy, stronger school leadership and the effective use of student performance information to identify where students need support. This will lead to improvements in literacy and numeracy outcomes for all students, with a priority focus on those primary aged students most in need of support. 


Of the schools participating in this National Partnership, approximately 430 (48 per cent) are located in regional Australia. Under this National Partnership, each Partnership school has identified their priorities and developed an implementation plan tailored to the needs of students at that school. 




Recommendation 3 



The committee recommends that as part of the investigation into the barriers to rural and regional secondary educational opportunities with a view to developing a long-term strategy to address the inequity in secondary educational opportunities in rural and regional Australia, consideration should be given to whether the current level of funding under the AIC Scheme is appropriate. 



Response: Not Supported. The Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme helps isolated families of primary, secondary and certain tertiary students with additional educational costs because they are unable to attend an appropriate government school on a daily basis. 


The AIC Scheme has five allowance types which are tailored to assist a range of education options for isolated families. The applicable allowance for a student will normally reflect the student's living arrangements while they undertake an approved course. In 2009, 11,098 students received AIC allowances at a cost of $59.9 million. 



As noted in the Majority Committee report, the DEEWR submission points to a variety of payment types with an annual basic boarding allowance of $7,141 (2011 rate) along with possible additional allowances (for example the Additional Boarding Allowance of $2,366 in 2011). The Australian Government recognises that the Majority Committee report wishes to consider the appropriateness of the particular rate for each allowance, however the Government believes the Scheme provides adequate assistance to students and their families. 


The assistance provided under the AIC Scheme is demand driven and is uncapped, with applications assessed by the Department of Human Services – Centrelink in line with established program guidelines and eligibility criteria. There is therefore no limit placed on the number of families assisted per year, provided they meet the eligibility criteria. The Scheme is funded under a special appropriation authorised under the Student Assistance Act 1973.


It should also be noted that assistance under the AIC should not be treated in isolation. For example, as discussed in detail within the DEEWR submission, there are other forms of Australian Government assistance for schools in rural or regional areas and their students. 


One notable Australian Government initiative is the Country Areas Program that assists schools and school communities in improving the educational outcomes and opportunities of students who are educationally disadvantaged because of their geographical isolation. 


Other Australian Government generic initiatives that assist schools in rural or regional areas include funding for new facilities and refurbishments through the Building the Education Revolution (BER) and the Australian Government's Capital Grants Program for non-government schools. In terms of the latter, the Australian Government provided approximately $106 million in funding to schools in remote, rural and regional areas in 2008-2011. This includes funding for government schools in 2008 and funding for non-government schools in 2008-2011. From 2009, Australian Government funding for government schools is delivered through the intergovernmental funding framework under the National Education Agreement (NEA) with states and territories.


Under the Commitment, schools in regional Australia will be the first to receive funding, including a minimum funding entitlement based on the population share, equating to around 32 per cent of available funding. This funding will be in the form of at least $125 million of the $388 million of payments being awarded under the Rewards for School Improvement initiative to the schools in regional Australia that have shown the most improvement in student outcomes. 


The government has also committed $480.5 million by 2018 to increase the capacity of schools to make decisions at a local level under the Empowering Local Schools (ELS) initiative. Approximately one third of the 1000 schools expected to participate in ELS over 2012 and 2013 will be located in regional areas. Participating schools will receive start-up grants of $40,000-$50,000 to assist them to manage their increased decision making responsibilities effectively.




Recommendation 4 



The committee strongly recommends that the Australian Government introduce a Tertiary Access Allowance for students who are required to move away from home to access tertiary education.



Response: Not Supported.


In the Commitment to Regional Australia, the Government noted that it has reformed student income support to expand access by including: 150,000 new scholarships; an increase to the parental income test which will benefit over 100,000 students; and a review of student income support to be brought forward by 12 months. 


As identified in the Government Senators Dissenting Report, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support for Students) Act 2010, significantly reformed income support for students. On 1 April 2010, Relocation Scholarships were introduced for eligible university students receiving Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY who have to live away from the family home for study. The Relocation Scholarship assists dependent rural and regional students, in particular, with relocation for study.


The Review of Student Income Support Reforms was presented to the Government on 8 July 2011. The Government tabled the Report in Parliament on 14 September 2011 and introduced the Social Security Amendment (Student Income Support Reforms) Bill 2011 on 21 September 2011 to eliminate regional eligibility distinctions for Youth Allowance from 1 January 2012.


The Social Security Amendment (Student Income Support Reforms) Bill 2011 introduced on 21 September 2011 provides for the value of Relocation Scholarships for non-regional students to be $4000 in the first year they are required to live away from home to study and $1000 in subsequent years from 1 January 2012. In recognition of the higher costs of relocation for regional students and subject to the passage of legislation, Relocation Scholarship values for eligible dependent regional higher education students will be reset to provide more assistance in the second and third years of living away from home to study. The 2012 values will be $4000 in the first year of living away, $2000 in each of the second and third years and $1000 in any subsequent years of study. The Scholarship is indexed by CPI annually. Many students will also qualify for Rent Assistance. 


From 1 January 2012, the value of Student Start-up Scholarships available to university students receiving Youth Allowance, Austudy or ABSTUDY will be reset to $2,050 in 2012 and indexed by CPI thereafter. The DEEWR submission pointed out that these scholarships would assist with the costs of textbooks and specialised equipment. 


The existing reforms also include relaxation of the parental income test threshold and associated withdrawal taper rates increasing access to Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY. As students living away from home also attract a higher rate of payment and generally Rent Assistance as well, this reform particularly benefits rural students, who are more likely to come from low-to-middle income families. 


While the Australian Government believes that parents, where they are able, should support their children until they reach financial independence, through the measures contained in the Social Security Amendment (Student Income Support Reforms) Bill 2011, students from Inner Regional areas will be able to access independent Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY under the same rules that apply to students from Outer Regional, Remote and Very Remote Areas from 1 January 2012.


Students accessing the second and third elements of the workforce participation criterion must have parental income of less than $150,000 per annum. 


The Australian Government is already providing substantial support for students who need to move away from home to study. The Australian Government considers that a Tertiary Access Allowance as described by the Committee, without any means testing in place, would be costly (impacting on provision in other areas of educational need), inequitable and possibly open to abuse.




Recommendation 5 



The committee recommends that the Australian Government investigate the establishment of a capital works program to assist tertiary institutions to increase the stock of affordable housing for students. 



Response: Not Supported. The Government Senators Dissenting Report notes that since taking office the Australian Government has committed almost $5 billion in capital funding for tertiary institutions to support the development and renewal of campus infrastructure. 


As the Dissenting Report also notes, the guidelines of the Better Universities Renewal Funding (BURF) and Teaching and Learning Capital Fund for Higher Education (TLC-HE) funds, worth $1 billion in total, were broad enough to allow universities to spend this on student housing. A number of institutions have taken the opportunity to do so. For example, the Australian National University used       $4 million of its BURF allocation to develop student accommodation on campus. 


The involvement of the private sector in the development and/or provision of student accommodation is widespread. For example, a 507 bed student accommodation complex opened by the University of Canberra in 2009 was developed through a partnership between the University and Campus Living Villages. The private rental market, 'homestay' programs and independent residential colleges will also continue to play important roles in responding to the housing needs of students. 


In line with the Commitment, the Government will provide $400 million in funding for the Structural Adjustment Fund: $200 million to meet universities' capital requirements of $10 million or more and $200 million to meet non-recurrent requirements. This funding is to assist universities, particularly those in regional and outer metropolitan areas to adapt to the new student focused university funding system being introduced in 2012. 


The Government has also reviewed the Regional Loading paid by the Government to eligible higher education providers in recognition of the higher cost of providing places at regional campuses. In the 2011-12 Budget the Government announced that it would increase the regional loading by $109.9 million over four years (for a total of $249.4 million over four years). The regional loading funding will be distributed through a new formula that is transparent and responsive to student demand.


Another potential source of funding for student accommodation is the Education Investment Fund (EIF). While the focus of EIF is on large-scale strategic infrastructure projects for teaching, learning and research, it does not exclude funding for student accommodation if it can be demonstrated that the accommodation is integral to fully delivering the intended outcomes of the project.




Recommendation 6 



The committee therefore recommends that the Australian Government investigate the implementation of a form of temporary income support for students while they are on clinical placements or block release. 



Response: Noted. The Australian Government has committed, in response to the Review of Student Income Support, to undertake development work on the feasibility and merit of an income-contingent loan scheme targeted specifically at students who are required to move away from home to undertake formal clinical practicums or other formal practicum periods as part of their course.


The Government's reforms to student income support include a Student Start-up Scholarship as an entitlement for higher education students receiving Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY and Austudy. This scholarship, valued at $2,050 in 2012, is intended to assist with education expenses, including text books, laptops, field trips and practicums or placements. 


Students eligible to receive Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY or Austudy will continue to receive these payments while undertaking practicums or clinical placements that are a requirement of their course. Some dependent students receiving the 'at home' rate of Youth Allowance may claim the 'away from home' rate when moving away from home to undertake a practicum. These students may also be able to claim Rent Assistance, but this would depend upon whether a rental agreement was in place while they were living away from home during the practicum.


If a student receiving income support is engaged in a tertiary external course that has a compulsory residential component, including practicums, they are entitled to Fares Allowance which includes reimbursement for one return trip from their permanent home to the institution and back. A student is eligible for Fares Allowance for each external course or practicum undertaken during a year that requires attendance at an institution for a residential component.


ABSTUDY students may also claim 'Away from Base' assistance to help cover the cost of practicums (up to a maximum of $2,080 for Masters and PhD students) per year. 


Students receiving Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY and Austudy may also obtain an advance of up to $500, if required. 


Universities offer limited support in some courses through scholarships and bursaries to assist with the additional costs associated with practicums. State Governments also offer scholarships and loan schemes to assist students undertaking practicums. This assistance may not be tied to receipt of student income support payments.




Recommendation 7 



The committee recommends that a review be undertaken in 2013 to assess the impact of funding compacts, student-driven demand funding and the Structural Adjustment Fund on regional universities.



Response: Supported in principle, initiatives already in place. The Australian Government regularly monitors the impact of policy changes on universities.  


Ongoing discussions with universities as part of the compacts process will inform the Government of the impact of its higher education reforms on individual universities and regional universities generally. 


The Australian Government regularly monitors higher education enrolments. Early indications are that demand driven funding for undergraduate student places is of benefit to regional areas. Growth in enrolments has been strong, with regional universities together enrolling 10 per cent more students in 2011 than in 2009. This equals the 10 per cent growth at metropolitan universities over the same period.


In response to the Review of Regional Loading, the Government announced in the 2011-12 Budget that it would increase the regional loading by $109.9 million over four years (for a total of $249.4 million over four years). The regional loading funding will be distributed through a new formula that is transparent and responsive to student demand. These changes will start in 2012. The new regional loading formula will involve annual monitoring of enrolments at regional campuses.


The Structural Adjustment Fund was announced in May 2009 with funding of $400 million to assist universities to prepare for the new operational requirements of a demand driven funding system with new quality measures in place.  


Regional universities and TAFEs will have access to a Regional Priorities Round of funding from the Education Investment Fund of $500 million. Infrastructure projects funded through the Education Investment Fund are monitored regularly during their implementation and grant recipients are required to participate in project evaluation activities following the completion of projects. The implementation of projects may not be complete by 2013.


The Australian Government has also made fresh commitments to governance and transparency reform which will ensure that regional Australia gets a fair hearing and a fair return from its national government. This includes developing a spatial accounting model which will provide greater visibility into Government spending and service delivery by regional location.




Recommendation 8 



The committee recommends that the Australian Government investigate options for attracting students to regional institutions, and encouraging graduates to work in rural and regional locations, through programs which provide for reduced HECS-HELP liability.



Response: Supported in part, initiatives already in place. The Government Senators' Dissenting Report notes that there are already a range of HECS remission policies in place which have already been adopted by this Government to encourage graduates to work in priority fields or areas. The Australian Government provides incentives for targeted areas such as medicine and early childhood education. 


Incentives for medicine include:


the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship;


the Rural Retention Program;


the Practice Incentives Program; and 


the MBS Bulk Bill Incentive Items. 


Incentives for early childhood education include:


a HECS-HELP Benefit for early childhood education teachers, which has a location-based eligibility criterion targeted at regional areas. The Benefit allows eligible early childhood education teachers who work in an area of particular need to reduce their HECS-HELP debt.


As universities are self-accrediting institutions that decide the courses they offer, they are best placed in terms of attracting students to their regional institutions or campuses. The Australian Government already provides significant support to these institutions through initiatives (many of which are detailed in the DEEWR submission) such as regional loading. 


The Australian Government also provides incentives for international students to study at regional institutions or campuses. For the purposes of the General Skilled Migration program administered by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC), inter­national students can claim migration eligibility points for having lived and studied full time at a campus located in regional Australia or a low population growth metropolitan area for at least 2 years prior to lodging an application for skilled migration visa.  


Governments currently provide a range of incentives to teachers to encourage them to take positions in rural and remote areas. Under this scenario, if a State Government chooses, incentives for teachers to take positions in rural and regional areas could include a scholarship or payment to be directed to the repayment of a person's HECS-HELP debt.


Under the Commitment the Australian Government will develop Regional Education, Skills and Jobs Plans in 2011, in response to the 2010 DEEWR report on access to and participation in higher education in regional Australia. Thirty-four Education, Skills and Jobs Coordinators will be deployed into regional communities to work with local stakeholders to develop the Plans. These Plans will include strategies to increase the participation rates for higher education, where relevant to the needs identified by the local stakeholders and community.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2012-03-13,"




Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:54):  I seek leave to take note of the response regarding the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report Rural and regional access to secondary and tertiary education opportunities.


Leave granted.




Senator NASH:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


We received today from the government their response to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into rural and regional access to secondary and tertiary education opportunities. This inquiry was held in 2009. The rural and regional committee reported in December 2009. I chaired that inquiry. It is interesting to note that it has taken the government over two years to provide the Senate with a response of fewer than 12 pages. The response is hardly timely, and I suggest that indicates the lack of understanding that the government has of this issue.


The government indicate in their response:


The Australian Government believes that every student should have access to a world-class education no matter where they live.


I would suggest to the government that perhaps they would like to put their money where their mouth is and ensure that that actually happens, because the response they have given to the committee report in no way does that. The response shows yet again that the government has a complete lack of understanding when it comes to the needs of regional students and the very real issue of inequity.



Recommendation 1 of the committee report is that there be 'an investigation into the barriers to rural and regional secondary educational opportunities' thatexist for regional students. What is extraordinary is that in the response the governmentsay they have been proactive in doing this and yet almost the entire response to recommendation 1—that we look at the barriers for regional students—relates to the changes that the governmentmade to the independentyouth allowance. Madam Acting Deputy President Fisher, you and others wouldknow thatthose were the unfair changes that the governmentput in place in 2010 thatmeant that students in inner regional areas did not have the same criteria applied to them for accessing independentyouth allowance as other regional students did—simply unfair. In the response, the governmentare claiming the reversal of thatunfair changeat the end of last year—that they themselves put in place in 2010—as a win and as somehow addressing the barriers thatexist for regional students. How stupid is that?




This government


should never have made those changes to independent


youth allowance in the first place. They should never have treated regional students differently simply because of where they lived according to lines on a map. And yet here we have the government


in response to the committee report recommendations claiming that


the change back to treating all 
regional students fairly is some wonderful win for the government, that they have made this great change and that that somehow indicates the government


are looking to remove the barriers for rural and regional students to educational opportunities. It is simply extraordinary that


the government


would


do that—that


they would


try to claim that as a win. The changes should never have been made in the first place.





That


is virtually the entire response to that


particular recommendation. It just goes to show that this government


simply does not understand


the issue of the inequity for regional students when it comes to their opportunities to educational access compared to those of city students and students in metropolitan areas. The problem is very simple. Regional students so often have no choice but to relocate to attend university


or further tertiary education, and that


comes at a cost of around $20,000 a year. That is a cost that


city students who have the opportunity to live at home, as they very often do, do not have to bear. That is the inequity that


this government


simply cannot get its head around. It is through no fault of the regional students that they have to relocate.




The government


say that they have addressed some of these issues


through some of the changes to the independent youth allowance. I have to admit, as I have before, that the changes to the threshold were a good thing. But that


does not address the issue for regional students who fall outside of the criteria for assistance through independent


youth allowance. We are talking about those with middle-income parents. What this government


have done is apply a $150,000 parental income test cap to independent


youth allowance. That


means that those students whose parents' income combined comes to $150,000 are not eligible for independent


youth allowance.

How illogical and, again, how stupid is that? These students are proving themselves to be independent of their parents. To then put a parental income test in place is treating this as a welfare measure, and independent youth allowance is not that.


Indeed, it has become quite obvious over time that the government put the cap in place only to free up funding for other areas, which means that regional students are bearing the cost. Let's just look at that for a moment. That $150,000 is combined income before tax. We are not talking about wealthy people. We are talking about, quite possibly, a police officer or a schoolteacher out in a regional area who is going to receive absolutely no assistance from the government for their students to travel away and attend university. It is an absolute mockery when the government say that they believe every student should have access to a world-class education, no matter where they live, when the policies that they have put in place directly contradict that statement. The government say that one of the recommendations was to put in place a tertiary access allowance, which would provide funding for students to assist them with relocation when they have no choice but to relocate to attend tertiary education. The government indicated in their response that that is not supported. Again, this just indicates that the government are not listening to the thousands of regional families who are telling them that the current policies do not work. Indeed, the government put in place enormous barriers for those students to go on to tertiary education, and that is simply not fair.


The ICPA have been pushing for a tertiary access allowance for many years, as have I. This is the way for regional students to be able to have some equity when it comes to accessing education, when we compare them to city students who do not have to bear that financial burden. The government in their response talk about the relocation scholarships that were introduced, saying that is providing funding. Relocation scholarships do not even apply to students on independent youth allowance. They talk about the fact that the government eliminated the regional eligibility distinctions for youth allowance from 1 January 2012. The government brought those changes in in the first place. They should never, ever have been put in place, and now we see the government again crying that this is some great win for regional students. They disenfranchised an entire two-year cohort of year 12 students who fell into the gap before the government fixed their absolutely appalling mistake, and that is simply not on.


The inequity that exists for those regional students will not be addressed until the government recognises that this is not a means-testing welfare issue. This is about the comparison between the regional student who has to bear the cost of that $20,000 a year when they have no choice but to relocate to attend university and the city student who does not bear that cost. It does not matter if the parents are earning $10,000, $50,000, $100,000 or $150,000—that is not the point. The point is the inequity for the regional students because the families have to bear the costs that other students do not. Until the government pulls its head out of the sand and recognises this as an issue, those students are still going to face those barriers. Those students are still going to face those enormous financial difficulties that are preventing so many of our students from going on to tertiary education. Only 33 per cent of regional students go on to tertiary education compared to 55 per cent of students in the cities. The evidence clearly shows that it is because of the financial burden. The government simply has to admit that its measures have not addressed those barriers. It must clearly start to recognise that there is a huge inequity for regional students and that it has to be addressed.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Government Response to Report</title>,COMMITTEES,14,2,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-03-13,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:04):  I join Senator Nash in expressing my concern at the very late response by the government to the inquiry chaired by Senator Nash. Let me give you these statistics by way of evidence. It is a comparison between the dates of 1984 and 2007 regarding people from rural communities and people in the wider community with tertiary qualifications. In 1984, four per cent of people in the rural communities of Australia had a tertiary qualification, whereas 2½ times that figure, 10 per cent, in the wider community had such a qualification. By 2007, the number of people in the wider community having a tertiary qualification had gone up from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. Those in rural communities having tertiary qualifications went from a lamentable four per cent to an even more lamentable seven per cent—equal to the lowest in the OECD, and this is supposed to be the smart country. If one were to actually examine those 2007 figures out to 2012, one would only see a further widening of that gap. This is what the inquiry went to, and we see a gross deficiency in the government's response.


In the last three weeks I have had the opportunity, with my colleague Senator Colbeck, to talk to rural communities about education and agricultural education in Tasmania. In Victoria, two weeks ago, I had that same opportunity with representatives of Marcus Oldham College, and last week throughout rural Western Australia I addressed the same questions in the wheatbelt areas. We have a lamentable and pathetic circumstance that must be handled, must be addressed and surely must be bipartisan. We cannot leave rural communities in the sad demise they are in at the moment.


Senator Nash spoke about independence from parents. How is it that an 18-year-old can vote and can be called up to participate in military service, and yet an 18-, 19-, 20- or 21-year-old somehow or other is beholden to their parents' income when it comes to addressing the question of independent youth allowance?


I will not go back over the words that Senator Nash used except to reflect on the three criteria, the first of which is working full-time for 30 hours a week for 18 months. Where are the full-time jobs in rural Australia, working 30 hours a week over 18 months—not seasonally adjusted, but 30 hours every week? They do not exist, Madam Acting Deputy President Fisher, a fact you know well yourself from your experience in the Dales. In fact, it was in Brookton that we started our visits last week.


The second alternative is part-time work for greater than 15 hours a week for two years after leaving school. We all know about the wastage that occurs when, instead of going on to higher study, a student takes a gap year and particularly a second gap year. They might go on to tertiary study if they have one gap year but it is very, very unlikely if they have two gap years. And who are those who are represented most highly in the group who do not go on to tertiary study after a two-year gap? You guessed it; they are from rural communities. The third group comprise those who might have total savings of greater than 75 per cent of the necessary $21,000 over 18 months.


The question I ask, of course, is: why, at all, are they beholden to their parents' combined incomes? As Senator Nash said, a policeman and a teacher in a country town may well accumulate $150,000 of annual salary—they may work overtime, get some form of penalties or some form of zone allowance in the magical, mystical $150,000—but you would have an argument on your hands if you were to say that such people were wealthy enough to send children away from home. The criterion must be: does that person have to leave their home to access higher education? The answer is yes.


Only last week did I have many people in the rural communities—towns you would know well: Brookton, Kondinin, Hyden—asking me: 'What is the solution to this dilemma? We have to get our children away for higher education, and we have to get them away for upper secondary education but we cannot afford it; it's $40-odd thousand, at least, after tax per student.' This is not for the top boarding schools in the cities, as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, but that is the least cost. In many instances, the farmer's wife shifts to the city so that she can be with the children in the city, and that is breaking up the family because we know that, on the weekend, the children also remain in the city. Where does the farmer end up? One farmer said to me, 'Unfortunately, Senator Back, all too often where the farmer ends up is on the end of a rope in his shearing shed.' That was said to me last Tuesday in your old home town of Brookton, Madam Acting Deputy President.


So we have the circumstance, unfortunately, in this country of a wide disparity now between the educational aspirations of those in the cities and those in the country. Those of us who have watched this process for many, many years know that, if a family remains in the country, the educational outcome for their students in years 11 and 12 going into higher education are much lower. We know that. They are much lower than they would be if the family were able to make the decision to move to the city. Of course, we now see that farming families cannot do this. In so many rural communities now, professionals such as doctors, dentists and others—and, in my own case, my wife and I—make the decision very early to be in a city somewhere by the time their oldest child goes to secondary school. Right across each of the states that I have been in that is the case. It is not just an educational issue; it is an issue right across society, because when that doctor or that dentist leaves that community, as we all know, a valuable person is lost, a valuable family is lost to that community.


These are issues that are not being addressed, yet we see the questions raised. Recommendations were made in this report for external students to try to make their circumstances easier. They did not receive an adequate response from the government. What we now have are compulsory student union fees payable also by external students who can never, ever access the services for which they are subsidising their city cousins and those who are in city based institutions.


We had a circumstance in Queensland—Senator Nash may remember it—in which one of the university vice-chancellors said to us that he was aware of cases where those leaving school at the end of year 12 were saying to the principal: 'Don't tell my parents that I am bright enough or that I have qualified to go to a city university to study, because I don't want to put that pressure on my parents and on my siblings.' This is a wealthy country. What a lamentable circumstance in which a year-12 student says to the school principal, 'I don't want my parents knowing that I am capable of going on to higher studies.' Very often these people from a regional area, a rural area, even a remote area, are the people who come back and provide professional services upon graduation. These are particularly important issues and should not have been the subject of so much delay.


Time does not permit me to go further into the whole question of agricultural and agribusiness education. As you know, that is the subject of a Senate inquiry at this moment, and it is creating an enormous amount of interest. I am delighted that Senator Gallacher is here in the chamber and has participated in the first hearing—and, hopefully, will participate in other hearings. But, again, all it is pointing to is the absolute demise of tertiary institutions. I was at Marcus Oldham College in Geelong the other day, now the only private sector college that is still operating in the same way as it did it in the 1980s. Look at those that have closed: Hawkesbury could not have first-year students this year; Muresk in Western Australia is closed; and Gatton and Roseworthy are largely now veterinary schools with some agricultural education. We are graduating fewer than 700 graduates in agricultural science for an annual demand of at least 3,500. This is not the way that Australia is going to achieve what it needs to achieve to provide food and fibre for the region into the future. These are critically important issues and they are far more deserving of rigour, study and examination than this response has indicated.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (18:01):  I move:


That the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and two related bills be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee. 


I do so because this is the latest betrayal by the Gillard Labor government that really does need to be put under scrutiny. Why? Because this government has absolutely no mandate whatsoever to pass these bills.


The government claims only 27,000 people will drop cover as a result of this measure. Treasury has not done the modelling of the effect of the downgrading of this cover. This is why it needs to be scrutinised. The government's own insurer, Medibank Private, predicted 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. About 2.4 million people will be directly affected with immediate increases in premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent and 43 per cent in the respective income tiers for those under 65. 


Deloitte, which is a very respected organisation, has undertaken an analysis which predicts that in the first year 175,000 people would be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 people will downgrade. Over five years, 1.6 million people will drop their cover and 4.3 million people will downgrade their cover. Deloitte's analysis also predicts that private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be. They also predict that there will be $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs for the public hospital system. Around 2.8 million people with general treatment cover will withdraw and 5.7 million people will downgrade over five years. 


Has Treasury done modelling on the costs and additional burden on the public hospital system, not to mention the effects that this is going to have on waiting lists? No. As we know, a deterioration of the risk pool—that is, healthier, younger people dropping out of private health insurance first—will cause an upward pressure on premiums for all 12 million Australians with private health insurance. What further premium increases will be required as a result of this increased risk? How many people will drop out of private health insurance as a result of these further increases?


When one looks at the people who now rely on private health insurance—the government has been absolutely outrageous in the way that it lied about this measure at the last federal election. For years the Australian Labor Party has been telling us in writing—and it is not worth the paper it is written on—that, 'No, we're not going to touch private health insurance rebates.' They kept telling us that. They lied about this.



Senator Feeney interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  They went to the last federal election and lied about this, Senator Feeney. Of course, now they are perpetrating that by telling us that private health insurance is for the rich. Well, 5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $50,000. Go and tell those people on less than $50,000 that according to this government they are wealthy, and 3.4 million of those people have an annual household income of less than $35,000. What this government is doing in relation to private health insurance is absolutely outrageous. What is going to happen when all the patients in the private hospital system move over? Therefore, these bills need to be scrutinised by a Senate committee. (Time expired)

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:06):  I rise to oppose the motion seeking to refer the—




Senator Williams:
  Let the Senate do its job.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Order! Senator Williams, please do not make any interjections. Senator Feeney, please ignore the interjections.




Senator FEENEY:
  I do try, Acting Deputy President. There is no justification for these bills to be referred to the committee, despite what Senator Fierravanti-Wells just set out in her speech of confected outrage. These bills have been debated extensively over the past three years with all of the issues comprehensively considered and examined. This motion is nothing more than a cynical attempt by the coalition to prevent these bills passing through this chamber prior to their proposed commencement date. I said in my very first speech to this place:


In health we need to end the scandal of three billion tax dollars a year being handed over to the private insurance industry—a handout that has done nothing to reduce the pressure on our public hospitals. For all this vast subsidy, the proportion of Australians who have private health cover rose during the Howard years only from 34 to 44 per cent. And most of the new purchasers were well-off people who bought a cheap policy to avoid the government’s tax surcharge. That is to say, the private health insurance industry has been grown with conscripts not volunteers.


It is our very firm view that these bills will ensure that low- and middle-income earners will no longer subsidise the private health insurance of high-income earners. Despite the misleading claims that members of the coalition have made throughout this debate and again today, the rebate will remain unchanged for low- and middle-income earners. The private health insurance rebate is the fastest-growing component of health spending and it is unsustainable. Over 10 years its real cost will increase more than 50 per cent.


The changes proposed by this government will save $2.4 billion over the next three years and $100 billion over the next 40 years. So one wonders why the coalition are opposed to a measure that ensures that our tax dollars are spent in the most effective way. The real reason the coalition are so opposed to these bills is that they have never met a billionaire they do not want to give a handout to. And we see this riddled throughout their policies.



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator FEENEY:
  I see Senator Nash gnashing her teeth as she hears my remarks, but one might very well remark that, given the recent advice and interactions between her Senate leader and a notorious billionaire, one can see my point proven again and again. The continued passage of these bills should not be held up because of the coalition's ideological desire to hand over taxpayers' money to those who are most able to look after themselves.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2012-03-13,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (18:09):  I am quite proud to speak on this motion, because what we just heard from Senator Feeney is a complete misrepresentation of the importance of private health insurance. In fact, one of the reasons we need to have an inquiry into this matter is to dispel those myths—in fact, those quite blatant mistruths—by the government. Let us go back to the history of why this is a rebate and not a tax deduction. Just like Medicare is universal—and Labor made such a point of that—the previous government introduced the private health insurance rebate as a rebate, not a tax deduction. The reason it was introduced as a flat-rate rebate and not a tax deduction was to guarantee that it would be worth more to lower income earners. If it were a tax deduction, like it was previously, it would have been worth more to higher income earners. This rebate guarantees that the millions of people Senator Fierravanti-Wells mentioned—whose household incomes are less than $30,000 and less than $50,000—will be helped to keep their private health insurance.


This is what Labor are all about: they actually wants to punish those who invest in their own health care. It is just like they have always been with education: they do not like people being able to invest in their own health care. The private health insurance rebate ensures and triggers further private investment in health care. It increases the overall pool of money being spent on health in Australia, and we know from the work of the Productivity Commission and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare that private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia. In 2009 and 2010 private hospitals admitted 3.5 million patients, and they perform most of the elective surgery in Australia. That is what Labor do not like. They want everyone to have to join the queues that they did so much to make longer at the state level over the last decade. The dream of the Labor Party is a national health service—a British-style national health service. The very balance that Neal Blewett designed into the Medicare system, which protected private health insurance and made the rebate that we as citizens get for a medical procedure not dependent upon the venue in which that procedure was performed, is supported by the private health insurance rebate. The rebate guarantees that, regardless of your income, you receive a flat amount to support you investing in your own health care, to support you taking pressure off the public system and to support you freeing up those resources to be used by those who are more needy. As I said, it was all about making it a rebate so that it would be of more value to lower income earners.


What the government does not want people to know is that every one of those households that Senator Fierravanti-Wells talked about—those who are earning less than $30,000 and $50,000—is going to pay more for health insurance because of this bill. We are going to have tens of thousands of people drop out. The government does not want to tell us, because Treasury will not do the modelling and release it, but we have heard from Medibank Private and we know from other players in the sector that this is actually going to mean that the young and the healthy will drop out. It will reduce the quality of the pool of people in private health insurance, and that will mean that the increases in private health insurance costs in coming years will be higher than they otherwise would be. When it comes to the carbon tax, the government does not like to have such comparisons. It likes to pretend that it lives in a world where its assertions are the truth. But they are not, and we know that.


What this Senate needs to do is to ensure that the mistruths—and potentially even the misunderstandings, Senator Feeney—that are put around by the Labor Party and their allies on this, and the dirty deal that was done in the lower house, are exposed so that the people know why they are getting a 10 per cent increase rather than a seven per cent increase in their bill next year. We are talking about the people on below average incomes—the people who save for their own health care because they see it as something that is good for them, good for their families and good for the community. Those people should have the right to know exactly why their premiums are going up faster than they were in previous years. They are going to go up faster because the Labor Party needs to fill various budget black holes that it has created, and it is continuing its 30-year war against the private health industry—the industry that performs the majority of elective surgery in Australia. Why on earth we would want to reduce that, I do not know. It is not like the state hospitals that have been run by the Labor Party for so long are doing such a fantastic job—with the tragedies we heard about in New South Wales and Queensland. It would be a travesty if these bills were not exposed. It is wrong that Labor and its Greens alliance partners are willing to ram this through. We will ensure that all the Australian people know the exact consequences of this legislation.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:14):  I too rise today in support of the motion of the shadow minister for ageing and mental health, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, to refer the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and two related bills to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. This legislation will impact on the federal budget and it is only right and proper that the Senate Standing Committees on Economics examine the legislation in light of the changing economic situation—and I mean the actual economic situation, not the changing political imperatives of the Labor government. When this legislation last entered the Senate, it was referred to the Senate community affairs committee, where the coalition recommended that, rather than punish hard-working Australian families, the Minister for Health and Ageing examine other means of obtaining the required fiscal savings. The coalition supported the government's attempt at fiscal responsibility, especially in light of such consistent failure over time on this key indicator of government performance.


The government is once again putting middle Australia in the spotlight and taking aim, as my two coalition colleagues have mentioned. I will not reiterate the statistics. In its majority report the committee at that time was satisfied that the government had set aside adequate funds to inform and instruct the industry and the public on how these means-tested rebates would work. But, clearly, this has not happened. If I walked down the main street of any town in Australia or asked any of the 40 per cent of regional Australians who have private health insurance how this would affect them, they would not be able to tell me. Australians need to understand how this legislation will affect their bottom line from July 2012 and the Senate needs to assure itself about the holistic impact of this legislation on the nation's bottom line.


Senator Fierravanti-Wells's motion seeks the committee to report in June, allowing plenty of time for all stakeholders to participate in a comprehensive examination in the current economic climate. The government has the numbers today to vote to halt the scrutiny, but it also has the numbers in the legislation committee to adopt a report. If it is such a great piece of legislation, Senator Feeney, let us have a look at it. What is there to hide? This is yet another example of the Labor government doing something in haste without fully understanding its impact and without thorough investigation. In fact, this government's entire time in leadership of our nation has been littered with rushed, poorly implemented policy with unintended consequences. 


I am confident Australians would like to know why Nicola Roxon, the then Minister for Health and Ageing, said in 2009:


The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. 


She then proceeded four months later to introduce this legislation into the House of Representatives—mixed messages from a mixed up Labor government. The government is planning to means test private health insurance rebates at the same time that it has approved a premium rise. The new federal health minister has approved an average rise in private health insurance premiums of 5.6 per cent effective from 1 April. As a result Australians will be paying more for their health insurance under this government.


Means testing families on $160,000 a year is just that—it is mean. This legislation targets the copper and the teacher, for example, in regional Australia, who contribute their taxes, who pay their Medicare levy and who are going to be slugged again. Describing these families as 'millionaires' shows just how out of touch this government is with the day-to-day struggles of working Australians. Penalising people for taking responsibility for their own health care makes no sense. Many regional communities currently have access to private hospitals and the specialists those hospitals bring to town, essentially acting as a hub for regional healthcare delivery. Typically, private hospitals in regional centres have lower occupancy rates, meaning they operate on wafer-thin margins and any erosion in those rates will be magnified in regional hospitals and likely to force cuts to service or, potentially, to cause some private hospitals to close their doors entirely. Forty per cent of regional people have private health insurance and those patients are using these private services, many no doubt relying on them for repeat admissions over the course of a treatment. For ongoing health conditions. these families can ill afford to lose these benefits.


Let us refer it to our committee for scrutiny. Senators are canny folk and I am confident there would be some great recommendations from the committee on how to assist the minister to find the savings for Mr Swan's surplus without slugging middle Australia. How typical, Labor.

Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (18:19):  I too would like to make a contribution to the debate on the motion moved by Senator Fierravanti-Wells to refer the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and two related bills to a committee for inquiry. We know that this is one in a long line of stunts by the opposition to delay the proper progress of legislation through the Senate. Indeed, it is just a delaying tactic and fairly repetitive behaviour on the part of the opposition, but it is in line with their opposition for the sake of opposition.


I note that these bills have already been in public debate for approximately three years and it would be safe to say that all of the issues covered by the bills have been well and truly traversed in debates in this chamber and in Senate estimates. Most of the issues raised in these bills have been traversed ad nauseum by those opposite. That is fair enough, but there is no need to refer them again to a future committee. I note also that the bills are already on the Notice Paper for debate in the Senate this week and this is, properly, where we should be heading—that is, to get on with the debate about these important bills. I note also that already nine coalition senators have their names on the speaking list to contribute to the second reading debate on these bills. Obviously they are clearly ready to talk about the bills, but they have to go through this stunt to make us waste more time of the Senate by talking about referring bills to a committee.


The government wants to proceed with these bills because they are good Labor policy. We believe that private health insurance rebates should be means tested to make it fair for all Australians. It is not fair that Australians on lower to middle incomes are subsidising the private health insurance of Australians on very high incomes, like those of us in here. It is not fair that taxpayers on low incomes who may not be able to afford private health insurance themselves should be subsidising the private health insurance of millionaires. There is another very good reason we should be getting on with debating and passing these bills—that is, the budgetary impact of not doing so.


We know that Australia's health budget is one of the burgeoning budget issues we have to deal with. We do have to take decisive action to make sure that we keep that budget under control and that we focus the health budget on where it needs to be—that is, on services for people and medical assistance in hospitals. That is what people really need. We know that these bills, if they are passed, would save the Australian budget $2.4 billion over the next three years and $100 billion over the next 40 years. That is an amount of money that could be well invested in the health system, but the opposition are saying they do not want to proceed with it. I have to ask them: if they are not going to pass these bills, as they are indicating, then where are they going to find the money so Australia's health system can provide the services Australians need?


They have given us no indication of where they would make up that budget shortfall. They never will give us any indication of where they are going to make up that budget shortfall. We are still trying to find out how the opposition are going to fill the black hole—the crater—of the $70 billion that they are going to foist on the Australian public because they have no concrete proposals for dealing with budgetary matters. They just continue to oppose for the sake of opposing.


These reforms build on the Australian Labor government's great record with regard to health and health reform. Of course, it was a Labor government that brought in Medicare—universal health care for all Australians. It is a very proud part of our history. In terms of the more recent Labor governments, we have tried to address the severe funding shortages that occurred throughout the Howard era—the era when Mr Tony Abbott was the Minister for Health and Ageing and ripped a billion dollars out of the health system.



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator McEWEN:
  We have attempted to redress that by increasing hospital funding by $20 billion since 2008. We have committed more to cancer services, including 22 regional cancer services, Senator Nash. We have committed more than $2.2 billion to mental health—the largest ever mental health package in Australia. We have provided funding for preventative health and for primary health care. We have increased the numbers of doctors and nurses. We have done practical things for Australians.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:24):  This is about the Senate doing its job as a chamber of review. That is what this is about. Senator Fierravanti-Wells has brought forward the statistics in terms of what is going to happen. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realise that the more you raise the price of something the fewer customers you will have. That is just a law of economics. As you raise the price what is going to happen is that people will either lower their amount of cover or pull out of private health insurance. And what will happen then? It will mean more stress—more people relying on the public health system that is run by our state governments and is already under enormous stress.


We just found out last week that there will be a $100 million a year cost to the hospitals for increases in electricity prices because of the carbon tax—$100 million a year for our hospitals. What are we going to do now? We are going to remove the incentive for people to take out private health insurance. The government want to take that away. Yet they are trying to hide from it. They will not let a Senate inquiry go ahead; they are opposing that.


Have a look at the statements of Ms Roxon and former Prime Minister and slain political man Kevin Rudd prior to the 2007 election. The statements were: 'We will not change the private health insurance rebate. That is locked in concrete. We are the Labor people and we will not change that.' And what are they trying to do? They are trying to change it.


The reason Labor have a 31 per cent primary vote is that people do not trust them. They do not trust them on private health insurance. They do not trust them on carbon tax. They do not trust them on managing our economy. The reason they are doing this is they are stone motherless broke. We now have $231 billion worth of gross debt because they wasted so much money. They handed out $900 to people here, there and everywhere. There was the pink batts. There were the school buildings—including a $600,000 kiosk at Tottenham Central School and a $330,000 eight metre by four metre building at Kingstown Public School. The waste of money is incredible.


What are the government going to do now they have run out of money? They are going to pressure our state health system. This is cost shifting. They are simply removing the cost from the federal budget and placing it onto state budgets, which are already under enormous stress. We have seen what has happened to our state hospital system over the last 15 years with the lack of finance and support. All this is about is shifting the cost from the federal budget to the state budgets. Make no mistake about it: people will leave private health insurance—we already have the models on that—or downgrade the cover they have. Many of these people are simply Aussie battlers. When more drop out, the private health insurance companies are going to have to raise their premiums. That is only common sense. Then those Aussie battlers, who will not be affected by this as far as their rebate goes, will see their premiums going up and they will drop out. There is the problem: more strain on our public health system.


People will be lined up at the emergency department of the hospital on a weekend putting more stress on the hospital system. People will have to wait to have surgery carried out. People will leave the private health system. What will happen then? How will those private hospitals survive? This is a threat to the private hospital system as well. More people will be going to the public health system. And it is a betrayal of the promise by Ms Roxon and Mr Rudd prior to the 2007 election. No-one can deny that. We can bring in the printouts. When we get into debate on this bill we will gladly bring in the printouts from the media coverage where they said, 'We will never reduce that.'


As I said, the reason the Labor Party's primary vote is at 31 per cent is that the people of Australia have lost faith and trust in this government. They cannot trust you.




Senator Nash:
  The carbon tax.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Yes, Senator Nash, there is the carbon tax. I will take that interjection. We heard, 'There'll be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' But on 1 July in will come the carbon tax.



Senator Feeney interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  And remember—people like Senator Feeney should remember—that $100 million a year extra cost for electricity in our hospital system throughout Australia. That is $100 million for what? It is for absolutely nothing. That is why we should support this inquiry. At least let the Senate do its job. That is all I ask for—to back Senator Fierravanti-Wells's reference here. Let the Senate do its job. If you vote against this reference you are voting against democracy and the job of this Senate. That is what you will be doing. You want to close it down so that you can rush a bill through for the budget that you have made such a mess of over the last four years.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:29):  In summing up this debate for the coalition I would remind Senators Feeney and McEwen that somebody once said:


I grow tired of saying this. Labor is committed to the 30 per cent health insurance rebate.


That quote was in my local newspaper, the Hobart Mercury, from a certain person. I will give those on the other side a hint: the person was also the person who promised undying loyalty to Mr Rudd. And just in case they cannot remember or cannot get the hint as to who it is—if they are scratching around in their heads—I will give them another hint. It was also the person who said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' In case they have not got it yet, that was the solemn promise of Ms Gillard on behalf of the Australian Labor Party.


This is another Labor broken promise. We as a coalition want to put this proposed measure to a Senate inquiry to give the Australian Labor Party the opportunity to explain how that which was such good policy before the election is all of a sudden bad policy after the election. They know they have the numbers—or, I should say, the Greens know they have the numbers, because they have a compliant ALP willing to ram this through the place without proper scrutiny. We will be dividing on this, because we believe the Senate should do its duty and explore this matter fully. (Time expired)

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (18:01):  I move:


That the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and two related bills be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee. 


I do so because this is the latest betrayal by the Gillard Labor government that really does need to be put under scrutiny. Why? Because this government has absolutely no mandate whatsoever to pass these bills.


The government claims only 27,000 people will drop cover as a result of this measure. Treasury has not done the modelling of the effect of the downgrading of this cover. This is why it needs to be scrutinised. The government's own insurer, Medibank Private, predicted 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. About 2.4 million people will be directly affected with immediate increases in premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent and 43 per cent in the respective income tiers for those under 65. 


Deloitte, which is a very respected organisation, has undertaken an analysis which predicts that in the first year 175,000 people would be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 people will downgrade. Over five years, 1.6 million people will drop their cover and 4.3 million people will downgrade their cover. Deloitte's analysis also predicts that private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be. They also predict that there will be $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs for the public hospital system. Around 2.8 million people with general treatment cover will withdraw and 5.7 million people will downgrade over five years. 


Has Treasury done modelling on the costs and additional burden on the public hospital system, not to mention the effects that this is going to have on waiting lists? No. As we know, a deterioration of the risk pool—that is, healthier, younger people dropping out of private health insurance first—will cause an upward pressure on premiums for all 12 million Australians with private health insurance. What further premium increases will be required as a result of this increased risk? How many people will drop out of private health insurance as a result of these further increases?


When one looks at the people who now rely on private health insurance—the government has been absolutely outrageous in the way that it lied about this measure at the last federal election. For years the Australian Labor Party has been telling us in writing—and it is not worth the paper it is written on—that, 'No, we're not going to touch private health insurance rebates.' They kept telling us that. They lied about this.



Senator Feeney interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  They went to the last federal election and lied about this, Senator Feeney. Of course, now they are perpetrating that by telling us that private health insurance is for the rich. Well, 5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $50,000. Go and tell those people on less than $50,000 that according to this government they are wealthy, and 3.4 million of those people have an annual household income of less than $35,000. What this government is doing in relation to private health insurance is absolutely outrageous. What is going to happen when all the patients in the private hospital system move over? Therefore, these bills need to be scrutinised by a Senate committee. (Time expired)

Senator Williams:
  Let the Senate do its job.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Order! Senator Williams, please do not make any interjections. Senator Feeney, please ignore the interjections.




Senator FEENEY:
  I do try, Acting Deputy President. There is no justification for these bills to be referred to the committee, despite what Senator Fierravanti-Wells just set out in her speech of confected outrage. These bills have been debated extensively over the past three years with all of the issues comprehensively considered and examined. This motion is nothing more than a cynical attempt by the coalition to prevent these bills passing through this chamber prior to their proposed commencement date. I said in my very first speech to this place:


In health we need to end the scandal of three billion tax dollars a year being handed over to the private insurance industry—a handout that has done nothing to reduce the pressure on our public hospitals. For all this vast subsidy, the proportion of Australians who have private health cover rose during the Howard years only from 34 to 44 per cent. And most of the new purchasers were well-off people who bought a cheap policy to avoid the government’s tax surcharge. That is to say, the private health insurance industry has been grown with conscripts not volunteers.


It is our very firm view that these bills will ensure that low- and middle-income earners will no longer subsidise the private health insurance of high-income earners. Despite the misleading claims that members of the coalition have made throughout this debate and again today, the rebate will remain unchanged for low- and middle-income earners. The private health insurance rebate is the fastest-growing component of health spending and it is unsustainable. Over 10 years its real cost will increase more than 50 per cent.


The changes proposed by this government will save $2.4 billion over the next three years and $100 billion over the next 40 years. So one wonders why the coalition are opposed to a measure that ensures that our tax dollars are spent in the most effective way. The real reason the coalition are so opposed to these bills is that they have never met a billionaire they do not want to give a handout to. And we see this riddled throughout their policies.



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator FEENEY:
  I see Senator Nash gnashing her teeth as she hears my remarks, but one might very well remark that, given the recent advice and interactions between her Senate leader and a notorious billionaire, one can see my point proven again and again. The continued passage of these bills should not be held up because of the coalition's ideological desire to hand over taxpayers' money to those who are most able to look after themselves.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2012-03-13,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (18:09):  I am quite proud to speak on this motion, because what we just heard from Senator Feeney is a complete misrepresentation of the importance of private health insurance. In fact, one of the reasons we need to have an inquiry into this matter is to dispel those myths—in fact, those quite blatant mistruths—by the government. Let us go back to the history of why this is a rebate and not a tax deduction. Just like Medicare is universal—and Labor made such a point of that—the previous government introduced the private health insurance rebate as a rebate, not a tax deduction. The reason it was introduced as a flat-rate rebate and not a tax deduction was to guarantee that it would be worth more to lower income earners. If it were a tax deduction, like it was previously, it would have been worth more to higher income earners. This rebate guarantees that the millions of people Senator Fierravanti-Wells mentioned—whose household incomes are less than $30,000 and less than $50,000—will be helped to keep their private health insurance.


This is what Labor are all about: they actually wants to punish those who invest in their own health care. It is just like they have always been with education: they do not like people being able to invest in their own health care. The private health insurance rebate ensures and triggers further private investment in health care. It increases the overall pool of money being spent on health in Australia, and we know from the work of the Productivity Commission and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare that private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia. In 2009 and 2010 private hospitals admitted 3.5 million patients, and they perform most of the elective surgery in Australia. That is what Labor do not like. They want everyone to have to join the queues that they did so much to make longer at the state level over the last decade. The dream of the Labor Party is a national health service—a British-style national health service. The very balance that Neal Blewett designed into the Medicare system, which protected private health insurance and made the rebate that we as citizens get for a medical procedure not dependent upon the venue in which that procedure was performed, is supported by the private health insurance rebate. The rebate guarantees that, regardless of your income, you receive a flat amount to support you investing in your own health care, to support you taking pressure off the public system and to support you freeing up those resources to be used by those who are more needy. As I said, it was all about making it a rebate so that it would be of more value to lower income earners.


What the government does not want people to know is that every one of those households that Senator Fierravanti-Wells talked about—those who are earning less than $30,000 and $50,000—is going to pay more for health insurance because of this bill. We are going to have tens of thousands of people drop out. The government does not want to tell us, because Treasury will not do the modelling and release it, but we have heard from Medibank Private and we know from other players in the sector that this is actually going to mean that the young and the healthy will drop out. It will reduce the quality of the pool of people in private health insurance, and that will mean that the increases in private health insurance costs in coming years will be higher than they otherwise would be. When it comes to the carbon tax, the government does not like to have such comparisons. It likes to pretend that it lives in a world where its assertions are the truth. But they are not, and we know that.


What this Senate needs to do is to ensure that the mistruths—and potentially even the misunderstandings, Senator Feeney—that are put around by the Labor Party and their allies on this, and the dirty deal that was done in the lower house, are exposed so that the people know why they are getting a 10 per cent increase rather than a seven per cent increase in their bill next year. We are talking about the people on below average incomes—the people who save for their own health care because they see it as something that is good for them, good for their families and good for the community. Those people should have the right to know exactly why their premiums are going up faster than they were in previous years. They are going to go up faster because the Labor Party needs to fill various budget black holes that it has created, and it is continuing its 30-year war against the private health industry—the industry that performs the majority of elective surgery in Australia. Why on earth we would want to reduce that, I do not know. It is not like the state hospitals that have been run by the Labor Party for so long are doing such a fantastic job—with the tragedies we heard about in New South Wales and Queensland. It would be a travesty if these bills were not exposed. It is wrong that Labor and its Greens alliance partners are willing to ram this through. We will ensure that all the Australian people know the exact consequences of this legislation.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-03-13,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:14):  I too rise today in support of the motion of the shadow minister for ageing and mental health, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, to refer the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and two related bills to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. This legislation will impact on the federal budget and it is only right and proper that the Senate Standing Committees on Economics examine the legislation in light of the changing economic situation—and I mean the actual economic situation, not the changing political imperatives of the Labor government. When this legislation last entered the Senate, it was referred to the Senate community affairs committee, where the coalition recommended that, rather than punish hard-working Australian families, the Minister for Health and Ageing examine other means of obtaining the required fiscal savings. The coalition supported the government's attempt at fiscal responsibility, especially in light of such consistent failure over time on this key indicator of government performance.


The government is once again putting middle Australia in the spotlight and taking aim, as my two coalition colleagues have mentioned. I will not reiterate the statistics. In its majority report the committee at that time was satisfied that the government had set aside adequate funds to inform and instruct the industry and the public on how these means-tested rebates would work. But, clearly, this has not happened. If I walked down the main street of any town in Australia or asked any of the 40 per cent of regional Australians who have private health insurance how this would affect them, they would not be able to tell me. Australians need to understand how this legislation will affect their bottom line from July 2012 and the Senate needs to assure itself about the holistic impact of this legislation on the nation's bottom line.


Senator Fierravanti-Wells's motion seeks the committee to report in June, allowing plenty of time for all stakeholders to participate in a comprehensive examination in the current economic climate. The government has the numbers today to vote to halt the scrutiny, but it also has the numbers in the legislation committee to adopt a report. If it is such a great piece of legislation, Senator Feeney, let us have a look at it. What is there to hide? This is yet another example of the Labor government doing something in haste without fully understanding its impact and without thorough investigation. In fact, this government's entire time in leadership of our nation has been littered with rushed, poorly implemented policy with unintended consequences. 


I am confident Australians would like to know why Nicola Roxon, the then Minister for Health and Ageing, said in 2009:


The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. 


She then proceeded four months later to introduce this legislation into the House of Representatives—mixed messages from a mixed up Labor government. The government is planning to means test private health insurance rebates at the same time that it has approved a premium rise. The new federal health minister has approved an average rise in private health insurance premiums of 5.6 per cent effective from 1 April. As a result Australians will be paying more for their health insurance under this government.


Means testing families on $160,000 a year is just that—it is mean. This legislation targets the copper and the teacher, for example, in regional Australia, who contribute their taxes, who pay their Medicare levy and who are going to be slugged again. Describing these families as 'millionaires' shows just how out of touch this government is with the day-to-day struggles of working Australians. Penalising people for taking responsibility for their own health care makes no sense. Many regional communities currently have access to private hospitals and the specialists those hospitals bring to town, essentially acting as a hub for regional healthcare delivery. Typically, private hospitals in regional centres have lower occupancy rates, meaning they operate on wafer-thin margins and any erosion in those rates will be magnified in regional hospitals and likely to force cuts to service or, potentially, to cause some private hospitals to close their doors entirely. Forty per cent of regional people have private health insurance and those patients are using these private services, many no doubt relying on them for repeat admissions over the course of a treatment. For ongoing health conditions. these families can ill afford to lose these benefits.


Let us refer it to our committee for scrutiny. Senators are canny folk and I am confident there would be some great recommendations from the committee on how to assist the minister to find the savings for Mr Swan's surplus without slugging middle Australia. How typical, Labor.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-03-13,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (18:19):  I too would like to make a contribution to the debate on the motion moved by Senator Fierravanti-Wells to refer the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012 and two related bills to a committee for inquiry. We know that this is one in a long line of stunts by the opposition to delay the proper progress of legislation through the Senate. Indeed, it is just a delaying tactic and fairly repetitive behaviour on the part of the opposition, but it is in line with their opposition for the sake of opposition.


I note that these bills have already been in public debate for approximately three years and it would be safe to say that all of the issues covered by the bills have been well and truly traversed in debates in this chamber and in Senate estimates. Most of the issues raised in these bills have been traversed ad nauseum by those opposite. That is fair enough, but there is no need to refer them again to a future committee. I note also that the bills are already on the Notice Paper for debate in the Senate this week and this is, properly, where we should be heading—that is, to get on with the debate about these important bills. I note also that already nine coalition senators have their names on the speaking list to contribute to the second reading debate on these bills. Obviously they are clearly ready to talk about the bills, but they have to go through this stunt to make us waste more time of the Senate by talking about referring bills to a committee.


The government wants to proceed with these bills because they are good Labor policy. We believe that private health insurance rebates should be means tested to make it fair for all Australians. It is not fair that Australians on lower to middle incomes are subsidising the private health insurance of Australians on very high incomes, like those of us in here. It is not fair that taxpayers on low incomes who may not be able to afford private health insurance themselves should be subsidising the private health insurance of millionaires. There is another very good reason we should be getting on with debating and passing these bills—that is, the budgetary impact of not doing so.


We know that Australia's health budget is one of the burgeoning budget issues we have to deal with. We do have to take decisive action to make sure that we keep that budget under control and that we focus the health budget on where it needs to be—that is, on services for people and medical assistance in hospitals. That is what people really need. We know that these bills, if they are passed, would save the Australian budget $2.4 billion over the next three years and $100 billion over the next 40 years. That is an amount of money that could be well invested in the health system, but the opposition are saying they do not want to proceed with it. I have to ask them: if they are not going to pass these bills, as they are indicating, then where are they going to find the money so Australia's health system can provide the services Australians need?


They have given us no indication of where they would make up that budget shortfall. They never will give us any indication of where they are going to make up that budget shortfall. We are still trying to find out how the opposition are going to fill the black hole—the crater—of the $70 billion that they are going to foist on the Australian public because they have no concrete proposals for dealing with budgetary matters. They just continue to oppose for the sake of opposing.


These reforms build on the Australian Labor government's great record with regard to health and health reform. Of course, it was a Labor government that brought in Medicare—universal health care for all Australians. It is a very proud part of our history. In terms of the more recent Labor governments, we have tried to address the severe funding shortages that occurred throughout the Howard era—the era when Mr Tony Abbott was the Minister for Health and Ageing and ripped a billion dollars out of the health system.



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator McEWEN:
  We have attempted to redress that by increasing hospital funding by $20 billion since 2008. We have committed more to cancer services, including 22 regional cancer services, Senator Nash. We have committed more than $2.2 billion to mental health—the largest ever mental health package in Australia. We have provided funding for preventative health and for primary health care. We have increased the numbers of doctors and nurses. We have done practical things for Australians.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:24):  This is about the Senate doing its job as a chamber of review. That is what this is about. Senator Fierravanti-Wells has brought forward the statistics in terms of what is going to happen. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realise that the more you raise the price of something the fewer customers you will have. That is just a law of economics. As you raise the price what is going to happen is that people will either lower their amount of cover or pull out of private health insurance. And what will happen then? It will mean more stress—more people relying on the public health system that is run by our state governments and is already under enormous stress.


We just found out last week that there will be a $100 million a year cost to the hospitals for increases in electricity prices because of the carbon tax—$100 million a year for our hospitals. What are we going to do now? We are going to remove the incentive for people to take out private health insurance. The government want to take that away. Yet they are trying to hide from it. They will not let a Senate inquiry go ahead; they are opposing that.


Have a look at the statements of Ms Roxon and former Prime Minister and slain political man Kevin Rudd prior to the 2007 election. The statements were: 'We will not change the private health insurance rebate. That is locked in concrete. We are the Labor people and we will not change that.' And what are they trying to do? They are trying to change it.


The reason Labor have a 31 per cent primary vote is that people do not trust them. They do not trust them on private health insurance. They do not trust them on carbon tax. They do not trust them on managing our economy. The reason they are doing this is they are stone motherless broke. We now have $231 billion worth of gross debt because they wasted so much money. They handed out $900 to people here, there and everywhere. There was the pink batts. There were the school buildings—including a $600,000 kiosk at Tottenham Central School and a $330,000 eight metre by four metre building at Kingstown Public School. The waste of money is incredible.


What are the government going to do now they have run out of money? They are going to pressure our state health system. This is cost shifting. They are simply removing the cost from the federal budget and placing it onto state budgets, which are already under enormous stress. We have seen what has happened to our state hospital system over the last 15 years with the lack of finance and support. All this is about is shifting the cost from the federal budget to the state budgets. Make no mistake about it: people will leave private health insurance—we already have the models on that—or downgrade the cover they have. Many of these people are simply Aussie battlers. When more drop out, the private health insurance companies are going to have to raise their premiums. That is only common sense. Then those Aussie battlers, who will not be affected by this as far as their rebate goes, will see their premiums going up and they will drop out. There is the problem: more strain on our public health system.


People will be lined up at the emergency department of the hospital on a weekend putting more stress on the hospital system. People will have to wait to have surgery carried out. People will leave the private health system. What will happen then? How will those private hospitals survive? This is a threat to the private hospital system as well. More people will be going to the public health system. And it is a betrayal of the promise by Ms Roxon and Mr Rudd prior to the 2007 election. No-one can deny that. We can bring in the printouts. When we get into debate on this bill we will gladly bring in the printouts from the media coverage where they said, 'We will never reduce that.'


As I said, the reason the Labor Party's primary vote is at 31 per cent is that the people of Australia have lost faith and trust in this government. They cannot trust you.




Senator Nash:
  The carbon tax.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Yes, Senator Nash, there is the carbon tax. I will take that interjection. We heard, 'There'll be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' But on 1 July in will come the carbon tax.



Senator Feeney interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  And remember—people like Senator Feeney should remember—that $100 million a year extra cost for electricity in our hospital system throughout Australia. That is $100 million for what? It is for absolutely nothing. That is why we should support this inquiry. At least let the Senate do its job. That is all I ask for—to back Senator Fierravanti-Wells's reference here. Let the Senate do its job. If you vote against this reference you are voting against democracy and the job of this Senate. That is what you will be doing. You want to close it down so that you can rush a bill through for the budget that you have made such a mess of over the last four years.

I grow tired of saying this. Labor is committed to the 30 per cent health insurance rebate.


That quote was in my local newspaper, the Hobart Mercury, from a certain person. I will give those on the other side a hint: the person was also the person who promised undying loyalty to Mr Rudd. And just in case they cannot remember or cannot get the hint as to who it is—if they are scratching around in their heads—I will give them another hint. It was also the person who said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' In case they have not got it yet, that was the solemn promise of Ms Gillard on behalf of the Australian Labor Party.


This is another Labor broken promise. We as a coalition want to put this proposed measure to a Senate inquiry to give the Australian Labor Party the opportunity to explain how that which was such good policy before the election is all of a sudden bad policy after the election. They know they have the numbers—or, I should say, the Greens know they have the numbers, because they have a compliant ALP willing to ram this through the place without proper scrutiny. We will be dividing on this, because we believe the Senate should do its duty and explore this matter fully. (Time expired)

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:38):  Those who assert they support the public hospital system, those who assert they support access to health services for the underprivileged and those who assert the provision of first-class health care as a policy priority should be voting against this Orwellian-named Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2012. Let us make no mistake: this bill is not fair, conceived as it is in the time warp of class warfare and gestated in the womb of destructive envy. This bill will, like everything Labor does, make the bad public hospital situation even worse.


Logic dictates that if government deliberately removes the incentives for people to privately insure and look after themselves, and take responsibility for themselves in matters health, there will be fewer people doing so. In short, there will be fewer people privately insured because as the incentives are removed so is the affordability and inclination. Having fewer people insured means that the risk of those insured is spread over fewer people and as a result premiums will rise, forcing even more out of private health insurance. As people are disincentivised or unable to insure themselves, reliance on the private sector diminishes. As reliance on the private sector diminishes, so reliance on the public sector commensurately increases. 


Due to years of Labor neglect and incompetence, the public hospital system is in disarray. The first-line service providers should not be faulted; indeed, they cannot be faulted. But the system, the incompetent administration, can and does deserve to be faulted. To these overstretched services will be added not hundreds nor thousands but, regrettably, hundreds of thousands of people as they too seek refuge in the public hospital system. Waiting lists will balloon out even further as a result of this measure. Government should have the vision to encourage people to look after themselves. Self-reliance is a great virtue. Self-reliance should be encouraged. Self-reliance needs to be encouraged. Reliance on government or the public purse—in other words, other people's purses—leads to an unmotivated people. Reliance on government leads to dullness in a society. Vibrancy, the desire to progress and the desire to achieve will be stifled.


There will be those who say: 'Why bother with private health insurance? The government will provide.' And there will be those who say, 'Why bother to be self-reliant because the government simply penalises you?' This bill is bad policy. It hurts the aspirational and chokes the great virtue of self-reliance. This bill is bad policy because it will deny those who genuinely need the public hospital system for more equitable access as the queues grow.


Let me also deal with the ugly class warfare mentality built in the past on the tried and failed socialist dogma of equal low-class service for all and the politics of envy, so clearly enunciated by Labor and Greens spokesmen on this issue. As the Greens-Labor alliance struggles to be trusted and believed by our community, it seems that they and their spokesmen will simply repeat the distortions in the hope they will eventually be believed. I remind the Greens and Labor senators that the simple repetition of an untruth does not change its inherent characteristic of untruthfulness, no matter how often it is repeated.


Let us debunk this oft-pedalled myth by the Greens-Labor alliance that under the current system the apprentice will subsidise the health care of the millionaire. Let us just stop and examine that proposition. In doing so, we will observe the deliberate falsehood that it represents. The person earning a taxable income of $1 million pays a Medicare levy of one per cent, amounting to $10,000, despite being privately insured. His insurance will cost, one assumes, thousands of dollars on top of the $10,000 Medicare levy. What that person then gets in return by way of a rebate can be counted in the hundreds of dollars for his $12,000, $13,000 or $14,000 contribution to health care. Now let us go back to the apprentice. On a first-year apprentice's wage, that apprentice would not even be paying a Medicare levy. So why this dishonesty by cabinet ministers from Labor, who repeatedly go out, night after night, on the evening news and on the talkback programs, peddling this falsehood, peddling this myth, hoping beyond hope that they will not be exposed?


We as a coalition will continue to expose this falsehood because it deserves to be exposed. That Labor senators do not even know that first-year apprentices, who earn about $18,000, do not even pay the Medicare levy shows how out of touch they are with the earnings of an apprentice. The Labor Party once upon a time was the proud custodian of the tradespeople of this country. Most of the people who represented the Labor Party actually had a trade under their belt. Nowadays there are more people with a trade under their belt sitting on the coalition side, and that is why we know some of these things which Labor ministers and cabinet ministers have lost touch with. But, despite the incontrovertible evidence, Labor senators and Greens senators will, I predict, get up one after another and regurgitate the untruths fed to them by the factional bosses.


Let me acknowledge that the millionaire is likely to retain his private health insurance. But what about the families, the ones Labor desperately does not want to talk about, which are battling with cost-of-living pressures and battling with the proposed carbon tax and now private health insurance rebates? For them, the rebate is a huge incentive to remain self-reliant. As they struggle to pay off a mortgage, educate their children and pay their power bills and rates, private health insurance will become a possible victim, especially if their health is relatively robust.


As these low- or non-claiming members drop out of private health insurance, the premiums for pensioners will increase—by an estimated 10 per cent above normal increases. This notion that pensioners will not be impacted by the proposed change is as wrong as it is disingenuous. As I doorknock, I am constantly astounded by how many pensioners volunteer that they scrimp and save to pay their private health insurance, usually on a fortnightly basis, as their security blanket. The peace of mind afforded by private health insurance is something they appreciate.




Senator Feeney:
  I doubt it.




Senator ABETZ:
  What they do not appreciate is politicians—like Senator Feeney's interjection just then—messing with the scheme. I know the public reaction in my home state of Tasmania, where we have a surprisingly high rate of self-insurance. Labor, the Greens and the Independent member for Denison will be judged and judged harshly for this short-sighted yet far-reaching emasculation of our health system through this bill.


Like so much of the Greens-Labor agenda, this bill is based on a broken promise. Ms Gillard wrote in my local newspaper:


I grow tired of saying this — Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.


This is another Labor broken promise, like the carbon tax, like the definition of marriage. You go through the issues: time and time again, Labor is the party of broken promises to the Australian people.

To these overstretched services will be added not hundreds nor thousands but, regrettably, hundreds of thousands of people as they too seek refuge in the public hospital system. Waiting lists will balloon out even further as a result of this measure. Government should have the vision to encourage people to look after themselves. Self-reliance is a great virtue. Self-reliance should be encouraged. Self-reliance needs to be encouraged. Reliance on government or the public purse—in other words, other people's purses—leads to an unmotivated people. Reliance on government leads to dullness in a society. Vibrancy, the desire to progress and the desire to achieve will be stifled.


There will be those who say: 'Why bother with private health insurance? The government will provide.' And there will be those who say, 'Why bother to be self-reliant because the government simply penalises you?' This bill is bad policy. It hurts the aspirational and chokes the great virtue of self-reliance. This bill is bad policy because it will deny those who genuinely need the public hospital system for more equitable access as the queues grow.


Let me also deal with the ugly class warfare mentality built in the past on the tried and failed socialist dogma of equal low-class service for all and the politics of envy, so clearly enunciated by Labor and Greens spokesmen on this issue. As the Greens-Labor alliance struggles to be trusted and believed by our community, it seems that they and their spokesmen will simply repeat the distortions in the hope they will eventually be believed. I remind the Greens and Labor senators that the simple repetition of an untruth does not change its inherent characteristic of untruthfulness, no matter how often it is repeated.


Let us debunk this oft-pedalled myth by the Greens-Labor alliance that under the current system the apprentice will subsidise the health care of the millionaire. Let us just stop and examine that proposition. In doing so, we will observe the deliberate falsehood that it represents. The person earning a taxable income of $1 million pays a Medicare levy of one per cent, amounting to $10,000, despite being privately insured. His insurance will cost, one assumes, thousands of dollars on top of the $10,000 Medicare levy. What that person then gets in return by way of a rebate can be counted in the hundreds of dollars for his $12,000, $13,000 or $14,000 contribution to health care. Now let us go back to the apprentice. On a first-year apprentice's wage, that apprentice would not even be paying a Medicare levy. So why this dishonesty by cabinet ministers from Labor, who repeatedly go out, night after night, on the evening news and on the talkback programs, peddling this falsehood, peddling this myth, hoping beyond hope that they will not be exposed?


We as a coalition will continue to expose this falsehood because it deserves to be exposed. That Labor senators do not even know that first-year apprentices, who earn about $18,000, do not even pay the Medicare levy shows how out of touch they are with the earnings of an apprentice. The Labor Party once upon a time was the proud custodian of the tradespeople of this country. Most of the people who represented the Labor Party actually had a trade under their belt. Nowadays there are more people with a trade under their belt sitting on the coalition side, and that is why we know some of these things which Labor ministers and cabinet ministers have lost touch with. But, despite the incontrovertible evidence, Labor senators and Greens senators will, I predict, get up one after another and regurgitate the untruths fed to them by the factional bosses.


Let me acknowledge that the millionaire is likely to retain his private health insurance. But what about the families, the ones Labor desperately does not want to talk about, which are battling with cost-of-living pressures and battling with the proposed carbon tax and now private health insurance rebates? For them, the rebate is a huge incentive to remain self-reliant. As they struggle to pay off a mortgage, educate their children and pay their power bills and rates, private health insurance will become a possible victim, especially if their health is relatively robust.


As these low- or non-claiming members drop out of private health insurance, the premiums for pensioners will increase—by an estimated 10 per cent above normal increases. This notion that pensioners will not be impacted by the proposed change is as wrong as it is disingenuous. As I doorknock, I am constantly astounded by how many pensioners volunteer that they scrimp and save to pay their private health insurance, usually on a fortnightly basis, as their security blanket. The peace of mind afforded by private health insurance is something they appreciate.




Senator Feeney:
  I doubt it.




Senator ABETZ:
  What they do not appreciate is politicians—like Senator Feeney's interjection just then—messing with the scheme. I know the public reaction in my home state of Tasmania, where we have a surprisingly high rate of self-insurance. Labor, the Greens and the Independent member for Denison will be judged and judged harshly for this short-sighted yet far-reaching emasculation of our health system through this bill.


Like so much of the Greens-Labor agenda, this bill is based on a broken promise. Ms Gillard wrote in my local newspaper:


I grow tired of saying this — Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.


This is another Labor broken promise, like the carbon tax, like the definition of marriage. You go through the issues: time and time again, Labor is the party of broken promises to the Australian people.


Debate interrupted.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:50):  I rise tonight to talk briefly about a book that I launched in Collins Street in Melbourne. It is unusual for me to be launching a book in Collins Street, especially with Collins Street being the home of capitalism in Australia. The name of the book is Scotland's Radical Exports: the Scots abroad—how they shaped politics and trade unions. I thought it was quite delightful to be—




Senator Feeney:
  Was Senator Macdonald there?




Senator CAMERON:
  No, Senator Macdonald was not there. Senator Macdonald's tartan tie was not even there. And Senator Macdonald—I must disappoint him—did not get any mention in this book about Scotland's radicals abroad and how they shaped politics and trade unions. The book was written by a former president of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Pat Kelly, and the book is fantastic. It is a great book. I ask everyone who has an opportunity to do so to have a look at the contribution that the Scots have made all around the world. Pat traverses and chronicles the struggles, defeats and victories of the trade union movement in Australia, the US, Canada and New Zealand. Central to those struggles was and is the role of Scottish trade unionists. Many Scottish trade unionists and their families paid a massive price as the owners of capital victimised, assaulted, blackballed and vilified union activists. As I said, being in Collins Street to launch this book was quite an experience.


We talk about globalisation and we hear a lot about some of the things the Scots have done, such as bringing culture and engineering excellence to the world. They have taken economics around the world, and they have also taken trade unions around the world. Wherever capitalism went, the Scots trade unionists were there. I am very happy to be one of them. This book talks about the values and principles that the Scots brought to trade unionism and the effect of that around the world—and particularly in Australia. In Scotland they did lots of education during the early years of unionisation—mostly self-education. Trade unionists were educated in Marxism, they were educated in economics, they were educated in politics. They were also educated in reading, debate, critical analysis and political analysis. As I said when I was launching this fantastic book, you can be smart, you can be well read, but you need values, principles and courage—and nobody had more values, principles and courage than some of the leading Scottish trade union officials who emigrated from Scotland and set up trade unionism around the world.


This book deals not just with the leaders of the Scottish trade union movement; it also deals with rank and file trade unionists. When I came to Australia and worked at the Garden Island dockyard, there were lots of Scottish accents. When I went to the Liddell power station, there were lots of Scottish engineers and Scottish accents. They were doing a great job keeping the wheels of this country turning. They also had great solidarity and commitment. The families of unionists did it really tough. Some of the unionists outlined in the book include William Wilson, the leader of the US miners who became the Secretary of the Department of Labor. He played a huge role in ensuring that workers got decent rights. I did not realise until I read the book that Philip Murray, born in Blantyre and who was the head of the steelworkers union in the US, had a street in my home town of Bellshill named after him. There are references to Doug Fraser from the United Auto Workers union, one of the key trade unionists in the history of the United States; JB McLachlan, from the Nova Scotia miners; and Tommy Douglas, who was the leader of the NDP in Canada. He was a Scottish trade unionist who went over there and got involved in politics, and only a few years ago he was voted the greatest Canadian of all time—a Scots emigrant to Canada. He was voted the greatest Canadian because of his trade union activities, because of his political activities and because he started the health system in Canada that created that huge difference between the United States and Canada.


The book also refers to great names in Australia such as William G Spence, who founded the Australian Workers Union. If you read the book, you will see he founded three unions. He did a fantastic job of organising during the great disputes, including the shearers dispute and the maritime dispute. He was an eight-year-old during the Eureka Stockade, and he was at the Eureka Stockade with his father. He knew plenty about deprivation and he knew plenty about trying to make sure that workers came together to form trade unions and get decent rights and not be treated simply as the goods and chattels of employers. Another great trade unionist who came to Australia, at the age of 18, was Andrew Fisher—the first Labor Prime Minister. It is interesting to note that Andrew Fisher was blackballed in Scotland as a union activist—he had to leave Scotland and come to Australia. I know Senator Williams would like to blackball me from the Senate, but I am going to be around for a little while. Andrew Fisher came to Australia and in 1910 won the first election for the Labor Party, on a very socialist platform, to bring Australia into modern times.


Of the 25 members of the first Labor caucus, 13 were Scottish. I would not have had a problem with my accent in that caucus—I think I would have been understood pretty well. The Scots made a huge contribution not only to trade unions in Australia but also to politics. The book Scotland's Radical Exports: The Scots abroad—how they shaped politics and trade unions is a must-read for anyone who has been influenced by a Scottish trade union official or has parents or friends who have been involved in the trade union movement in Australia. The union movement is not just about the Scots, but the Scots have made huge contributions around the world. As I said earlier, the Scots are well-known for their contribution to engineering and to capitalism, so Scottish entrepreneurs always had that check and balance from the Scottish trade unionists. I am glad I am keeping the tradition alive in the Senate and in the Labor Party.


It is interesting that so many Scots have made such huge contributions. If Senator Williams has a look at the book he will find that there is actually a chapter about me. I am very pleased about that. I do not know why I am in there with such Labor luminaries as William G Spence and Andrew Fisher, but I actually do get a mention in the book. I want to try to keep the whole thing going. I do not want to say too soon that it has all come to an end, because there is lots of work for Scottish trade unionists and there is lots of work for progressive Scottish politicians in the Australian parliament, especially in the Senate. When you hear the arguments being put up from the other side, you can tell that there will always be room for progressive political argument here.


I would recommend reading the book to anyone who gets the opportunity—to look at the tragic circumstances that many Scots founds themselves in. Being locked up for five years because of your political activism in the US is a big call, but that was done. It was about advancing the rights of working people and we should continue to do that. I am very pleased to have launched the book in the seat of capitalism—Collins Street. (Time expired)

Senator Waters
  asked the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, upon notice, on 2 February 2012:


With reference to the proposed strategic assessment of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area:


(1) How are comments made by a spokeswoman from the department, reported by Australian Associated Press on 11 January 2012, suggesting that the strategic assessment will focus on identifying and assessing cumulative impacts from major industry and port developments, including ongoing dredging projects such as that at Gladstone, which could affect the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, consistent with the following statements:


(a) by the Minister on Four Corners, aired on 7 November 2011, that 'I'd prefer a situation where as much as possible is able to be dealt with once we've concluded the strategic assessment, but people have legal rights under law to commence the process, and those processes continue in the interim'; and


(b) by the departmental Deputy Secretary, Ms Dripps, during the 2011 Supplementary Budget estimates hearing of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee on 18 October 2011, that 'Any proposal for development along the coast of Queensland that was likely to occur after that point [the conclusion of the strategic assessment] would be included in the strategic assessment'.


(2) What implications, if any, will the strategic assessment have on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) assessment process, conditions and outcomes for each of the following types of projects that are having, or are likely to have, a significant impact on the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage values:


(a) projects currently undergoing a project level EPBC Act assessment, where a final decision is: (i) likely, or (ii) unlikely, to be made prior to the conclusion of the strategic assessment;


(b) projects that have been referred for project level EPBC Act assessment since the strategic assessment was announced; and 


(c) projects that will be referred prior to the conclusion of the strategic assessment.


(3) What implications, if any, will the strategic assessment have on the EPBC Act assessment process, conditions and outcomes for each of the following types of projects that are having, or are likely to have, a significant impact on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park:


(a) projects currently undergoing a project level EPBC Act assessment, where a final decision is: (i) likely, or (ii) unlikely, to be made prior to the conclusion of the strategic assessment;


(b) projects that have been referred for project level EPBC Act assessment since the strategic assessment was announced; and 


(c) projects that will be referred prior to the conclusion of the strategic assessment.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2012-03-13,"



Senator Conroy:
  The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:


(1) The comprehensive strategic assessment of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area aims to protect the environment, support more efficient and effective regulation of future coastal development and meet Australia's obligations to protect the World Heritage values of the property. It will achieve this by examining direct, indirect and cumulative impacts from existing, planned and potential future coastal development activities.  


The strategic assessment can not “suspend” or “switch off” assessment and approval processes for individual actions that have already been referred or are referred before completion of the strategic assessment. Consistent with legal requirements, assessments will continue for individual project proposals in the Queensland coastal zone or Great Barrier Reef. Proponents of controlled actions will be expected to meet a high standard of assessment, including consideration of cumulative impacts, where appropriate, to ensure that any individual project assessment does not compromise the strategic assessment process. 


The Australian Government will strongly encourage all proponents of actions in the Great Barrier Reef to have their proposals considered as part of the strategic assessment process rather than individually, however, the government is required to consider all valid proposals referred in accordance with the law.


(2) Refer to (1) above. Actions that have been referred or are referred before the completion of the strategic assessment will be assessed stringently in accordance with usual assessment and approval provisions of the EPBC Act to ensure ongoing protection of the World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef.


(3) Refer to (1) above. Proposed actions that have been referred or are referred before the completion of the strategic assessment will be assessed rigorously in accordance with the usual assessment and approval provisions of the EPBC Act to ensure ongoing protection of the environment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.
