"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, I present the committee's report entitled Connecting Australia!—Wireless broadband, together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This unanimous report reflects seven months of intense work involving eight public hearings at major Australian cities, several private briefings by officers of government agencies, and the consideration of 60 submissions from the public. These submissions covered a broad range of views. They included industry participants such as Telstra, Optus, Vodafone, Alcatel, ArrayComm Inc., Motorola, Cisco Systems, Nortel, Integrity Data Systems, SR Telecom, m.Net Corporation, Ericsson Australia, AirNet, and Soul Pattinson Telecommunications. They also included community radio groups like Melbourne Wireless and others.
We heard also from educational bodies like the Western Australian Department of Education, and the Australian Information and Communications Technology in Education Committee. In addition, we took into account submissions from state, territory and local governments, as well as university researchers. We heard from organisations representing the hearing impaired, including the Australian Association of the Deaf and the Australian Communication Exchange. We also heard from industry commentators and, of course, the Australian Communications Authority. To all of our submitters, we say thank you. We also thank the many people who addressed us at the public hearings.
Our report addresses each of the terms of reference that were set by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts when he first suggested the committee initiate an inquiry into wireless broadband technologies. That was in April this year. So, in tabling today, members will appreciate that the committee has moved speedily to bring down this report. I want to thank members and the committee secretariat for their cooperation in this regard. The committee's 14 recommendations are aimed at improving the take-up of wireless broadband in Australia, especially in regional areas.
The conclusion reached by the committee is that the solution to the last mile service involves a mix of technologies, both wire line and wireless. Clearly, however, for regional and remote Australia, where wire line solutions are not economically viable in the short to medium term, the last mile problem could be addressed by a variety of wireless techniques. Two possibilities are Nortel's CDMA2000 and Lucent's 450 MHz CDMA. The committee appreciate that spectrum availability for 400-500 MHz is a problem and so we recommend that the ACA consider allocating spectrum in this range for CDMA-450 on an experimental basis.
Further, a possible way of bringing broadband services to remote areas involves the use of analog TV bands which will not be employed in the future for digital television services in Australia. These TV bands are able to provide long-distance services without the need for expensive infrastructure. They are to be abandoned at the completion of the analog-digital simulcasts, which will occur in 2008 in urban Australia and somewhat later in regional Australia. Some of the bands are available now in certain areas. Several groups are working on developing technologies for these low-frequency bands, including the ANU BushLAN group, Baltech Pty Ltd and ntl, with its Bushnet proposal. The committee recommends that the ACA and the ABA develop a scheme to allow the trial use of unallocated TV channels for rural wireless broadband links with a view to such spectrum being made available if the trials are successful. This has the potential to provide a uniquely Australian solution to the worldwide problem of long-distance last mile Internet provision.
Inexpensive wireless technologies such as these longer wavelength technologies and 802.11—WiFi—could be used to `pull' broadband 3G wireless and wire line infrastructure to customers by creating the business case for broadband. In this way, a cheap wireless rollout could later be followed by a wire line rollout providing additional or better services. For both urban and regional Australia, the most exciting technology for wireless broadband is 802.11. The elimination of a carrier licence on the ISM bands for both commercial and non-commercial operation would be a simple regulatory change which would unleash its potential, and we recommend that this be done. For those areas of Australia where DSL or other broadband wire line connections are not yet in place, the committee recommend that the ACA should consider raising the power limits on the ISM bands to the equipment's rated values. This should encourage the wider availability of broadband services. In view of the interest that these changes may evoke in the community, the committee recommend that the ACA provide educational services to interested parties, whether they be carriers or non-carriers. 
We also recommend that training programs be developed for prospective wireless operators in relation to the wireless market and to customer requirements. In the event that these measures lead to much greater use of 802.11 equipment, they may result in co-channel interference and hence the need for a conflict resolution service of some kind to be offered by the ACA. That is another recommendation made by the committee.
Should an organisation using 802.11 establish a business case in a certain area, then a profitable company operating on the ISM band could be given the opportunity to move to licensed spectrum. This may be, for example, a mechanism to prove a 3G business model. We recommend that the ACA and the ABA develop procedures to facilitate the migration of wireless activities from ISM bands to adjacent licensed spectrum by streamlining equipment qualification procedures.
Greater use of the ISM bands increases the possibility that someone might attempt to use them for illegal activities. The committee consider that the ISM band should be treated in the same manner as all other telecommunications with respect to its capability for interception by the police. Therefore we recommend that a standing bureau or a working party be established to maintain a watching brief on the potential for WiFi and other ISM networks to be used for illegal activities.
In order to facilitate the provision of Internet services by small wireless service providers, the committee recommends that the ACA and ACCC develop a mechanism to enable such providers to negotiate wholesale prices for Internet backbone connections. This is particularly important for the delivery of broadband services in areas where DSL/wireline broadband connections do not yet exist. The committee considers that impediments to the interoperation of wireless ISPs and their access to the Internet backbone should be removed.
The committee noted concern about the nature of spectrum licensing procedures. Some witnesses were worried that the cost of spectrum licences is excluding small players and that services are not being provided to non-profitable regions that are under a spectrum licence covering a more profitable urbanised area. Some spectrum allocations have not been utilised owing to the fact that the profitability of the business operation on that spectrum does not justify the price of the spectrum licence in the first place. We therefore call on the ACA and the ABA to establish a spectrum bureau to examine these issues, including considering regionally adjusted spectrum auction reserve prices and financing terms.
Some submitters expressed serious concern about the tenure of spectrum licences. The committee recommends that the ACA consider improving the system of licence renewal. Given the trend toward closer convergence of broadcasting, telecommunications and information technology issues, the committee calls upon the government to consider replacing the existing regulatory bodies with one central regulator. The committee strongly believes that the benefits of new wireless broadband technology should flow to everyone in the Australian community. In order that the hearing impaired are not excluded, the government may need to provide some specific encouragement to the industry to take their needs into account; and we recommend accordingly. 
Wireless broadband has an important role to play in extending the reach of broadband services within Australia, but there is no one particular technology that can solve all of our telecommunications problems. A mix of technologies will be required. The market should be permitted to determine, over time, which ones best suit particular applications. The government should maintain a general regulatory policy of technology neutrality—not favouring any particular technology, whether it be wireless or wire line. Within this overall setting, it is desirable for specific measures to be implemented to improve the understanding and takeup of wireless broadband. I believe the committee's recommendations, if adopted by the government, will go a long way toward achieving this desirable end.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I concur particularly with the last remark made by the member for Sturt, the Chair of the Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I fully endorse everything that has been said by him with respect to the findings of committee and also the processes which we undertook.
An important element to underline is the fact that, in every one of the 14 recommendations put forward by the committee, the decision was unanimous. As well as being unanimous in its recommendations, this was a committee that worked extremely well throughout its entire period of operation. It was a very quick span of time within which to put a report together. It is an excellent example of how the parliament can work cross-party as a useful tool for the community at large, almost as a fulcrum between the community and the government. It is very important to note, firstly, that that process can work as well as it did, and it did so because of the openness of the members on the committee to look at a completely new and challenging area. Most of the matters we dealt with were entirely new to just about everyone on the committee. The matters were quite complex and technical and people were open to looking at them afresh. 
Secondly, the secretariat did—as all of our parliamentary committee secretariats do—an enormous job of organising the committee's basic work. Thirdly, the intensity brought by the people giving evidence, and their genuine fervour for this area, helped to enliven the process. There was terrific communciation between those who gave evidence, the members of the committee and the committee support staff. It is a fabulous example, in an area that is challenging and exciting. It is challenging and exciting because it goes to the core of some of the great challenges that face Australia at the moment. We have always had the key problem of the tyranny of distance. The overland telegraph helped to overcome that, lessening the distance between Australia and the rest of the world. We know that broadband communications and the use of Internet technologies can further shrink the distance between Australia and our overseas markets, in particular as we enter a period of economic change. It has really been going on for more than a century, but it is increasingly taking up pace and direction, and that is moving towards selling knowledge goods rather than just selling physical goods. 
Australia has had a tremendous history of investing our intellectual capital in improving the way we do things in areas of economic activity. However, we have also had a history where a lot of that has been lacking and we have not got as much out of it as we could have. This new area is one where we can take our whole range of capacities and create an Australia that is knitted together more effectively.
The core reason that this committee's investigations are important is that broadband has not yet been taken up broadly within Australia. That is the point that we started from. We said that here is an enabling technology—one that can bring Australian people closer together, one that can make our economy work domestically much more effectively and one that can give us a platform of connectivity to the rest of the world to enable us to expand our exporting capacity—but it is one that is not yet working properly in the wired area. So we looked at why that was the case and we looked at the possibilities in the wireless area that would allow a better conjunction of the use of broadband. 
We found that it was apparent that: (1) you need a cluster of different technical and technological approaches to meet Australia's communication needs, and that developing that cluster is very important; and (2) the price point is probably the key factor determining why we have not had a great uptake of broadband in Australia, and it is one key thing we need to drive towards in the future. On top of that, the next two to five years will probably be the greatest for prospectivity, hope and movement we have seen in wireless broadband. Accordingly, this particular report occurs at a time when the future is opening up in the wireless broadband area. We are happy to have received the evidence we had and to have been able to present a report as strong, well developed and thoughtful as this. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Pearce, Christopher, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—Firstly, I support the remarks made by the member for Sturt and the member for Blaxland. In making my remarks today about the report of the Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts titled Connecting Australia!—Wireless broadband,I would like to set the scene by touching firstly on the broad area of technology and its value to our society. The Internet has changed the way we live. It has provided people from all walks of life with a true window to the world right from their own lounge room. As we have seen in many areas of technological development, such as television, the video recorder, the compact disc player, the mobile telephone and many more newer inventions, Australians love to embrace new technology. We are seeing this trend yet again with the Internet as Australians increasingly become more and more comfortable with it. We now find that many Australians are frequently utilising it in a myriad of ways on a day-to-day basis—in fact, on an hour-to-hour basis and a minute-to-minute basis.
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and many industry analysts, in Australia today, with a population of some 19.7 million people and over 7½ million homes, we have over 4½ million homes with a computer and over 3.6 million Internet-ready households. Of these, there are an estimated 300,000 broadband-enabled households. This means that every second house in Australia has the Internet and that Australia is very well placed to further leverage and maximise the opportunities that come from technological innovation and, in particular, from broadband.
There is often confusion, complexity and, indeed, an element of mystery surrounding the area of technology when one starts to talk about it. This confusion is more real than ever when you get into the area of broadband. Quite simply, broadband is nothing more than the term given to a service that provides quick access to information—it is like having an express checkout lane to the Internet. When we talk about wireless broadband, it is simply accessing information quickly while being mobile; in others words, not being plugged into or hamstrung by a hole in the wall that we typically use for other media services.
The presence of broadband itself has significantly increased in Australia in recent times. However, despite the recent growth, there remains discussion around the key areas of broadband price, access, use and, indeed, need. The committee's report will be a valuable vehicle for further discussion around these issues and for the progression of several new initiatives for this important area.
As we have heard, the report is the result of over six months work by the committee members and the committee secretariat. The committee received 60 submissions during the inquiry. What is particularly worth noting is the diverse array of people and organisations that made submissions. For example, submissions were received from private individuals with a keen interest in this area through to some of Australia's major corporations. As a result, the committee was provided with a broad range of representations that has led, I believe, to an objective and technologically non-biased report that will prove useful in furthering the debate around this important initiative. 
The report puts forward a total of 14 recommendations. Importantly, in chapter 8 of the report there is discussion on the trends affecting wireless broadband into the future: trends like the convergence of telecommunications, IT and broadcasting—that worldwide trend that is converging those three areas into the broad area of ICT. Technology and how Australia embraces it and maximises it is a key plank to our future. Broadband, both wire lined and wireless, are a fundamental part of this. I commend the report to the House.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—Like my colleagues, I am very pleased to be part of presenting the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Standing Committee report Connecting Australia!—Wireless broadband to parliament. The inquiry conducted by our committee was particularly worth while and very informative. The provision of wireless broadband is a complex area of new technologies, and much technical analysis of the present options being introduced and trialed in Australia was required. The report gives an excellent overview of these technologies and, for someone like me who was not aware of them, it is a wonderful text in its own way. It also explores the flexibility and mobility which will be required more and more in communications and information in this current information age. Obviously the use of wireless communications will increase.
The report takes the view that government should not attempt to dictate the type of technology used to implement wireless broadband in Australia, recommending instead that government adopt a technology neutral approach. That position is obviously supported by all the committee and is strongly recommended given the wonderful initiatives being taken. However, it is difficult for the CIT industry to address the other issues such as equity and affordability in access, or accelerating uptake and encouraging regional and rural initiatives. The report goes a long way in making recommendations that, should they be adopted by government, will certainly assist in those very important areas.
Particular analysis of the last mile, taking wireless broadband to remote and isolated areas where cost and access are more difficult, has been a major feature of the inquiry and I congratulate all that have been involved in it. I join the member for Blaxland in acknowledging the benefit of the report and the work of all who contributed to this report. I also congratulate the participants and the many people who willingly made submissions to the inquiry, who shared their expertise and experiences and expressed their views and advice in a frank and honest way. The report is obviously much improved because of the quality of that input. The report's recommendations give good guidance on options and ways forward. The chairman, the member for Sturt, covered those technical recommendations particularly well.
The report cannot cover all the issues, but it has played a most important role in highlighting other areas that need to be looked at in future and what an incredible area this will be for government in the challenges that lie ahead. The report makes recommendations on the needs of the disabled community, particularly hearing impaired people, which need careful attention. Due to its size, the market will not attract much attention from commercial providers, but it is absolutely essential that government finds ways to assist the take up of modern technology that is mobile, flexible and attractive, particularly to young people with disabilities. Equitable and affordable access in regional and rural Australia is something that we are all very aware of and the report goes some way to doing something about it. The report highlights—and I congratulate the regional presenters—problems in regional Australia and will assist regional areas, should the recommendations be followed. E-business is ready to assist in rural places and, should the report be adopted, will be encouraged to do so. Arising from the information we gained, another area the government may look at in future reports and inquiries is the amazing application of wireless broadband to transport. Being part of the committee, we realised the opportunities for the use of this technology in the transport industry. 
Finally, I point out that there is much more to be done in encouraging the take up of this sort of technology. One of the saddest submissions—and I have had it in other committees as well—has been the Ericsson experience, which demonstrates just how important it is for us to assist companies which are willing to buy into this area. We certainly need to look at e-education, e-medicine and e-transport, which I talked about before, to make our market more reactive to the needs of this industry. I register my appreciation to the chairman, the member for Sturt, for his inclusive and encouraging manner in conducting this inquiry. I commend the report to the parliament for its consideration.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I am happy to begin my second innings, having bowled myself out in the first one, but I have only five minutes to go. I want to thank Brendan Egan, who assisted the committee so well during the early part of the hearings before he took up a job at Austrade. Given that we had a report to write and Brendan was not readily to hand—although he provided a summary of where we might go— invaluable assistance came to us from Professor Harris and Dr Borg, who gave unbiased evidence to the committee. We thank them for their work in preparing the report for us and putting a great deal of meat on the bones of that report. They did a tremendous job in an extremely difficult area.
As with most reports, we hope that we will get a bit of a run with regard to this report, Connecting Australia!—Wireless broadband. We know that people will have a bit of a look at the executive summary and we hope that they will look at the recommendations, which are extremely strong. When that happens, what will come out of it will possibly be a very human story, one which struck us very strongly while we were hearing the evidence. It relates to recommendation 12, which recommends the Commonwealth develop the means to provide hearing impaired people with mobile telephones compatible with hearing aids, portable wireless devices that can communicate through the National Relay Service and appropriately adapted video compression and transmission technology for video communication using sign language.
Every member of the committee who heard the evidence of hearing impaired people was tremendously impressed: one, with their capacity and fluency; two, with the real problems that they try to overcome and the fact that they bear an enormous cost relative to the costs that other people face. Telstra could go a long way to helping these people by looking at the current charge mechanisms. New technologies such as this offer much increased and better access for people who are hearing impaired, particularly if their first language is a spoken language. For the hearing impaired whose first language is sign language, this report is an indication that we can assist them in communicating fluently, effectively and cogently and in arguing extremely strongly, effectively, theatrically and dramatically within the community.
—Order! The honourable member for Blaxland's dexterity may have been challenged in saying that he bowled himself out. In this case—I think it may be topical—he has been caught by the standing orders because the time allotted for statements has expired. Does the member for Sturt wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?

That the House take note of the report.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

The Internet has changed the way we live. It has provided people from all walks of life with a true window to the world right from their own lounge room. As we have seen in many areas of technological development, such as television, the video recorder, the compact disc player, the mobile telephone and many more newer inventions, Australians love to embrace new technology. We are seeing this trend yet again with the Internet as Australians increasingly become more and more comfortable with it. We now find that many Australians are frequently utilising it in a myriad of ways on a day-to-day basis—in fact, on an hour-to-hour basis and a minute-to-minute basis.
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and many industry analysts, in Australia today, with a population of some 19.7 million people and over 7½ million homes, we have over 4½ million homes with a computer and over 3.6 million Internet-ready households. Of these, there are an estimated 300,000 broadband-enabled households. This means that every second house in Australia has the Internet and that Australia is very well placed to further leverage and maximise the opportunities that come from technological innovation and, in particular, from broadband.
There is often confusion, complexity and, indeed, an element of mystery surrounding the area of technology when one starts to talk about it. This confusion is more real than ever when you get into the area of broadband. Quite simply, broadband is nothing more than the term given to a service that provides quick access to information—it is like having an express checkout lane to the Internet. When we talk about wireless broadband, it is simply accessing information quickly while being mobile; in others words, not being plugged into or hamstrung by a hole in the wall that we typically use for other media services.
The presence of broadband itself has significantly increased in Australia in recent times. However, despite the recent growth, there remains discussion around the key areas of broadband price, access, use and, indeed, need. The committee's report will be a valuable vehicle for further discussion around these issues and for the progression of several new initiatives for this important area.
As we have heard, the report is the result of over six months work by the committee members and the committee secretariat. The committee received 60 submissions during the inquiry. What is particularly worth noting is the diverse array of people and organisations that made submissions. For example, submissions were received from private individuals with a keen interest in this area through to some of Australia's major corporations. As a result, the committee was provided with a broad range of representations that has led, I believe, to an objective and technologically non-biased report that will prove useful in furthering the debate around this important initiative. 
The report puts forward a total of 14 recommendations. Importantly, in chapter 8 of the report there is discussion on the trends affecting wireless broadband into the future: trends like the convergence of telecommunications, IT and broadcasting—that worldwide trend that is converging those three areas into the broad area of ICT. Technology and how Australia embraces it and maximises it is a key plank to our future. Broadband, both wire lined and wireless, are a fundamental part of this. I commend the report to the House.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—Like my colleagues, I am very pleased to be part of presenting the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Standing Committee report Connecting Australia!—Wireless broadband to parliament. The inquiry conducted by our committee was particularly worth while and very informative. The provision of wireless broadband is a complex area of new technologies, and much technical analysis of the present options being introduced and trialed in Australia was required. The report gives an excellent overview of these technologies and, for someone like me who was not aware of them, it is a wonderful text in its own way. It also explores the flexibility and mobility which will be required more and more in communications and information in this current information age. Obviously the use of wireless communications will increase.
The report takes the view that government should not attempt to dictate the type of technology used to implement wireless broadband in Australia, recommending instead that government adopt a technology neutral approach. That position is obviously supported by all the committee and is strongly recommended given the wonderful initiatives being taken. However, it is difficult for the CIT industry to address the other issues such as equity and affordability in access, or accelerating uptake and encouraging regional and rural initiatives. The report goes a long way in making recommendations that, should they be adopted by government, will certainly assist in those very important areas.
Particular analysis of the last mile, taking wireless broadband to remote and isolated areas where cost and access are more difficult, has been a major feature of the inquiry and I congratulate all that have been involved in it. I join the member for Blaxland in acknowledging the benefit of the report and the work of all who contributed to this report. I also congratulate the participants and the many people who willingly made submissions to the inquiry, who shared their expertise and experiences and expressed their views and advice in a frank and honest way. The report is obviously much improved because of the quality of that input. The report's recommendations give good guidance on options and ways forward. The chairman, the member for Sturt, covered those technical recommendations particularly well.
The report cannot cover all the issues, but it has played a most important role in highlighting other areas that need to be looked at in future and what an incredible area this will be for government in the challenges that lie ahead. The report makes recommendations on the needs of the disabled community, particularly hearing impaired people, which need careful attention. Due to its size, the market will not attract much attention from commercial providers, but it is absolutely essential that government finds ways to assist the take up of modern technology that is mobile, flexible and attractive, particularly to young people with disabilities. Equitable and affordable access in regional and rural Australia is something that we are all very aware of and the report goes some way to doing something about it. The report highlights—and I congratulate the regional presenters—problems in regional Australia and will assist regional areas, should the recommendations be followed. E-business is ready to assist in rural places and, should the report be adopted, will be encouraged to do so. Arising from the information we gained, another area the government may look at in future reports and inquiries is the amazing application of wireless broadband to transport. Being part of the committee, we realised the opportunities for the use of this technology in the transport industry. 
Finally, I point out that there is much more to be done in encouraging the take up of this sort of technology. One of the saddest submissions—and I have had it in other committees as well—has been the Ericsson experience, which demonstrates just how important it is for us to assist companies which are willing to buy into this area. We certainly need to look at e-education, e-medicine and e-transport, which I talked about before, to make our market more reactive to the needs of this industry. I register my appreciation to the chairman, the member for Sturt, for his inclusive and encouraging manner in conducting this inquiry. I commend the report to the parliament for its consideration.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,0,2,speech
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I am happy to begin my second innings, having bowled myself out in the first one, but I have only five minutes to go. I want to thank Brendan Egan, who assisted the committee so well during the early part of the hearings before he took up a job at Austrade. Given that we had a report to write and Brendan was not readily to hand—although he provided a summary of where we might go— invaluable assistance came to us from Professor Harris and Dr Borg, who gave unbiased evidence to the committee. We thank them for their work in preparing the report for us and putting a great deal of meat on the bones of that report. They did a tremendous job in an extremely difficult area.
As with most reports, we hope that we will get a bit of a run with regard to this report, Connecting Australia!—Wireless broadband. We know that people will have a bit of a look at the executive summary and we hope that they will look at the recommendations, which are extremely strong. When that happens, what will come out of it will possibly be a very human story, one which struck us very strongly while we were hearing the evidence. It relates to recommendation 12, which recommends the Commonwealth develop the means to provide hearing impaired people with mobile telephones compatible with hearing aids, portable wireless devices that can communicate through the National Relay Service and appropriately adapted video compression and transmission technology for video communication using sign language.
Every member of the committee who heard the evidence of hearing impaired people was tremendously impressed: one, with their capacity and fluency; two, with the real problems that they try to overcome and the fact that they bear an enormous cost relative to the costs that other people face. Telstra could go a long way to helping these people by looking at the current charge mechanisms. New technologies such as this offer much increased and better access for people who are hearing impaired, particularly if their first language is a spoken language. For the hearing impaired whose first language is sign language, this report is an indication that we can assist them in communicating fluently, effectively and cogently and in arguing extremely strongly, effectively, theatrically and dramatically within the community.
—Order! The honourable member for Blaxland's dexterity may have been challenged in saying that he bowled himself out. In this case—I think it may be topical—he has been caught by the standing orders because the time allotted for statements has expired. Does the member for Sturt wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?
Mr PYNE (Sturt) (1.00 p.m.)—I move:
That the House take note of the report.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted.
—In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises that:
(a)	young people have a diversity of talent and can provide a fresh insight into the creative industries;
(b)	there is a need for positive promotion of young people and their achievements;
(c)	young people wish to advance themselves by utilising work placement and work experience programs; and
(d)	young people are willing to promote and enhance positive programs of a range of issues such as multiculturalism, education, the environment and social justice issues, including asylum seekers; and
(2)	urges the Government to:
(a)	organise a collaborative effort by schools in local areas to provide the opportunity for students to audition, take part in and display their individual talents in a musical performance, with the help of local sponsorship and government funding, to provide a professional opportunity for students in creative areas; 
(b)	provide increased resources to support mechanisms to students in order to enhance educational opportunities and outcomes, including library facilities, syllabus management and student support infrastructure;
(c)	provide incentives to employers to encourage their participation in work experience and work placement programs and to address the public liability insurance issues that are threatening such programs; and
(d)	create youth sport and recreation facilities where young people can physically participate and interact with each other to promote better physical and mental well-being.
It gives me a great deal of pleasure to move this motion today. This is the second private member's motion that I have moved this year on youth issues. Each year, I host a Blacktown Youth Orientation, the BYO, in my office. Each year we get a number of students and youth leaders from around the electorate together to discuss the issues that they see as important to them. While my staff help out, the day is pretty much run by the participants, who set the agenda and talk about the issues that they consider important. The final session of the BYO is the drafting of a motion for debate in this place. The words are written by the participants themselves, and it is a credit to them that it is being debated so soon after this year's BYO. 
There are many issues listed in this motion, and if one looks at the previous motion, debated on 17 June, that arose from last year's BYO, one will see some similarities. The issue of perception comes through strongly in both motions. Many young people believe that the perception of youth, particularly in Western Sydney, is an incorrect one. As the motion states, young people have a vast array of skills and talents that need appropriate recognition. This motion differs from its predecessor in one major issue that was discussed on the day—that is the availability of quality workplace experiences. Every school has some form of work experience program where students are placed in workplaces for a period of time to gain an insight into the type of environment that awaits them when they join the work force. In some programs, it is one day each week for a term and for others it is a one-week block. The programs and their quality vary greatly across the school systems.
The members of the BYO spoke about their various experiences—some were good, others not so good. They also identified several barriers to a good workplace experience. The number of employers willing to take on students for work experience is falling. It is getting harder to place students in the first place. I acknowledge that it is difficult for employers. Many jobs require a great deal of training, and a two-week block for someone who will not be there after it finishes makes it very difficult for employers to put in the required resources. This motion talks about the incentives for employers to take on students for work experience. Exactly what incentives would be appropriate is something for another debate at another time, but members should give some thought to how we can improve the situation.
Some of the participants in the BYO have gone on to bigger and better things. I spoke last time of Eshan Fallahi, who became a delegate to the Prime Minister's Youth Roundtable and was one of only two Australian delegates to a global youth summit in England. Another BYO participant, Jonathan Wang, has just returned from the Fourth China Synergy Program for Outstanding Youth. Jonathan was one of four Australian delegates to this 17-day conference program, organised by the Chinese government, which aims to provide a chance for young ethnic Chinese from around the world to understand more about China, their ancestral homeland. Jonathan, like Eshan, has used his BYO experience to take that next step; next year Jonathan will be applying to be a delegate to the Prime Minister's Youth Roundtable.
Both Jonathan and Eshan are remarkable young men who are a credit to their community. The BYO afforded me the opportunity to meet with them and other young people to hear their ideas on what is needed for our region and the future. It is always good to hear from young leaders of the community, but it is also important not to forget the disadvantaged. It is important that we direct the resources available to where they are most needed. Helping all young people is an investment in the future; in particular, we must ensure that all students receive appropriate workplace experience to help them prepare themselves for the world of work. There is no quick buck to be made, but the long-term pay-off can be enormous. The pay-off comes with a better society and a better community for our children and grandchildren to live in.  
I am grateful for the support the BYO has received from local schools who have sent delegates, and I am grateful to the participants for their honesty and hard work. The BYO has been a great conduit for me to listen to the concerns of young people in Greenway and to bring those concerns and ideas to this place in the form of this motion. It has been a remarkable exercise, and I commend the motion to the House.

"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—It gives me great pleasure to speak today on the motion on youth and youth affairs put forward by the member for Greenway. As one of the youngest members of the parliament, I have made it my business to expand the aspirations, the dreams and the opportunities for young people, and to promote the value of young people in society—particularly those young people in my electorate of Ryan. These aspirations reflect very much the aspirations and objectives of the Howard government. One of the very top priorities of the Howard government since its election to government in 1996 has been to implement programs, ideas and initiatives that consistently recognise the value of our young people and give them all the opportunities possible to motivate them to make a contribution to our community and our country.
I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the initiatives the Howard government has put before the people and all of which the government supports very strongly. One of these is the National Youth Media Awards, which have been operated by the Commonwealth for four years. They have helped raise awareness of the critical role the media plays in forming public opinion about young people in our society. The awards encourage the media to take the lead by looking for positive stories when reporting on young people and youth issues. The 2002 awards attracted a record number of entries—some 1,159 were received nationally—and I think that is testament to their popularity and the part they play in this country.
The Howard government also sponsors the Young Australian of the Year Award, which every member of this parliament would be more than familiar with. This award attracted over 2,000 nominations, which is testament to its popularity and its place in our community. The 2001 Young Australian of the Year was a Queenslander, Mr Scott Hucknall, whom I have had the pleasure of meeting. I expressed my support for all the work that he does as Young Australian of the Year.
The coalition government also sponsors the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge, which over 20,000 secondary students participated in in 2002. These events provide valuable opportunities to publicly recognise young people's achievements and thus serve to raise the profile of young people in the community. I know that every member of this parliament is very supportive of the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge. I am pleased to say that, in my electorate of Ryan, the Kenmore State High School—a very popular and high-achieving school in Ryan—achieved an amazing result this year in the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge, coming ninth overall in the Brisbane division of the competition. I want to pay tribute to all those at the school who were involved in that: the parents, the teachers and all the families who supported it. Kenmore State High School and those people who were involved in it and played an important part in it deserve full accolades from the Ryan community.
The Commonwealth government also sponsors National Youth Week, which focuses on youth participation in the Australian community and celebrates the diversity of young people from all over the country—all backgrounds and all regions. The main feature of this year's program was the youth calendar, which attracted 300,000 on-the-ground participants. Again, I think that is testament to what the Commonwealth government is doing and to the initiatives that it puts out into the community. 
I want to say a few words about the electorate of Ryan. It is one year since I had the privilege of becoming the representative of the people of Ryan, and that was a great honour indeed. One of the things I have done as the new member for Ryan has been to establish advisory committees. This Friday I will be presenting the Ryan Youth Recognition Awards and the Ryan Community Awards. These awards are an idea that I have come up with to acknowledge those in our community, especially young people. It is a very young electorate and it is a community that deserves all the support of its federal member. I certainly aim to provide that.
I think it is very important that every member in this parliament acknowledges young people and all that they do. These are very challenging times for young people, and I am sure that anything we can do as members of the federal parliament to enhance and promote their opportunities is very much appreciated. For my part, it was phenomenal to see the enormous interest that my office received in the nominations by the exceptional young people in Ryan. I just want to mention one exceptional young Ryan student, Margaret Forrest. I am sponsoring her attendance at the National Young Leaders Brisbane Forum on Tuesday, 12 November. I fully support the forum. It brings together young people from all over the community. It inspires them, and they get access and exposure to young people in our country who have achieved a lot.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—It gives me great pleasure to rise in support of the motion moved by the member for Greenway and to second that motion. Often the youth of our society feel that they are `the forgotten' in the political process—that they do not carry the same voting clout as, say, the baby boomers. Many of them of course are not even of voting age and feel that politics and politicians do not even know that they exist or, worse still, if they are on the political radar, that it is through their parents and, predominantly, their parents' hip-pocket nerve. So I want to commend the member for Greenway for conducting his regular youth forum and for the motion that that forum has put before the parliament today. 
Sadly, I inform all people in my electorate that they cannot escape parliamentarians and politicians; we are actually there for all of them, whether or not they vote for us and whether or not they are of voting age. So it is particularly important that we do go out and garnish the ideas of these young people in our electorates. Each year since I have been elected, I have held forums with the year 12 school leaders from the 13 secondary schools in my electorate of Chisholm and with the grade 5 and grade 6 leaders from the 41 primary schools in my electorate. This year was no exception. Again, I was blown away by the insight, passion, concern and humanity expressed by those future leaders. 
What did concern me, though, were two factors. First, all three forums began with our youth expressing grave concern about the world we live in—in particular, the escalation of terror on both a global and a local level. The grade 6 forums, which were made up of 11- and 12-year-old kids, both began with in-depth discussions about the prospect of terror in Australia, concerns over hand guns—and they cited the recent example at Monash University which, sadly, occurred within my seat—and also the sniper in the US. The year 12 forum gave chilling insight into the extent of violence in our streets, with all present—and there were about 50 kids—relating tales of peers who carry weapons, mainly knives, and of incidents at parties or innocently at a KFC where they had experienced violence, terror and attack. The other issue of concern was the perception that these things were intractable, that change was very unlikely and that change came only from personal experience: people would have to learn the hard way that carrying knives did not make sense. One student at the year 12 forum put it nicely into perspective when he assured all present that Australians did not live in a violent society. He had recently emigrated from South Africa and explained quite calmly how it was almost part of life to carry guns for personal protection there.  
Why did this disturb me? The first year that I held these forums when I was elected back in 1998, we had a great debate about who should have won Big Brother, why it appeared rigged and whether it was reflective of society or just entertainment. Life was all pretty good, with hope for going on to university or work and only the fear of starting secondary school. Now, the forums are about fear, concern and despair at the future and in our world. We have in-depth discussions from grade 6ers about: is Australia too close to the US? What role does the ANZUS Treaty have? Should the Russian President have used the gas? Why did the student kill his classmates and how did he get hold of the gun? Why does someone lie in the back of their car and shoot complete strangers? This was the tenor of the forums. 
But there was something fantastic in all this—the vocabulary of these students was just tremendous; it was mind-blowing to be precise. When the grade 6er used the `surreal' explanation, the whole room just looked gobsmacked by this kid's use of language. Their knowledge of the issues, not just reciting events, and their ability to analyse and offer theories and solutions were well beyond all their years. And their genuine concern for their world and their fellow human beings shone through all the gloom. Emily from Mont Albert Primary School summed it up nicely when she wrote to me:
Dear Anna, 
I really enjoyed yesterday's lunch. However, I was disappointed that the discussion on terrorism and snipers took up most of the time and we didn't get to discuss school matters as much as I thought we would. Thank you for a wonderful opportunity. 
Emily
Emily had raised great issues. She wanted to talk about graffiti and bullying in our classrooms, but in two hours over lunch we did not get there. At the year 12 forum, we had been going on and on about knives and terrorists so much that we did not get to talk about Kyoto and greenhouse gas emissions—and one student wanted passionately to talk about the actual chemistry of it. We did not get there. It was just so disappointing. All these students wanted us to hear their concerns and they wanted us to react to them. They wanted us to know that, even though they are not of voting age, they have ideas and concerns and they need to be heard.

"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today on the motion moved by the member for Greenway. Honourable members would know that I am a strong advocate for youth. I believe they are essentially the reason we are all in this House—to pass on a better standard of living for our children, grandchildren and all future generations of Australians. It is this desire to create a better future for our children that motivates parents to get involved in their community and, as a mother of eight and grandmother of 11, it is certainly what brought me to federal politics and keeps me motivated in this challenging job.
While I support the vast majority of the sentiment of this motion, I have to say to the honourable member for Greenway that this government needs no urging whatsoever in this area. The Howard government has in fact made some very major advances when it comes to resources, support and funding for our young people. Implicit in this motion is the belief that more needs to be done—and in any area where funding is an issue, a case can always be made for more to be done. Youth services will never be a completed business, but I say to the honourable member for Greenway that he ought to be urging his state Labor counterparts to follow the Commonwealth's lead in this area and to devote more of their funds to helping our young people achieve their full potential.
This motion includes references for more funds for resources and facilities in our schools. Of course, I fully support that, but I would also like to add that school funding is an area where Labor is hopelessly behind the Howard government. In this year's May budget, the Howard government increased funding for state schools on average by 5.7 per cent. Not one single state or territory government has matched that increase.
Despite all the Labor hype on funding for public schools, the states have let their schools down badly. Their failure to at least match the Howard government's increases in funding represents millions of dollars missing from the education system. For example, if the Beattie Labor government in Queensland had matched our increases in education funding, Queensland schools would have an extra $102 million to help fund the sorts of things that the member for Greenway wants. If Labor did the same in New South Wales, there would be an extra $202 million; in Victoria, an extra $95 million; in South Australia, an extra $50 million; and in the ACT, an extra $13 million. These missing millions represent missed opportunities for government school students. So I suggest the member for Greenway should be urging his state Labor counterparts around the nation to do more because, as usual, their actions do not match the Labor rhetoric on this issue. 
In contrast, the Howard government has made huge inroads where it matters most of all—that is, in helping young people get the skills they need for fulfilling jobs. The latest figures show a current record of 330,000 apprenticeships in training—that is more than double the number since Labor left office. It is an incredible achievement, especially when you consider that Labor let apprenticeships fall to their lowest level in 30 years. In this year's budget alone, we have provided $54 million for additional new apprenticeships incentives, especially in the field of information technology and other emerging highly skilled occupations. We have done exactly as the member for Greenway suggests with the highly successful Jobs Pathway Program in schools, which is continuing to expand. In fact, an estimated 170,000 Australian students participated in vocational education and training while in secondary school last year.
These examples are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what our government has done to assist young Australians. It would take most of the day to list the various programs that are now in place to achieve the very thing that the member for Greenway wants to see from this motion. There is the ongoing Youth Roundtable where the government gets feedback and advice directly from young Australians. I was pleased last year to have Darren Chant, a local apprentice from my electorate, visit Canberra. He made some valuable contributions at the roundtable. There is also Ausyouth, a national coordination unit for the development of youth activities in Australia. In fact, I would highly recommend that the member for Greenway look up the very excellent web site that the Howard government established to help young people gain access to a large range of support and advice. It is at www.thesource.gov.au.
One look at the plethora of options and the practical advice and assistance that is available to our young people would make the member for Greenway realise that the Howard government, unlike Labor, is indeed very serious about supporting young Australians to achieve their full potential. I urge the honourable member to tell his state Labor counterparts that they ought to be following our lead in this very important policy issue. I will indeed be supporting all future programs that help our young Australians reach their potential.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Young People</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I thank the member for Greenway for giving me the opportunity to speak in this private member's business debate on young people. I would like to talk about a very innovative program which commenced in Bendigo called Lead On. This particular program was started as a result of the efforts of Mr Rob Hunt, who was the Chairman of the Bendigo Bank and whom a lot of members would be aware of.
In July 1999, Lead On was opened in Bendigo, Victoria. The plan was to create a pilot program that would find ways of engaging, informing and connecting young people to the business and broader community. The belief was that communities that fail to engage their young people are losing and underutilising one of their key resources. Lead On says that young people are the future leaders of our communities, and it is right.
In the three years since the program model was developed, Lead On has expanded and now has offices in Mildura, Swan Hill and Echuca in Victoria, and Ipswich in Queensland—I think this is in the electorate of my good friend the member for Oxley. In that time, almost 700 young people from these communities have been actively engaged in a range of meaningful and worthwhile projects that have provided them with various skills, personal development, community connections, employment, direction and confidence. The more than 100 business and community partners from these communities who provided the project opportunities have experienced the value of having these young people involved with their businesses or organisations. Many of these Lead On facilitated projects have brought people, young and old, together from various industries, backgrounds, schools and environments to work towards a joint outcome for the first time. Lead On has never advertised for young people to be involved and has a steady stream of business partners ready and willing to provide project or other opportunities for young people in the communities. 
It is primarily through the real life project partnerships that the Lead On model engages and develops young people with the community. Some of these projects have provided ongoing roles, employment and development for young people. Projects such as the very successful, LOOP Bendigo Advertiser news supplement—written, edited and designed by youth—have presented wonderful opportunities. The Lead On Inc. project has provided web pages and other IT support for businesses, and Internet training for older people from the innovative Internet for the Oldies by Kids project. It is the dynamics and interactions along the way that provide the key development, learning, connections and outcomes for young and old people. Details of the projects are available, and range from the complex to the simple. Projects are the excuses to bring people together. While Lead On has facilitated some significant projects and benefits for the communities, it is the coming together and broad involvement that are key parts of building community capacity. They are what lead on from the involvement.
Another important element of the program is the integration strategy as opposed to the traditional view of segmenting young people and categorising them. Lead On brings together young people from diverse backgrounds and so-called categories, and integrates them into working groups that include all shapes and sizes. The organisation is headed by Mr Chris DeAraugo, a former musical colleague of mine. He does a superb job with the young people in his charge. This is not an elitist organisation, as some have described it. This organisation takes young people from all walks of life. It is not specifically designed for unemployed young people, although unemployed young people are very welcome and indeed participate in the programs. It takes kids from all over Australia, gives them a sense of self worth and puts them in touch with the important parts of various communities and businesses. The kids gain skills that they are not able to gain in other areas. It is not like a work experience program as such—it does a lot more than that—and it is far more effective. 
I commend Lead On to the House. I encourage the government to get behind it and to work with Chris DeAraugo and others to ensure that it is able to provide the service, not only in the areas that I have mentioned but all over Australia. I thank the member for Greenway for the opportunity to speak.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—In the past decade the Internet has become the most important network to bring people and ideas together. The key benefit of the Internet is its openness—people are able to access information from anyone anywhere. This, however, is seen as a threat in some countries. The government of Vietnam has imprisoned a number of its citizens in recent months. Last Friday a 32-year-old lawyer, Mr Le Chi Quang, was sentenced to four years imprisonment and three years of house arrest on charges arising from the posting of an essay critical of the Vietnamese government on an Internet site. His trial was held behind closed doors and comes in the wake of similar trials in which the accused have been denied proper legal representation. Le Chi Quang has been in custody since February this year. He suffers from kidney disease and is in poor health. His family hold grave fears for his safety. 
His fate is being closely watched by human rights groups, including Amnesty International and locally the Free Vietnam Alliance, New South Wales chapter. And the Internet is bringing his story to the world. I would like to thank Ms Anh Linh Pham from the Free Vietnam Alliance, New South Wales chapter, for keeping me up to date on this issue.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Human Rights: Vietnam</title>,Statements by Members,2,1,speech

I ask: is he aware that, when asked about whether and why he made phone calls to Victoria Police investigator Neil Jepson, conducting a criminal investigation into Telstra's conduct, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has given at least four different answers, including denying he made the calls, stating he called to ensure `matters were properly investigated', stating he called to ensure any action he took `did not compromise any investigation' and, finally, stating he made the calls on behalf of Mrs Ann Garms, which she vigorously denies?

"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question and for his interest in the Australian economy. The international economy continues to look more bleak; in particular, the developments in the United States—probably reflected in the cut of 50 official basis points by the US Fed last week—indicate fears about the American recovery and whether or not it has stalled. In addition to that, growth is sluggish in Europe, and Japan remains in recession.
Despite these difficulties, Australia continues to perform well overall and most international forecasts—for example, the Economist forecast of this month—predict that Australia will have the strongest growth of the developed nations of the world both in 2002 and 2003. In addition to that, the labour force figures for October, which were released late last week, showed that unemployment actually fell to six per cent, which is equal to the lowest unemployment rate recorded since the great recession of April 1990. After that recession, which was dubbed by Labor `the recession we had to have', unemployment was above 10 per cent for 28 consecutive months. The figure for October 2002—at six per cent—is the lowest figure since then.
Notwithstanding that, the risks that we see for the economy are on the downside. Firstly, the international economy continues to disappoint. Secondly, the effect of the drought on the economy is becoming greater and more pronounced as the severity of the drought takes hold. ABARE has put out crop forecasts showing that Australia's crop harvest will be slashed, forecasting the possibility of that detracting up to one per cent from growth in the current financial year, and assessments to that effect have been made by the Reserve Bank in its statement on monetary conditions today. 
The government will be taking into account all of these effects when it updates its forecast in the midyear review, which will be at the end of this month. As I have said, our budget forecast of 3¾ per cent would be affected by downside factors in the international economy and in relation to the drought. Nonetheless, we continue to lead the developed world in growth and employment generation. The number of jobs that have been generated this calendar year is 164,000, and 37,000 over the course of 2002 were full-time jobs. Over the course of the government's period of office, the increase in employment is over one million jobs. Notwithstanding the difficulties of the Australian economy, the creation of those jobs means so much to young Australians, their families and all those who rely on people in the work force.
Good economic policy needs good leadership, and we continue to provide that leadership. We call on the Senate to enact all of our budget measures, including those that have already been defeated. We will be preparing those and presenting them to the Senate again to give the Senate the opportunity to reconsider its position in relation to those budget measures because important budget measures for the long-term sustainability of the Australian economy—good economic policy—are opportunities for Australians.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Performance</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer

That this House:
(1)	notes:
(a)	the alarming rise in the number of people with Type 2 Diabetes estimated to be 1 million, with half of those people currently undiagnosed;
(b)	according to a recent landmark study by Diab Cost Australia, Type 2 diabetes is costing Australians a staggering $3 billion a year with the bill for each person averaging nearly $11,000 in expenditure and benefits;

(c)	continue to encourage people diagnosed with Diabetes to undergo regular medical testing including eye testing so as to prevent complications;
(d)	ensure adequate funding for further research into prevention and treatment of Type 2 Diabetes; and
(e)	develop a strong education program encouraging appropriate diet and exercise regimes to minimize the risk of Type 2 Diabetes.
Diabetes is emerging as one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century. Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin, does not use insulin effectively, or both. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps the body use glucose—a sugar that is the body's main energy source. When insulin is absent or ineffective, the level of glucose in the blood increases.
There are two types of diabetes: type 1, which accounts for 10 to 15 per cent of cases and is not caused by lifestyle factors, and type 2, which accounts for 85 to 90 per cent of cases and is influenced by genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors. Type 2 diabetes is a silent killer. It often remains undiagnosed for many years, resulting in complications such as blindness, stroke, heart attack, amputation of limbs and kidney failure—to name a few. The cost in terms of quality of life can be very high if diabetes goes undetected and untreated. It is estimated that more than one million Australians have diabetes, and at least half of them do not know that they have this disease. 
After launching a retinopathy program for the former minister for health about two years ago, I decided to set up a parliamentary diabetes group in an endeavour to highlight the challenges we face with what many health professionals now call a diabetes epidemic. This epidemic is worldwide. I discussed the idea of setting up a parliamentary group with several of my colleagues, and I am grateful for the enthusiastic response of Cameron Thompson, the member for Blair; Dick Adams, the member for Lyons; Dr Mal Washer, the member for Moore—Dr Washer originally seconded this motion but he is unable to be with us in the House today, so I would like to acknowledge his support—and Senator Guy Barnett, Liberal senator for Tasmania. All of these people agreed to form the founding executive for a bipartisan parliamentary group committed to promoting better health outcomes for people with diabetes. 
The support group has been set up to provide support to members and others who have been diagnosed with diabetes. Managing diabetes in any circumstances is a challenge, but in this environment it presents a particular challenge. The group will also act as a conduit to government and ministers to improve the management of diabetes and education in the community; liaise with industry groups, research organisations and other health professionals to raise public awareness of lifestyle choices which increase the risk of becoming a type 2 diabetic and the importance of early detection; and promote the development of programs to minimise the risks of health complications associated with inadequate or poor management of type 2 diabetes. I would also like to thank many other members of the parliament who have joined this group. Not all of them are diabetics, but they all recognise that this is a key health issue in their electorates and in the states that they represent.
We were lucky enough to have GlaxoSmithKline host an inaugural dinner here in Parliament House last month, which was a tremendous success. That was our first function as a group. Our guest speakers, Brian Conway, Chief Executive Officer of Diabetes Australia, and Professor Paul Zimmet, Director of the International Diabetes Institute, both gave wonderful speeches that certainly focused the mind.
On World Diabetes Day, which is on 14 November—this Thursday—we have arranged with Diabetes Australia a number of activities in Parliament House to draw attention to this growing health problem, and we hope that everyone employed by or visiting the parliament that day will take the opportunity to better inform themselves of the risks and the options for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.
In conclusion, I thank all of my colleagues for the support that they have given this motion today, particularly those of my colleagues who will follow me in speaking to this motion.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Health: Diabetes</title>,Private Members' Business,13,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I second the motion. As one of many sufferers of type 2 diabetes, I think it is very important that diabetes is highlighted as one of the most damaging problems affecting the general health of the community. None of us is immune to this threat. Some of us are born with a tendency to develop type 2 diabetes; others of us acquire it as a part of the ageing process because of our lifestyle and genetic make-up. No group of people is immune. It often takes some other health problem to highlight what should have been obvious, but we do not like to admit that we have it until we have to. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes two years ago and have been living with managing the disease since then. The good thing about knowing about the disease is that you can then set yourself up to manage it and take control over your life, rather than denying that there is anything wrong.
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting 85 to 90 per cent of all people with the disease. This type of diabetes, also known as late onset diabetes, is characterised by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The disease is strongly genetic in origin, but lifestyle factors such as excess weight, inactivity, high blood pressure and poor diet are major risk factors for its development. Symptoms may not show for many years and, by the time they appear, significant problems may have developed. People with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to suffer cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes may be treated by dietary change, exercise and/or tablets. Insulin injections may later be required.
This disease is running rampant in Australia. The Director of the International Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Professor Paul Zimmet, has said that it is the biggest epidemic in human history. Professor Zimmet expresses the position very clearly. There are 500 million people worldwide with either diabetes or the condition coming on. The so-called pre-diabetes condition is glucose intolerance. It can be detected with the same blood sugar test that picks up diabetes, but has no symptoms. Two million Australians have the condition, and more than half of those will have full-blown diabetes by 2007. A million Australians already have diabetes, though half of those do not yet know it. Three-quarters of diabetics will eventually die from heart disease. 
Physical activity is being engineered out of our lives with the automation of industry, computerisation, kids not exercising after school and going to the computer, parents driving their kids to school because they are scared they are going to be kidnapped et cetera. Elderly people are scared to exercise at night because they might be mugged. Professor Zimmet has said that it is not good enough for us to expect individuals to change their lifestyles if they do not have the infrastructure around them. According to Professor Zimmet, government has a responsibility to provide places for people to exercise in safety and the government should consider extending school hours to replace the physical education that has been cut out of curriculums. Professor Zimmet said that the public needed to be aware of risk categories for so-called pre-diabetes and should ask for a test by a GP if necessary. He would love to see screening for everyone, but did not think it economically feasible in the current health climate.
I commend my colleagues, especially the member for Pearce, who established the group here in Parliament House. I certainly hope that we can make people aware, and our colleagues in this House aware, of the significance of this disease throughout the Australian community, the need to highlight it and the need to get people to take a test to see how they are going so that we can deal with it into the future.

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—I have spoken in the past in the parliament about the problems of diabetes, being a type 1 diabetic myself. This motion, particularly given that it falls in the week of World Diabetes Day this Thursday, is significant, and the fact that it focuses on the problems of type 2 diabetics I think is well and truly timely and something that I hope will focus the minds of members of parliament on the great cost of this disease not only in dollar terms but in opportunities lost.
It is a deadly disease and it is spreading dramatically across the world. That has been highlighted recently in the final report of the Australian diabetes, obesity and lifestyle study—AusDiab—within Australia, DiabCost Australia:Assessing the burden of type 2 diabetes in Australia. One of the most significant findings of the study, which was launched on 26 September in Adelaide, was that the complications of diabetes increase over time and with that the costs of maintaining the disease escalate. It is estimated that in Australia we pay $3 billion a year, with the average cost per person at $5,360 plus $5,500 in benefits. That is the cost of diabetes.
Another significant factor to the debate we are having here is that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Indigenous Australians is one of the highest in the world. In 1995, self-reported diabetes was seven to eight times higher among Indigenous Australians than for other Australians aged between 25 and 55 years.
Both the earlier speakers referred to the formation of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. I thank all those members who have lined up to join that group, because it is certainly highlighting in the parliament something that is very serious. As type 2 diabetes is something that does manifest itself mostly in older people—people with a sedentary lifestyle—I think that pure self-preservation should encourage more and more MPs to take an interest in diabetes and the parliamentary support group. I would like to pay credit to the member for Pearce for her vision in putting that group together. She was the one who thought of it and has promoted it, and I am glad that she has had such enthusiasm to get us on board and make it happen.
In the year 2000 there were 160 million people worldwide with diabetes. The predictions are that that figure will grow to 280 million by the year 2025. One of the most remarkable aspects of Professor Zimmet's speech at the recent dinner of the diabetes support group was his comment on the rate at which the disease is growing, not only in Australia—we have a high growth rate here—but in other countries: in Asia, there are growth rates of over 50 per cent in the number of people being affected by diabetes. So it is something that we must come to grips with and we must put greater resources towards. In fact, the number of people with type 2 diabetes has increased in Australia by over 300 per cent in the past 20 years, from 250,000 to one million. It is also reported that in Australia one in four now have type 2 diabetes or are at risk of developing it in the next five to 10 years. Those are serious and dangerous statistics, and we must encourage not only our colleagues in this place but people in the wider community to take greater notice, because, particularly with type 2 diabetes, it is so very difficult to detect. It is important that people be proactive and engage in an active lifestyle and discover the things that can be precursors to diabetes and take active steps to make sure that it does not affect them.

"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I join with my colleagues to speak on the motion by the member for Pearce on diabetes to ensure that community awareness is raised and that the Howard government puts time, effort and resources into strong education programs. As has been pointed out today, there is an alarming rise in the number of people with type 2 diabetes, which is estimated to be one million people with half of these people currently undiagnosed. With half a million undiagnosed diabetics in Australia, the need for strong education programs is critical. That old saying `a ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure' certainly applies to diabetes.
Prevention has three important aspects: first, people's lives are improved if they lead a healthier lifestyle and minimise the risk of developing diabetes; second, early detection means later onset of complications; and, third, the cost of the health bill for diabetes, currently running at $1.2 billion a year, is minimised. People are not greatly aware that their GP can arrange a simple blood test which can show if they are diabetic. People are also not greatly aware that early diagnosis and treatment for diabetes lessens the incidence of complications. Complications from diabetes range from eye problems, blindness, kidney failure and loss of limbs to heart attacks and/or strokes. These complications lead to people having to restrict their lives, and this often takes them out of the work force and onto a much lower income.
I first became aware of the impact of diabetes when I had friends and family members develop the condition. I was not then aware of the prevention strategies that are available to people, their families and local communities. I became aware of the prevalence of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, when I worked as a health education officer for three years. In this job, I was fortunate in being able to work with a team of health professionals to provide health checks at community events. These health checks resulted in many people being referred to their GP for the blood test to check if they were diabetic. We got positive feedback from many of these people that they had been diagnosed as diabetic and that, with early treatment and practical lifestyle changes, they would be able to cope with the diabetes. These people expressed gratitude for the publicly funded health checks, as they would not ordinarily have thought of themselves as being at risk of diabetes or thought of asking their GP for a blood test. Since then I have had continuing experiences of friends, family members and work colleagues being diagnosed with diabetes. Often the diagnosis comes through contact with a publicly funded health information stall. Their life and lifestyle have been enhanced through this contact with a public awareness campaign strategy.
I was pleased earlier this year to become a member of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, and I commend my colleagues, particularly the member for Pearce, the member for Moore and the member for Lyons. I was pleased to attend the inaugural dinner and hear Professor Paul Zimmet speak on diabetes surpassing AIDS as the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century. His speech was thought provoking but practical. Brian Conway of Diabetes Australia also spoke on the work of his organisation in funding research, promoting awareness of diabetes and raising community awareness of early detection leading to enhanced lifestyle choices. I had an experience recently of publicly-funded prevention strategies in my electorate of Stirling at the open day at the Osbourne Park Hospital. I was pleased to see that amongst the information stalls there was a display about diabetes. Interestingly, the information being provided was of a high standard, and I was pleased to see many people expressing an intention to visit their GP for the blood test. 
I take this opportunity of commending the research organisations and scientists looking into the cause of diabetes, as well as improved treatments and possible cures. I support the scientists and medical researchers who have called on the government and the National Health and Medical Research Council to increase the length of grants. My sympathies lie greatly with research organisations and researchers relying on one-year grants and the limits that such short-term grants place on their research efforts.
I join my colleagues in urging the government to continue programs to raise public awareness of the high risk of undiagnosed and untreated cases of type 2 diabetes; ensure access to appropriate screening; support access to new medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes while ensuring that Australian taxpayers get value for money through appropriate pricing arrangements; continue to encourage people diagnosed with diabetes to undergo regular medical testing, including eye testing, so as to prevent complications; ensure adequate funding for further research into prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes; and develop a strong program encouraging appropriate diet and exercise regimes to minimise the risk of type 2 diabetes.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—I rise to support the motion by the member for Pearce on diabetes. I commend my parliamentary colleagues the member for Pearce, the member for Lyons and the member for Blair for their leadership of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, and the member for Pearce for introducing this motion to the parliament and putting it on the Notice Paper. I too wish to speak on this serious and increasing health issue.
In 2000-01, the total number of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes registered with the National Diabetic Services Scheme in Australia was just over 493,000, representing an increase of 10.75 per cent on the previous year. It is estimated that that figure will double to about one million when you take into account those who are not registered with the services scheme or who are undiagnosed. The International Diabetes Institute has estimated that by 2010 there will be 1.23 million people in Australia with diabetes. Professor Paul Zimmet from the IDI—whom we were privileged to hear speak at a dinner on 26 September 2002 on the release of the final report of the Australian diabetes, obesity and lifestyle study, known as AusDiab—reported that the number of people with type 2 diabetes had increased by over 300 per cent in the past 20 years, from 250,000 to one million.
The study also reported that one in four Australians now have type 2 diabetes or are at risk of developing it over the next five to 10 years. The implications of this for health are enormous. It means that we can expect to see continuing increases in life span but also increased morbidity associated with that. At the presentation, Professor Zimmet also spoke of the incidence of type 2 diabetes in children under 10. This is something that has never been seen before. We do not know what the long-term, 20-, 30- or 40-year consequence of this will be. Indigenous Australians have one of the highest prevalences of type 2 diabetes in the world. In 1995, self-reported diabetes was seven to eight times higher among Indigenous Australians than among other Australians aged 25 to 55 years.
I also should mention the commitment of the previous Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, in making diabetes one of our national health priorities in 1996 in recognition of the increasing incidence of it, its seriousness and its cost to the community. He also established the National Diabetes Strategy, which began in 1998. There have been a number of associated programs as part of this, including, in July 2001, $25 million in research funding through the NHMRC in partnership with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and also, in March 2002, a further partnership with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation for $10 million over three years, which was announced to establish the world's first auto-immune vaccine centre to develop a vaccine for type 1 diabetes. 
The motion also talks about the DiabCost Australia study. One of the key findings of that study was that, as the complications of diabetes increase, the costs escalate. This lends weight to the need for a continued focus on policies and programs that aim to minimise the development of complications amongst people with type 2 diabetes, especially as we are now seeing diabetes occurring much earlier than it ever did before and people will be having it for much longer. There is some evidence that good control of blood sugar does decrease the risk of microvascular complications—that is, renal complications, retinal complications and so on. In terms of the cost, the burden of diagnosed type 2 diabetes is estimated at $3 billion a year, with the average cost per person at $5,360, plus $5,540 in benefits, totalling $10,900. He is not known for his comments on health, but I recall a comment by former Speaker of the US House of Representatives Newt Gingrich where he said if we actually do things much better on diabetes we can save over a billion dollars a year. It is exactly the same in Australia: a little spent now will save a lot in the future by avoiding the complications of diabetes. Things like the National Diabetes Strategy should lead to this.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I want to start my remarks by commending the member for Pearce for being part of the inspiration for the formulation of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, of which I am a member. I also want to thank her for her motion on the Notice Paper today coinciding, as has already been said, with the world recognition of diabetes this week. Unlike many other members of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, I am not a sufferer of diabetes, but I feel very strongly about the issue, the impact that it is having on our community and the need for people in this place to take every opportunity that they can to emphasise the need for continuing vigilance and growth in funds in the area. I acknowledge the steps that the government has taken so far, as outlined in the motion, in recognising the seriousness of this diabetes epidemic—and that is what it is—by making diabetes a national health priority back in 1996 and by continuing to take steps to attend to it.
There is absolutely no doubt that diabetes is a major cause of disability and premature death. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is the most common cause of kidney failure, the most common cause of blindness under the age of 60, the most common non-traumatic cause of limb amputation and one of the most common chronic diseases in children and adolescents. Sadly, it also has an incredibly disproportionate impact on Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and Pacific Islander communities in this country. I would like to make quick reference to the Department of Family and Community Affairs report that was tabled in the year 2000—which I had the pleasure of contributing to—which looked at the state of Indigenous health in this country. What became incredibly clear to us in that work, over the months leading to the tabling of the report, was the absolute trauma that is disproportionately experienced in those communities by the sufferers of diabetes.
It is true, as the motion says, that some $3 billion per year is currently being expended on type 2 diabetes. I know that we do not have bottomless pits of money, no matter who is in government. I have to say—not in a negative but in an encouraging way—that I hope, through motions such as this, that the parliamentary group can put pressure on governments, no matter who may be in power at the time, to consider as carefully as they can the suggestions of the member for Boothby a moment ago that we provide as much funding as we can at the earliest possible opportunity so that we can alleviate not just the cost impact in future but also the economic impact. 
Podiatry services are another area that need to be talked about. Education programs are important to help people understand the disease if and when they become sufferers, but once it has been diagnosed there are a range of services that are essential, and podiatry is one of them. In fact, people with diabetes are 15 times more likely to have a leg amputated. I understand that some 2,600 amputations a year are performed on diabetics. Podiatry services simply must be available to people as needed to try to alleviate those pressures. The simple blood test that my colleague on this side mentioned a moment ago, performed by a GP, is a very good thing. A gentleman in my electorate recently went to his GP for that simple blood test and, as a result of that, on his GP's recommendation, sought specialist advice. He got a slightly contradictory blood test as a result of that referral. I stand to be corrected on this, but I understand that there is a limit to the number of blood tests you can have per year before you have to pay for them yourself. This is the question that this gentleman is facing. If that is in fact the case, maybe that is an area we should look at to see whether we can alleviate any pressure on individuals.
There is no doubt at all that the growth in type 2 diabetes is very serious for this nation. There is no doubt also that the increasing level of diabetes in our young people—in our children—is far from acceptable. The reports and commentary in recent times on obesity in young people, and in children specifically, hopefully will raise the broader question of the incidence of diabetes and whether or not it is related to that particular point. If it is, we need to analyse and promote the education process as much as we possibly can to alleviate diabetes in that age group. (Time expired)

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I rise in the grievance debate to continue the remarks I made in the adjournment debate on 23 October 2002 in which I raised serious allegations against the Office of the Ombudsman and accused the Ombudsman of improperly investigating a serious complaint against the Australian Federal Police. In July 1993 a warrant was created and signed by Mr Grahame Wheeler in his capacity as a justice of the peace. In 1994 the Internal Security and Audit Division of the Australian Federal Police began an internal investigation into then AFP officer John Cushion. During that investigation, Mr Wheeler became suspected of some wrongdoing. The AFP wrote to the New South Wales Police alleging that Mr Wheeler had an `improper relationship' with John Cushion. It was not until 1995 that Mr Wheeler was finally charged by the AFP with wrongdoing: he was accused of having fraudulently backdated a warrant document. The investigation into Mr Wheeler, which was codenamed Operation Graft, was headed by Mr John Lawler. Lawler was then a sergeant within the Internal Investigations Division of the AFP. He has since been promoted and is General Manager of Eastern Operations within the AFP.
In the trial of John Cushion, with whom Mr Wheeler was alleged to have conspired, Mr Justice Pratt commented on the kinds of questions that had been put to the accused. He said:
These are not the sort of questions we can have from police officers to suspects ... They are not in a position to start putting propositions like that: would you have prepared, would you have remembered, what a lot of rot. We can't have them doing this sort of thing, what do they think they are.
Mr Cushion was acquitted. It is now clear that when Mr Wheeler was questioned in respect of the suspicions the investigating officers had, they had a belief in his involvement yet, despite this, they failed to caution him. Mr Wheeler asserts that the questioning he was subjected to was similar in its approach to that criticised by Mr Justice Pratt in the Cushion trial. The prosecution against Mr Wheeler was abandoned after he had been committed for trial. 
In 1997 Mr Wheeler began his complaints to the Office of the Ombudsman. He complained that he should have been cautioned before being charged, that he was set up, that the investigation had been improperly handled and that the AFP were aware of a witness who could verify his claims but had not interviewed that witness. Some time during 1997 the internal AFP report into Mr Wheeler's complaints was forwarded to the Office of the Ombudsman for review. The Ombudsman accepted the AFP report as disposing of the issues raised by Mr Wheeler and concluded that no further investigation had to be undertaken.
In 1998 John Taylor, the then head of the Ombudsman's law enforcement team, wrote to Mr Wheeler to explain the reasons for that decision. Mr Taylor is a former New South Wales public prosecutor. He maintained close social links with senior AFP staff, including those from Internal Investigations, whose work he was tasked to review. He is now Senior Assistant Ombudsman in another area of responsibility. Mr Taylor's 1998 letter reminded Mr Wheeler that he had been acquitted of charges against him. This was incorrect and misleading. Wheeler had been committed for trial but the prosecution had not proceeded with the charges. Mr Taylor's letter stated that Mr Wheeler should have raised his concerns in court. Plainly this was absurd because the prosecution had been abandoned prior to trial. For these manifestly unsatisfactory reasons the Ombudsman had decided not to investigate Mr Wheeler's complaints.
Others might have given up in frustration at this point, but Mr Wheeler did not. Between 1998 and 2001, Wheeler asked several times for the Ombudsman to review the internal investigation. In June 2000 he signed a 13-page statement detailing serious allegations against members of the Australian Federal Police. His allegations were supported by what appears to be extensive documentary evidence. This material was given to Agent Murray Cottam, the Internal Investigations officer tasked with the investigation, but nothing, to Mr Wheeler's knowledge, occurred as a result of these complaints. Finally, in October 2001 the Ombudsman agreed to take up the matter. In July 2002, after a prolonged investigation, Mr Wheeler received a bland two-page response informing him of the result of the investigation into his allegations. The report admitted that there had been failures in both the AFP's and the Ombudsman's office's handling of the complaints but it failed to deal with the real substance—Mr Wheeler's assertion that the Lawler investigation into his alleged misconduct had been carried out in a grossly improper way.
Mr Wheeler is aware, because of questions put to him by staff of the Ombudsman, that those issues of substance were supposed to be examined. He thinks that there has been a cover-up. He believes the Ombudsman's office colluded to prevent the investigation of those complaints. Remarkably, he is right. The evidence of this impropriety is both direct and circumstantial. The most damning document was obtained recently by Mr Wheeler as a result of an FOI request. Prior FOI requests had been fobbed off. Only after I spoke in this House on this matter some weeks ago were key documents provided. One of them is quite damning. It is a memo from Catherine McPherson, Senior Assistant Ombudsman, to Allyson Essex, the staff member of the Ombudsman's office who was the head of the investigation. Ms McPherson was asking for an update on the investigation. On the memo there is a note that I infer to be in Ms Essex's handwriting, stating inter alia: 
Meeting with CPM—
McPherson, I infer—
pm 10/12/01.  CPM advised F/A—
Federal Agent—
Lawler extremely busy and important man.  Therefore PRM—
another investigator, I assume—
and I were to (1) i/v for no longer than 1½ -2 hours (2) not accuse him of any wrongdoing.
While an instruction from a senior officer to an officer investigating alleged police misconduct to limit the length of time of the interview with a busy and important AFP officer might be understandable if unwise, the instruction not to put adverse matters to the subject of an investigation is a direct corruption of the integrity regime. 
The impropriety of this action stands out when objective reasons to doubt the truthfulness of at least one of the two AFP members who were involved in the Cushion-Wheeler investigation exists. For example, at Cushion's trial former Federal Agent O'Toole denied making any allegations about Cushion or Wheeler to Lawler, while Federal Agent Lawler stated under oath that O'Toole had been the source of his information. McPherson's instructions meant that the Ombudsman's officers could not put key issues of this kind to Mr Lawler. No proper investigation of Mr Wheeler's complaints could have been possible when a preconceived decision to not accuse Mr Lawler of any wrongdoing had been made higher up in the Office of the Ombudsman. The bland report that was ultimately produced by the Ombudsman's office suggests that the investigating staff within that office had either accepted that they were not to make any recommendations about individuals—and did not make any findings about individuals and did not criticise the AFP—or that the report was later edited to delete such comments. Only an independent inquiry could ascertain which of those two possibilities is true.
This issue goes beyond what is a particular instance to a culture which is obviously unsatisfactory. Senior police staff who have headed the police integrity section of the Ombudsman's office, including Mr John Taylor and Mr Peter Hassell, are both said to have maintained close personal links with serving and former AFP staff and with their counterparts in Internal Investigations. Perceptions of a conflict of interest naturally arise. The morale of the police integrity section within the Ombudsman's office appears to be shot to pieces. The police team has undergone something approaching a 90 per cent turnover of staff in each of the past two years. A survey conducted among staff of the Canberra Office of the Ombudsman in 2002 revealed that two-thirds felt that the policies in the workplace were neither clear-cut nor non-contradictory. A majority of those surveyed felt that the penalties for failure were greater than the rewards for success, and that there was not consistency between the professed philosophy of the organisation and the behaviour of its leaders. A disturbing number of staff felt that honesty and openness were not valued. This is crucial because the Ombudsman's office is the final port of call for anyone with a complaint about misconduct within the AFP. Soon it will be the final port of call and the integrity watchdog for those with complaints against the successor to the National Crime Authority, the Australian Crime Commission. Without confidence in its utmost probity, the citizen is entitled to sneer at any assurance that this is an adequate protection against overreach by law enforcement agencies.
I have learned to respect the professionalism and dedication of the AFP. I think highly of its senior officers and of its reputation. But I know that every organisation will make mistakes and that most will be innocent. I know that every organisation will include some who are corrupt. I know that every organisation will become weakened if the integrity regime is not applied equally to high and low alike. If investigations of alleged misconduct of `busy and important' AFP staff can be perverted from within the Office of the Ombudsman, then the process does not deserve our respect. It must be cleaned up. The minimum requirement is that this parliament insist on an examination of why things are going so wrong within the Ombudsman's office. This is not just a matter of justice for Mr Wheeler; it is also a matter of fairness for agents such as Federal Agent Lawler and his fellow investigators. They may have done nothing wrong, but the circumstances and the way in which this appears to have been investigated lead to a sense of gross unfairness. This parliament cannot allow that kind of instance to go unnoticed.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Report 49: the Timor Sea Treaty, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The report contains the results of an inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into the exchange of notes and the Timor Sea Treaty, both done at Dili on 20 May 2002 and tabled in the parliament on 25 June 2002. From the outset it was evident that the committee would require longer than the normal 15-day sitting period to review the Timor Sea Treaty, and on 26 June 2002 the committee informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this was the case. The longer period was required because of the high level of interest in the proposed treaty action among the Australian public. The committee took evidence at public hearings in Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Darwin from key stakeholders, including relevant government departments; state and territory governments; resource, oil and gas companies; business and commercial interests; and NGOs. In Darwin, the committee also took evidence from representatives of a large number of NGOs from East Timor.
The purpose of the treaty is to set in place a framework that provides the necessary legal and fiscal security to enable the development of the oil and gas resources within the designated area. The treaty provides for East Timor to have title to 90 per cent of the resources within the joint petroleum development area—the JPDA—and for Australia to have title to 10 per cent. The revenue flow to Australia from the Bayu-Undan oil and gas fields, enabled by the ratification of the treaty, is not inconsiderable at $A2 billion over the life of the project. In addition, Australia as a whole—and the Northern Territory in particular—stands to gain through indirect benefits, such as employment associated with bringing oil and gas from the Bayu-Undan fields onshore. The Bayu-Undan venture participants estimate the construction of a liquefied natural gas plant in Darwin will create about 1,200 jobs and the operation phase will sustain 100 direct jobs and from 300 to 500 indirect jobs for the 20-year life of the project. The construction of the pipeline from the Bayu-Undan to Darwin together with investments in Darwin is estimated at $A2.7 billion. 
In an ever more global world Australia's interests are increasingly bound up with the interests of its region. Ratification of the Timor Sea Treaty serves the Australian national interest in providing the conditions that will allow East Timor economic independence and political and social stability. East Timor is the newest sovereign member of the international community and the ratification of the treaty provides a rare opportunity for putting in place conditions that will exert a beneficial influence upon the future course of this nation and contribute to the stability of the region.
The treaty also makes provision for the unitisation and equitable sharing of any oil and gas resource that extends across the boundary of the JPDA. The oil and gas fields of the Greater Sunrise constitute a known instance of a straddling resource. The treaty provides that the Greater Sunrise shall be subject to a unitisation agreement on the basis that 20.1 per cent of the field lies within the JPDA and 79.9 per cent lies within Australian jurisdiction. It was estimated that under current expectations the resources of Greater Sunrise would be worth an estimated $A400 million per year to Australia, and East Timor could expect to receive approximately $A100 million per year, with indirect benefits including training and development opportunities for the East Timorese.
The unitisation agreement for the Greater Sunrise fields is currently under negotiation. Both Australia and East Timor signed a memorandum of understanding on 20 May 2002 stating that they will work expeditiously and in good faith to conclude this agreement by 31 December 2002. The committee recommends that the government use its best endeavours to achieve this objective on or before the date on which the Timor Sea Treaty is ratified and, in any event, before 31 December 2002, as this would serve the best interests of both nations.
The committee was concerned to ensure that the treaty provides for the adequate maintenance of employment and environmental standards within the JPDA. The occupational health and safety and environmental regimes that are currently in operation are likely to continue under the terms of the treaty. The committee urges the government to use its presence on the administrative agencies overseeing oil and gas development in the JPDA to ensure that standards are enforced. Although some non-government organisations and individuals in Australia and East Timor challenged the treaty as prejudicing future maritime claims by either East Timor or Australia, the treaty is without prejudice to the claims of either party. It is a provisional instrument that provides the necessary conditions for the development of petroleum related activities within the JPDA.
There is a minority report of Senator Andrew Bartlett which in essence recommends that the parties not ratify this treaty but go back to the negotiating table, start again and determine the entire competing seabed delimitation claims between Australia and East Timor. This position is against the weight of the evidence and ignores the stated position of both parties to the treaty. It fails to take account of East Timor's need for immediate assistance and resources. The minority report suggests that 40 per cent of East Timor's share of 90 per cent be placed in escrow for at least five years, invariably longer. Inexplicably, the minority report requires Australia to put all its share of revenues from the JPDA into escrow. It fails to take account of the commercial reality of the impact of delay on the Bayu-Undan project that has signed delivery contracts in place, as well as the evidence that nothing less than treaty action will be required for the project to continue beyond its present state. The minority report does not take into account the fact that seabed delimitations can take decades to resolve—and this treaty provides an interim framework. The minority report also makes no reference to the rights of Indonesia in such a process and does not mention the stated preference of both treaty parties to negotiate, not litigate, over their boundaries. 
The committee notes that the ratification of the treaty is a fundamental condition precedent to the exploitation of the resources of the Timor Sea. The development of these resources will bring great benefits to Australia and is vital to the immediate and future development of East Timor. It is the view of the committee that it is in the interest of Australia for the Timor Sea Treaty, considered in Report 49, to be ratified. The committee so recommends. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—by leave—I would like to make a few comments in supporting Report 49: the Timor Sea Treaty of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. On 20 May this year East Timor, our nearest neighbour, became an independent country. At that time Australia exchanged notes with East Timor constituting an agreement between the government of Australia and that country concerning arrangements for exploration and exploitation of petroleum and gas reserves in an area of the Timor Sea between our two countries known as the joint petroleum development area. This formed the basis for the treaty which the committee has considered and on which this report is based.
The committee reported on a number of areas. Firstly, we looked at the history of the treaty itself and then at the costs and future protocols, the people who were consulted in relation to the inquiry and how the inquiry was conducted. We also looked at the purpose of the treaty, how it was designed, different designated authorities that it reported to, the joint commission, ministerial conduct and dispute resolution, which are all very important parts of the treaty. During the inquiry, the committee heard from a range of parties who have an interest in ensuring that the treaty best reflects the interests of all parties. I would like to thank all those people who made submissions to the committee over an extended period of time. Their contributions were very valuable. I would particularly like to thank the non-government organisations from East Timor who actually made the trip to Darwin to give evidence to the inquiry.
There are a number of different issues raised in the report. Firstly, a lot of submissions talked about the seabed boundary delimitation. We covered resource sharing arrangements, particularly in relation to the Bayu-Undan field and the Greater Sunrise field. Other matters that arose were employment, the environment, flags of convenience ships, how we deal with fisheries and also greenhouse gas emissions, so the committee received a wide range of evidence concerning this treaty. One aspect that was often mentioned was that Australia had been very heavy-handed in its dealings with East Timor in negotiating the treaty. I believe that we were. For example, the East Timorese get no money from the development of the Bayu-Undan field until the treaty is ratified and they are therefore under a lot of pressure to ratify the treaty as quickly as possible. Also, we received evidence concerning Australia's withdrawal of recognition of the ability of the International Court of Justice to determine maritime border disputes. We withdrew from that convention in March this year, even though we have been part of that body since the early 1940s. It was very disappointing that we did that. Clearly, we withdrew from that particular convention so that East Timor could not appeal to that court in determining maritime borders.
But, in making that statement, I also recognise that the treaty, in articles 2(a) and (b), at least provides for ongoing negotiations regarding the boundary. I will quote from those articles because I think it is important to get them on the public record. Article 2(a) states that the treaty gives effect to international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, agreed at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982, which, under article 83, requires states with opposite or adjacent coasts `to make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature pending agreement on the final delimitation of the continental shelf between them in a manner consistent with international law'. This treaty is intended to adhere to such obligations, so it provides for ongoing negotiations. Article 2(b) states: 
Nothing contained in this Treaty and no acts taking place while this Treaty is in force shall be interpreted as prejudicing or affecting Australia's or East Timor's position on or rights relating to a seabed delimitation or their respective seabed entitlements.
That is particularly important because a lot of submissions worked around the thought that, if in fact East Timor ratified the treaty, they may not be able to pursue any legal course at a future time. Clearly that is not the case—there are ongoing negotiations provided for.
We also looked at the national interest. Clearly, when a treaty is being considered the committee must look at the national interest. I would like to quote one submitter, Alan Matheson from the ACTU, who I believe gave an excellent summation of what this committee should look at in terms of national interest in relation to this inquiry. Alan Matheson was representing Sharan Burrow, who unfortunately was unable to attend the committee's hearing in Melbourne. He made the following statement:
I believe that, if we do not get this treaty process right, in five years we will have another joint Australia-New Zealand government mission into Timor to try to sort things out, as we have done in Bougainville and the Solomons.
He went on to say:
... if we do not get the treaty process right with Timor, it seems to me that we will have the Australian government in five years up there trying to work out governance. It is the capacity building and governance which will provide the background and the backbone to an effective treaty ratification process in terms of what it will deliver in Dili.
Basically what he was saying is that it is in Australia's national interest to have a neighbour with a strong and stable financial base, and that to have otherwise could cause long-term difficulties for Australia. There are a number of areas we looked at in the national interest analysis that was provided to us. Unfortunately, what I found with the national interest analysis was that it was disappointing for what it missed out rather than for what it included. For a start, it did not consider that the Bayu-Undan field, which is totally contained within the joint petroleum development area, is at the moment under threat of not going ahead because the people who are developing that particular area, Phillips Petroleum, want certainty of ratification before they can proceed. They need to have that relatively quickly. The impact on the Northern Territory of not proceeding with that project was never considered in the national interest analysis. We are talking about 1,200 jobs in the construction phase and 400 on an ongoing basis. We are talking about $6 billion in infrastructure and about $2½ billion in tax coming to Australia. For example, the national interest analysis talked about Greater Sunrise, but it did not refer to the potential loss for Australia if we do not proceed with the Northern Territory project. If we do not proceed with the Northern Territory project and Phillips Petroleum withdraws, and if East Timor is not getting the money from that project, I am also concerned that that will mean Australia has to provide the equivalent level of aid to make up for what the East Timorese will be missing out on.
We also heard that it was very important from Woodside's point of view to have unitisation in place to allow for their certainty in developing the Greater Sunrise part of the treaty. This demonstrates the incompetence of the government in not appreciating the issues that we are dealing with here. It is vitally important that the treaty be ratified, but it is also vitally important that we get the unitisation process happening as quickly as possible. If we do not do that, we could end up losing Bayu-Undan as a project and not getting Greater Sunrise developed in the future. I want to know what the foreign minister is doing and what his counterpart in developing projects, Minister Macfarlane, is up to in relation to getting these projects happening—that is, getting in there and getting unitisation happening before the end of the year, as per the memorandum of understanding. If they do not get that happening, Australia stands to lose billions of dollars. 
In closing, there are a number of other issues mentioned: staffing, which is also important, and the need to include Australian and East Timorese workers. Unfortunately, the treaty currently talks about East Timorese workers and does not mention Australians, but I think we can deal with that in the setting up of the project. Also, having occupational health and safety standards that meet international standards is very important. I will also make mention of the minority report of Senator Bartlett. I am very disappointed that Senator Bartlett did not attend one meeting to do with this treaty but has seen fit to put in a minority report in relation to it. Perhaps if he had actually attended he would have found something out that would have convinced him to go ahead with it. I commend the report to the House and thank the staff and members of the committee for all their work.

... if we do not get the treaty process right with Timor, it seems to me that we will have the Australian government in five years up there trying to work out governance. It is the capacity building and governance which will provide the background and the backbone to an effective treaty ratification process in terms of what it will deliver in Dili.
Basically what he was saying is that it is in Australia's national interest to have a neighbour with a strong and stable financial base, and that to have otherwise could cause long-term difficulties for Australia. There are a number of areas we looked at in the national interest analysis that was provided to us. Unfortunately, what I found with the national interest analysis was that it was disappointing for what it missed out rather than for what it included. For a start, it did not consider that the Bayu-Undan field, which is totally contained within the joint petroleum development area, is at the moment under threat of not going ahead because the people who are developing that particular area, Phillips Petroleum, want certainty of ratification before they can proceed. They need to have that relatively quickly. The impact on the Northern Territory of not proceeding with that project was never considered in the national interest analysis. We are talking about 1,200 jobs in the construction phase and 400 on an ongoing basis. We are talking about $6 billion in infrastructure and about $2½ billion in tax coming to Australia. For example, the national interest analysis talked about Greater Sunrise, but it did not refer to the potential loss for Australia if we do not proceed with the Northern Territory project. If we do not proceed with the Northern Territory project and Phillips Petroleum withdraws, and if East Timor is not getting the money from that project, I am also concerned that that will mean Australia has to provide the equivalent level of aid to make up for what the East Timorese will be missing out on.
We also heard that it was very important from Woodside's point of view to have unitisation in place to allow for their certainty in developing the Greater Sunrise part of the treaty. This demonstrates the incompetence of the government in not appreciating the issues that we are dealing with here. It is vitally important that the treaty be ratified, but it is also vitally important that we get the unitisation process happening as quickly as possible. If we do not do that, we could end up losing Bayu-Undan as a project and not getting Greater Sunrise developed in the future. I want to know what the foreign minister is doing and what his counterpart in developing projects, Minister Macfarlane, is up to in relation to getting these projects happening—that is, getting in there and getting unitisation happening before the end of the year, as per the memorandum of understanding. If they do not get that happening, Australia stands to lose billions of dollars. 
In closing, there are a number of other issues mentioned: staffing, which is also important, and the need to include Australian and East Timorese workers. Unfortunately, the treaty currently talks about East Timorese workers and does not mention Australians, but I think we can deal with that in the setting up of the project. Also, having occupational health and safety standards that meet international standards is very important. I will also make mention of the minority report of Senator Bartlett. I am very disappointed that Senator Bartlett did not attend one meeting to do with this treaty but has seen fit to put in a minority report in relation to it. Perhaps if he had actually attended he would have found something out that would have convinced him to go ahead with it. I commend the report to the House and thank the staff and members of the committee for all their work.
—by leave—I move:
That the House take note of the report.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Price. I know that you of all the occupiers of the chair will appreciate more than most the significance of our heritage. We share a common interest in the western suburbs of Sydney and we both know of the strong inheritance that we have from the pioneers and the early settlers of that district. Tonight we are considering a change to legislation which covers the national estate and our national heritage. Of course, this area is one that fits between what is significant to state or local authorities and what is important in anational and a world sense. Australia has a number of features which are of great significance in an international sense. The one that most people think of without any difficulty is the Great Barrier Reef. It is a unique geographical feature that is a phenomenon not matched anywhere in the world. Most people value the buildings and roadways of their suburbs that have been a feature of their district ever since the district was established. But there is a role to be played, and that role is the Commonwealth's as part of its responsibility for things that are of national importance. 
Over the years since its establishment—and I think it was first established in the 1970s—the concept of a national estate and some sort of national heritage process has increasingly captured the attention of Australians. In some instances, the failure of state or local authorities to value things of importance has encouraged people to apply for their registration as places of interest to the nation. In other instances there has been such overwhelming support for an idea or a concept that people have wanted to nominate a site to be of great significance. This legislation establishes a mechanism for the identification, protection and management of places of national heritage significance, and these places are going to be inscribed on the National Heritage List. The list will be comprehensive. It will consist of natural, historic and Indigenous places that are of outstanding national heritage significance. We will be looking at the register that is now established and asking, `What items on this register are really of national significance?' In some ways we are going to go back over old ground but we are also going to look at fresh ground. The minister is going to be advised by an expert group of people whose purpose is to advise him about the process of registration on the National Heritage List.
Western Sydney is a most significant part of Australia. I will start with the environment around Mitchell and just mention in passing some of the areas that catch my attention. The member for Greenway will be aware of the Grantham Poultry Research Station. In my opinion, that is a very significant feature. It has wrapped up in it some of the most brilliant veterinarians and scientists Australia has seen, and the construction of the buildings and the grounds themselves also make it a very significant site. I believe that it was very far-sighted to place the Grantham Poultry Research Station at Seven Hills on the register. In the Penrith area we have the Museum of Fire and the Penrith Courthouse. Those are places that catch my attention as a visitor to that area.
In the Parramatta region, nobody could be unfamiliar with St John's Cathedral, the All Saints Anglican Church, the buildings that were formerly the Kings School, or Burnside Homes—a magnificent group of buildings constructed by Mr Burns along Pennant Hills Road, Parramatta, leading towards Pennant Hills. They are fine buildings which have been beautifully maintained and are now being used as a school. There is also the Catholic cemetery in Church Street; the Cumberland Hospital landscape, which is itself unique; Lake Parramatta Dam; the Lancer Barracks Precinct and the Lancer Barracks themselves; and the Lennox Bridge. All these are in the western suburbs of Sydney. They are great features, crying out to be maintained and crying out to be preserved and not destroyed.
In an area near where I live we have the Galston Gorge Road Bridge; Glenroy on Old Northern Road, Middle Dural; St Jude's Anglican Church; and The Pines, the famous building of the Roughley family—the outhouse, the pine trees and the whole area are just exceptional. Coming to Maroota, we have the Felton Mathew marked tree; the Indigenous place at Wiseman's Ferry and another place at Canoelands; and the Marramarra National Park in toto. Then in Castle Hill itself, there is Castle Hill House, which has been wonderfully restored. There is the Redeemer Baptist Church. The people of that church have lovingly restored what has become a feature of the district. It was an outstanding effort of dedication and showed a real valuing of the past and the pioneers. It is a beautifully restored building. We also have the Castle Hill Public School and residence on Castle Hill Road. Unfortunately, the owners of that building, QIC, have not done anything with it. They have not maintained it or put it to use. I trust they will shortly make a decision. It is not in a state of disrepair but it will shortly get to be in a state of disrepair. 
There is also the Castle Hill Settlement Site, the so-called heritage park. It is a wonderful site—an absolutely brilliant site. For ages I have been asking the minister to encourage the Commonwealth, through its heritage trust grants, to do something towards interpretation of that site through archaeological digs and to have interpretative displays to really explain to the community what is a completely open site. As far as I can determine, it was the third site of establishment in Australia. First of all there was Sydney, then Parramatta and then Castle Hill with a convict settlement. The remains of that settlement have been identified in a cursory way and further detail of that site is needed. It would be a wonderful opportunity for young people and schools to have a look at an archaeological dig and to work out what was on that site right from the beginning of the colony. To my knowledge, it is the only area that has been untouched since the beginning, and it is still there in open fields and paddocks. Crops have been grown on the site but the site is there. With modern technology, the roadways, the wells, the buildings and the foundations can be established and what was actually there can be demonstrated at what is called `heritage park'—the Castle Hill Settlement Site on Old Castle Hill Road, Castle Hill. We also have Elwatan on Castle Hill Road, the former St Paul's Anglican Church—a beautiful sandstone building in the centre of Castle Hill—and the Old Parsonage, which sits just opposite. All of these are part of our wonderful heritage that we should value and preserve.
The Commonwealth government is, with this legislation, improving the way in which it protects our heritage. These three bills which have been introduced into the parliament, the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002, identify, conserve and protect places of national heritage significance. We need to understand that the new heritage regime will operate through a list of places of national heritage significance. A new Commonwealth heritage list will be established which will list the pre-eminent and elite sites—the sites that are truly and absolutely of great significance—and an independent expert body, the Australian Heritage Council, will be created to advise the minister on the listing and protection of heritage places. This is all good stuff. In my view, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, with his intellectual strength and determination, is just the guy to make it work well.
Regarding the future of this legislation, I know the Australian Labor Party are supporting it, and I am pleased about that. It was, I believe, Tom Uren who established the concept of the national estate and what we should have as Australian heritage. After the passage of some 20-odd years, this current government is now looking at that again. For good reason but without properly understanding the value of buildings or natural sites, we have perhaps included things on the list which would be better on other lists. Perhaps we would be better gathering from other lists things that should be on the national estate list. So this list of Australian heritage, the Commonwealth Heritage List, needs to be cleansed, in a way, and brought up to date and reappraised. This legislation focuses, as did the original legislation, on the Commonwealth's responsibility regarding places of national importance and heritage areas owned or leased by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's own responsibility is to look after those things for which it has responsibility. A Commonwealth listing of its own properties is pretty important in making sure that we act responsibly as the Commonwealth government and give a lead to some of those governments that at times really do not appear to value the same sorts of things that we value from a federal perspective.
Heritage places will be protected consistent with the Commonwealth's constitutional powers. That means we cannot override the states; if they want to bulldoze something, they will do it. We just need to be active to make sure that that does not happen. If they want to destroy something that is of value, constitutionally we will not be able to stop them with this legislation; they will still be able to go ahead. But with our list we ought to be able to prevent those acts of degradation occurring at those places that are—and I quote the words—`of national heritage significance'. What this legislation does is seek to lock in for permanent preservation those areas which are of particular significance to the Commonwealth and for which the Commonwealth has a responsibility. 
The legislation requires the minister to ensure that there are approved management plans listed for places owned by the Commonwealth, so that the Commonwealth does not just sit back and say, `We've got a fabulous building and it is historic,' when in 10 years time, when it actually decays, it will be past restoration. We have to put in place a management plan that will set out how to protect the heritage values of a place. The government will provide technical and financial assistance to the people who are the owners of such places and from whom we lease buildings.
The minister will be required to report to the parliament on the state of the National Heritage List. The report is required to include the number of places on the list, their values and any threats to them; the progress of the preparation of management plans; changes in tenure; allocated resources; and, where applicable, the operation of any accredited management arrangements. In that way, each one of us can be sure that when something is listed it goes beyond just merely recording something on a list in a computer database somewhere or other; there has to be an active plan of the way in which that site is going to be managed. We have not had that before, and I think that is a great innovation. I congratulate the minister for being proactive in this area. We need, first of all, to make sure that buildings are properly looked after. As well, where we are talking about the built environment, the buildings need to be used. In other areas, where it is not the built but the natural environment that we are seeking to preserve, we need to know what the impending threats to such sites are. The monitoring and reporting process which is required under this legislation will ensure that every member of parliament and every member of the Australian Commonwealth, every individual living within Australia, will be able to access those plans for themselves. No doubt they will be on web sites as well so that people will be able to find out for themselves precisely what the Commonwealth intends to do regarding those places that are registered on the Commonwealth Heritage List or those that are part of the National Heritage List—the places of significance.
The Commonwealth agencies that own or lease places will be required to assist the minister and the Australian Heritage Council to identify and assess the value of places. They will not be able to sit down as we have seen in the past and bulldoze a post office to build some sort of fake building which, although it may be more convenient to operate as a postal service, has led to the destruction of a heritage building in the process. The owners of those buildings will not be able to do that any longer. The legislation will prevent them from doing that. The bill provides a nomination, assessment and listing process. Protection is there.
The establishment of the Australian Heritage Council will bring consistency. In New South Wales we have the New South Wales Heritage Council, and the Australian Heritage Council will replace the Australian Heritage Commission; I like the consistency of that. I think that the new title is more consistent with the status of what is now being established. It describes its advisory role as the Commonwealth's expert advisory body on heritage. The council will be independent and expert and it will help the minister in the identification, conservation and protection of places on the National Heritage List and on the Commonwealth Heritage List. It will include experts in the fields of natural, Indigenous and historic heritage, as I have already said, and it will also be responsible for keeping the register.
I think this is good legislation, but I will be keeping an eye on where things are registered. I will look out for my area, as I hope every member will for their own area, to make sure that those buildings and sites which are of significance to them and to the people of their electorates are properly acknowledged by the Australian Heritage Council. I hope they will make sure that the nominations go forward and, if rejected, that they will fight to keep them on the list. Whether the nominations are on the major list or on the subset list of places of significance, I expect this parliament to be active, to make sure that, despite some of the activities of state or local authorities, we are able to preserve buildings, natural forms and the Indigenous inheritance that is so much the heart and soul of this nation. I do not look to the past for direction for the future but, unless we really understand what those before us have contributed to the building of this nation, we will not truly value the future we are putting together.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I rise to speak on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002. These bills were originally introduced in 2000 under a different title. Debate was delayed and they lapsed as a result of the election. They have now been reintroduced and finally debated in this place. The bills have been slightly amended since they were first introduced, to take account of some of the concerns of the Senate reference committee which inquired into the operation of the bills, but fundamentally they remain the same. These bills, in effect, completely rewrite our heritage regime, which was first introduced by the Whitlam government in 1975. When the Australian Heritage Commission Act was first passed by the parliament in that year, it was recognised as world's best practice in heritage legislation. Like many things in our rapidly changing society, however, the act and the regime that underpins it need to be renewed and strengthened from time to time—strengthened, not weakened—and that lies at the heart of the problem Labor has with these bills. These bills seek to water down and weaken the heritage regime, and Labor sees this as a backward step in our community's progress.
The Australian Heritage Commission Act will be repealed by this legislation, and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will be amended to become the main act dealing with Commonwealth heritage protection. There are many questions and concerns about whether the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is the right framework for these changes; many would say not. By attempting to integrate heritage protection into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, many of the important aspects of the unique requirements of heritage protection are neglected or simply omitted.
There is also major concern over the decision to abolish the Australian Heritage Commission, which is a statutory authority independent of government, and replace it with a ministerial advisory council. At present there is a requirement that the chair and not less than half of the commission must not be Commonwealth officers. The provisions of these bills remove such a requirement. The final decision as to whether an item will be listed or not will, if these bills are passed unamended, rest with the minister and not with the independent commission. Under these bills, if a person nominates an item to be listed, the minister can reject it out of hand or he or she can ask the council for advice as to whether it should be listed. After that advice is given, the minister has the power to completely ignore the advice from the council and reject the nomination out of hand. Many of the functions that the commission currently undertakes will be exercisable only upon the recommendation of the minister. As the Bills Digest says:
This implies that the new Council will have considerably less freedom of independent action and initiative than the Australian Heritage Commission ... 
The potential for politicisation or, at the very least, the appearance of politicisation of the heritage regime is enormous.
Australia is in a unique position when it comes to heritage. We have one of the oldest cultures on the face of the planet, with our Indigenous heritage stretching back at least 40,000 years. However, Western settlement occurred only 214 years ago. We do not have ancient castles or churches that have stood for many hundreds of years. Our oldest continually licensed pub, for example—the Surveyor General Inn at Berrima—is only 168 years old. In the Greenway electorate, the Royal Cricketers Arms Inn has been there since 1881—121 years. When we compare that to something like Kyteler's Inn in Kilkenny, in Ireland, which has been a pub continuously since 1324—or for 678 years—we see there is no real comparison to be made. Ours is a young culture. In many respects, though, that is precisely why we must have in place strong protection and heritage laws; otherwise, pubs will not get to be 678 years old and counting. 
To give the House an example of the extent to which developers will go to get around their heritage responsibility, I want to refer to the demise of a well-known landmark in my electorate, the Robin Hood Inn, which I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, would know—in a professional capacity, of course, not social—as you were previously a member of the Blacktown City Council. I think we agree that the demise of this great establishment happened sometime in the 1980s. The situation was that the Robin Hood Inn, as I said, was a well-known Blacktown drinking house and landmark. It was situated within a stone's throw of Blacktown railway station and was a convenient drinking house for both locals and the travelling public. The country train stopped at Blacktown station for a short period of time, allowing travellers to cross the road and have a quick drink before continuing on their journey. One Saturday night—we believe sometime in the 1980s—the patrons were cleared out of the inn at closing time. A high wall was erected around the inn and the inn was demolished overnight.
—I want to hear the story.
—Maybe the member for Mitchell knows more about this than you or I, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—No. I am interested in the story, though.
—I do not know; he might be able to help us with that. The fact is that the patrons were cleared out, as I said, but we do not know what happened to any boarders—I certainly hope they were cleared out also. The inn was demolished overnight. A number of local drinkers arrived on the site at about 10 o'clock on the Monday morning, only to find, to their disappointment, that the inn no longer existed. Of course the question that we ask is: why the haste? Why was it done so quickly and why was it done so secretly? That is a little bit of Blacktown folklore.
It is not just drinking places that need protection; it is all sorts of places. In my electorate of Greenway, there are many and varied heritage sites. Sites of local significance include the Battle of Vinegar Hill memorial site, the Glenwood Park Dairy, the Hebe Farm, the Masonic Hall at Riverstone, the Meadows Public School in Seven Hills, St Andrew's Uniting Church in Marsden Park and St Anthony's Catholic Church in Kings Park. There are some 17 cottages, houses, farmhouses and the like scattered around the electorate that represent and preserve our local history. Of state significance are St Andrew's Anglican Church and rectory at Seven Hills, the Seven Hills Railway Station group and the rail underbridge, the Riverstone Railway Station and Rouse Hill House. There are seven sites on the national register in the electorate of Greenway. Three sites have the legal status of registered as well as the administrative status of registered—they have gone through the entire process.
The first is the Grantham Poultry Research Station, which the member for Mitchell has already referred to; the second is a section of the Old Windsor Road; and the third, which is just on the border with the electorate of Mitchell, is Rouse Hill House, including stables and outbuildings. The other four places on the register are termed indicative places, which means that their details have been entered into the database and information has been collected but no final decision has been made. These places include the old boiler house in Blacktown, the Plumpton Ridge Aboriginal site, Schofields Aerodrome and the Second Pond Creek open site, which is also of Indigenous significance. Unfortunately, when Blacktown Hospital was redeveloped over the last few years, the boiler room and its contents were destroyed after extensive efforts to find a new home for the equipment failed. 
One might ask why something like a chicken farm is heritage listed, but the Grantham Poultry Research Station is more than just a chicken farm. The scientific research undertaken on that property, particularly research into manganese and vitamin deficiencies in food and their effects on hatchability, effectively saved the poultry industry from ruin and brought international acclaim, establishing the estate as one of the six leading poultry research stations in the world. I will speak about why the poultry research station is protected. After the First World War, the station was used for a soldier settlement scheme, providing a home and a new start for many injured and maimed soldiers returning home after that terrible war. The site also contains a significant remnant tract of Cumberland Plain bushland, which is an endangered species around Western Sydney. As you can see, there are many reasons why a single site should be protected and why a local chicken farm is deserving of preservation.
Another local site of some significance is the Vinegar Hill memorial site. Australia has had a relatively peaceful history, with armed uprisings being relatively few. The first, however, occurred in what is today known as Rouse Hill, in the electorate of Greenway. On 5 March 1804, some 200 mainly Irish convicts, led by Phillip Cunningham, rose against the authorities in Australia's first rebellion, in what became known as the Battle of Vinegar Hill. It was crushed quickly before convict reinforcements from Toongabbie or Hawkesbury could arrive. The cry of `death or liberty' only resulted in the former for the ringleaders, while between 200 and 500 lashes were handed out to the other convicts involved. Each year sees a re-enactment of the battle on the original site. While grisly in its origin, it is nevertheless part of our history and should be protected. In fact, I attended the re-enactment of the event around Christmas last year and enjoyed the occasion very much.
Another local icon is St Bartholomew's Church, which was commissioned by William Lawson, one of the three men who were the first to cross the Blue Mountains. St Bartholomew's was built in 1841 and operated until 1967, when increased vandalism forced its closure. In 1972, Blacktown council obtained the site and set up the St Bartholomew's Prospect Preservation Committee. The committee raised funds—holding various events each year—held numerous working bees and received some government funding, including a Centenary of Federation grant, which was very much appreciated. Finally, on 21 February 2001, after many years of hard work by local residents, the restored church was reopened to the public. St Bartholomew's stands adjacent to the M4 motorway and forms one of the gateways to Blacktown city—and indeed a gateway to the electorate of Greenway. The small graveyard attached to the church is the resting place for William Lawson, one of the great pioneers of early Australian exploration. This is a historically significant site that could have been lost through neglect but was saved and restored to its former glory. It now stands as a great testament to the hard work and dedication of the local community.
The heritage listing of Schofields Aerodrome is of particular concern. While its final status has yet to be determined, the Department of Defence, which owns the site, has placed it on the list of Defence sites to be sold off. I ask you: how can you sell off a property whose heritage status is yet to be determined? Can you not see the potential for a conflict of interest if the final decision as to whether to list a property is left solely in the hands of the government of the day?
—They sold Nirimba.
—The member for Mitchell will probably concede this point too—in privacy, no doubt. The government wants to flog Schofields Aerodrome, and the government makes the decision on whether it gets listed as a heritage site. It is not hard to see which way the heritage listing decision will go, given these circumstances. Some will say that the government can sell the site and still place restrictions on its use due to its heritage value. But who is going to buy a site they cannot use fully? Placing restrictions on the use of the land will automatically drop the price that the government will get for the land. If you can only build 500 houses, not 5,000 houses, then why would you pay full price? This government likes to get full price. 
What would happen in a situation where the land is sold subject to restriction, part of the property is bulldozed and built on, and then the final assessment is made placing a high value on the recently bulldozed portion? It would be a bit too late to be able to do anything about it, and our future would be the poorer for it. There is also the problem of who decides exactly what restrictions or covenants are placed on a property before the sale. So the argument that the property can be sold off before its final heritage value has been determined is, quite frankly, nonsense, even when some restrictions are made. This is why the final decision as to heritage listing must be put in the hands of a body that is independent of government and that has no consideration to make beyond whether the site is of heritage value. When you politicise the process, you naturally leave yourself open to accusations of conflict of interest. Not only must the process be independent but it must also be seen to be independent, and this legislation fails—miserably, I am afraid—on both counts.
I represent the electorate of Greenway, which was named after Francis Greenway, a man with a very interesting history. He was born near Bristol in 1777, and he was convicted of forgery in 1812. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to transportation for 14 years to New South Wales. When Greenway arrived in the colony in February 1814, he was given a ticket-of-leave almost immediately. In March 1816, Governor Macquarie appointed him to the position of civil architect and assistant engineer on a salary of three shillings a day.
Greenway was Australia's most influential early architect. He adapted his designs to suit the local conditions, and so he created buildings with an Australian flavour. He was the first to do so, and quite rightly he is remembered in our history. Along with Henry Lawson, Greenway was featured on the original paper $10 note, and he has a federal electorate named in his honour. For an architect, his name is extremely well known and his life is celebrated. I wonder if members would know how many buildings he designed before his death in Maitland in 1837 or how many are still standing. Greenway designed over 40 buildings, shaping the look of Sydney and surrounds. But how many are still standing?
This is the most influential and well-known architect in Australia's history. Of his 40-plus buildings, only 11 remain—and every one of those 11 has been altered in some shape or form. We have nothing left that is wholly original from our most influential architect. Certainly, 11 still stand, including St Matthew's Anglican Church in Windsor, St James' Church in Queen's Square in Sydney, the Hyde Park Barracks and St Luke's at Liverpool, but they have all been altered to some degree over the years. And that is because our heritage regime was nonexistent or simply not strong enough at the time. So much of our history and heritage has already been lost, which is why we need a strong and independent heritage regime. Obviously not every building can or should be protected. If the old tram depot on Bennelong Point had been preserved and protected, we would not have the Opera House. It is a difficult balancing act between preserving our history and building our future. Nobody denies that, but this is precisely why we need strong legislation in place. 
The amendments that will be moved by Labor help to maintain this balance. They keep the commission in place as an independent body. They preserve the positive aspects of those bills that improve the system. I urge the government to consider the amendments on their merit, because they have merit, and not to try to play politics with this very important issue. This is an area where we can have bipartisan support but, as it stands, if the bill is not amended, I am afraid Labor cannot support it.",REPS,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—The coalition government has a proven track record when it comes to the protection of Australia's valuable natural, historic, cultural and Indigenous heritage. It is, after all, a government that has provided $10.5 million over three years for heritage conservation projects under the rubric of the Cultural Heritage Projects Program. Likewise, the government has allocated $5 million for the restoration of historic pubs in regional Australia. The Howard government has, through the federal fund, the Federation and Cultural Heritage Projects program and the Conservation of Heritage Projects Program, provided more funds for the protection of heritage than any other government in Australia's history. But the protection of heritage means more than simply the writing of cheques, and the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 before this House tonight testify to the commitment of the government to the structural reform of Australian regulatory practice as it relates to places of great heritage value. 
The reforms contained in this package of bills before the parliament are based on the national consensus reached by the 1997 Council of Australian Governments meeting. COAG agreed to the evaluation of the appropriate responsibilities and roles for the federal and state governments of Australia. Most pertinently, COAG decided that the focus of the federal government, in terms of heritage protection, ought to be on places of national significance. This is a most reasonable proposition in a federal polity. The great value of federalism is that it decentralises power and decision making to allow for policies that best reflect local interests. 
At the national level, the Commonwealth has an obvious role to play in safeguarding heritage, the value of which crosses state lines and transcends the parochial. Following COAG in 1997, the federal government undertook a long and productive process of community consultation, including the National Heritage Convention held in 1998. That consultation identified a number of deficiencies in the present heritage protection structure. At present, the 27-year-old Australian Heritage Commission Act does not offer adequate protection to places of national heritage significance. Its procedural deficiencies and overreliance on indirect triggers mean it is incapable of ensuring that heritage valued by all Australians is protected and fostered.
These reforms address those deficiencies and will provide, in place of the Australian Heritage Commission, an expert advisory body called the Australian Heritage Council. The council will consist of a chair and six other members, and its members will be experts drawn from relevant fields—for example, the environment, history, Indigenous studies and the like. The National Heritage List will also be established. This will comprise places of outstanding national heritage significance, whether that significance is cultural, historic or natural. Such places will also be protected by an improved management system to ensure best practice standards are maintained.
I note with particular approval the reference by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in his second reading speech on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 to the possible inclusion on the National Heritage List of places identified with Australian industry. We often think of Indigenous heritage, sporting heritage, natural heritage or artistic heritage, but it is equally valid to recognise our industrial heritage, such as mining places, pastoral places or industrial places. These are sites that have given to our society work, wealth, and material and collective identity. I think this aspect will be appreciated by representatives from both sides of this House.
It does have widespread ramifications. Just think of the preservation of heritage sites in terms of the tourism industry and the enhancement that such preserved sites can bring to tourism in this country. I would like to see a number of places in Western Australia considered for assessment. I take as an example the heritage precinct of Perth. This comprises a number of the earliest buildings of the Swan River Colony. The heritage precinct is the area around the intersection of Barrack Street and St George's Terrace, around Stirling Gardens. It includes the original Supreme Courthouse, a tiny little house at the bottom of Stirling Gardens, built with bricks made by convict labour. Government House is also in Stirling Gardens. It was also built by convict labour and is a superb example of early colonial architecture. There is the Treasury building across the road on St George's Terrace and the magnificent St George's Cathedral, which is one of the most gracious and yet simply adorned cathedrals that I have ever seen. The Town Hall is also in this area. It is a delightful little building made of bricks of clay from a clay pit just down the road which is now Queens Gardens in the city. 
All of these buildings surround the place where the Swan River Colony was founded. This is where Mrs Dance cut down a tree to mark the foundation of the colony in 1829. As the story goes, Captain Dance—who was the captain of HMAS Sulphur—was meant to take the longboat from the coast up the river to found the colony but he got sick with a cold that day and so he had to send his wife along instead. Back on that day in August 1829 Mrs Dance got into the longboat and went up to the place where the Swan River Colony was founded and cut down a tree. Trust the women to finish the job.
We are not just concerned about places within Australia. As the minister noted to the House, this recognition might include places of national significance such as Lone Pine on the Gallipoli peninsula—the rocky outcrop thousands of kilometres away that symbolises the heart of our nation—the Kokoda Trail in Papua New Guinea or even Australia House in London. The reforms provide for the assessment by the Australian Heritage Council of nominations, the listing of which will then be subject to the approval of the federal minister. A management plan will then be developed for each place added to the National Heritage List.
I should note in this regard that the Register of the National Estate, which presently has about 13,000 recorded entries, will be retained as a useful source of information for the promotion of heritage protection. Information on the register will also be considered in the context of actions taken under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Places listed under the National Heritage List, the Register of the National Estate and the respective lists held by the state and territory governments will be accessible to the public by way of the Australian Heritage Places Inventory database. I think this is a terrific idea: an efficient, coordinated resource for heritage places throughout Australia providing all the convenience of a one-stop shop.
The benefits of the reforms to Australian heritage laws are considerable. There will now be a greater certainty in terms of the respective roles to be played in heritage protection by the states and by the Commonwealth. This will be an advantage not only to the governments concerned but to citizens, who will now be better able to identify the responsible level of government and bring to the appropriate representatives their concerns, wishes, hopes, dreams and aspirations in relation to places of national significance in this country. This simplified and clarified system will also benefit industry, which will be better able to navigate through the murky world of development approval. An increased use of voluntary conservation agreements will allow for a more flexible approach to the conservation of heritage places located on private land. I commend this package of bills to the House.",REPS,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 represent the latest attempt by the Howard government to water down the Commonwealth's involvement in the protection of Australia's rich cultural and environmental heritage. This is not the government's first attempt at lessening the protection currently afforded to these assets. The heritage bills were first introduced into the Senate in December 2000 and were debated in that chamber in August 2001. They were never brought to this House for debate because of the deficiencies in the legislation. The Liberal and National parties have a long and unfortunate record in sponsoring or defending private interests which seek to destroy or compromise our environmental and cultural heritage, so I guess it is not surprising that the Howard government has introduced this insipid package of legislation into this House.  
Australia is a young nation and, in an increasingly global environment, it is often difficult for ordinary citizens to retain a sense of their own history, culture and identity. Our young people are bombarded on a daily basis with ideas, cultural mores, styles of dress and language from other societies with enormous propaganda resources to project into other communities not only the best of their own culture but the very worst. One means whereby nations that possess unique cultural characteristics can preserve and enhance their cultures in the face of this onslaught is to pay careful attention to the preservation of their cultural, historical and environmental heritage and to encourage their citizens to understand and take pride in that heritage. 
Here in Australia we have not been all that successful in that regard. In my own electorate of Corio, based on Victoria's premier provincial city of Geelong, local governments and the community in the past have not done nearly enough to preserve the cultural heritage of the city—a source of considerable regret to many people older than I am who have witnessed the destruction of that heritage in recent decades. Fortunately, Labor governments in power have done much in my own area to preserve the city's environmental and cultural heritage for generations to come. It was Labor in partnership with the then City of Geelong that commenced the refurbishment of the eastern beach area of the city and the public bathing area that is now so popular with residents in the summertime.
It passed the old Commonwealth Customs House to the City of Geelong to enable the local community to preserve this asset. I note the recent proposal by the Wathaurong Aboriginal Cooperative to use the building for its purpose, in particular the retailing of Wathaurong glass to the wider tourist community. Labor in government is very proud of the role it played in Geelong in the refurbishment of the Deakin Woolstores campus, turning the old Dennys Lascelles Woolstore into a student campus and providing a world-class auditorium for showcasing local and international talent.
Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, I know that you are a child of the sixties—perhaps a child of the seventies—so you would have an appreciation of the former Little River Band. Of course, they cannot go under that name any more. Glenn Shorrock, along with Beeb Birtles and Graham Goble, formed that great vocal trio in the Little River Band, who will be appearing in Geelong on Friday night in a very important cultural asset to the city, the Deakin Woolstores campus. There are other examples of Labor's involvement in the restoration and protection of not only the built environment in the Geelong area but also the physical environment. 
Last night on SBS I watched, along with many members, the interview with Gough Whitlam. In those golden Labor years from 1972 to 1975, Australia awoke from the stupor that it had fallen into under 23 years of Liberal rule. One of the great pieces of legislation that was passed by that government was the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, which, as former members have intimated, set the framework for world's best practice in Australia and elsewhere in the protection of environmental and cultural assets. It was a source of great pride to watch that program and know that many assets that would have been destroyed if the Liberal and National parties had continued in office are now part of Australia's rich cultural and environmental heritage. That is why I am appalled at this Howard government legislation. It reduces the current protection afforded to our cultural and environmental heritage in my own area and right across Australia. 
The limitations of this legislation in protecting our cultural and environmental heritage have been widely canvassed and I note the continued opposition of the Australian Conservation Foundation and a group of former chairs of the Australian Heritage Commission to the legislation as it is being proposed by the government, particularly concerning the powers of the minister to finally list. This is regarded as a thinly veiled attempt by the government to politicise the listing process in the whole area of heritage protection. I do not propose to outline all the major areas of concern by the opposition to this legislation as some of those have already been canvassed by previous speakers on this side, and they will be canvassed by successive speakers from the opposition in this debate. However, there is one substantial area of the legislation which is of particular concern to me, and that is the fate of the 13,000 places currently on the Register of the National Estate and, in particular, the many sites in the Geelong area that are currently on the register.  
In this legislation the government seeks to replace the Heritage Commission, which currently operates with a broad range of functions, with the Heritage Council, which will operate purely as an advisory body under ministerial direction. The Register of the National Estate will be replaced by the National Heritage List, which will create a limited list of places of national heritage significance. The government will also create the Commonwealth Heritage List of Commonwealth owned places of heritage significance—once again, a smaller, restricted list. The question that has to be answered is: what protection will be afforded those assets in the Geelong area and elsewhere that are currently on the Register of the National Estate but that will not make it onto the new National Heritage List or the Commonwealth Heritage List?
In the Geelong area there are a variety of churches, hotels and public and private buildings that are currently on the Register of the National Estate. For example, as far as churches go, there is St Paul's Anglican Church, St Peter and Paul's Catholic Church in Mercer Street, St George's Presbyterian Church and manse, Christ Church, St John's Lutheran Church and the Church of Christ. Will these buildings that are very precious to Geelong's cultural heritage be listed on the new registers that are being set up by the government under this legislation? There are the beautiful old hotels in Geelong that are currently listed on the Register of the National Estate. I refer to the Golden Age, the Bayview Hotel, the Geelong Wool Exchange and Terminus Hotel. There are other buildings and houses, such as Corio Villa, the Dennys Lascelles Woolstore I referred to earlier, the Geelong Army Drill Hall, the Geelong Customs House, the Geelong Town Hall itself, Lunan House in Drumcondra and Wimmera House. There are others on this particular list, and I want to refer to one in detail, Osborne House, in a moment. The Commonwealth register currently provides some measure of protection, which will be removed if this legislation is passed, for many of these sites that have been listed on the national heritage register.
Osborne House is the subject of considerable community debate at this time. It was built in 1857 for the squatter Robert Muirhead. This large, historic bluestone building occupies a truly magnificent site overlooking Corio Bay. I am indebted to the Osborne Park Association, which is endeavouring to keep this facility in public hands for use for community purposes, for the material I am quoting from. Osborne House is very significant to Geelong's pastoral, naval, maritime, social and civic history. It was the home of Australia's first naval training college from 1913 to 1915, a submarine base during the 1920s and an army training base during World War II. It was a military hospital in World War I, and back in 1900 it was the state Premier's country retreat.
The Osborne Park Association has developed a unique proposal to create a heritage park and tourist facility at Osborne House and its stables that will showcase the early history of Victoria's largest provincial city, Geelong. It is a very interesting proposal. On 17 November there will be an open day at Osborne House and I urge all interested citizens in the city of Geelong to go along. The open day will see the arrival of the sailing ship Enterprize—the dignitaries and the mayor will sail over from Cunningham Pier to the Osborne House area. The Trailable Yacht Club will stage races at 10 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. The Wathaurong people will welcome to their traditional land everyone who attends the function. The Naval Reserve cadets will perform a fife and drum routine, and the Geelong Maritime Museum will be open to the public free of charge for the afternoon. There will be a wide range of activities on that day for the community to enjoy, and they will hear about the unique proposal to create a heritage park and tourist facility at Osborne House. 
We know that during the Kennett era and the era of the commissars in Geelong—the commissioners who were appointed when local government was abolished in Victoria—Osborne House was under threat of sale. It is a unique historical and cultural asset, not only to Geelong but to the state of Victoria, however, it has been under threat, most recently when the Kennett government was in power. I pay tribute to the Osborne Park Association for the magnificent effort they have put in to preserve Osborne House in public hands to be used for community purposes. I pay particular tribute to the former mayor of the City of Greater Geelong, Gerry Smith, to Cheryl Scott, Peter O'Brien and to others on that Osborne House committee who have laboured long and hard to persuade the City of Greater Geelong and its officers to take a keen interest in this facility and to ensure that it serves the people of Geelong and Victoria in future generations. They have faced enormous obstacles in this task: obstacles within the City of Greater Geelong, and apathy from councils and former mayors. Of course, if the public of Geelong do not get behind this particular proposal it may well wither on the vine and we may well see this very important community asset sold to private entrepreneurs for use as a restaurant or for some other facility on the site.
The question is: will Osborne House wither under this legislation that is now before the House? I suggest that it would have little protection in any sense if this legislation were to proceed. That is the fate of many of the sites that are on the Register of the National Estate under the current legislation. Most of those listings will not be there under this new legislation being proposed by the coalition government. Labor have many concerns with this bill. I have mentioned the downgrading of the Australian Heritage Commission to an advisory council. We have concerns about the watering down of the definition of `action' on the part of the Commonwealth, and we will be proposing amendments to reinstate the definition of `action' to that which applies under the current legislation. We are proposing amendments to the preparation of management plans and heritage strategies under this legislation. We have concerns about interim arrangements for heritage protection of listed sites. We are going to propose to add all Commonwealth places on the Register of the National Estate to the Commonwealth Heritage List. We are also concerned about the protection of places or values. Labor support protection of a heritage place and its associated values, not just the values as proposed under this legislation.
In conclusion, let me say once again that it always falls to Labor to protect the public interest in these matters. The Liberal and National parties have historically watered down, have attempted to water down or have opposed legislation that would give the Commonwealth power to protect the cultural and heritage assets of the nation. I wonder why this is so.
—The honourable member is new to the House. He might be a gun footballer in the media scrums and the media games that we participate in, but he was probably only a little whippersnapper back in the 1970s when we saw the party to which he now belongs hell-bent on destroying Australia's environmental heritage down in the Gordon below Franklin in Tasmania. Once again it was the Labor Party that stepped into the breach—opposed all the way by the Liberal and National parties—that preserved that wilderness area for all time for all Australians. That is why we are proud of what occurred in the years 1972 to 1975—because Labor set a framework. Labor set the standard that you are now trying to water down to your eternal shame. We will be proposing amendments to make sure that this legislation is up to standard and is not being watered down. We will see how the government handles these amendments. There are always actions that can be taken in another place to ensure that this government does the right thing and does not water down this very important legislation designed to protect Australia's cultural and environ-mental heritage.",REPS,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—I am delighted to speak on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002. These bills form a package which is aimed at preserving the most significant places within Australia in the environmental and heritage sphere. They represent a significant step forward for the protection of those places which represent our heritage, our environment and the very values which give us a sense of place, purpose, position and meaning. I am proud to speak on these bills. They represent a watershed in heritage protection. I want to speak on five aspects: first, core environmental and heritage issues within my own seat of Flinders; second, the government's proud record on the environment and heritage; third, the current heritage regime and some of the challenges which necessitate these changes; fourth, the provisions of the bills themselves; and finally, the benefits which flow from these actions. 
Turning first to the question of environmental and heritage issues in my own seat of Flinders, only last week 22 Envirofund projects were announced in the successor to the Natural Heritage Trust. This meant that projects such as Warrangine Park in Bittern and Hastings, the Balcombe Estuary in Mount Martha, preservation of the foreshore at Kilcunda, and preservation and restoration of the foreshore at Cannons Creek are all now being offered an opportunity to advance, succeed and proceed where none existed before. The Envirofund offers a chance which simply has not existed in Australian history for the government to support the work of community organisations in protecting and promoting heritage and environmental values.
The second issue within my electorate of Flinders is the restoration of the natural order at Gunnamatta beach. The Boags Rocks outfall is one of Victoria's disgraces. Four hundred and twenty million litres of water proceed from the Carrum Downs treatment plant, underneath the Mornington Peninsula, and exit at Boags Rocks. There they create a toxic environmental plume and the result is a danger to health, extraordinary damage to the environment and a manifest waste of water. Only last week the Clean Ocean Foundation presented Melbourne Water with Victoria's Don't be a Wally with Water award for the year 2002. What needs to be done there is for concrete steps to be taken towards cleaning up the quality of the water and, ultimately, the cessation of the outfall, which should be twinned with a national policy to end all ocean outfalls by the year 2025.
The third of the environmental issues within my electorate of Flinders, one which I consider very salient, is the future of Point Nepean. Point Nepean is an area of great national, historical and heritage beauty. It was offered free of charge to the Bracks Victorian government by the Commonwealth government this year. In addition, in 2001 the Commonwealth government, under the Federation Fund, gave $4 million towards the restoration of the grand buildings within Point Nepean. What was the state government's response? The state government's response was to say, `No. Thank you for the offer, but we won't accept it. Instead, in order to take land, we want $35 million given to us.' What an extraordinary action which puts at risk the future of that area. That responsibility rests solely and squarely with the Bracks government, which has refused to accept an extraordinarily generous offer. We will resolve this issue irrespective of the state government, which made itself irrelevant to the final solution leading to no housing, no preservation of the bush and no constructive use of the buildings.
I now want to turn to the government's broader record on the environment and heritage. There have been many profound initiatives since 1996. Perhaps first and most important is the over $2½ billion spent on the Natural Heritage Trust. The provision of money for this initiative was opposed by Labor when they opposed the sale of Telstra. They simply would not allow the greatest bonanza that we have ever had for environment and heritage in Australia to occur. My own electorate of Flinders, one of 150 electorates, saw 22 community projects funded during last week alone. There was also the extension of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by 4,830 square kilometres, $10½ million provided over three years for conservation projects under the Cultural Heritage Projects Program and $5 million allocated for the restoration of historic pubs in regional Australia. No doubt the member for Corio will take us through a tour of them, as he did in his speech on the pubs of Geelong. 
But, going forward, what is it that the government will do? Firstly, it will increase the level of Natural Heritage Trust community grants, designed to support environmental conservation projects. That is a tremendous opportunity for small communities in every corner of Australia to work—and it will require work, because this is not an easy thing—to clean up and restore areas of beauty which would never have been possible without the Natural Heritage Trust and its successor, Envirofund. Secondly, the government will push for World Heritage assessment for the Opera House, for the Melbourne exhibition buildings and for a range of convict sites around Australia. That World Heritage listing is something which is conceived within this legislation as being at the apex of the whole process of environmental and conservation protection.
The provisions in this legislation will fulfil the government's promises made in its 2001 election policy in the Measures for a Better Environment package. The core of that was the promise of protecting the existing Register of the National Estate. Contrary to the assertions made by the member for Corio, the Register of the National Estate exists and will continue to be recognised for the purposes of public education and the promotion of heritage conservation generally. In addition, the 2001 policy promised a new Commonwealth heritage regime with, at its peak, the establishment of a Commonwealth Heritage List. So how does this legislation bring that promise into being? This brings me to the third part of the question this evening. The current heritage regime was established by the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, but there are limits with this regime. The current Register of the National Estate includes places of local and state significance rather than places of national significance. It fails to give prominence to or to highlight those areas which are of genuine importance to the country as a whole. As a result, there is unnecessary duplication, leading to inefficiency and confusion regarding jurisdiction. There is also a lack of protection for places of national significance. Far from in any way diluting the protection for those areas which we regard as sacred and of significance, this legislation for the first time offers powerful legislative protection for places of national significance. The current act simply does not provide for the protection of sites of environmental significance.
How do the provisions in these three bills work? Together, they will replace and augment the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. The first objective is to establish a comprehensive heritage regime for places of national significance both at home and, for the first time, abroad. Places such as Gallipoli, El Alamein and the Kokoda Trail and perhaps even parts of Bali, following the tragedy there, can be registered as being places of national significance. That is quite a change of mindset. The second objective is to list such places on the National Heritage List. The third objective is to protect and to manage these places of national significance. If we turn to the first bill, what it does above all else is to create a hierarchy: firstly, World Heritage listing, which is carried out by UNESCO; secondly, national heritage listing, both within the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List for Commonwealth land; thirdly, state heritage listing; and, at the same time, the long-term maintenance of the Register of the National Estate so not one property which is on the current Register of the National Estate departs from that.
Schedule 1 of the legislation creates the National Heritage List. The National Heritage List will be compiled by the minister through consultation with the Australian Heritage Council and will be formed by the cognate legislation. A place on the list will entail national environmental significance under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999, which is to be amended. In addition, schedule 1 creates for the first time the Commonwealth Heritage List, which assesses Commonwealth land. The minister will select places within Commonwealth areas which are to be inscribed on the Commonwealth Heritage List, and it will be possible to consult the Heritage Council if required. In addition, there will be conservation of biodiversity and heritage. 
Schedule 2 of the bill allows for advice on Indigenous heritage, which is a very critical step if we are to recognise the full sense of place for all Australians. Schedule 3 ensures that the Register of the National Estate is maintained and that those buildings which are currently on the Register of the National Estate maintain their place and their standing. Schedule 4 enables the minister to delegate any of his or her powers under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act to the Director of National Parks.
The second bill, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002, provides for the establishment of the Australian Heritage Council. The role of the council is to assess nominations for places on both the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List and to advise the minister on the identification, preservation and management of heritage sites. All of this is backed up by the final bill, the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002. That bill repeals the Australian Heritage Commission Act and amends other acts in order to allow seamless transition between the current and proposed heritage regimes.
What do these bills achieve together? First, the proposed legislation would eliminate the problem of heritage listing duplication and simplify the legal situation covering heritage sites. Second, the legislation clearly specifies the framework within which decisions are to be made regarding heritage sites. Third, it focuses the Commonwealth's attention on places of national rather than local significance. Fourth, it improves the protection of places of national significance both within Australia and abroad in a way which has never previously been available. I respect the work which was done with the 1975 act, and this does not derogate from it. It builds upon it and creates a new layer of recognition and protection which has never been available in Australia.
Ultimately, this legislation creates a platform from which future generations will be able to look back with pride on those buildings and those areas of natural beauty within Australia which have been protected and preserved and which enshrine the most important areas and the most important elements of each of the different ages of Australian history. I commend these bills to the House. I urge all members to support them because they take forward the protection of our environment and our heritage in a way which has never before been achieved.",REPS,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—This package of bills—the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002—represents the latest attempt by the Howard government to overhaul the current regime for the protection, conservation and management of heritage in Australia. The Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 underpinned a regime for the protection, conservation and management of heritage that has been highly regarded around the world. It was one of the many great reforms of the Whitlam government and it provides an enduring legacy for which we can all be grateful. On a practical level, this regime revolutionised the management of Australian heritage. More than a quarter of a century after its introduction, this regime has been instrumental in the preservation of much of Australia's heritage. We cannot begin to imagine the rich array of heritage locations which would have been lost had it not been for the visionary reforms that Whitlam is so famous for. Indeed, the very concept of a Register of the National Estate exists because of the 1975 act. However, after more than a quarter of a century, Australia's heritage regime requires updating. However, these bills—sadly—do not meet that requirement.
Consistent with the Howard government's poor record on the environment, this legislation joins a long list of failures. Since 1996, this government's environment policy failures have resulted in approval for uranium mining in Jabiluka, a multibillion dollar environmental pork barrel in the form of the Natural Heritage Trust, which has given funding disproportionately to projects in government electorates, and the continuing refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. This government is leaving a shameful environmental legacy, one that will endure long after it has left office. This package of bills only adds to its list of failures. 
Despite the changes made by the government to these bills since they were first introduced in the previous parliament, they still fall well short of achieving an effective overhaul of the protection, conservation and management of heritage in Australia. Labor supports the stated objective of these bills but does not believe that, even with the changes made to present them in their current format, they will achieve these objectives. For this reason, Labor has proposed a series of amendments to the bills to enable them to achieve these objectives.
In highlighting the deficiencies of these bills, I want to focus on the impact they would have on existing heritage locations within my electorate of Swan. Covering just 108 square kilometres and comprising mainly urban residential and industrial areas within the Perth metropolitan area, Swan is home to a small number of heritage locations. In comparison to neighbouring inner metropolitan electorates such as Curtin, Fremantle and Perth, Swan has only a small number of heritage locations which are presently listed on the Register of the National Estate. While they may be few in number, there is a remarkable diversity in terms of the types of heritage locations there.
There is the magnificent art deco cinema, the Cygnet, in Como, which many Western Australians, myself included,  have visited since childhood and where they have enjoyed countless movies. It is a cinema I still visit with my family, and I did so about two weekends ago. It has retained an atmosphere and a charm that is not found in the modern cinema complex. Only a short distance from my electorate office in Victoria Park is the Edward Millen Hospital, which has provided a range of medical services to the community in its lifetime. It is presently disused but the Western Australian government and the town of Victoria Park continue to work on a master plan to ensure its preservation, at the same time allowing for appropriate redevelopment so that it can be used by the community. I am sure that the involvement of the local member for Victoria Park, who just happens to be the Premier, Dr Geoff Gallop, a scholar of history, will see this facility preserved for the community into the future.
The Perth Zoo, in South Perth, holds important significance for the people of Western Australia. There would be few who have not visited the zoo at least once in their lifetime. Growing up virtually next door to the zoo, it was a place I visited many times as a child. As a parent, I regularly visit with my family and marvel at the enjoyment my sons derive from watching and interacting with the animals. As a member of parliament, I am impressed by the work of the zoo in educating the community about different species of animals and in contributing to the preservation of various animals at risk of extinction. I spoke recently in this chamber about the important work of the zoo in contributing to the preservation of orang-outangs through its highly successful breeding program. I commend to members a recently published book entitled Orangutans and their battle for survival, authored by Leif Cocks who is the curator of exotic mammals at Perth Zoo. Royalties from the book will go towards the zoo's orang-outang appeal.
There are also a number of important natural environment heritage locations in Swan, such as the Canning River Wetlands and the Milyu Nature Reserve. While these heritage locations may be few in number, most importantly they are equally deserving of ongoing heritage recognition, protection and management. These bills will fail, unfortunately, to achieve these objectives. The proposition in these bills, that the Australian Heritage Commission be replaced by the Australian Heritage Council, is not supported by Labor. It represents the downgrading of the commission, which equates to the downgrading of the Commonwealth government's commitment to heritage. The Australian Heritage Commission should remain not just in name, but also with its existing functions and powers. 
The process by which locations are listed is an important part of the overall heritage regime. Presently, the assessment of locations is undertaken by the Australian Heritage Commission. The new bills politicise this process by giving the minister the power to make decisions on whether to list or not. This function should remain with the Australian Heritage Commission so that the process remains independent and does not suffer the same politicisation that this government is allowing to tarnish many other government organisations.
The increased powers given to the minister through these bills also lack appropriate transparency. While the minister can invite public comment, there is no specification of the issues the minister should consider when making a decision nor any obligation for the minister to consider the advice of the Australian Heritage Commission. Governments, including ministers, must be accountable for the decisions they make, and this is achieved through transparency in decision making. This government is notorious for the secrecy surrounding many decisions it makes and its unwillingness to be open and accountable with the public. Labor does not support this proposed decision making process, which fundamentally lacks transparency and accountability. Labor also opposes the objective of these new bills, which would see heritage protection afforded to only the heritage values of a place. Labor's consistent position on heritage protection has been that of protecting a place and its associated values rather than the heritage values alone.
Under the present heritage regime, around 13,000 places are listed on the Register of the National Estate. These new bills seek to create a National Heritage List, which is a list of places of national heritage significance, and a Commonwealth Heritage List, which is a list of Commonwealth government owned places of heritage significance. The existing 13,000 places listed will not automatically be listed on either the new national or Commonwealth heritage lists. While the Register of the National Estate will still technically exist, once the 1975 act is repealed, the protection it affords will cease. Thus, there is no certainty that those places presently listed will be listed in the future and, if they are, when this might occur. Labor is concerned that the vast majority of places presently on the Register of the National Estate will not be transferred to either of the two new lists. This represents a major downgrading of Australia's regime for the protection, conservation and management of heritage.
The transitional process from listing on the Register of the National Estate to listing on the new National Heritage List or Commonwealth Heritage List is flawed and consistent with the overall impact of these bills—that is, a major downgrading of Australia's heritage regime. These bills do not provide for any procedures to manage the transition from the Register of the National Estate to the Commonwealth Heritage List. There is no provision for even a public consultation process. The minister does not have to seek the advice of the proposed Australian Heritage Council before deciding whether or not to transfer a property.
Labor has a simple position on these bills—that is, they do not achieve the objectives that are important for the regime to protect, conserve and manage Australia's heritage. Labor acknowledges that the government has made some improvements to the bills since they were presented in the previous parliament. However, these changes were only made because of pressure from Labor on the government. The amendments Labor has proposed are necessary for this bill to achieve its objectives. Without further amendment, the Commonwealth government will introduce a heritage regime that fundamentally downgrades our commitment to the protection, conservation and management of Australia's heritage. Without further amendment, Labor will take the only responsible action available to it and will oppose these bills.",REPS,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—The three bills that we are considering today, the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002, represent the most important, comprehensive and far-reaching changes to the way in which heritage places are managed and protected in Australia. They are a reflection of the genuine interest and concern that the Howard government has for the protection of those wonderful places—natural, Indigenous and historic—that reflect Australia's unique environment and the continent's cultural development during both Aboriginal and Islander history and post-European settlement. 
I had the great honour of serving as the chair of the Australian Heritage Commission for more than three years prior to the commencement of last year's election campaign when I was preselected and elected to this parliament. One of the more rewarding aspects of that period was observing and participating in the development of this legislation and the extensive consultation undertaken by both the Australian Heritage Commission and the government in finalising their reform proposals. This legislation is presented to the parliament against the background of traditional Commonwealth leadership in this area. In 1973 the then government commissioned Justice Robert Hope to inquire into Australia's national estate. His report led to the creation of the Australian Heritage Commission and the Register of the National Estate—proposals advanced and strongly supported by both Prime Minister Whitlam and Prime Minister Fraser during the 1974 and 1975 period. At the time, the Australian Heritage Commission and its enacting legislation put the Commonwealth at the head of the emerging community interest in providing better protection for and proper identification of those places of cultural and natural significance to our nation. The concept of the national estate was in itself groundbreaking both here and in most parts of the world.
It is worth noting that the passage of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1974 occurred at a time when the state level protection for heritage places was, at best, patchy. Some states protected a limited range of historic buildings. None had heritage protection regimes that comprehensively identified and listed or offered protection for heritage places with both natural and cultural values. In many respects the legislation that we consider today reflects the fact that states have caught up, but in some cases they still have a long way to go. Certainly most states now provide legislative protection for Indigenous and built heritage places. Very few, however, have legislation that allows for the listing and protection of natural heritage places outside the formal conservation reserve system.
The Australian Heritage Commission Act has structurally changed little in the almost 30 years of its operation. During that time the commission has established an international reputation for its work to identify heritage places, promote sound conservation practices and encourage greater community awareness of the value of our national heritage. As chair of the Australian Heritage Commission I experienced how highly its work is regarded around the world. For example, I visited Beijing with commission staff at the request of the Chinese government to share our experience as China seeks to improve its management of that nation's incredible heritage. More recently during my visit to Israel earlier this year, I met with heritage officials in that country who expressed an interest in the Natural Heritage Charter and the Burra Charter, prepared by the commission. I was pleased to learn that those documents have now been translated into Hebrew and are being used to guide that country's development of heritage practice.
Since its establishment, the commission has listed over 13,000 places in the Register of the National Estate, and by their identification in that way communities across the country have a greater appreciation of those heritage places in their midst. There can be no doubt that the Australian Heritage Commission has been a success and that the dedication of its commissioners and staff has had a tangible influence on the growth in community understanding of the value of heritage places. This legislation follows a process that began in 1996 that reflected both the new Howard government's desire to strengthen and reform the Commonwealth heritage regime and an internal realisation within the commission that new approaches were desirable. Under the chair of my predecessor at the commission, Wendy McCarthy, the commission began what it described as a future directions process. I particularly want to acknowledge today the leadership of both Ms McCarthy and the then executive of the commission, Sharon Sullivan, in that regard. 
In 1998 I had the honour of convening the first National Heritage Convention in Old Parliament House, which brought together heritage practitioners, community leaders and government officials in a way that I do not think had ever occurred before. That convention developed a set of heritage principles, the spirit of which is reflected in this legislation. The Australian Heritage Commission's work in developing proposals for the future of the Commonwealth's involvement in heritage issues occurred in tandem with intergovernmental processes initiated by the then environment minister, Senator Robert Hill. Part of the Commonwealth's goal was to not only improve the effectiveness of its own heritage regime but also lead improvements across all jurisdictions. Heritage issues were therefore an important part of discussions that occurred in 1997 at the Council of Australian Governments meeting.
At that meeting, the Prime Minister, premiers and chief ministers adopted the principle in the historic Heads of Agreement on Commonwealth and State Roles and Responsibilities for the Environment. The agreement was the foundation for the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which I believe will long be regarded as one of the more important legislative reforms implemented by this government. It also contained a commitment by governments to rationalise the existing Commonwealth-state arrangements for the identification, protection and management of heritage places. It envisaged the development of a national heritage policy which would include nationally consistent criteria and standards for identification and protection of heritage places and also agreement on the establishment of a new list of nationally significant heritage places.
This legislation reflects the spirit of that agreement, in that it seeks to reorganise and improve Commonwealth responsibilities for heritage protection in a way that recognises the federal government's national responsibilities. It is, however, a matter of regret that the legislation does not implement a national heritage strategy in the terms suggested by the COAG agreement to which I have just referred. This is disappointing, as there is no doubt that the cause of heritage protection would benefit from a streamlined joint Commonwealth and state approach, including common standards and listing criteria and common protective measures. Agreement on the division of responsibilities through the referral of certain state powers for national heritage places would also have strengthened the new national regime.
The fault for this gap in these reforms lies squarely with the intransigence of state governments. For two years the former environment and heritage minister, Senator Robert Hill, sought to negotiate the national strategy that premiers and chief ministers said they agreed was necessary. However it became apparent that the frequent rhetoric from the states urging the Commonwealth to concentrate on places of national significance was not going to be matched by support for a referral of powers to make that most effectively happen. Equally, the states were not prepared to sign off on rigorous standards that would provide the Commonwealth with the assurance that it needed before it considered devolving responsibility for those places of state and local heritage value currently listed on the Register of the National Estate.
In reality, what the states wanted was for the federal government to agree to a strategy that would have given it little more than a token role in relation to heritage protection. The people of Australia should be quite clear about that as we consider this legislation. The Commonwealth, correctly, has refused to agree to such a position and has pressed on with the drafting of this legislation to the extent of, but limited by, its constitutional powers. Through processes currently under way, I hope that the states will finally recognise that the Australian community does expect the federal government to have some responsibility for ensuring that places of clear significance to the entire nation warrant the protection of the national government. It is my fervent hope that it will not be too long before we can see the gaps in the new protective regime filled through the agreement that states claimed they were willing to progress at COAG. 
Reforms in the terms of this legislation are important for a number of reasons. Primarily, they relate to ensuring that the Commonwealth has greater power to protect those places that are of national significance. I mentioned earlier the important role that the Register of the National Estate has played in increasing awareness of the rich and varied heritage of this wonderful country, but the reality is that the register has been somewhat of a toothless tiger. Under the existing legislation, while the Commonwealth can list places through the auspices of the Australian Heritage Commission, it has virtually no power to protect those places. At present, a national estate listing only has implications for Commonwealth agencies, and their obligations are simply to seek the advice—known as section 30 advice—of the Australian Heritage Commission about the possible detrimental impact of proposals that affect listed places. While departments are required to consider prudent and feasible alternatives where damage may occur, neither the environment minister nor the commission have any actual powers to prevent even Commonwealth actions that may damage those sites. National estate listing does not provide even this protection against the actions of state governments, corporations or private individuals.
In reality, it would be inappropriate and unmanageable for the Commonwealth to exercise such powers in relation to the national estate. I say that for two reasons. Firstly, the national estate does not draw a hierarchical distinction between places of national or local significance. I support the philosophical position that such a hierarchy is desirable and that the Commonwealth should regard its legislative domain to be principally those places of national significance. Secondly, in an administrative sense it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to seek to monitor and protect the over 13,000 places on the Register of the National Estate without an unacceptably massive expansion of the environment department. At present the Australian Heritage Commission is only able to report on the state of the national estate in a very limited way, as each year's annual report demonstrates.
These bills are also important because they address a problem that the community has often expressed concern about and that was formally reflected in the landmark 1996 Schofield report; that is, the Commonwealth record of managing the heritage places it either owns or leases. While many departments and agencies perform this task superbly, many unfortunately do not. I think for example of the atrocious plans put forward by the Department of Defence for land around Sydney Harbour, plans that were only averted by the actions of Prime Minister Howard and Senator Hill in establishing the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. This legislation addresses these issues in two fundamental ways. First, the legislation will establish a new national list of heritage places and, for the first time, will give the federal government real powers to protect places included in the list. Regulations will prescribe the listing criteria for national heritage values but these will obviously be places of significance to the entire national community and will therefore be significantly smaller in number than those places on the Register of the National Estate. Through the established mechanisms of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, actions that could affect nationally listed places will need the approval of the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage and will be regarded as matters of national significance.
The Constitution does limit our ability to protect places on the national list as there is no direct head of power for the Commonwealth in relation to the protection of our environment and heritage. While the external affairs and Indigenous affairs powers allow for the comprehensive protection of places pertaining to natural and Indigenous heritage, the Commonwealth is largely limited in its capacity to protect what I would broadly describe as built heritage from the actions of federal agencies and constitutional corporations and from actions that relate to interstate and international trade and Commonwealth territories. It is for this reason that a referral of powers from the states is desirable for the Commonwealth regime to be truly comprehensive. In the long term I support consideration of constitutional amendments that would give the Commonwealth a direct head of power in relation to matters of national environmental and heritage significance, but that is a debate for another day. 
Places will be entered on the national list by the responsible minister, following advice from the Australian Heritage Council, which will replace the Australian Heritage Commission. I am aware of the considerable debate that has occurred about whether this should be the function of the minister or the council as an arms-length independent statutory authority. Proponents of the latter course point to the fact that the commission currently determines whether places should be included on the Register of the National Estate. Arms-length listing decisions are also proposed by some because of concern that listing decisions could become politicised. I strongly support the proposed methods of listing contained in this bill. Unlike inclusion of a place on the Register of the National Estate, the inclusion of a place on the national list will have direct legislative implications for the minister and the federal government in relation to management and protection. In our democratic system, it is entirely appropriate that the delegate of the elected government—that is, the minister—have responsibility for making decisions of this magnitude. In so doing, he or she will have before them the expert advice of the Australian Heritage Council on whether or not a place is of national heritage value, but it is proper that he or she should also be able to consider economic and social issues before a listing occurs.
I know that at times individuals and organisations do not like or trust what they would describe as `the political process', but that political process is our democratic process. What is important is that the minister's decision making be transparent. The bills ensure that that is so by requiring the minister to seek advice, both from the council and the community, to give reasons for his or her decisions. That is an actual requirement. I note that the approach adopted in the bills is consistent with the role the minister has in relation to other matters of national environmental significance as expressed in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. For example, the minister and the government determine whether to propose places for World Heritage and Ramsar listing. Similarly, the minister makes the final decision as to whether to list as threatened a species or ecological community.
The second aspect of the legislation that I briefly want to refer to is the way in which it addresses deficiencies in the management of Commonwealth owned heritage places. The bills do that principally by establishing a Commonwealth heritage list which will include places in Commonwealth territories that are owned or leased by the federal government and that contain heritage values. The threshold for inclusion on the list will be more akin to that which exists for the Register of the National Estate than the national list. I note in this regard that some have estimated that, for example, 800 places on the Register of the National Estate may be included on the Commonwealth list. The bills ensure a direct role for the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in approving actions by Commonwealth agencies that may harm places on the Commonwealth list. Importantly, and in line with the recommendations of the Schofield report on this area, the bills specifically require Commonwealth authorities to develop agency-wide strategies for the management of heritage places. They also encourage individual management plans for those places on the Commonwealth list. These are important reforms and long overdue.
The other reforms proposed in these bills relate to the Australian Heritage Commission and the Register of the National Estate. As I mentioned previously, the commission will be replaced by the new Australian Heritage Council. There will be some who mourn the passing of the commission, as it has many friends within the heritage community. While I am not sure that a change of name has served much purpose, I am confident that the new council will continue the fine traditions of the commission and take the mantle as the nation's pre-eminent heritage organisation. Its role will not be dissimilar to that of the commission and will in fact be expanded because of the creation of the national list and the Commonwealth list. These bills provide for it to continue to have an overarching advisory function in relation to heritage. It will have responsibility for promoting heritage conservation, education and best practice. It will also continue to maintain the Register of the National Estate. 
These bills reflect a change of direction by the government in relation to the Register of the National Estate. Originally it had been the government's intention to effectively freeze the Register of the National Estate so that it became a historical record to which additions were no longer made nor legislative responsibilities attached. These bills ensure that the Register of the National Estate continues in the living form kept by the new Australian Heritage Council. I know these changes will be welcomed by many in the community. In conclusion, these bills herald the beginning of an important new era in the way that we as a nation protect and treasure those heritage places that make us what we are. The task is vital. As the 1998 National Heritage Convention noted in its final communique:
... Australia should act as a community that respects, sustains and celebrates its diverse heritage, which connects us to the past, present and country for all generations.
In these bills, the Howard government has demonstrated the commitment to achieving that noble ambition. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—I rise today to speak on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002, as they directly impact on local treasures in the electorate of Stirling, such as Trigg Bushland, Star Swamp, the Centaur shipwreck at North Beach and Edlaston-Chellaston Reserve in Carine. These are all listed on the Register of the National Estate to preserve them for future generations. However, their future is now uncertain due to the provisions of these bills.
These bills are the Howard government's attempt to again impose complete ministerial control over whether a place is included on the new national and Commonwealth heritage lists—complete control over heritage issues in this country. It is obvious that the government has not learnt the lessons from the 2000 bills, which were debated in the Senate last year. The crux of the opposition to the 2000 bills was due to the blatant power grab by the minister to become the ultimate decision maker in determining what is heritage listed. I must concede that the government has made attempts to fix some of the other problems of the 2000 bills, and it must be acknowledged for making that attempt. The issues the government has attempted to resolve include those raised by the International Council on Monuments and Sites, ICOMOS, and ATSIC in the Senate references committee inquiry. I further acknowledge that these bills protect places with heritage value outside of Australia, which is a welcome development. I want to acknowledge that the government is also taking steps to recognise and protect areas that are culturally and historically significant to our Indigenous people.
So what are the differences between these bills and the 2000 bills? There are some substantive changes, which are outlined in the Bills Digest as follows:
·	the Register of the National Estate retains its statutory identity 
·	the Council may undertake assessments of places for potential listing of its own initiative as opposed to needing a Ministerial direction to do any assessment 
·	the Council has an enhanced role in advising the Minister 
·	National and Commonwealth Heritage places outside of Australia are protected, and 
·	Commonwealth agencies have greater responsibilities in relation to Commonwealth Heritage places they control or are intending to sell or lease.
Currently in Australia, the Register of the National Estate has approximately 13,000 places on it. It was established by the Whitlam Labor government in 1975 and operates through the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, the AHCA. How do its powers actually work? Unless a place is protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the EPBCA, the only substantive legal protection a place listed on the Register of the National Estate has is through section 30 of the AHCA. Section 30 of the AHCA imposes the following two duties on the Commonwealth: that any action proposed by the Commonwealth which adversely affects a place in the register should only be taken where the minister or authority proposing the action is satisfied there is `no feasible and prudent alternative', and, if the minister or authority is satisfied no such alternative exists, they must also be satisfied that all measures that can be reasonably taken to minimise the adverse effect will be taken. 
On the surface, the current legislation seems a little weak for those who advocate strong protection of heritage listed sites. There are some legal protections offered by the two duties I have just described. Under the legislation, there is no explicit requirement that the minister has to take into account the commission's comments. However, if the minister fails to do so, it could be argued in a court of law that the minister had breached the second duty. In the most extreme case, the court could find that due process had not been followed and it could invalidate any decision to proceed with the action. The important thing to recognise is that, effectively, heritage legislation in this country is toothless or not invasive, depending on your point of view on the issue. The current laws are by no means draconian and would not invite the same reaction of talkback callers as the recent crusade Paul Murray ran on 6PR radio in Perth against local government listing of residences. These bills deal with places that are actually culturally significant.
I will briefly outline the powers of the current laws. The Bills Digest succinctly describes the current status of the legislation in relation to civil or criminal penalties for breaches of the AHCA, as follows:
Listing a place in the Register imposes no direct legal constraints on owners of private property, or on State or Local governments—the Commission has no power to direct private owners or State or Local governments on their actions that might affect a place in the Register.
The only protection, albeit indirect, is that places on the register may be:
... protected under the environmental assessment provisions of the EPBCA, if the place is also a matter of national environmental significance (MNES), is on Commonwealth land, or the proposed action ... is to be undertaken by a Commonwealth agency. In such circumstances ... an action that will have a significant impact on the place on the Register, they must first get approval from the Commonwealth Environment Minister ... failure to get Ministerial approval before taking an action with a significant impact renders a person liable to up to seven years gaol or fines of over $550 000.
So what changes do these bills make? The first real change is that, although the register will remain, the AHCA will be repealed. This effectively removes the section 30 provisions I have spoken about. It removes the indirect protections: the two duties that I have just outlined. The Howard government is trying through this bill to replace the current structure with two separate lists: the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List. The net effect of this move is that the 13,000 places which currently exist on the register will be significantly reduced, leaving the places removed with absolutely no protection at all. Places that are transferred to the new National Heritage List will be covered by the indirect environmental protections I outlined before under the EPBCA.
The second issue that I have concerns about is the downgrading of the present commission to an advisory council which operates solely under the direction of the minister. This is totally unacceptable. My colleague the shadow minister for the environment and member for Wills has moved amendments to this bill to reinstate the functions and powers of the commission and retain its name. Labor does not want the commission turned into a rubber stamp for this minister. Continuing this rubber stamp policy, the minister is also changing the definition of `action' under this bill—maybe it should be described as `inaction'. Both the Australian Conservation Foundation and the International Council on Monuments and Sites have raised concerns about these changes. The deleted references include provisions for funding via grants and the granting of authorisations, including permits and licences. 
My colleague the member for Wills moved amendments to this bill to ensure that the deleted items are reinstated and to ensure that such actions include the making of Commonwealth decisions on grants which are excluded under section 524A of the EPBC Act. What this bill attempts to do, through technical means, is to eliminate the means to get grants to preserve the places of national significance. It is a mean and tricky way of cutting funding and redirecting it to projects or places that this government supports.
The important listing process is also severely affected by this bill. It changes fundamentally the concept of who gets to list places of significance. Previously, heritage values of a place have been assessed and determined by the independent Australian Heritage Commission. The process of listing has been considered a technical decision based on technical merit made by an independent body. The government now seeks to remove technical merit from the decision. In effect, it is dumbing down its decisions. Environment groups are not dumb. They see this move for what it really is: the politicisation of heritage protection. No wonder groups like the ACF are angry about this politicisation. It changes the whole philosophy of heritage protection; it rips the soul out of it. Labor are opposing this politicisation of the process and the centralisation of power in the minister's hands, and we have moved amendments to reinstate the independent listing process.
Another concern I have with this bill is the concept of protection of place versus the protection of values. Labor supports protection of a heritage `place and its associated values' rather than just the values. The ACF believes that the legislation should continue to protect places, including their associated values, as opposed to relying on just values. Labor has moved amendments to restore credibility to this bill by reinstating the specification of heritage `place and its associated values'.
I mentioned earlier in this debate the concerns I had about the future of the 13,000 places that are currently covered by the 1975 act. A serious deficiency of this bill is that once it becomes law no places will be listed on either the Commonwealth or national lists. In a Senate estimates committee hearing, the department indicated that approximately six places a year will be added to the list. My question to the minister is: how can we trust you to place the 13,000 places currently on the Register of the National Estate on these two lists? I want the minister to give us a guarantee on the public record that none of the 13,000 places currently on the Register of the National Estate will disappear into the ether. Is the government prepared to give this guarantee?
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, in the electorate of Stirling there are some significant sites of environmental and heritage importance. Luckily, there are a number of local volunteer groups that have been set up to ensure that these sites are protected and nurtured for future generations. I am going to briefly outline the activities of these groups to ensure their commitment and work do not go unrecognised. As a member of all of these groups, I would like to publicly reaffirm my commitment to them and to the conservation of the valuable natural assets in the Stirling electorate.
Bushland in the Perth metropolitan area is a scarce commodity. The importance of urban bushland was not recognised by planners and governments until too much of it had been cleared for urban use. That means that the remaining sites need to be carefully protected from any future development. I will look at these sites individually, starting with Trigg Bushland, a site which will be affected by this legislation. Community action saw Trigg Bushland listed on the Register of the National Estate in 1987, and I want to place on notice that, if this government fails to ensure that this bushland is protected under this new legislation, I will personally lead a community campaign against the government to save this national treasure.
To give the House a fair indication of the importance of the area in question, I will read from the brochure circulated by the Friends of Trigg Bushland: 
Trigg Bushland is one of the few larger bushland reserves (122ha) in the inner suburbs of Perth. It preserves a range of vegetation typical of the coastal strip and exhibits a progression of soil and vegetation types found in no other metropolitan reserve. Trigg Bushland is an important habitat for resident wildlife and it provides a sanctuary for birds moving from one bushland area to another.
The bushland is managed by the City of Stirling under a management plan. The plan involves an ongoing program which includes the rehabilitation of vegetation, erosion and weed control, upgrading tracks to improve fire management and public access, and maintaining fences and signs. In partnership with the City of Stirling, the Friends of Trigg Bushland Inc. help conserve the natural habitat of the reserve. The role of the group is best summarised by the description in their brochure:
The Friends group, formed at a public meeting in 1990, actively contributes to the implementation of the Management Plan, and is represented on the City of Stirling's Management Advisory Committee for Star Swamp and Trigg Bushland Reserves. The Friends conduct monthly guided walks through different parts of the reserve, collect seeds, remove weeds and rubbish, and assist with bush regeneration and fire watch schemes.  The Group's committee meets monthly and produces a newsletter and a calendar of events. New members are encouraged. Urban bushland areas are under constant pressure and need your help.
The Friends of Trigg Bushland need to be commended for the thousands of hours of work that they have put into the site over the years. A special mention needs to be made of Robyn Murphy, who was one of the driving forces in setting up the group. Robyn was the president of the group pretty much from its inception, and I was honoured by an invitation to an appreciation dinner held in her honour by the group a few months ago. Robyn has decided to step aside from the committee to let the next generation carry on the good work. Robyn and her husband Harley visited me in Canberra recently. It was great to catch up with them. I would also like to acknowledge the work of Challis Tilbrook, Lisette Nigot and Phyllis Robertson, who contribute enormously to the work of the committee.
Another place in my electorate that is on the Register of the National Estate is Star Swamp. Star Swamp is a complete wetland ecological system containing a wide range of animal and plant life. Large areas of reeds and rushes provide nesting sites for waterfowl. The swamp and surrounding vegetation of tuart woodland and banksia woodland are examples of wetland and forest formations that are becoming very depleted on the Swan plain. The swamp was first registered in 1983.
The Friends of Star Swamp is another local environmental group. They do hundreds of hours of work and conduct open days and walks. I am a member of the Friends of Star Swamp, and I would like to thank Christine Currie, David Pike, Jennifer Rogers and the other members of the committee for their dedication. On the site of the Star Swamp is the Henderson Environmental Centre, which was opened in April 2001. The Henderson Environmental Centre was made possible by a generous donation of $150,000 from Joyce Brushfield, a local North Beach resident. I was pleased that Joyce was able to be at the opening of the centre before she passed away last year. Her legacy will certainly live on through generations to come. I have been working closely with Councillor Bill Stewart to get funding from state and federal governments so that the centre can be open full time. Bill has been working nonstop with the officers from the City of Stirling to make the centre a viable and vibrant ongoing concern. I would like to thank Bill publicly again for his hard work for the North Beach, Trigg and Scarborough community. Changes to the grant system in this bill do not make me feel confident that any funding will be available for the Henderson Environmental Centre.
Finally, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of Jan Bant and the other members of the Friends of Dianella Bushland group. The group has been doing a lot of displays at local shopping centres and the Dianella library to advertise the group and to get families involved in the group's activities—activities such as the fungi walk. Phyllis Robertson, whom I have mentioned already in this debate, takes great photos which are a real asset to their displays. I attended the group's meeting in June and really enjoyed the lively debate by members. Although this bill does not directly affect the Dianella bushland, the site is of great environmental significance and needs to be preserved. 
In closing, I want to make this statement to the minister and this government: your environmental credentials are in tatters due to your refusal to ratify the Kyoto agreement. Why don't you do something positive for a change and not harp on about the pork-barrelling you engaged in in regional Australia as a basis for your environmental credentials? Do some things now: accept the Labor amendments to these bills if you are serious about environmental heritage and heed the Labor Party's call to ratify Kyoto. Without the Labor amendments, I will oppose this bill.",REPS,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—Our cultural and natural heritage is part of our identity. It is part of our understanding of who we are and from where we have evolved. We come to know our heritage in all sorts of ways. It is passed through the generations in oral and written histories, but we also absorb it, consciously or by osmosis, from objects and sites in our environment. Sometimes we take our environment and heritage for granted, and we may pass key examples of it every day without giving them a thought. There are a large number of places in my own electorate of Kooyong which are listed on the Register of the National Estate. While we may not fully appreciate them every time we pass them, we would certainly notice if they were gone.
Whether or not it is at the forefront of our consciousness, our heritage is of immense value to us. It is impossible to fully keep or transmit this heritage in words or in pictures. Even with the wonders of modern technology, with digital images and sound, the only way we can fully preserve heritage places is by preserving the physical matter that embodies the heritage values of these places.
It is incumbent upon present generations to preserve the history of our forebears and our unique natural environment so that we may pass it on to future generations for them to learn from and enjoy. If we are to preserve our cultural and natural heritage adequately and appropriately, we need to ensure that our heritage management systems are compatible and complementary across all levels of government. We need to ensure that nationally significant places are properly identified, and we need to provide certainty to property owners, governments and the wider community about the treatment of significant sites.
The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 will meet these objectives. Together they will establish a Commonwealth heritage regime that will focus on matters of national heritage significance and clearly define the Commonwealth's responsibilities in this area. These bills represent the culmination of six years of community discussion and consultation, including the National Heritage Convention convened by the Australian Heritage Commission in 1998. When the forerunners to these bills were originally introduced into the parliament late in 2000, 76 briefing programs were held throughout Australia. These bills were before the Senate, awaiting debate, but lapsed when the 2001 election was called. Since that time, amendments have been made to the legislation to implement the commitments made by the government in the lead-up to the 2001 election campaign, and I will outline these in due course. 
The Australian Heritage Commission Act established the Commonwealth's existing heritage conservation regime in 1975. At that time, it was the only piece of heritage protection legislation in Australia. A generation later, we have a regime where all states and territories have heritage protection legislation and many local government bodies can also identify and protect their local heritage through planning guidelines. However, this has resulted in unnecessary intergovernmental duplication. Multiple different pieces of protective legislation and planning laws can apply to any one site, causing considerable uncertainty. The regime established by the Australian Heritage Commission Act has led to the listing of more than 13,000 places on the Register of the National Estate. While some of these places could indeed be considered significant to all Australians, many would properly be regarded as places of primary significance only to the states or the local communities where the site is physically located. 
More importantly, the Australian Heritage Commission Act in itself does not provide adequate protection for important heritage sites. Places on the Register of the National Estate are afforded only limited substantive legal protection under the Australian Heritage Commission Act. Under that act, any action proposed by the Commonwealth which would adversely affect a place on the register should only be taken if `there is no feasible and prudent alternative' and if all reasonable steps are taken to minimise the adverse effect. But no civil or criminal penalties are provided in the Australian Heritage Commission Act for breaches of the provisions of the act.
Apart from its impact on the Commonwealth government, listing a place on the register imposes no direct legal constraints on the owners of private property or on state or local governments, nor does it give the Australian Heritage Commission the power to direct private owners or state and local governments in their actions if these actions might affect a place on the Register of the National Estate. Some places on the register incidentally fall under the existing environment protection framework established by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in 1999, but this is incidental protection rather than direct and explicit protection for places on the register. In effect, what we have at the moment is a heritage regime that does not provide strong, clear protection for all nationally important heritage places; yet, at the same time, it is a regime which may result in all three levels of government being drawn into heritage protection controversies that could typically be handled effectively by one alone.
In 1997, the Council of Australian Governments agreed on the need for rationalisation of existing Commonwealth-state arrangements for the protection, identification and management of places with heritage significance. The council recognised that a list of places of national heritage significance— places that could reasonably be considered the responsibility of the Commonwealth— needed to be established. The measures contained in the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 will provide for heritage places of national significance located both within Australia and overseas to be included on the National Heritage List.
The National Heritage List will be a key Commonwealth mechanism for heritage protection. The list will consist of natural, historic and Indigenous places with one or more national heritage values. In providing protection for heritage places of national significance, the list will strengthen Commonwealth heritage protection and complement the state regimes which protect places of local or state significance and the World Heritage regime which protects places of global significance.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999—the EPBC Act—provides a framework for the protection of places of national environmental significance. Under the new scheme, the definition of `environment' given in the EPBC Act is expanded to explicitly include the heritage value of places. The heritage value of a place is defined as including:
... the place's natural and cultural environment having aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance, or other significance, for current and future generations of Australians.
This amendment clarifies that heritage comes within the statutory environment protection framework under the EPBC Act.
Moreover, the National Heritage List will be a new matter of national environmental significance under the EPBC Act. This will mean that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage must give his or her approval before anyone can undertake activities that will have, or are likely to have, a significant impact on the heritage values of a place included on the National Heritage List. The only circumstance in which prior ministerial approval is not required is either if an agreement between the Commonwealth and a state or territory or if a ministerial declaration provides that the action does not require approval. 
This requirement for prior ministerial approval is underpinned by a provision for severe civil and criminal penalties for those who fail to obtain such approval prior to taking an action which has a significant impact on a National Heritage List site. Those who contravene any of the conditions attached to notices of ministerial approval may also face significant penalties. There has been a lot of concern about what protection will be afforded to places on the Register of the National Estate, so I was anxious to have this clarified. The Register of the National Estate will be retained in accordance with the commitment made by the government during the 2001 election campaign.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-11-11,"—Last Wednesday I had the opportunity to attend in my electorate the wonderful opening of the Holden V6 engine plant that had been constructed on time and on budget, according to Senator Minchin, who represented the government as Minister for Finance and Administration. It was indeed a wonderful experience to see Australians making a great contribution in the manufacturing industry. We still have a manufacturing industry in my electorate, of which I am extremely proud. The V6 plant will export 200,000 engines, including V6 engines, to the United States. I could not get out of the local chairman of General Motors Holden which particular cars these would power. I think it is probably not quite a state secret, but it may embarrass some American car makers that their cars are powered by Australian engines. 
Senator Minchin's comment that the V6 engine plant was constructed on time and on budget is very significant, because it was made in the presence of Ian Jones of the Vehicle Builders Union and Martin Kingham, the state secretary of the CFMEU. I fully understood Ian Jones's comment that it was interesting that the Cole royal commission looking into the construction industry had not been sent down there to see this plant be delivered on budget and on time. Indeed, the minister for finance, to everyone's amazement there, said that this excellent work by the construction workers in Victoria would send a message to Detroit and Tokyo—and so it should. But perhaps it might also send a message to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations that there are some good things being done by Australian construction workers and that perhaps, in a balanced view of industrial relations, one ought to see construction workers as making a contribution to Australian productivity.
Indeed, Ian Jones turned to the minister and said, in a very powerful speech, that they should not introduce the industrial caveats of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, into the very successful operation of the automotive industry. Ian Jones said to the minister, `Nick, if things aren't broke, don't fix them.' I think that is a very strong message that the 800 construction workers, people who are in the motor vehicle industry in my electorate, would send to this government.
The motor vehicle industry is producing record exports, record productivity and record employment. We do not need wedge politics in industrial relations being inserted into the automotive industry, which is operating very successfully. Leave the Holden V6 plant and all automotive plants alone, Minister. The vehicle builders and the automotive firms are operating very cooperatively together. There are no industrial caveats where there are no problems. This plant was delivered on budget and on time, to quote the minister. It sent a message to Detroit and Tokyo and I hope the message is also received by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Melbourne Ports Electorate: Automotive Industry</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-11-11," asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002:
(1)	Does he have administrative portfolio responsibility for Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act.
(2)	Does section 50AA of the Corporations Act 2001 define control of a corporation in a broad manner, without specifying the percentage of controlling interest.
(3)	Does schedule 1 of clause 6 of the Broadcasting Services Act state that if a person has an interest in a company exceeding 15%, the person is to be regarded as being in a position to exercise control of the company.
(4)	Pursuant to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, is 15% the test applied for him to block acquisitions that would result in the control of a business passing to foreign persons.
(5)	Is he able to say whether, pursuant to the SANTOS (Regulation of Shareholdings) Act 1989 (SA), no shareholder can own more than 15% of SANTOS.
(6)	Pursuant to the clause 850B of the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001, is 15% the test applied to prevent market operators such as the Australian Stock Exchange or the Sydney Futures Exchange before ministerial approval is required.
(7)	Pursuant to the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act, is a person prohibited from holding a stake of greater than 15% in an authorised deposit-taking institution.
(8)	What is the policy rationale upon which the figure of 15% is based.
(9)	At 15%, does the operation of a parent company over pairs of airport lessee companies constitute a controlling interest; if not, why not.
(10)	Does the parent shareholding interest provisions for paired ownership of Australian airports bring this threshold of 15% into conflict with Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act; if not, why not.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade Practices Act</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,23,1,question
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2002-11-11,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1)	The Treasury Ministers have administrative portfolio responsibility for Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974.
(2)	Section 50AA of the Corporations Act 2001 defines control of a corporation in a broad manner without specifying the percentage of controlling interest.
(3)	Schedule 1 of clause 6 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 states that if a person has interests in a company exceeding 15%, the person is to be regarded as being in a position to exercise control of the company.
(4)	No. The 15% limit is a notification trigger. A foreign person proposing to acquire a substantial interest (i.e. 15% or greater) in an Australian asset or business must notify the Treasurer of the proposed transaction prior to the transaction being executed. This notification requirement is subject to specific exemption thresholds.
The test applied to “blocking” a proposal is two fold. Firstly, it is necessary to determine whether the proposed transaction would result in a change in control of the Australian asset or business. If this is the case, the Treasurer must then judge whether the proposal is contrary to the national interest.
If there is no change in control, the Treasurer can not issue a final order prohibiting the transaction.
(5)	Pursuant to sections 5 and 6 of the SANTOS (Regulation of Shareholdings) Act 1989 (SA), it is unlawful for a person to hold an entitlement to more than 15 per cent of the voting shares in Santos Limited. 
(6)	The meaning of the honourable member's question is unclear.
(7)	No. The Treasurer may approve a person to hold a stake of greater than 15 per cent in an authorised deposit-taking institution provided it is in the national interest. 
(8)	The 15% limits under different Acts reflect various policy objectives.
(9)	I refer the Honourable Member to the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to parts (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) of question 2881 as it appeared in Hansard on 27 September 2001 at page 31826. 
(10)	The cross-ownership restrictions in the Airports Act 1996 (Airports Act) do not conflict with the Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Part IIIA). Part IIIA and the cross-ownership restrictions of the Airports Act operate to achieve different purposes.
The rationale for the cross-ownership provisions of the Airports Act is to ensure diversity of ownership. In contast, Part IIIA, in conjunction with certain provisions of the Airports Act, provides a procedure to seek access to certain essential services and facilities of airports. This enables businesses needing access to negotiate with airport operators on commercial terms, or if negotiations fail, to have terms and conditions arbitrated by the ACCC.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade Practices Act</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,23,1,answer
