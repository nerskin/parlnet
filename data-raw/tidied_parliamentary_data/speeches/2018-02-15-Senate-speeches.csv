The PRESIDENT
 (09:31):  I have received, through His Excellency the Governor-General, from the Governor of New South Wales, a copy of the certificate of the choice by the houses of the parliament of New South Wales of Kristina Kerscher Keneally to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator Dastyari. I table the document.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:37):  I rise to continue my remarks on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill. When I was concluding my remarks previously I was speaking about the legislative undertakings of the Labor government and the FOFA reforms which were undertaken under the leadership of Mr Shorten, who, I understand, joined us in the chamber here to recognise the ascendancy to the Senate of Senator Keneally, who is a great New South Wales woman that I'm glad to have with me, and I'm sure she will be interested in supporting adequate banking protection for ordinary people as well.


Returning to my comments around ASIC, we know that, according to the latest numbers from ASIC, there were 300,000 customer accounts affected by concerns regarding financial services, with amounts of fees improperly charged for underservicing but still sending out the bills of over $200 million excluding interest. ASIC has stated that FOFA requirements that were vehemently opposed by those opposite—namely, the requirement customers periodically opt in to the advice relationship and the requirement that advisers provide annual fee disclosure statements to all clients, including existing clients—helped to bring to light this massive fees-for-no-service scandal.


In government those opposite made massive cuts to ASIC and massive cuts to the capability of the corporate regulator and have given a massive free pass to corporate misconduct. They only moved to restore funding to ASIC when Labor began calling for a royal commission. Those opposite have a record of giving free passes to the financial sector, thereby enhancing the misconduct at every turn. That record continued with their stubborn refusal to initiate a banking royal commission. 


Labor will support this bill, as I've indicated a number of times during my contribution to this debate. We are particularly pleased that this government has finally, after years of delay, introduced changes to credit cards, recommended by a Labor-led Senate inquiry back in 2015. We welcome other measures in this bill, including giving the right to use the word 'bank' to smaller ADIs, including credit unions and building societies. For Australians whose literacy around finance helps them understand what a bank is, I think that this will be a significant change and improvement in their access to services, particularly in some of the regional communities across Australia.


However, we note that this bill comes from a government that's really not fair dinkum about consumer protection in the financial services sector. It has come, begrudgingly, from a government that will stand up for the big end of town over ordinary Australians, every day. It has to be, and has been in this case, dragged kicking and screaming to do otherwise, whether it is in relation to something as simple as overdue charges to credit card regulations or something as significant as a much needed royal commission into the banks.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-02-15,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:40):  I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 on behalf of the Australian Greens. The bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to enable the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, known as APRA, to make rules and directions relating to the provision of finance by non-authorised deposit-taking-institution lenders, which, as APRA has identified, may materially contribute to risks of instability in the Australian financial system. The bill removes restrictions on the use of the term 'bank' and inserts an objects provision. It also amends the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 to require that the suitability of a credit card contract is assessed on the consumer's ability to pay the credit limit within a certain period and prohibits providers from making unsolicited credit limit offers in relation to credit card contracts and from retrospectively charging interest on credit card balances. Finally, it enables consumers to reduce credit card limits and terminate credit card contracts including by online means. The Greens will be supporting this bill. We don't see anything too controversial in it.


I note APRA's comments that were provided to the committee that the non-ADI, non-licensed, non-regulated finance market—I call it the shadow banking sector—is roughly only four to five per cent of the total market at this point in time, and is not enough to cause instability. But this is an issue that's been discussed all around the world, especially in the last five years, by regulators in just about every country and international institutions. The growth in the unregulated shadow banking sector is something that we do need to keep a close eye on. We're quite comfortable with giving APRA extra powers to monitor that sector, collect data and act, should they feel that there's any instability in the financial system brought on by the growth in the shadow banking sector. 


On the credit card changes, I echo Labor's comments that we'll be reviewing these changes over time to see how the banking sectors themselves respond to this. You don't get between them and a buck, basically, so I'm sure they'll find a way to continue to squeeze Australians through the credit card market, but, nevertheless, the bill's provisions are good.


In fact, I actually wrote to the regulator and spoke to them in estimates last year after being contacted by a friend who had had unsolicited attempts to increase his credit card limit from his bank. He was told how easy it would be if he just pressed a button on an email, which led to a doubling of his credit card limit. These kinds of things can be dangerous and they need to be monitored. The Greens will be supporting this bill today.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-02-15,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:43):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. Labor supports this bill, which does a number of useful things. It provides further reform across the banking and financial sector. Of course, further reform is absolutely critical for the culture within this sector, and I note, before I talk in more detail about the bill, that it was for 601 days that Labor called for a royal commission into the financial sector, which we did because we recognised that there was a need for something substantial to be done to reform this sector to meet community expectations. That has now kicked off this week, and for anybody who might be looking at a copy of this speech, public submissions are now open online at www.financialservices.royalcommission.gov.au. It is very important that members of the public participate in this, particularly those who have a story to tell about how they've been treated by our big banks. 


Before I proceed, let's review some of the facts about the Australian banking industry. Some of this information comes from the background paper that was prepared by the royal commission. We know that there are 147 ADIs operating in Australia, and that those ADIs hold $4.6 trillion in assets. Three-quarters of that figure is held by the big banks. I'm just underscoring the importance of this sector for the Australian economy. The big banks earned a profit margin of 36.4 per cent in the June quarter 2017. The big banks' net profit after tax in the June quarter was $7.8 billion. Other domestic banks earned a profit margin of 24.7 per cent, and total net profit after tax in the June quarter was $831 million. The financial and insurance services sector is the largest contributor to real industry gross value added in Australia—around nine per cent in the September quarter 2017. The mining and manufacturing industry is six per cent, for comparison's sake. All of this information, as I say, comes from the background paper prepared for the royal commission. 


Publicly available data broadly indicates that the big banks in Australia may be more profitable than some international counterparts—for example, those in Canada and the UK. As at November 2017, there were over 16 million credit and charge card accounts, with total balances of $52.2 billion. So, this is an industry that warrants a lot of scrutiny and there is a need for continual oversight of this industry. 


This bill expands APRA's regulatory powers to include reserve powers that cover non-ADI lending, should practices or the size of the non-ADI lending sector pose a risk to financial stability in the future. There's no suggestion that there is a problem at the current time with the size of the non-ADI lending sector, but, at some point in the future, this may become an issue and, therefore, APRA should have powers to monitor in this area. 


Non-bank lenders do play an important role in Australia. They encourage competition in the market and they are very much involved in lending to small business, which, of course, is an engine room for employment growth. Schedule 3 to the bill allows smaller ADIs—authorised deposit-taking institutions—to use the word 'bank' in their business name. I note that this is one of the changes that was very strongly supported by the Customer Owned Banking Association, and I will talk a little bit about that shortly. The change is designed to reflect public perception regarding the regulations and protections applicable to entities using the term 'bank'. Whereas ADIs are prudentially supervised by APRA, this has been extended and deposits covered by the Financial Claims Scheme are guaranteed. Labor welcomes the fact that small ADIs, including many credit unions, will now have the right to call themselves banks if they choose to. Previously, the term 'bank' could only be applied to institutions that held more than $50 million in tier 1 capital. 


I will digress briefly to mention that I am a big fan of the cooperatives and mutuals sector. I indicated that the Customer Owned Banking Association is a supporter of these changes and I do think it is extremely important that the mutuals are placed in a position where they can compete with the major banks. Their business model is one which, in my view, promotes more ethical treatment of customers. It's a situation where profits go back to members rather than return to shareholders, and we avoid the situation of the imperative for massive returns to shareholders, which drives the gouging and mistreatment of customers. I think the cooperatives and mutuals sector has a lot to offer the market and a lot to offer consumers. It's just interesting to note that, when it comes to cooperatives and mutuals, a lot of people are not aware of the prevalence of those.


For my own part, I'm a member of ME Bank, which is a mutual bank, I'm a member of Australian Unity Health Insurance and I'm also a member of the RACQ. These are very well known institutions. A lot of people don't know that they are actually mutuals, that they are customer owned and that they perform a very important role providing diversity and providing competition to the big banks.


I also want to give a plug, while I'm here, to the need for work to be done to enhance the mutuals sector, particularly in the banking area. I want to revisit some of the recommendations that were made by the Senate Economics References Committee on this issue, and I do welcome the fact that the government has picked up a number of the recommendations from that committee. Again, it's so important to the health of the financial services sector that we have this sort of healthy competition. Among the recommendations we looked at in the cooperatives and mutuals inquiry was for the Commonwealth to work with states and territories to develop a program of supports to encourage the establishment of new cooperatives and mutual enterprises. We recommended that a mutual enterprise be explicitly defined in the Corporations Act and its associated regulations. We also recommended that the cooperative and mutual sector be considered when the government is preparing a regulatory impact statement that accompanies new regulatory policies. We also recommended that the Commonwealth government liaise with state and territory counterparts to ensure that the regulatory burden for small and medium-sized cooperative and mutual enterprises aligns with the needs of these organisations to ensure they're not disadvantaged relative to companies of a similar size, because we know, and we've heard from a number of inquiries, that the regulatory burden is, in fact, a competitive advantage to some of the bigger corporations. We also talked about the Commonwealth and state governments supporting the formalisation of some of the innovative and market based approaches to raising capital for small and medium-sized cooperatives and mutual enterprises in the form of advice and information as they become available.


Importantly, we wanted APRA to set a target date for the outcome of discussions with the cooperative and mutual sector on issues of capital-raising and to bring those discussions to a timely conclusion. We also recommended, very importantly, that the Commonwealth examine proposals to amend the Corporations Act to provide cooperative and mutual enterprises with a mechanism to enable them access to a broader range of capital-raising and investment opportunities. This is a necessary vital reform. Unfortunately, we see a situation where a lot of cooperatives and mutuals, where they currently want to expand, see the only option going forward to de-mutualise. That's unfortunate. It sees a loss to the cooperative and mutual sector and is, I think, to the disadvantage and to the detriment of consumers, and I would certainly welcome movement in that area.


While I'm talking about this, I also wanted to just commend the work that the RACQ has done in merging with the QT Mutual Bank in 2016 and then, in September of last year, launching RACQ Bank, which is going to be an important player. RACQ is a very trusted organisation. As I've said, it's a cooperative owned by its members, and there are more than 1.6 million members. This now establishes one of Queensland's last remaining mutual banks. As I said earlier, the profits from the bank will be reinvested back into the RACQ ecosystem for the benefit of the RACQ members. That's a positive story. This, I think, underlines the fact we need to do more to support the cooperatives and mutuals sector. Its ability to call itself a bank followed from that merger in 2016 with QT Mutual Bank. 


Turning to other aspects of the bill, schedule 5 of the bill amends the credit act to introduce a number of reforms to improve consumer outcomes under credit card contracts by tightening responsible lending obligations and prohibiting credit card providers from offering unsolicited credit limit increases—part of the reckless and irresponsible behaviour that we've seen in the past. It also simplifies the calculation of interest charges and requires credit card contracts to allow consumers to reduce credit limits and terminate credit card contracts, including the ability to do it online. 


As at November 2017, there were 16.7 million credit and charge card accounts in Australia, with total balances, as I said earlier, of $52.2 billion. While credit card debt comprises a small percentage of the banks' overall assets, it can have a significant impact on household finances. These days, most consumers have some form of credit or store credit card, and many of these cards have hidden fees or charges. We have seen balance transfer schemes becoming more prevalent in the industry. Consumers do deserve the best protection we can give them from fee-gouging and shoddy bank practices. 


Labor do, in fact, welcome the reforms that we are debating today. In fact, we actually came up with them first. I go back to the 2015 committee report findings of the Senate Economics References Committee, of which I am the chair. We released a report into the Australian credit card market. That report came up with a table of recommendations—I won't go through all of those quite significant recommendations. I note that the government did indicate its support for a large number of those, and it responded, promising reform, in May of 2016. But, as with many other things, it dragged its feet and has, for the last almost two years, been running a protection racket for the big banks. 


In the meantime, the Khoury review of the Code of Banking Practice, for the Australian Bankers' Association, recommended that banks voluntarily make changes to credit card practices for a fairer system for consumers. But the banks refused the recommendations to stop unsolicited credit card increase offers and to stop the tricky credit card interest charging practices, and they also refused to clearly commit to simple, online cancellation of credit cards. I think these are very telling responses from the Bankers' Association which show that they have been unwilling to grasp the nettle and go about the job of reforming their own practices. Because of the Prime Minister's inaction and the banks' reluctance, consumers will have to wait until 2019 for these long-overdue protections to take effect.


We're seeing a recurring theme here from the financial sector and the Turnbull government: review something, vaguely promise action and then hope that the issue goes away. Labor refuses to let these issues go away. That's why, after 601 days, the Prime Minister has been dragged, kicking and screaming, by Labor into having the royal commission.


Labor fought for this inquiry because banks were ripping off consumers with credit cards through hidden charging, high interest rates, high annual fees, expensive rewards programs, exorbitant late payment fees and inappropriate lending practices. Customers were being taken for a ride here, while the banks made—and are still making—millions in credit card profits. While the government has dilly-dallied on these laws to protect consumers with credit cards, OECD data shows that Australia is in the top five countries for personal debt. I refer to an article that has appeared in the Gladstone Observer to that effect. This particular article, by Tim McIntyre of the Gladstone Observer on 12 February, showed this concerning statistic. The article had a comment from Wealth Within chief analyst Dale Gillham, who said that the debt levels were a concern. He went on to say:


We are stuck on a debt treadmill and many of us don't know how to get off … Identify you have a problem with debt, cut back on non-essential spending … and funnel the cash freed up into paying down your bad debt.


As a society, we do have an issue with this. Let's hope that some of these improvements in credit card changes will assist.


In terms of Labor's record, we introduced the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, which was the first single-standard and nationally consistent regime for consumer credit regulation and oversight in the country. We gave ASIC regulatory powers to oversee consumer credit, including home loans and credit cards. I want to give a shout out to Wayne Swan, who did fantastic work on credit card reform as Treasurer. These measures that he introduced began in July 2012. I won't go through the details of those, but I just want to take a minute to wish Wayne all the best for the next phase of his life. We all remember that he was voted world's best Treasurer in 2011. He's made an enormous contribution to our country, and I'm sure that he will be missed in this place.


So just further in terms of Labor's achievements, we looked into the Future of Financial Advice reforms, or FoFA, which came about in the wake of the Storm Financial, Trio Capital and Westpoint collapses. We had a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry in 2011-12. Reforms included financial advice providers legally being required to act in the best interests of their clients, eliminating kickbacks to financial advisors. Unfortunately, these were fought by the coalition. They voted against FoFA in the House, they voted against FoFA in the Senate and they tried to undermine its function when they came to government. But thanks to Labor taking up the fight on the finance front, FoFA lived on. As a result, ASIC uncovered in 2016 that customers were paying fees for financial advice that was never provided. There were more than 300,000 customers affected by this. In conclusion, this change cannot come soon enough, though the royal commission will deliver the real change in practice and culture.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-02-15,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (10:04):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. Australians are people who believe in treating others fairly. The fair go is a hallmark of the Australian way of life. In turn, they expect fairness from those around them. They expect fairness from their mates, from the government and from the other institutions in society, such as the banking and financial sector; however, it's quite clear to most Australians that banks, the financial sector and credit card companies have not upheld their end of this fairness bargain. All of us have heard horror stories, and may even know victims of the financial sector—in fact, my own parents lost $150,000 some years ago.


There are dodgy financial products, hidden fees and charges and just plain rip-offs. We can clearly see from the overwhelming community support for Labor's call for a banking royal commission—which the government ignored for two years and then belatedly and begrudgingly supported once they had given their mates in the sector the opportunity to write the convenient terms of reference—that the community wants things to change. 


I hope that the focus of the royal commission will turn to the victims of banking and financial scandals. This is an opportunity for those who have suffered because of insurance scams, dodgy lending and fee rip-offs to tell their stories and present their evidence to the royal commission. I hope that the royal commission delivers justice to families and small businesses that have suffered because of misconduct in the banking and financial services sector. We already know—and the royal commission will show us—that change is needed. 


The bill before us today makes some important and significant changes—changes which will significantly help credit card consumers, in particular, and changes that Labor has been calling for for years. We really have to ask ourselves why it has taken this government so long. It's not that the issue only affects a small number of people: there were 16,690,289 credit cards in Australia as of November 2017. Almost every adult in Australia has a credit card, and many people have more than one. Why has the government taken so long to act? Is it to allow their mates in the sector to keep on rolling in record profits to squirrel away to tax havens, like Mr Turnbull's in the Cayman Islands? In 2015, a Labor-led Senate inquiry first stirred changes to credit card regulation. It was in response to the recommendations of the inquiry that the Treasurer promised to progress these changes to credit card regulation. Even with the passage of this bill, we won't see most of those protections come into place until 2019. 


Let me tell you a bit about the bill. The bill makes three key changes. It will allow smaller authorised deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs, to use the word 'bank' in their business name, and the bill will give the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, powers to deal with developments in non-ADI lending that pose a risk to financial stability. It also introduces reforms to improve consumer outcomes under credit card contracts. 


As I mentioned, in 2015 the Senate Economics References Committee, which my colleague Senator Ketter referred to earlier, handed down its report Interest rates and informed choice in the Australian credit card market. This is quite a comprehensive report, and I urge anyone with any interest in the issue to download it from the committee's website and read it. 


The committee handed down 11 recommendations in the report, derived from written submissions and five public hearings held in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. In 2016, the government promised legislation in the near future to respond to the recommendations of that inquiry, yet it's taken nearly two years to come to it. Seriously, I would hate to see this government on a go-slow, I really would. While the Treasurer dithered, the banking sector continued to thumb their nose at him. The Australian Bankers' Association refused recommendations from the review of their code of practice that, in the name of fairness to customers, they should voluntarily make changes. The banks refused to stop unsolicited credit card increase offers and tricky credit card interest rate charging practices. They also refused to clearly commit to simple online cancellation of credit cards. 


If the government could just spend a little bit of time away from their internal bickering, their scandals, their back-stabbing and their incompetence, the Australian people would really appreciate them focusing their attention on legislating for the interests of the Australian people. 


One of the changes to credit cards is the tightening of the responsible lending requirements. Many thousands of desperate people have racked up credit card debt beyond their means to repay. They've spent years trying to pay these debts off, often with interest rates over the 20 per cent mark. This change will require that the suitability of a credit card contract is assessed on the consumer's ability to repay the credit limit within a certain period. That period is to be set in a legislative instrument made by ASIC. We'll be watching closely to see what that period is. 


It's obviously important that Australians are properly protected from predatory or unsuitable lending. Another of the changes is the standardisation of the way credit card interest is calculated. I was taught how to calculate interest in my high school maths classes; however, the well-respected website Choice has said that the way the banks calculate credit card interest is 'mind bending'. When respected governance adviser Phil Khoury conducted a review of the code of conduct of banking practice, he investigated the ways that banks were applying credit card interest. He looked at some practices and found that few customers would be aware that they were even happening at all. Khoury describes the interest calculation practices as 'unacceptable' and 'substantially unfair' and indicates that, if understood, they would be seen as 'just plain tricky'. This is pretty troubling criticism from a very respected reviewer. Under this bill, credit card providers are prohibited from imposing interest charges retrospectively to a credit card balance or part of that balance that has the benefit of an interest-free period. Again, we welcome these changes to the way credit card interest is calculated—but, again, they're long overdue, and we've been calling for them for many years.


Many Australians have come to realise that some of the credit products that they hold aren't suitable or aren't good value for money and they want to cancel them, but, currently, people can't do that online, where most Australians now do their banking. Under this bill, banks will now be required to allow online cancellation of credit cards. This makes eminent sense. You can get a credit card online quite easily, but, if you try and cancel a credit card online, it's very difficult—and it shouldn't be that way. If a customer sees a card that's a better deal, they should be able to move over to that better deal with great ease. Additionally, customers end up hanging onto old cards that they do not intend to keep, with access to more credit than they otherwise need, and these cards often have annual fees and other ongoing costs which add up over the years to a substantial amount of money. So it does make simple sense to require banks and card issuers to have simple online cancellation of credit cards. Under the bill before us today, a bank may not be required to cancel a credit card where there is still an outstanding balance. Again, we need to ensure that this element of the bill is monitored to make sure that the impact of encouraging customers to switch credit cards is real and to ensure that it enables customers to more easily ditch unsuitable cards.


Labor notes that this bill will also require banks to allow a reduction of credit card limits online. As those listening would all be aware, you can very easily increase your credit limit online, often in minutes, so it should be just as easy to reduce your credit limit online. If a consumer has the insight or the awareness that they have too much credit available to them and that they might not easily be able to pay that off and they want to do the right thing and take some control, they should find it easy, not hard, to reduce their credit card limit. I believe we should be supporting consumers that want to take proactive actions to limit their liabilities and we should make it easy for them to do that. The Consumer Action Law Centre has drawn attention to the fact that, as the bill is currently drafted, banks are not required to reduce credit limits below the minimum credit of the card. Labor will continue to monitor that closely and, if further improvements are needed, we will make those suggestions in due course.


Schedules 1 and 2 of the bill will give APRA powers in relation to non-ADI lenders. These powers, which have been described as reserve powers, are designed to be used should the activities of these lenders pose a risk to financial stability in the future. The bill also gives APRA power to collect certain data from these lenders. ADI lenders such as banks and credit unions are subject to APRA's prudential requirements and ongoing supervision. These new powers for APRA are proposed in recognition of the fact that APRA has responsibilities in relation to stability of the Australian financial system which are consistent with its core mandate of protecting depositors. Labor notes that some non-bank lenders have raised concern about the scope of these powers. We recognise that non-ADI lenders can play an important role in ensuring competition against banks; indeed, this is an increasing element of our financial system. There is disruption with these new providers, peer-to-peer lenders and others. This includes disruption in relation to business lending. As an example, innovative non-banking lenders can play an important role in providing finance needed to small-business owners to expand. And, as mentioned briefly earlier, schedule 3 will allow smaller ADIs to use the word 'bank' in their business names should they choose to.


As the explanatory memorandum points out:


… the changes will align community expectations in respect of the use of the term 'bank' with the fact that ADIs are prudentially supervised by APRA and deposits are covered by the FCS guarantee—


the Financial Claims Scheme guarantee. Under this change all ADIs can use the word 'bank' in their business name unless APRA, for whatever reason, has issued a determination to the contrary. Currently, APRA permits only ADIs with tier-1 capital exceeding $50 million to use the terms 'bank', 'banker' and 'banking'. There are a number of small ADIs who would benefit from the use of these terms, and I note that the Customer Owned Banking Association, which represents credit unions and building societies as well as mutual banks, has been particularly supportive of this change. Again, Labor supports this change.


Finally, schedule 4 to the bill modernises the Banking Act by inserting an objects provision. Similar industry acts, the Life Insurance Act 1995 and the Insurance Act 1973 contain objects provisions which guide the reader on the main purposes of the act. The main objects of the Banking Act will be (a) to protect the interests of depositors in ADIs in ways that are consistent with the continued development of a viable, competitive and innovative banking industry and (b) to promote financial system stability in Australia.


While the changes in this bill are welcome, they are long overdue. This government does not care about the consumer, and it only acts belatedly when it has no other choice—when it has to be dragged in, kicking and screaming. In contrast, Labor made significant reforms when we were in government. These landmark reforms included the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. This was the first single standard and nationally consistent regime for consumer credit regulation and oversight in this country. This act gave oversight to consumer credit, including home loans and credit cards, to a national regulator, that being ASIC. It included what are proving to be very important responsible lending obligations. Labor also enacted the Future of Financial Advice, FOFA, reforms. Those opposite want to write these reforms out of history because their persistent opposition to FOFA now looks so embarrassing. They voted against FOFA in the House, they voted against FOFA in the Senate and, when they got into government, they tried to gut FOFA, first by legislation and then by regulation. Labor had to fight tooth and nail to protect FOFA, and it was lucky that we prevailed.


To take one example, ASIC's Fees for no service report revealed, in October 2016, that the big four banks and AMP had spent years taking fees from customers for financial advice services that were never provided. ASIC found that there were great systems in place to record incoming revenue but very little in place to prove that customers were getting anything in return. The number of customers affected is over 300,000. The amount of fees improperly charged is over $200 million. ASIC has stated that the FOFA requirements that were vehemently fought against by those opposite—namely, the requirement that customers periodically opt in to the advice relationship and the requirement that advisers provide annual fee disclosure statements to all of their clients, including existing clients—helped to bring to light this massive fees-for-no-service scandal.


In government, those opposite made massive cuts to ASIC, made massive cuts to the capability of the corporate regulator and gave a massive free pass to corporate misconduct. They only moved to restore funding to ASIC when Labor began calling for a royal commission. Those opposite have a record of giving free passes to financial sector misconduct at every turn, and that continued until recently with their stubborn refusal to initiate a banking royal commission.


Labor have identified other areas where we could see a greater stability in our economy—and I'd like to thank my colleague the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, who has been working to highlight areas of our economy where there are unacceptable risks. I'd also like to concur with Senator Ketter's words about Mr Swan and to thank him for his work as well.


One such area where there is unacceptable risk is that of household debt, particularly in regard to household debt related to housing in Australia. Over the recent decade, we've seen astronomical price increases in the cost of housing, particularly in the Sydney and Melbourne markets and, interestingly enough, in the Hobart market, which is growing at a staggering rate. Australia's level of debt is now 100 per cent higher than the total earnings of all households. Australia has the most generous property tax concessions in the world when it comes to investing in housing. I'm speaking here, of course, of our negative-gearing regime—the ability to deduct interest payments on an investment loan for an investment property—and the capital gains tax discount: the 50 per cent discount on capital gains tax being paid on the sale of an investment property.


When these two reforms were introduced by the Howard government, importantly, in the budgetary context, they weren't funded. In other words, there was no revenue source that offset the reduction in revenue that came about from the additional expenditure associated with these tax concessions. Now that we've got a growing budget deficit—it's almost tripled under this government—we're seeing the folly of those decisions being borne by this generation of Australians, because there was no funding source put in place to introduce those very generous tax concessions into the budgetary process. Therefore, it's hardly surprising that we have one of the highest household leverage rates in the world.


For almost two years the Labor Party has been calling on the government to bring attention to the risks associated with such high household debt. The Reserve Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Grattan Institute and the government's Financial System Inquiry have argued forcefully that tax concessions such as negative gearing distort economic decision-making and encourage leverage in the economy. The overwhelming evidence is that those who benefit from those tax concessions are the wealthiest Australians. It was confirmed in the newspapers fairly recently that the top 10 per cent of income earners in this country benefit from 80 per cent of the capital gains tax discount—that is, 80 per cent of the capital gains tax discount benefits go to the top 10 per cent of income earners in Australia.


We would welcome the government's making such additional reforms if they could be bothered to concentrate long enough on the task of government. While we welcome the bill before us and the consumer protections it entails, the government need to be reprimanded for their tardiness and their unwillingness to act until now. They really do need to sharpen their pencils, as a dear friend of mine would say. This legislation could have been enacted two years ago. That would have been an additional two years of protections for consumers across Australia. But I do call upon my fellow senators to support the bill. As I said, it's a start, but it's not enough. The government needs to pay more attention to the role of governing and sort out their squabbling and their bickering and their scandals so that the people of Australia can have some faith in this government.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-02-15,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:22):  I rise to sum up the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017, and I thank all senators for their contribution to the debate. The bill enhances the stability, competitiveness and fairness of the financial system. 


Schedule 1 to the bill provides the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, which is known as APRA, a new power to make rules concerning the lending activities of non-bank lenders. This new power is a reserve power, which means that in ordinary times it will not be used. Schedule 2 reinforces APRA's ability to monitor the sector by strengthening APRA's existing data collection powers. Together, these reforms mean APRA will be able to make rules where it assesses that the lending activities of non-ADI lenders are materially contributing to risks of instability in the Australian financial system. While non-ADI lenders are currently a small share of the financial sector, APRA's macroprudential measures for ADI mean it is likely that the sector will grow and, potentially, contribute to risks. Risks to financial stability can be very costly. Risks, if realised, will ultimately fall on the broader Australian community. However, the government is of the view that non-ADI lenders are not currently materially contributing to financial stability risks, and therefore the government does not expect a rule to be made on day 1. Schedules 1 and 2 to the bill will add to APRA's tools on the shelf by expanding the powers APRA can use if and when risks to financial stability emerge in the non-ADI lending sector.


Schedule 3 of the bill removes the prohibition on the term 'bank' and allows all banking businesses with an ADI licence to benefit from this term. Currently, only ADIs with at least $50 million in capital are permitted to use the term 'bank'. This is a real problem for the innovative new banking entrants who want to enter the market. Customers need to understand the product you are offering before they come on board, and these entities need to onboard customers to grow. This is a real catch 22 for new bank entrants. They can't call themselves a bank before they hit $50 million in capital but they can't grow without being able to call themselves a bank. The limit on the use of the term 'bank' to entities over $50 million also creates a false perception in the community that the level of protection afforded to depositors in large APRA regulated institutions is greater than that of small regulated institutions. This is simply not the case. All depositors can take comfort in the fact that APRA regulates all ADIs and all depositors are protected under the Financial Claims Scheme, the government's deposit guarantee scheme.


In implementing this measure, the government has three objectives. It opens the door to innovative new entrants, it levels the playing field for existing ADIs and it meets the community expectation that the only entities that can use the term 'bank' are APRA regulated entities. In order to achieve the third objective, this measure alters the framework for the administrative review of decisions made by APRA concerning the use of the term 'bank'. Non-banks will no longer be able to challenge a decision by APRA to deny the use of the term 'bank' other than on the grounds of procedural fairness. This has the added benefit of reducing an administrative burden on APRA.


Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to modernise the Banking Act by inserting an objects provision, clarifying APRA's mandate under this act. This provides an opportunity for government to reinforce APRA's mandate to protect depositors and financial stability, whilst also promoting innovation. A reference is also incorporated to make it clear that APRA can take account of geographic and sectoral considerations where appropriate.


In addition, schedule 5 will prohibit credit card providers from making unsolicited credit limit increase invitations to consumers through any form of communication. This prohibition will cover all consumers, even if they have previously opted in to receive these invitations. Schedule 5 will also simplify how credit card interest can be calculated by prohibiting credit card providers from backdating interest charges or charging interest on a balance that has already been repaid. This reform will bring credit card interest in line with community expectation and reduce the complexity of the calculation of credit card interest. Finally, schedule 5 will require credit card providers to have online options for consumers to lower a credit limit or request to cancel a credit card. Consumers can face substantial barriers to cancelling a credit card or lowering a credit limit, which reduces competition and impedes the ability of consumers to manage their credit card debts. Schedule 5 will require credit card providers to facilitate a request and will prohibit providers from imposing unnecessary requirements on consumers.


These reforms will provide vital protections to vulnerable Australians and improve competition in the credit card market. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (09:37):  I rise to continue my remarks on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill. When I was concluding my remarks previously I was speaking about the legislative undertakings of the Labor government and the FOFA reforms which were undertaken under the leadership of Mr Shorten, who, I understand, joined us in the chamber here to recognise the ascendancy to the Senate of Senator Keneally, who is a great New South Wales woman that I'm glad to have with me, and I'm sure she will be interested in supporting adequate banking protection for ordinary people as well.


Returning to my comments around ASIC, we know that, according to the latest numbers from ASIC, there were 300,000 customer accounts affected by concerns regarding financial services, with amounts of fees improperly charged for underservicing but still sending out the bills of over $200 million excluding interest. ASIC has stated that FOFA requirements that were vehemently opposed by those opposite—namely, the requirement customers periodically opt in to the advice relationship and the requirement that advisers provide annual fee disclosure statements to all clients, including existing clients—helped to bring to light this massive fees-for-no-service scandal.


In government those opposite made massive cuts to ASIC and massive cuts to the capability of the corporate regulator and have given a massive free pass to corporate misconduct. They only moved to restore funding to ASIC when Labor began calling for a royal commission. Those opposite have a record of giving free passes to the financial sector, thereby enhancing the misconduct at every turn. That record continued with their stubborn refusal to initiate a banking royal commission. 


Labor will support this bill, as I've indicated a number of times during my contribution to this debate. We are particularly pleased that this government has finally, after years of delay, introduced changes to credit cards, recommended by a Labor-led Senate inquiry back in 2015. We welcome other measures in this bill, including giving the right to use the word 'bank' to smaller ADIs, including credit unions and building societies. For Australians whose literacy around finance helps them understand what a bank is, I think that this will be a significant change and improvement in their access to services, particularly in some of the regional communities across Australia.


However, we note that this bill comes from a government that's really not fair dinkum about consumer protection in the financial services sector. It has come, begrudgingly, from a government that will stand up for the big end of town over ordinary Australians, every day. It has to be, and has been in this case, dragged kicking and screaming to do otherwise, whether it is in relation to something as simple as overdue charges to credit card regulations or something as significant as a much needed royal commission into the banks.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-02-15,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:40):  I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 on behalf of the Australian Greens. The bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to enable the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, known as APRA, to make rules and directions relating to the provision of finance by non-authorised deposit-taking-institution lenders, which, as APRA has identified, may materially contribute to risks of instability in the Australian financial system. The bill removes restrictions on the use of the term 'bank' and inserts an objects provision. It also amends the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 to require that the suitability of a credit card contract is assessed on the consumer's ability to pay the credit limit within a certain period and prohibits providers from making unsolicited credit limit offers in relation to credit card contracts and from retrospectively charging interest on credit card balances. Finally, it enables consumers to reduce credit card limits and terminate credit card contracts including by online means. The Greens will be supporting this bill. We don't see anything too controversial in it.


I note APRA's comments that were provided to the committee that the non-ADI, non-licensed, non-regulated finance market—I call it the shadow banking sector—is roughly only four to five per cent of the total market at this point in time, and is not enough to cause instability. But this is an issue that's been discussed all around the world, especially in the last five years, by regulators in just about every country and international institutions. The growth in the unregulated shadow banking sector is something that we do need to keep a close eye on. We're quite comfortable with giving APRA extra powers to monitor that sector, collect data and act, should they feel that there's any instability in the financial system brought on by the growth in the shadow banking sector. 


On the credit card changes, I echo Labor's comments that we'll be reviewing these changes over time to see how the banking sectors themselves respond to this. You don't get between them and a buck, basically, so I'm sure they'll find a way to continue to squeeze Australians through the credit card market, but, nevertheless, the bill's provisions are good.


In fact, I actually wrote to the regulator and spoke to them in estimates last year after being contacted by a friend who had had unsolicited attempts to increase his credit card limit from his bank. He was told how easy it would be if he just pressed a button on an email, which led to a doubling of his credit card limit. These kinds of things can be dangerous and they need to be monitored. The Greens will be supporting this bill today.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-02-15,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:43):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. Labor supports this bill, which does a number of useful things. It provides further reform across the banking and financial sector. Of course, further reform is absolutely critical for the culture within this sector, and I note, before I talk in more detail about the bill, that it was for 601 days that Labor called for a royal commission into the financial sector, which we did because we recognised that there was a need for something substantial to be done to reform this sector to meet community expectations. That has now kicked off this week, and for anybody who might be looking at a copy of this speech, public submissions are now open online at www.financialservices.royalcommission.gov.au. It is very important that members of the public participate in this, particularly those who have a story to tell about how they've been treated by our big banks. 


Before I proceed, let's review some of the facts about the Australian banking industry. Some of this information comes from the background paper that was prepared by the royal commission. We know that there are 147 ADIs operating in Australia, and that those ADIs hold $4.6 trillion in assets. Three-quarters of that figure is held by the big banks. I'm just underscoring the importance of this sector for the Australian economy. The big banks earned a profit margin of 36.4 per cent in the June quarter 2017. The big banks' net profit after tax in the June quarter was $7.8 billion. Other domestic banks earned a profit margin of 24.7 per cent, and total net profit after tax in the June quarter was $831 million. The financial and insurance services sector is the largest contributor to real industry gross value added in Australia—around nine per cent in the September quarter 2017. The mining and manufacturing industry is six per cent, for comparison's sake. All of this information, as I say, comes from the background paper prepared for the royal commission. 


Publicly available data broadly indicates that the big banks in Australia may be more profitable than some international counterparts—for example, those in Canada and the UK. As at November 2017, there were over 16 million credit and charge card accounts, with total balances of $52.2 billion. So, this is an industry that warrants a lot of scrutiny and there is a need for continual oversight of this industry. 


This bill expands APRA's regulatory powers to include reserve powers that cover non-ADI lending, should practices or the size of the non-ADI lending sector pose a risk to financial stability in the future. There's no suggestion that there is a problem at the current time with the size of the non-ADI lending sector, but, at some point in the future, this may become an issue and, therefore, APRA should have powers to monitor in this area. 


Non-bank lenders do play an important role in Australia. They encourage competition in the market and they are very much involved in lending to small business, which, of course, is an engine room for employment growth. Schedule 3 to the bill allows smaller ADIs—authorised deposit-taking institutions—to use the word 'bank' in their business name. I note that this is one of the changes that was very strongly supported by the Customer Owned Banking Association, and I will talk a little bit about that shortly. The change is designed to reflect public perception regarding the regulations and protections applicable to entities using the term 'bank'. Whereas ADIs are prudentially supervised by APRA, this has been extended and deposits covered by the Financial Claims Scheme are guaranteed. Labor welcomes the fact that small ADIs, including many credit unions, will now have the right to call themselves banks if they choose to. Previously, the term 'bank' could only be applied to institutions that held more than $50 million in tier 1 capital. 


I will digress briefly to mention that I am a big fan of the cooperatives and mutuals sector. I indicated that the Customer Owned Banking Association is a supporter of these changes and I do think it is extremely important that the mutuals are placed in a position where they can compete with the major banks. Their business model is one which, in my view, promotes more ethical treatment of customers. It's a situation where profits go back to members rather than return to shareholders, and we avoid the situation of the imperative for massive returns to shareholders, which drives the gouging and mistreatment of customers. I think the cooperatives and mutuals sector has a lot to offer the market and a lot to offer consumers. It's just interesting to note that, when it comes to cooperatives and mutuals, a lot of people are not aware of the prevalence of those.


For my own part, I'm a member of ME Bank, which is a mutual bank, I'm a member of Australian Unity Health Insurance and I'm also a member of the RACQ. These are very well known institutions. A lot of people don't know that they are actually mutuals, that they are customer owned and that they perform a very important role providing diversity and providing competition to the big banks.


I also want to give a plug, while I'm here, to the need for work to be done to enhance the mutuals sector, particularly in the banking area. I want to revisit some of the recommendations that were made by the Senate Economics References Committee on this issue, and I do welcome the fact that the government has picked up a number of the recommendations from that committee. Again, it's so important to the health of the financial services sector that we have this sort of healthy competition. Among the recommendations we looked at in the cooperatives and mutuals inquiry was for the Commonwealth to work with states and territories to develop a program of supports to encourage the establishment of new cooperatives and mutual enterprises. We recommended that a mutual enterprise be explicitly defined in the Corporations Act and its associated regulations. We also recommended that the cooperative and mutual sector be considered when the government is preparing a regulatory impact statement that accompanies new regulatory policies. We also recommended that the Commonwealth government liaise with state and territory counterparts to ensure that the regulatory burden for small and medium-sized cooperative and mutual enterprises aligns with the needs of these organisations to ensure they're not disadvantaged relative to companies of a similar size, because we know, and we've heard from a number of inquiries, that the regulatory burden is, in fact, a competitive advantage to some of the bigger corporations. We also talked about the Commonwealth and state governments supporting the formalisation of some of the innovative and market based approaches to raising capital for small and medium-sized cooperatives and mutual enterprises in the form of advice and information as they become available.


Importantly, we wanted APRA to set a target date for the outcome of discussions with the cooperative and mutual sector on issues of capital-raising and to bring those discussions to a timely conclusion. We also recommended, very importantly, that the Commonwealth examine proposals to amend the Corporations Act to provide cooperative and mutual enterprises with a mechanism to enable them access to a broader range of capital-raising and investment opportunities. This is a necessary vital reform. Unfortunately, we see a situation where a lot of cooperatives and mutuals, where they currently want to expand, see the only option going forward to de-mutualise. That's unfortunate. It sees a loss to the cooperative and mutual sector and is, I think, to the disadvantage and to the detriment of consumers, and I would certainly welcome movement in that area.


While I'm talking about this, I also wanted to just commend the work that the RACQ has done in merging with the QT Mutual Bank in 2016 and then, in September of last year, launching RACQ Bank, which is going to be an important player. RACQ is a very trusted organisation. As I've said, it's a cooperative owned by its members, and there are more than 1.6 million members. This now establishes one of Queensland's last remaining mutual banks. As I said earlier, the profits from the bank will be reinvested back into the RACQ ecosystem for the benefit of the RACQ members. That's a positive story. This, I think, underlines the fact we need to do more to support the cooperatives and mutuals sector. Its ability to call itself a bank followed from that merger in 2016 with QT Mutual Bank. 


Turning to other aspects of the bill, schedule 5 of the bill amends the credit act to introduce a number of reforms to improve consumer outcomes under credit card contracts by tightening responsible lending obligations and prohibiting credit card providers from offering unsolicited credit limit increases—part of the reckless and irresponsible behaviour that we've seen in the past. It also simplifies the calculation of interest charges and requires credit card contracts to allow consumers to reduce credit limits and terminate credit card contracts, including the ability to do it online. 


As at November 2017, there were 16.7 million credit and charge card accounts in Australia, with total balances, as I said earlier, of $52.2 billion. While credit card debt comprises a small percentage of the banks' overall assets, it can have a significant impact on household finances. These days, most consumers have some form of credit or store credit card, and many of these cards have hidden fees or charges. We have seen balance transfer schemes becoming more prevalent in the industry. Consumers do deserve the best protection we can give them from fee-gouging and shoddy bank practices. 


Labor do, in fact, welcome the reforms that we are debating today. In fact, we actually came up with them first. I go back to the 2015 committee report findings of the Senate Economics References Committee, of which I am the chair. We released a report into the Australian credit card market. That report came up with a table of recommendations—I won't go through all of those quite significant recommendations. I note that the government did indicate its support for a large number of those, and it responded, promising reform, in May of 2016. But, as with many other things, it dragged its feet and has, for the last almost two years, been running a protection racket for the big banks. 


In the meantime, the Khoury review of the Code of Banking Practice, for the Australian Bankers' Association, recommended that banks voluntarily make changes to credit card practices for a fairer system for consumers. But the banks refused the recommendations to stop unsolicited credit card increase offers and to stop the tricky credit card interest charging practices, and they also refused to clearly commit to simple, online cancellation of credit cards. I think these are very telling responses from the Bankers' Association which show that they have been unwilling to grasp the nettle and go about the job of reforming their own practices. Because of the Prime Minister's inaction and the banks' reluctance, consumers will have to wait until 2019 for these long-overdue protections to take effect.


We're seeing a recurring theme here from the financial sector and the Turnbull government: review something, vaguely promise action and then hope that the issue goes away. Labor refuses to let these issues go away. That's why, after 601 days, the Prime Minister has been dragged, kicking and screaming, by Labor into having the royal commission.


Labor fought for this inquiry because banks were ripping off consumers with credit cards through hidden charging, high interest rates, high annual fees, expensive rewards programs, exorbitant late payment fees and inappropriate lending practices. Customers were being taken for a ride here, while the banks made—and are still making—millions in credit card profits. While the government has dilly-dallied on these laws to protect consumers with credit cards, OECD data shows that Australia is in the top five countries for personal debt. I refer to an article that has appeared in the Gladstone Observer to that effect. This particular article, by Tim McIntyre of the Gladstone Observer on 12 February, showed this concerning statistic. The article had a comment from Wealth Within chief analyst Dale Gillham, who said that the debt levels were a concern. He went on to say:


We are stuck on a debt treadmill and many of us don't know how to get off … Identify you have a problem with debt, cut back on non-essential spending … and funnel the cash freed up into paying down your bad debt.


As a society, we do have an issue with this. Let's hope that some of these improvements in credit card changes will assist.


In terms of Labor's record, we introduced the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, which was the first single-standard and nationally consistent regime for consumer credit regulation and oversight in the country. We gave ASIC regulatory powers to oversee consumer credit, including home loans and credit cards. I want to give a shout out to Wayne Swan, who did fantastic work on credit card reform as Treasurer. These measures that he introduced began in July 2012. I won't go through the details of those, but I just want to take a minute to wish Wayne all the best for the next phase of his life. We all remember that he was voted world's best Treasurer in 2011. He's made an enormous contribution to our country, and I'm sure that he will be missed in this place.


So just further in terms of Labor's achievements, we looked into the Future of Financial Advice reforms, or FoFA, which came about in the wake of the Storm Financial, Trio Capital and Westpoint collapses. We had a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry in 2011-12. Reforms included financial advice providers legally being required to act in the best interests of their clients, eliminating kickbacks to financial advisors. Unfortunately, these were fought by the coalition. They voted against FoFA in the House, they voted against FoFA in the Senate and they tried to undermine its function when they came to government. But thanks to Labor taking up the fight on the finance front, FoFA lived on. As a result, ASIC uncovered in 2016 that customers were paying fees for financial advice that was never provided. There were more than 300,000 customers affected by this. In conclusion, this change cannot come soon enough, though the royal commission will deliver the real change in practice and culture.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-02-15,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (10:04):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. Australians are people who believe in treating others fairly. The fair go is a hallmark of the Australian way of life. In turn, they expect fairness from those around them. They expect fairness from their mates, from the government and from the other institutions in society, such as the banking and financial sector; however, it's quite clear to most Australians that banks, the financial sector and credit card companies have not upheld their end of this fairness bargain. All of us have heard horror stories, and may even know victims of the financial sector—in fact, my own parents lost $150,000 some years ago.


There are dodgy financial products, hidden fees and charges and just plain rip-offs. We can clearly see from the overwhelming community support for Labor's call for a banking royal commission—which the government ignored for two years and then belatedly and begrudgingly supported once they had given their mates in the sector the opportunity to write the convenient terms of reference—that the community wants things to change. 


I hope that the focus of the royal commission will turn to the victims of banking and financial scandals. This is an opportunity for those who have suffered because of insurance scams, dodgy lending and fee rip-offs to tell their stories and present their evidence to the royal commission. I hope that the royal commission delivers justice to families and small businesses that have suffered because of misconduct in the banking and financial services sector. We already know—and the royal commission will show us—that change is needed. 


The bill before us today makes some important and significant changes—changes which will significantly help credit card consumers, in particular, and changes that Labor has been calling for for years. We really have to ask ourselves why it has taken this government so long. It's not that the issue only affects a small number of people: there were 16,690,289 credit cards in Australia as of November 2017. Almost every adult in Australia has a credit card, and many people have more than one. Why has the government taken so long to act? Is it to allow their mates in the sector to keep on rolling in record profits to squirrel away to tax havens, like Mr Turnbull's in the Cayman Islands? In 2015, a Labor-led Senate inquiry first stirred changes to credit card regulation. It was in response to the recommendations of the inquiry that the Treasurer promised to progress these changes to credit card regulation. Even with the passage of this bill, we won't see most of those protections come into place until 2019. 


Let me tell you a bit about the bill. The bill makes three key changes. It will allow smaller authorised deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs, to use the word 'bank' in their business name, and the bill will give the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, powers to deal with developments in non-ADI lending that pose a risk to financial stability. It also introduces reforms to improve consumer outcomes under credit card contracts. 


As I mentioned, in 2015 the Senate Economics References Committee, which my colleague Senator Ketter referred to earlier, handed down its report Interest rates and informed choice in the Australian credit card market. This is quite a comprehensive report, and I urge anyone with any interest in the issue to download it from the committee's website and read it. 


The committee handed down 11 recommendations in the report, derived from written submissions and five public hearings held in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. In 2016, the government promised legislation in the near future to respond to the recommendations of that inquiry, yet it's taken nearly two years to come to it. Seriously, I would hate to see this government on a go-slow, I really would. While the Treasurer dithered, the banking sector continued to thumb their nose at him. The Australian Bankers' Association refused recommendations from the review of their code of practice that, in the name of fairness to customers, they should voluntarily make changes. The banks refused to stop unsolicited credit card increase offers and tricky credit card interest rate charging practices. They also refused to clearly commit to simple online cancellation of credit cards. 


If the government could just spend a little bit of time away from their internal bickering, their scandals, their back-stabbing and their incompetence, the Australian people would really appreciate them focusing their attention on legislating for the interests of the Australian people. 


One of the changes to credit cards is the tightening of the responsible lending requirements. Many thousands of desperate people have racked up credit card debt beyond their means to repay. They've spent years trying to pay these debts off, often with interest rates over the 20 per cent mark. This change will require that the suitability of a credit card contract is assessed on the consumer's ability to repay the credit limit within a certain period. That period is to be set in a legislative instrument made by ASIC. We'll be watching closely to see what that period is. 


It's obviously important that Australians are properly protected from predatory or unsuitable lending. Another of the changes is the standardisation of the way credit card interest is calculated. I was taught how to calculate interest in my high school maths classes; however, the well-respected website Choice has said that the way the banks calculate credit card interest is 'mind bending'. When respected governance adviser Phil Khoury conducted a review of the code of conduct of banking practice, he investigated the ways that banks were applying credit card interest. He looked at some practices and found that few customers would be aware that they were even happening at all. Khoury describes the interest calculation practices as 'unacceptable' and 'substantially unfair' and indicates that, if understood, they would be seen as 'just plain tricky'. This is pretty troubling criticism from a very respected reviewer. Under this bill, credit card providers are prohibited from imposing interest charges retrospectively to a credit card balance or part of that balance that has the benefit of an interest-free period. Again, we welcome these changes to the way credit card interest is calculated—but, again, they're long overdue, and we've been calling for them for many years.


Many Australians have come to realise that some of the credit products that they hold aren't suitable or aren't good value for money and they want to cancel them, but, currently, people can't do that online, where most Australians now do their banking. Under this bill, banks will now be required to allow online cancellation of credit cards. This makes eminent sense. You can get a credit card online quite easily, but, if you try and cancel a credit card online, it's very difficult—and it shouldn't be that way. If a customer sees a card that's a better deal, they should be able to move over to that better deal with great ease. Additionally, customers end up hanging onto old cards that they do not intend to keep, with access to more credit than they otherwise need, and these cards often have annual fees and other ongoing costs which add up over the years to a substantial amount of money. So it does make simple sense to require banks and card issuers to have simple online cancellation of credit cards. Under the bill before us today, a bank may not be required to cancel a credit card where there is still an outstanding balance. Again, we need to ensure that this element of the bill is monitored to make sure that the impact of encouraging customers to switch credit cards is real and to ensure that it enables customers to more easily ditch unsuitable cards.


Labor notes that this bill will also require banks to allow a reduction of credit card limits online. As those listening would all be aware, you can very easily increase your credit limit online, often in minutes, so it should be just as easy to reduce your credit limit online. If a consumer has the insight or the awareness that they have too much credit available to them and that they might not easily be able to pay that off and they want to do the right thing and take some control, they should find it easy, not hard, to reduce their credit card limit. I believe we should be supporting consumers that want to take proactive actions to limit their liabilities and we should make it easy for them to do that. The Consumer Action Law Centre has drawn attention to the fact that, as the bill is currently drafted, banks are not required to reduce credit limits below the minimum credit of the card. Labor will continue to monitor that closely and, if further improvements are needed, we will make those suggestions in due course.


Schedules 1 and 2 of the bill will give APRA powers in relation to non-ADI lenders. These powers, which have been described as reserve powers, are designed to be used should the activities of these lenders pose a risk to financial stability in the future. The bill also gives APRA power to collect certain data from these lenders. ADI lenders such as banks and credit unions are subject to APRA's prudential requirements and ongoing supervision. These new powers for APRA are proposed in recognition of the fact that APRA has responsibilities in relation to stability of the Australian financial system which are consistent with its core mandate of protecting depositors. Labor notes that some non-bank lenders have raised concern about the scope of these powers. We recognise that non-ADI lenders can play an important role in ensuring competition against banks; indeed, this is an increasing element of our financial system. There is disruption with these new providers, peer-to-peer lenders and others. This includes disruption in relation to business lending. As an example, innovative non-banking lenders can play an important role in providing finance needed to small-business owners to expand. And, as mentioned briefly earlier, schedule 3 will allow smaller ADIs to use the word 'bank' in their business names should they choose to.


As the explanatory memorandum points out:


… the changes will align community expectations in respect of the use of the term 'bank' with the fact that ADIs are prudentially supervised by APRA and deposits are covered by the FCS guarantee—


the Financial Claims Scheme guarantee. Under this change all ADIs can use the word 'bank' in their business name unless APRA, for whatever reason, has issued a determination to the contrary. Currently, APRA permits only ADIs with tier-1 capital exceeding $50 million to use the terms 'bank', 'banker' and 'banking'. There are a number of small ADIs who would benefit from the use of these terms, and I note that the Customer Owned Banking Association, which represents credit unions and building societies as well as mutual banks, has been particularly supportive of this change. Again, Labor supports this change.


Finally, schedule 4 to the bill modernises the Banking Act by inserting an objects provision. Similar industry acts, the Life Insurance Act 1995 and the Insurance Act 1973 contain objects provisions which guide the reader on the main purposes of the act. The main objects of the Banking Act will be (a) to protect the interests of depositors in ADIs in ways that are consistent with the continued development of a viable, competitive and innovative banking industry and (b) to promote financial system stability in Australia.


While the changes in this bill are welcome, they are long overdue. This government does not care about the consumer, and it only acts belatedly when it has no other choice—when it has to be dragged in, kicking and screaming. In contrast, Labor made significant reforms when we were in government. These landmark reforms included the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. This was the first single standard and nationally consistent regime for consumer credit regulation and oversight in this country. This act gave oversight to consumer credit, including home loans and credit cards, to a national regulator, that being ASIC. It included what are proving to be very important responsible lending obligations. Labor also enacted the Future of Financial Advice, FOFA, reforms. Those opposite want to write these reforms out of history because their persistent opposition to FOFA now looks so embarrassing. They voted against FOFA in the House, they voted against FOFA in the Senate and, when they got into government, they tried to gut FOFA, first by legislation and then by regulation. Labor had to fight tooth and nail to protect FOFA, and it was lucky that we prevailed.


To take one example, ASIC's Fees for no service report revealed, in October 2016, that the big four banks and AMP had spent years taking fees from customers for financial advice services that were never provided. ASIC found that there were great systems in place to record incoming revenue but very little in place to prove that customers were getting anything in return. The number of customers affected is over 300,000. The amount of fees improperly charged is over $200 million. ASIC has stated that the FOFA requirements that were vehemently fought against by those opposite—namely, the requirement that customers periodically opt in to the advice relationship and the requirement that advisers provide annual fee disclosure statements to all of their clients, including existing clients—helped to bring to light this massive fees-for-no-service scandal.


In government, those opposite made massive cuts to ASIC, made massive cuts to the capability of the corporate regulator and gave a massive free pass to corporate misconduct. They only moved to restore funding to ASIC when Labor began calling for a royal commission. Those opposite have a record of giving free passes to financial sector misconduct at every turn, and that continued until recently with their stubborn refusal to initiate a banking royal commission.


Labor have identified other areas where we could see a greater stability in our economy—and I'd like to thank my colleague the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, who has been working to highlight areas of our economy where there are unacceptable risks. I'd also like to concur with Senator Ketter's words about Mr Swan and to thank him for his work as well.


One such area where there is unacceptable risk is that of household debt, particularly in regard to household debt related to housing in Australia. Over the recent decade, we've seen astronomical price increases in the cost of housing, particularly in the Sydney and Melbourne markets and, interestingly enough, in the Hobart market, which is growing at a staggering rate. Australia's level of debt is now 100 per cent higher than the total earnings of all households. Australia has the most generous property tax concessions in the world when it comes to investing in housing. I'm speaking here, of course, of our negative-gearing regime—the ability to deduct interest payments on an investment loan for an investment property—and the capital gains tax discount: the 50 per cent discount on capital gains tax being paid on the sale of an investment property.


When these two reforms were introduced by the Howard government, importantly, in the budgetary context, they weren't funded. In other words, there was no revenue source that offset the reduction in revenue that came about from the additional expenditure associated with these tax concessions. Now that we've got a growing budget deficit—it's almost tripled under this government—we're seeing the folly of those decisions being borne by this generation of Australians, because there was no funding source put in place to introduce those very generous tax concessions into the budgetary process. Therefore, it's hardly surprising that we have one of the highest household leverage rates in the world.


For almost two years the Labor Party has been calling on the government to bring attention to the risks associated with such high household debt. The Reserve Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Grattan Institute and the government's Financial System Inquiry have argued forcefully that tax concessions such as negative gearing distort economic decision-making and encourage leverage in the economy. The overwhelming evidence is that those who benefit from those tax concessions are the wealthiest Australians. It was confirmed in the newspapers fairly recently that the top 10 per cent of income earners in this country benefit from 80 per cent of the capital gains tax discount—that is, 80 per cent of the capital gains tax discount benefits go to the top 10 per cent of income earners in Australia.


We would welcome the government's making such additional reforms if they could be bothered to concentrate long enough on the task of government. While we welcome the bill before us and the consumer protections it entails, the government need to be reprimanded for their tardiness and their unwillingness to act until now. They really do need to sharpen their pencils, as a dear friend of mine would say. This legislation could have been enacted two years ago. That would have been an additional two years of protections for consumers across Australia. But I do call upon my fellow senators to support the bill. As I said, it's a start, but it's not enough. The government needs to pay more attention to the role of governing and sort out their squabbling and their bickering and their scandals so that the people of Australia can have some faith in this government.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2018-02-15,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Jobs and Innovation) (10:22):  I rise to sum up the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017, and I thank all senators for their contribution to the debate. The bill enhances the stability, competitiveness and fairness of the financial system. 


Schedule 1 to the bill provides the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, which is known as APRA, a new power to make rules concerning the lending activities of non-bank lenders. This new power is a reserve power, which means that in ordinary times it will not be used. Schedule 2 reinforces APRA's ability to monitor the sector by strengthening APRA's existing data collection powers. Together, these reforms mean APRA will be able to make rules where it assesses that the lending activities of non-ADI lenders are materially contributing to risks of instability in the Australian financial system. While non-ADI lenders are currently a small share of the financial sector, APRA's macroprudential measures for ADI mean it is likely that the sector will grow and, potentially, contribute to risks. Risks to financial stability can be very costly. Risks, if realised, will ultimately fall on the broader Australian community. However, the government is of the view that non-ADI lenders are not currently materially contributing to financial stability risks, and therefore the government does not expect a rule to be made on day 1. Schedules 1 and 2 to the bill will add to APRA's tools on the shelf by expanding the powers APRA can use if and when risks to financial stability emerge in the non-ADI lending sector.


Schedule 3 of the bill removes the prohibition on the term 'bank' and allows all banking businesses with an ADI licence to benefit from this term. Currently, only ADIs with at least $50 million in capital are permitted to use the term 'bank'. This is a real problem for the innovative new banking entrants who want to enter the market. Customers need to understand the product you are offering before they come on board, and these entities need to onboard customers to grow. This is a real catch 22 for new bank entrants. They can't call themselves a bank before they hit $50 million in capital but they can't grow without being able to call themselves a bank. The limit on the use of the term 'bank' to entities over $50 million also creates a false perception in the community that the level of protection afforded to depositors in large APRA regulated institutions is greater than that of small regulated institutions. This is simply not the case. All depositors can take comfort in the fact that APRA regulates all ADIs and all depositors are protected under the Financial Claims Scheme, the government's deposit guarantee scheme.


In implementing this measure, the government has three objectives. It opens the door to innovative new entrants, it levels the playing field for existing ADIs and it meets the community expectation that the only entities that can use the term 'bank' are APRA regulated entities. In order to achieve the third objective, this measure alters the framework for the administrative review of decisions made by APRA concerning the use of the term 'bank'. Non-banks will no longer be able to challenge a decision by APRA to deny the use of the term 'bank' other than on the grounds of procedural fairness. This has the added benefit of reducing an administrative burden on APRA.


Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to modernise the Banking Act by inserting an objects provision, clarifying APRA's mandate under this act. This provides an opportunity for government to reinforce APRA's mandate to protect depositors and financial stability, whilst also promoting innovation. A reference is also incorporated to make it clear that APRA can take account of geographic and sectoral considerations where appropriate.


In addition, schedule 5 will prohibit credit card providers from making unsolicited credit limit increase invitations to consumers through any form of communication. This prohibition will cover all consumers, even if they have previously opted in to receive these invitations. Schedule 5 will also simplify how credit card interest can be calculated by prohibiting credit card providers from backdating interest charges or charging interest on a balance that has already been repaid. This reform will bring credit card interest in line with community expectation and reduce the complexity of the calculation of credit card interest. Finally, schedule 5 will require credit card providers to have online options for consumers to lower a credit limit or request to cancel a credit card. Consumers can face substantial barriers to cancelling a credit card or lowering a credit limit, which reduces competition and impedes the ability of consumers to manage their credit card debts. Schedule 5 will require credit card providers to facilitate a request and will prohibit providers from imposing unnecessary requirements on consumers.


These reforms will provide vital protections to vulnerable Australians and improve competition in the credit card market. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Efforts to address human rights concerns at a Commonwealth level have been activated by the external affairs power granted by the Constitution. 


Conversely, states have the residual jurisdiction to address the manifest and increasing number of claims for human rights that are coming out of the international and globalist movement, particularly from the United Nations.


This Bill leaves untouched the relevant federal legislation to prevent race discrimination, age discrimination, sex discrimination and the like. 


As was the case in 2000 via amendments made by the Howard Government, the Human Rights Commission will cease hearing complaints—due to its abolition. Instead, aggrieved plaintiffs will retain the right to take action under the relevant anti-discrimination regimes in the States and Territories.


In short, we must cease the increasingly aggressive agenda being advanced by so-called 'human rights commissions' and instead place the burden back on the plaintiff—as it should, under the rule of law—to establish their case before a court. It is always open to the government of the day to address the question of how the rights described in state, territory and federal legislation are resourced as a consequence of the repeal of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 or the government could propose consequential amendments to provide for applications by aggrieved plaintiffs to be lodged directly in the Federal Court. 


I have to observe that the rationale for creating commissions such as these might have at least had some logical basis for the political left in the historical context of when they began. However, these regimes fail to look at the state of civil society and the advance of technology. It may once have been considered necessary to give the imprimatur of a taxpayer-funded commission to remedy power imbalances. Technology now places recording and broadcasting devices in the hands of every Australian. Speech or conduct that is deemed offensive can be the subject of near automatic broadcast. A person offended—rightly or wrongly—by speech or behaviour can pull out their phone and not just record but also broadcast live, if they wish, what they are unhappy about. The court of public opinion immediately weighs in on the matter. Technology has overtaken the rationale for having powerful commissions to take 'affirmative action'. Everyone has a voice now. The days of big government should be numbered. 


However, ideology prevents the political activist acting upon the evidence and accepting reality. Their political marketing model relies on two things. 


Firstly, if emancipation of a minority is achieved, the brief celebration ends and these same advocates shift to advocacy for another group that allegedly needs emancipation. It is a continuous cycle of complaint and deconstruction of our culture, institutions and civil society. 


Secondly, if emancipation of a minority is not achieved—and it could be argued the so-called solutions are so ill-conceived as to ensure it is not achieved—then the next tranche of solutions are increasingly radical, aggressive and destructive. This, too, breaks down civil society as advocates' frustration leads to increasing radicalisation. 


In the context of radicalisation, it is apt to turn to a self-confessed radical who occupied the highest position in the Commission I am seeking to abolish.


There has been no clearer illustration of the misguided agenda of the Commission than its time under the tenure of controversial president Gillian Triggs, whose 5 year term concluded last year.


In one of her final interviews, former Attorney-General Roxon's appointee Ms Triggs told the ABC ""dealing with human beings"" made her ""radicalised"" in the job, adding, ""I don't see myself as a warrior, I'm not a warrior at all. But as you meet the people … (and she lists some) … frankly, one becomes radicalised.""


The most egregious examples of the radical agenda of the former Commissioner were the cases of the late and great Bill Leak and the QUT student cases. Both turned on the problematic question of the methods aimed to advance the status of indigenous Australians.


Both cases have been well publicised and would be well-known to most senators. 


Mr Leak published a cartoon in The Australian newspaper raising questions about Aboriginal parental responsibility. 


The students from Queensland University of Technology (QUT) fell within Ms Triggs' remit when Ms Cindy Prior lodged a complaint against them. One of their number was refused access to what the student did not know was an Aboriginal-only computer lab on campus. Ms Prior informed the student of this exclusivity whilst on duty at the lab. After leaving, he and his associates to take to social media to express their surprise at—as one person put it—affirmative action now seeking to address 'segregation with segregation'. For this alleged thought crime, Ms Triggs deployed the full force of her powers against the students by supporting Ms Prior. Ms Prior claimed she has been so traumatised by this incident that she had suffered personal harm. The case was, ultimately, dismissed by the court—but not before significant cost and distress for the students.


In her final week as Human Rights Commissioner, Ms Triggs claimed the present government was 'ideologically opposed to human rights' and that such rights were 'regressing on almost every front'. It is the type of hyperbole one expects from political activists—which Ms Triggs became—not from an independent commissioner who determines human rights matters. 


It is passing strange that I must indeed submit a human rights compliance statement not only on this bill, but every bill I present—as does every other senator—yet Ms Triggs asserts that somehow human rights are going backward.


Ms Triggs cited as evidence for her concerns former Prime Minister Abbott's pre-2013 campaigning to repeal the Commission. This is true, and it is indeed the policy position of Australian Conservatives. I am enacting that policy position today, a position that it would seem has been abandoned by a Coalition government that—as Ms Triggs points out—campaigned to do so.


To say that abolishing the Commission equates to being ideologically opposed to human rights is a false dichotomy. Repealing state apparatus that claims to uphold human rights does not equate to opposing human rights. It equates, in the case of my bill today, to:


remove duplication, 


strengthen state rights for their proper constitutional and jurisdictional responsibilities, 


task greater responsibility for enforcement to civil society, and


disarm unaccountable bodies with draconian powers to police thought-crime.


I note that this same Gillian Triggs appeared at a fundraising event for the founder of the Australian Greens political party, Mr Bob Brown, during her tenure. Mr Andrew Bolt—another victim of the unbalanced section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act—opined at the time of this event:


""She (Triggs) has turned this taxpayer-funded body into a soapbox for the Left and a witch-hunter to persecute conservatives, while misleading the Senate."" 


Mr Bolt later recounted that:


Ms Triggs said in a reportedly 'blistering' speech to the event that it was 'sad that you can say what you like around the kitchen table at home' and 


Mr Brown tweeted that Ms Triggs received a standing ovation.


Perhaps, indeed, it was applause for accomplishing the mission set by the government and indeed the Attorney-General who appointed her, Ms Nicola Roxon. This is the same Attorney-General who caused a furore in November 2012 with proposals to consolidate federal anti-discrimination laws. In effect, Labor's and Ms Roxon's proposal would have expanded prohibitions of offence, insult or intimidation in the anti-discrimination space. She said, at the time, it was a 'very sensible middle course'—a refrain picked up in other contexts by former senator Xenophon. Yet her proposals triggered some 600 submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs committee. Ms Roxon sought to consolidate the laws touched by my bill today into one Act, but thankfully civil society spoke up in outrage about the attack on free speech that it was. One wonders whether civil society would speak up—and be heard by a future government on this topic. Thankfully, due to the advocacy of civil society, the government retreated from its proposals.


I move on to consider the actions of another Labor appointee, by former Attorney-General Dreyfus, namely Mr Tim Soutphommasane. The late Mr Leak, in particular, took umbrage to Mr Soutphommasane's approach to his role as Race Discrimination Commissioner. Last July, Mr Soutphommasane criticised those who sought to ""re-open ideological culture wars"" and derided those who suggest ""cultural Marxism (is) taking over public institutions."" He wrote not long before his appointment that ""today's conservatives frequently endorse a form of destructive radicalism towards public institutions and civil society."" One could not—in my view—give a better example of Newspeak than that statement. Conservatives are the ones upholding public institutions and civil society. It is the likes of leftists like Mr Soutphommasane that are doing the very thing he accuses conservatives of doing. 


A great many Australians hold conservative views and whilst open to question, when attacked by a supposedly impartial 'race discrimination commissioner', this calls into question—if I may borrow terms from the political left—his own conscious or unconscious bias.


I note that Mr Soutphommasane once said ""the arts must … consciously question the status quo."" Evidently, the cartoons of the late Mr Leak are not therefore art, as he was questioning the new status quo of political correctness when he was attacked under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. 


Mr Soutphommasane's tenure concludes in August. The Institute of Public Affairs has asserted that Mr Soutphommasane has been the source of 'incessant solicitation' of complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act.


Yet the excesses of these commissions are not limited to the federal bodies. I will focus on two examples to illustrate. Before doing so, I invite colleagues to reflect that the current and future examples of state and territory regimes that I point to are not touched by this bill. They are regimes that are already aggressively pushing affirmative action. The state-federal duplication can be resolved by removing their aggressive federal counterparts, and leaving the virtue-signalling and thought-policing to the state and territory bodies.


The first example is Tasmania. In that jurisdiction, two complaints illustrate the over-reach of anti-discrimination laws there. The cases of Archbishop Porteous and pastors Markham & Gee—both relating to sexuality discrimination complaints—are sobering examples. In both instances, adherents to the Catholic and Protestant expressions of Christianity were publicly expressing their views regarding marriage and sexuality according to their holy texts. Complaints were made against them, one of which I understand is ongoing. In the Porteous case, the complaint was withdrawn but I am very reliably informed, it was withdrawn purely for tactical purposes. The complaint was so ridiculous that it had the potential to undermine the 'Yes' campaign for redefining marriage, so the complainant was encouraged to withdraw. The advocates of these thought-policing regimes that suppress free speech shrug their shoulders and say no harm was done as the complaint was withdrawn. The Archbishop suffered public ridicule and reputational attack, and had to engage legal counsel, to defend a complaint that cost the complainant next to nothing. 


The second example is that proposed in the Northern Territory. Among other proposals, the government there suggests that the regime not require an actual complainant for the equivalent commission to initiate a complaint. Nor does the proposed regime require the continuing support of a complainant for the matter to continue. In both instances, the lack of an active complainant or plaintiff is an abuse of the rule of law. It suggests that the real target is not to redress personal damage or harm, but to police thought-crime. It is a frightening prospect.


I have not even mentioned yet the regime in Victoria which is also excessive, but these two examples alone ought to illustrate that there is ample movement in the human rights space—albeit misguided, aggressive 'affirmative action'—to show that there is no need for a federal body for the same purpose.


I urge the senate to end the duplication of these functions, restore the power of states and the moderating role of civil society by supporting this Bill.

  The coalition government does not support this motion. Offshore processing is a critical component of Operation Sovereign Borders. The Labor-Greens policy of abandoning regional processing cost 1,200 lives and saw 8,000 children detained. It was a humanitarian disaster.


The coalition government's strong and consistent border protection policies have saved countless lives, and we have taken back control of Australia's borders from the people smugglers. This government's position is clear and will not be changing. No-one who arrives illegally be boat will be permanently settled in Australia.

  The Turnbull government are in their fifth year of government, and have been completely and utterly incompetent at managing Australia's offshore processing centres. It is incumbent on the Turnbull government to ensure refugees have access to essential services, including security, health and welfare services.


Labor believes in strong borders, offshore processing, regional resettlement and, when it's safe to do so, boat turnbacks, because we know they saves lives at sea. Manus Island and Nauru were set up as temporary processing facilities but have become places of indefinite detention because of the inaction of the Turnbull government. Labor wants eligible refugees off Manus Island and Nauru and resettled in third countries as soon as possible. We strongly support the US refugee resettlement agreement, which will see up to 1,250 refugees given the opportunity to resettle in America. One-hundred and thirty-five refugees from both Manus and Nauru have already had that opportunity. The US refugee resettlement agreement won't pick up all eligible refugees, and for that reason the Turnbull government must immediately secure other third-country settlement as a priority.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:13):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Treasury Laws Amendment (Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive) Bill 2017 will amend the tax law to replace the former Exploration Development Incentive with the Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive.


The Government is focused on promoting investment and driving economic activity. Ongoing exploration and the discovery of new mineral resources are vital to the longer term future of the resources sector. This tax incentive will encourage junior explorers to take risks and to have a go at discovering the next large-scale mineral deposit. We want to back small businesses.


This Government is working to get the economic fundamentals right to build a strong prosperous Australia, improve the business climate and unleash our economic potential. We are creating a stable platform for investor confidence and growth.


This new incentive entitles Australian resident investors in small minerals exploration companies to a refundable tax offset (or where the investor is a corporate tax entity, additional franking credits) if the company in which they have invested issues them an exploration credit. 


The ability of an exploration company to give up their tax losses to distribute credits to investors as a tax offset will make investing in a junior explorer more attractive.


Despite good prospects, Australia has not had a world-class minerals discovery in more than 20 years. Expenditure on greenfields exploration has declined by almost 70 per cent over the past five years to 2015-16. This incentive will make it more financially attractive for our mineral explorers to find resources in untapped regions, continuing discovery of quality resources. It builds on the EDI which ceased in 2016‑17, and aims to improve on the timeliness of the offset and target new investors that participate in new capital raisings. This will help maximise the incentive for additional investment in minerals exploration. 


Not only does the extraction and sale of minerals resources make a significant contribution to the Australian economy, it also creates jobs and supports local businesses in regional communities across Australia.


Greenfield minerals exploration is essential to ensuring an investment pipeline to support the future strength of the Australian resources sector. However, these exploration companies can find it difficult to raise the capital they need to explore. A $100 million tax incentive over four years, starting in 2017-18, will make this easier.


Companies can obtain an allocation of credits by applying electronically to the Commissioner of Taxation. Credits will be allocated on a first come, first served basis, until the annual cap is reached, with any unallocated credits carried forward to the next year of the scheme.


The new process will be faster than the EDI as small exploration companies will know with certainty upfront how many credits they have been allocated before they undertake their capital raising to fund their exploration activities.


To ensure that the benefits of the incentive are widely distributed, there is a cap on the amount of credits that may be allocated to an entity of 5 per cent of the total amount available for each year.


As part of introducing the new incentive, the excess exploration credit tax will apply to ensure minerals explorers seek to create and issue exploration credits only in circumstances in which they are entitled to. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:01):  I seek leave to move a motion relating to the breaching of the standards required of ministers by the Deputy Prime Minister.


Leave not granted.




Senator DI NATALE:
  I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to give precedence to a motion relating to the breaching of the standards required of ministers by the Deputy Prime Minister.


Mr President, the behaviour and actions of the Deputy Prime Minister have brought the office of the Deputy Prime Minister into disrepute. This happens at a time when trust in politics is at an all-time low, when people have had a gutful of the behaviour of people in this place, and yet here we see a Prime Minister where questions are raised around due process, conflict of interest and the inappropriate use of taxpayer funds. What the Deputy Prime Minister chooses to do in his own time is his own business. We do note that this is a very difficult time for his family and indeed his new partner. But the reality now remains that there are serious questions about the conduct of the Deputy Prime Minister.


We know that arrangements have been made by the Deputy Prime Minister to place his new partner into highly paid positions within the National Party's parliamentary staff. We know the Prime Minister's own ministerial code of conduct states very, very clearly that partners shouldn't be offered positions within other ministerial offices. Of course, part of this hinges on whether the person in question was the Deputy Prime Minister's partner. Well, forgive me, but to try and avoid responsibility for fulfilling the ministerial code on the basis of whether she was technically his partner because he was in an ongoing relationship with his wife does not pass the common sense test. There is a serious question around whether he breached those standards.


Today we learnt from reports that it appears that the Deputy Prime Minister solicited a gift of free rental accommodation worth in the order of $12,000, again appearing to be a clear breach of the Prime Minister's statement. Worse still, when asked about this he told the parliament today that the person in question, his friend, approached him, offering to do him a favour. We know, however, from when he was asked about this several days ago, that it was Barnaby Joyce that approached Greg Maguire—the person in question, the so-called friend—to solicit some help in finding accommodation. It does appear that today the Deputy Prime Minister has misled the parliament.


We further learnt that this individual, who clearly stands to benefit from decisions that have been made by Barnaby Joyce, may have already been the beneficiary of decisions by the Deputy Prime Minister, in that some of the accommodation that he owns may have already benefited from a government contract. That is a clear conflict of interest if indeed that is the case.


We also learnt today that there are further revelations that the Deputy Prime Minister was paid by the Nationals to run for the recent by-election in New England. This is remarkable. The Deputy Prime Minister of the country, who is on almost $500,000, is paid a salary by the National Party to conduct a by-election campaign. It is utterly remarkable that the Nationals would think it was appropriate to cover the salary of somebody who was so incompetent. He was found to be a dual citizen. He denied it initially, sat on it and continued to be a minister. And what do the National Party do? They reward him for his incompetence.


We should also remember that the reason we are in the mess we are in with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is because Deputy Prime Minister Joyce has been so incompetent. This is a man whose hypocrisy knows no bounds. He took time during the debate around marriage equality to lecture us on family values and how important it was to ensure that we respect those values—of course, knowing all the while that he wasn't living up to them.


But that is not the reason for this suspension here today. The reason for this suspension is that there are serious questions about due process, about the potential for conflict of interest and, of course, about the appropriate use of taxpayer funds. All of this could be resolved, every last question right now could be resolved, if we had a national anti-corruption body. These are precisely the sorts of allegations that should be referred to a national anti-corruption body because there are serious questions now for the Deputy Prime Minister to answer.


One of the Deputy Prime Minister's primary functions is to serve as Prime Minister when the Prime Minister is on leave. We now learn that Deputy Prime Minister will be missing in action next week, and that honour will be handed over to Senator Cormann. That's simply not good enough. If he's not up to the job to be Prime Minister, he needs to go, and the Nationals need to sack him. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Di Natale, could you please provide the Senate with a signed suspension motion. Senator Wong.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2018-02-15,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:07):  I will outline why Labor is supporting this proposition. On Wednesday next week Mr Turnbull will leave Australia for the United States but Australia's Deputy Prime Minister will not be the Acting Prime Minister. That is because this government knows how untenable it is for him to act as the Prime Minister. In fact, the government's own decision underlines how untenable it is for Mr Joyce to hold any ministerial office—



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  and it underlines that the Prime Minister knows this. If he can't be the Acting Prime Minister, why is he still in his job?


The Deputy Prime Minister has repeatedly demonstrated a failure to abide by the standards demanded of ministers. That disqualifies him from any ministerial office, let alone acting as Prime Minister of Australia. I make very clear at the outset that I make no judgement—



Government senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, please resume your seat. I remind senators, particularly Senator O'Sullivan, that Senator Wong has the right to be heard in silence. I would ask you to respect that. Senator Cameron?




Senator Cameron:
  Madam Deputy President, I ask Senator O'Sullivan to withdraw the accusation he made against Senator Wong.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, I did hear the comment you made, I would ask you to withdraw it without repeating the offence.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  I withdraw.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator O'Sullivan. Senator Wong.




Senator WONG:
  I want to make very clear that I make no judgement, nor any comment whatsoever, about Mr Joyce's personal life. I make no judgement about him as a husband nor as a father. What we are asserting is that, in his professional capacity as a minister, Mr Joyce has failed to adhere to the standards that one expects of a minister. The foreword to the statement of ministerial standards makes this crystal clear. It declares that 'ministers must act in a manner consistent with high standards of integrity and propriety'. It also says that 'ministers shall conduct themselves in a manner that will ensure public confidence in them and in the government'. I think even Mr Joyce's most loyal supporters could not, and would not, reasonably assert that he has acted in a manner consistent with the highest standards of integrity and probity and conducted himself in a manner that will ensure public confidence either in himself or in the government.


The revelations this morning that Mr Joyce sought, and was subsequently offered, rent-free, an apartment from a prominent local business man is evidence of this. The statement of standards states:


Ministers … must not seek or encourage any form of gift in their personal capacity.


Mr Joyce's claim today that he did not seek the apartment has been directly contradicted by two journalists, who spoke directly to the owner of the apartment. And, even if we were to accept Mr Joyce's version of events, what is not in dispute is that he continues to benefit from the gift to this day. One is reminded of the $40,000 gift from Ms Gina Rinehart.


Secondly, it has been confirmed in this chamber this week that the former staffer that Mr Joyce has now made clear he is in a relationship with was subsequently employed, with the involvement of Mr Joyce's office, by two other senior members of the National Party. Again, I make no comment on the fact of the relationship. What I refer to is the Statement of Ministerial Standards, which is very clear on these facts:


Ministers' close relatives and partners are not to be appointed to positions in their ministerial or electorate offices, and must not be employed in the offices of other members of the executive government without the Prime Minister's express approval.


The Deputy Prime Minister and Mr Turnbull try to use a legalistic argument to evade culpability by arguing over the time at which Mr Joyce's former staffer came to be officially regarded as a partner. Can I say this: these are legalistic arguments which ignore the central issue, which is the principle that the standards uphold. There are sound reasons as to why these standards exist and why the safeguards, prohibitions and guidelines in them exist. The principle that is sought to be upheld here is one of the avoidance of conflict of interest. It is so the public can be assured that there is no conflict of interest in the appointment of persons to taxpayer-funded positions. And, frankly, it is also to ensure that those close to us are not exposed to unwanted public scrutiny that such suggestion of partiality would attract, and we have, I think, seen that this week.


Most importantly, these actions do not pass the Prime Minister's own test:


Ministers … must act in a manner that is consistent with the highest standards of integrity and propriety … and … conduct themselves in a manner that will ensure public confidence in them and in the government.


The sad reality is—and I wish the National Party could see this—Mr Joyce's position is untenable. It is unthinkable at this time that he can act in any ministerial office, as is demonstrated by the fact that the government itself cannot appoint him to be the Acting Prime Minister. Mr Joyce has failed to live up to the standards that Australians rightly expect of ministers. It is right that the Senate today expresses its view that Mr Joyce must resign, and he should resign today.

 (Victoria—Minister for Rural Health, Minister for Sport, Minister for Regional Communications and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:12):  As Deputy Leader of the National Party, I rise to speak on this particular motion and completely reject the notion that Barnaby Joyce, as minister, is not acting in the absolute best interests of regional Australia and the coalition government. He has explained the nature of his relationship with his former media adviser earlier this week in a very, very public statement. In relation to the employment of partners, of people that you are in a relationship with, he has explained the complexity of that issue in his statement. I am very, very happy to read that out for the Senate right now.


Ms Campion worked in the Deputy Prime Minister's office. A relationship developed, and she did the responsible thing and sought employment in Senator Canavan's office for a position which she was eminently qualified for and skilled to perform. And she did great work in that office, not just for Senator Canavan but for the entire National Party. I know, as a backbench senator then, that she visited my office and assisted us to develop our social media skills within the office as well.


Vikki did great work when Matt, obviously, stepped down as a result of things going on with the High Court. As is the usual practice, Vikki, as were other staff in his office, was deployed throughout the National Party's pool, and that is incredibly appropriate, and there is nothing unusual about what happened.


When we go to issues around ministerial accountability, Barnaby Joyce has been incredibly accountable in this whole process. He has publicly made a statement that has ensured that we are all clear about what occurred and how he has taken personal responsibility for what occurred.


I think Senator Wong was talking about issues around the accommodation that the Deputy Prime Minister has been in receipt of. That's all been declared completely publicly. I know you're trying to whip up a stir here, but everything is public. Everything has been declared in the usual process and as is appropriate.


Again I go to the statement by the Deputy Prime Minister, which is up-front and honest about what occurred. I think it's important that we remember that, as a minister of the Crown, your No. 1 job is to deliver for your constituency. Barnaby Joyce, as a member of the National Party, as the Leader of the National Party, has been doing that day in, day out, whether we look at the $8 billion delivered for the Inland Rail or his pursuit of a decentralisation agenda to ensure that we have more local and well-paying government jobs right across regional Australia. We look at the Regional Investment Corporation legislation, passed by the Senate this sitting fortnight—incredibly important legislation for the delivery of jobs and investment in regional communities and our industries, and it was Barnaby Joyce that actually developed that.


When we go out onto the ground, into our communities, the reality is life happens. Our community knows that. But, I tell you what: they back Barnaby Joyce. They back what he delivers for them in government, what he's been able to deliver as agriculture minister with a $4 billion agricultural white paper, and now they're looking forward to what he'll be able to do within the infrastructure portfolio. It won't just be about the Inland Rail; hopefully, he'll be able to get the Victorian Labor government to get behind infrastructure projects in a real and meaningful way.


When we look at the trade agreements rolling out our support for agriculture industries in regional communities, we see that no-one has done that better than Barnaby Joyce. When you go out into regional communities—not just in Tamworth, but right up and down the eastern seaboard and beyond—they back Barnaby Joyce not because he is being a fabulous husband, not because of what he has or hasn't done within his office but because of what he has absolutely been able to deliver for them.


When they send all of us here, the people of Australia want us to deliver for them and to remember why we're here, and Barnaby Joyce has done that 100 per cent. He enjoys the full support of the National Party—and the leadership of the National Party is actually a gift of the National Party party room. Barnaby is on leave next week, as he is entitled to do. For that period of time, Mathias will be Acting PM. (Time expired)




Senator Cormann:
  On a point of order—I'm not taking the call on the debate—we still haven't got a copy of the motion. Given that, apparently, this has got such a great sense of urgency, it would be courteous, on a serious matter like this, for the chamber at least to be provided with a copy of the motion, which we still haven't got.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (15:18):  Fellow senators, think about how this looks to the Australian people. We've just heard from Senator McKenzie that Barnaby Joyce is on leave next week—a week when he is expected to fill the role of Prime Minister. As the Deputy Prime Minister, he's expected to fill the role of Prime Minister. What could be more important? But he's going on leave. This motion here today is not about Barnaby Joyce—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Whish-Wilson, I remind you—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Mr Barnaby Joyce. This motion is about the institution of parliament. None of us want to see this place being seen by the Australian people as a joke. This government has had crisis after crisis in recent years. We've seen former minister Sussan Ley have to step down from her job—resigned over a scandal. We've seen Mr Stuart Robert resign from his position as a minister over a scandal.


We've had crisis after crisis. It's no wonder that politics is at such a low ebb in this country and that people are throwing up their hands in disgust right around this country when they see politicians and political parties putting themselves first. That's what this is—this is about Mr Barnaby Joyce's career and this is about keeping a Prime Minister in power. It is a Prime Minister and a political party that will do whatever it takes to hold on to power. It's not a good look. 


All of us need to support this motion today because this is about trust in the institution of parliament. I'm not going to get personal either about Mr Barnaby Joyce—I never have. I'm not going to get personal about this at all, but I will say in relation to politics that this is a man who has been happy to come into this place and the other place and lecture us on morality on issues like same-sex marriage and then display double standards. He's happy to tell young people that if they want an affordable house they should move to Armidale, and then he takes, rent free, an expensive apartment in the same town. This is a guy who is on $400,000 a year. How does this look? 


The reason I'm raising these issues is that I ask senators to reflect on how this looks about politicians. Each and every one of us in here is a parliamentarian and a politician, and this diminishes each and every one of us. We are asking for the Deputy Prime Minister—if, indeed, he still is the Deputy Prime Minister next week when on leave—to step down, to resign from his position, for the good of the parliament and all of us and for the reputational damage that this continues to do to our institution.


He has clearly breached ministerial standards. Examples have already been given of the decisions that he's made. Each and every time it looks to the Australian people like this is self-serving politicians feathering their own nest, having their snouts in the trough and taking double standards every chance they get. That's what it looks like to your average punter on the street. That actually matters. That is what matters here today. This is about the institution of parliament, not about Mr Barnaby Joyce.


It should be a clear decision. No doubt it will be some weight off the shoulders of the National Party. I've seen you refuse to answer any questions you've been asked about Mr Barnaby Joyce this week. There has not been any meat on any bones in any answers. I've watched your body language, and clearly you're under the pump and this is a very difficult time for you. I suggest you make it easier by supporting this motion. 


No offence to you, Senator Cormann—I think you'll do a very good job as Prime Minister next week—but the man who's supposed to do the job is Barnaby Joyce, and he's going on leave when he's supposed to be the Prime Minister. Young children around this country will be saying one day to their parents: 'I'm going to be Prime Minister. That's what I want to be when I grow up.' When Barnaby Joyce has got the chance to step into the big role, into the shoes of the Prime Minister, and sit in the big chair, he squibs it and goes on leave because he cannot stand the heat of what will happen next week. Senators have estimates the week after that. That's going to be a very busy week, let me tell you. Save yourself some pain and get Barnaby Joyce to resign. (Time expired)

  Through you, Madam Deputy President, I'm asking Senator McKim if he wants to talk about office relationships and the conflicts that come with them while you are a member of the parliament. That's what I'm asking. He can respond now or at some later time, if he chooses to. This is a party that did not ever make comment on Sam Dastyari's conflict—not one word. He was a member of parliament who had a monstrous conflict in accepting money from foreign interests. He got demoted and then promoted—and there was not one word from you.

Senator O'SULLIVAN:

  It's got everything to do with this! If you want to talk about someone under influence because they've got a free flat for $7,000, I'll have a talk about you with $1.5 million or $1.8 million—whatever the figure was—




Senator Williams:
  Two point two. 




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  My colleague tells me I'm out by hundreds of thousands of dollars. You people are hypocrites. You need to concentrate on the terms of some indictment that you imagine in your mind has been done here, because you behave like that in this place every day. You pull down jobs while Barnaby Joyce builds them. You pull down the bush and all the developments that occur in rural Australia while Barnaby Joyce builds them. He, on his worst day, would contribute more to this nation than your whole mob would in your best month—every time. Barnaby Joyce has done a phenomenal job and there's nothing, nothing, in the indictment that you have so loosely laid down that would in any way compromise him in doing the great job that he has done. He remains the leader of our party with absolute confidence. He will be there for as long as he chooses to be. You will not see our party move on it. You suggest that we are the ones with their career and their reputation at stake here. We will stand with this man. He's a fine leader of our party. He's a fine member of parliament. He's a fine Deputy Prime Minister. 


You come in here and attack him through this hypocrisy. You have been silent on so many other matters. I will bet you London to a brick that not one single lick came out of your mouth in relation to the Dastyari matter. You want to talk about conflict and seriousness? You want to talk about that? Let's talk about that. If you want to talk about interoffice relationships and its impact on people's performance, I could start today, go alphabetically and get to about 50 or 60 people here and right across the community. You people need to take a breath and think about what you're saying. It is grubby. It is below the point. The only reason you have brought yourself in here today is that you know that the Australian people have moved past this. The media have run out of any opportunity to put one more word in the paper. They've run out of pictures. So what you're trying to do is add a bit of water and turn a cup of soup into enough for the whole eight of you. I'm telling you now, you'll fail at this, just as it's failed at the moment. The reason it's failed is that there's been no weight in the indictment. There is nothing to see here. These things are tickety-top. There are movements of staff in the hundreds around this building every week. You do it yourself. You share resources. You sit your resources in the one room over there with the Greens. They're attached to you, but you sit them in a common office. You come in here and try to lecture us because you've found some sliver of a thing, some lightweight sliver of a thing, and you think we're going to fold.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2018-02-15,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (15:28):  I rise to support Senator Di Natale on this motion and also to agree with Senator Wong that the Deputy Prime Minister's position is untenable. I will go further and say that it was untenable last year. He should have stood down as Deputy Prime Minister and the party should have insisted on it when he was accused of being—and it was proved to be right—a dual national. He should have stood down then and gone to the backbench at least. Senator Canavan did that. He stood alongside the then Attorney-General Brandis and said, 'This is the right thing to do.' Senator Canavan did the right thing and went to the backbench. That's what Mr Joyce should have done back then. 


Earlier today, when an earlier motion was being circulated, I would not have supported it because it directly said that the Prime Minister should sack the Deputy Prime Minister. I thought that was not the way it should go. I say to the junior partner of the coalition, the Nationals: it's your job and your responsibility now to do what you think you should do. I'm pleased, in a way, that Mr Joyce has probably taken some of the advice I gave him in a tweet earlier this week, in which I said:


Suggestion for Barnaby. Announce today: ""Because of circumstances ,I have asked the Prime Minister to have Foreign Minister Bishop stand in for him when he goes to Washington next week"".


A tweeter said to me that the Nationals won't do that because it is common sense. No aspersion on you, Senator Cormann—I realise now that the foreign affairs minister will be overseas next week and you will be the Acting Prime Minister.


But I do think, as Senator Wong said, it is untenable. You can't have this person in there, and you as a government shouldn't want it, either. As a government you've been making some traction, you've had the PM getting some traction and getting ahead of Opposition Leader Shorten in the polls. If he goes to Washington next week and is at the White House, with Mr Joyce as Prime Minister, the headlines will all still be about Mr Joyce.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator HINCH:

Senator HINCH:

The newspapers haven't run out of stories and I suspect that Sharri Markson and The Daily Telegraph still have heaps and heaps and heaps of material that has been marked 'Barnaby'—since about last April, May or June. Who knows—they have had it.


I will go back to the original point. If you had any sense as a party—I'm only one man and the new boy here, but if this were happening to me my staff would be telling me 'Derryn, get back, sit down, apologise, clean up your act.'

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:54):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Marshall today relating to payday lenders.


I know it's some time ago, after all of the debates we have just held, but the topic of the answer that I am taking note of concerns the government's continued failure to take action against payday lenders. It's not surprising that they are failing to take action against this insidious form of credit, because, if you believe half of the media reports that are circulating at the moment—the ones not about the Deputy Prime Minister—it seems yet another parliamentary friends group has been created in this place: the 'Parliamentary Friends of Payday Lenders'. If there were one organisation or group in the community you would want to associate yourself with, you wouldn't have payday lenders up there, but it seems a number of government members are cosying up to payday lenders, defending their interests against the needs of poor and vulnerable people, and have brought pressure to bear on the government to the extent that the government has withdrawn legislation it was working on.


It's particularly disappointing that some of the names circulating as those who've been fighting hardest for the interests of payday lenders in this parliament have been National Party members—or LNP members, as we call them in Queensland—who represent rural and regional electorates with great degrees of poverty. We know very well that payday lenders prey particularly on the poorest and most vulnerable people in our communities, people who have run out of other credit options and who are forced into a position where, simply in order to pay their bills and get by from week to week, they take out loans at exorbitant rates, which spiral up, with the result that they owe, in some cases, hundreds or thousands of dollars more than they originally borrowed. I'm very surprised, for instance, to see the member for Dawson, Mr Christensen, being one of the most vocal supporters of payday lenders. He knows very well that his electorate has substantial pockets of poverty in it. Rather than coming into this house and defending his constituents from the rapacious payday lenders who are ripping them off, he's siding with those very same payday lenders.


I'm pleased, though, with the significant efforts by Labor representatives who've taken up this cause in parliament of late—in particular, our shadow minister for consumer affairs, Tim Hammond, and my Queensland Labor colleague the member for Oxley, Milton Dick. I know that builds on the work of Senator Cameron and many others on this issue over many years. We want to see much tighter regulation of payday lending. We think that it is a good idea to put some caps on the amount that debts can climb by, so that people don't get themselves into a situation where they might borrow to buy an appliance whose shelf price is a few hundred dollars, only to find a couple of years down the track that they've ended up being charged in the thousands of dollars, because of the outrageous interest rates that are imposed upon those borrowers by payday lenders. Those figures are no exaggeration. There are many instances where people are signing up to initial loans for hundreds of dollars which, by the end of their loan, end up being thousands of dollars, literally. That is absolutely wrong, and we should be taking action against it.


That's why Labor has introduced a private member's bill to take some action against these payday lenders. It's very surprising that, because of this pressure that has been imposed upon ministers by government members such as the member for Dawson, they have backed off introducing legislation that would have done something about this problem. But rather than let this issue lapse, Labor is grasping the nettle. We have introduced a private member's bill in exactly the same terms as the bill which was proposed by the government. If they are not prepared to take some action against payday lenders, then Labor most certainly will. Far too many people in our community are hurting as a result of payday lenders, and this kind of legislation will make a difference. When this bill goes before the parliament, it will be a real test for people like the member for Dawson, the member for Capricornia and the member for Forde—LNP representatives of areas with great poverty and people being ripped off. If they're on the side of their constituents and want to stop the rip-offs, they'll vote with Labor, but if they want to side yet again with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his big business mates, they'll vote against it.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2018-02-15,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (16:00):  It is a pleasure to rise and speak on the matter asked about by Senator Watt earlier today. It is refreshing to actually speak on something that is of relevance to ordinary Australians, as opposed to the subject matter we covered for most of question time today and a good period of time post question time. I take into account the points that were made by Senator Cameron on the doors—that Australians are sick and tired of talking about things that don't matter to them. It's a refreshing change to talk about something that is relevant to ordinary Australians and how they manage their household budgets.


It is interesting, as always, to listen to Senator Watt make his contributions on taking note. He's a very articulate man. I'm sure he does his research well. But he did make the point that a lot of what he was talking about is based on media reports around a particular supposed friendship group which exists in the parliament and fulfilled certain functions. It is one with which I'm not familiar and one I've not heard of myself but one, nonetheless, Senator Watt refers to in vague terms while trying to claim that this group of individuals who are members of it wield some amazing amount of authority in the party room. I think it may just be salacious reporting, but we'll have to wait and see as time goes forward.


No-one in this place, I think, denies that we need to ensure that vulnerable members of our community are well looked after and protected from predatory entities that may be preying on those who do require certain amounts of cash in short time frame. We've heard reports of this quite often, particularly in communities like those Senator Watt referred to: regional and rural communities, where sometimes work is hard to come by and it is a struggle to make ends meet. So you have families who, maybe in order to buy their kids their school uniform for the beginning of the school year, to pay the power bill or things like that, need to access funds in a very short time frame. And often these payday loans, as they've been referred to, are a product that these people access. It's important to ensure that the laws around these entities are ones that protect the consumer, because we've sometimes seen larger financial institutions and some smaller ones do things that could be construed as taking advantage of vulnerable consumers.


Of course, it's important to point out that there was a review into small-amount credit contract laws and whether these particular laws should be extended to consumer leases. That review was undertaken under the requirements of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. The government was fulfilling an obligation which came out of those laws which was specifically targeted at protecting individuals and ensuring that the rights of consumers were protected.


That report came back to government in March 2016, and the response to that particular report was released in November of 2016. Of course, the government's response supported the vast majority of the review's recommendations, including retaining existing price caps on small-amount credit contracts, extending the small-amount credit contract-protected earnings amount requirement to all consumers and lowering it to 10 per cent of the consumer's net income. It also talks about introducing a cap on total payments on a consumer lease equal to the base price of the good plus four per cent of that price per month and introducing a protected earnings amount requirement for consumer lease providers of 10 per cent of net income for all consumers. Also, it's important to note that the government did release an exposure draft to implement the response in October of last year.


These are all important steps the government is taking. This is quite the contrast to the suggestions being made by Senator Watt, that there's this group of mysterious individuals roaming the corridors of this building—members of this 'friendship group'—trying to dictate to government what they'll do when it comes to consumer protection in relation to credit products. It's important, but, as I said at the beginning of my contribution, it's refreshing to talk about something that is actually relevant to Australians, rather than the matters that we've been discussing in question time.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2018-02-15,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (16:05):  In answer to the question that I asked of Minister Cormann today, I got a response that has been backed up rather feebly by Senator Duniam. He said, 'Of course we don't have reckless National Party members dictating to the government on economic policy.' But the reality is very different. If we are to believe Senator Duniam's assurances, he's also going to say that this is a mysterious group and it doesn't exist. But the problem with that argument, really, is that Mr George Christensen has self-identified as part of that group. It's not a mysterious, secret group; it is a group. He's out there, and it's reported in the press. And it is being reported in the press because he's told them so! He's directly quoted as being part of that.


Now, the assurances that we received from the ministers and that we received from senators on the other side is that they actually care about the issue, 'We're considering our response, we've got things in train and we've got some legislation ready to go'—even though we haven't seen it yet—'but trust us; it's going to get there because the National Party isn't the tail that's wagging the Liberal Party dog.' That's what they try to tell us: the National Party is not the tail wagging the Liberal Party dog.


Now, you might think that that could be true, based on the numbers in the National Party versus the Liberal Party, unless we look at the track record. Let's look at the track record of the National Party tail wagging the Liberal Party dog. You only have to look at one of the biggest issues where we saw a backflip: the royal commission into the banking system. How many times did we see the very minister here today saying: 'The Nationals aren't dictating our policy to us on the banking royal commission. There's no need to have one. We don't need one; it's all under control, it's all happening'? But the very same National Party members who were pursuing that proposition kept at it and at it and at it, and where did we see that land? All of a sudden, the government takes the position: 'Oh! We've now had another think about it: we do need a royal commission into the banks'—something that we'd been telling them for a long, long time. But it took those same National Party people from within their coalition to actually make them do it. Why? Because they are the tail that is wagging the Liberal Party dog on economic policy.


We've not only seen it there, we've seen it in numerous examples all over the place. So when we get the rather feeble assurances from those opposite, and the rather curt assurances from the minister, forgive us for thinking that we don't necessarily believe those. That's why we've introduced a private member's bill that does exactly what they say they as a government should be doing with respect to payday lenders.


So they'll have an opportunity, even though they'll hedge and they'll try to squib it and try to avoid the issue, because the National Party, as we know, will keep undermining the proposition and setting up friends of payday lenders groups to lobby the government. We've seen the effectiveness of that in the past. But they will still have an opportunity to do what's right, because we will make them do it. We will give them that option, to actually do what's right and to implement what they know they should be doing—and that is, cutting back the opportunities for predatory lending behaviour in this country.


They know it's a problem. It's a significant problem. And the irony is that it's in National Party seats that it's one of the biggest problems—that's where it's one of the biggest problems. It's a problem across the country, but it's one of the biggest problems in those seats. Some of the seats that have the lowest socioeconomic groupings in this country are National Party seats, and they're where a lot of this problem of predatory lending happens. We see all the time people who have borrowed hundreds of dollars to get themselves out of an immediate problem and then, in a process of multiplying interest rates—incredibly high interest rates—it leads, in some cases, to tens of thousands of dollars due to be paid back, simply for a couple of hundred dollars.


People never get out of that downward spiral, and it's because some of these predators—and I call them 'predators'—feed on the opportunities that they have to exploit people in vulnerable positions. We want to move to regulate that. The government know they ought to be doing it, but the National Party won't let them do it, and the government need to stand up to the National Party.

Senator COLBECK:
  I wasn't hiding, Senator Moore—I was in plain view. As alluded to by Senator Moore, I have been out of this place for a little while. But, when you consider that Senator Marshall has just said he hasn't seen any legislation from the government in relation to this supposedly very important issue, you wonder what he was doing on 23 October last year, when the draft exposure legislation was released by the government.




Senator Chisholm:
  We just want you to pass it! Why won't you pass it?




Senator COLBECK:
  Where was he? He said he hadn't even seen it. He comes into the chamber, expressing such concern about the importance of this issue, and yet he has not even read the exposure draft of legislation that was released by the government last year in response to the inquiry that this government set up into small-amount credit contracts.


This government has taken action in respect of the issue. It's conducted the review. It's received the recommendations. It has responded to the recommendations, as Senator Duniam said before. About the only thing the Labor Party has is some conspiracy about a mythical phantom group that has one member—one member is all we know of. Now, George is a big guy, but he's hardly a group! He's just one person. Just because he's talking about it in the media, it doesn't mean that that's what the rest of us think. We acknowledge that consumers need appropriate protection around this matter. For the opposition to come into this place, complaining about the urgency and the importance of the issue and to then admit that they haven't even seen the exposure draft of the legislation completely puts paid to any semblance of reality about the supposed concerns.


In respect of the government's response to the review on small amount credit contract laws, as Senator Duniam said, the government's response supports retaining existing price caps on contracts, extending protected earnings amount requirements to all consumers and lowering it to 10 per cent of the consumer's net income—and it's a lot higher for some other people in the current circumstances—and introducing a cap on total payments on a consumer release equal to the base price of the good plus four per cent of that price per month. So there are some realistic changes to the way the current process is working, supported by the government: introducing a protected-earnings amount requirement for consumer lease providers of 10 per cent of net income for all consumers, equivalent but separate to the requirements for small-amount credit contracts.


Of course we have released exposure draft legislation. But the opposition claims it hasn't even seen the legislation. I think what we have here this afternoon is little more than a National Party-bashing exercise. That's about what we have: an extension of question time and the events immediately after question time. It is just a National Party-bashing exercise, and the Labor Party has nothing to show for it. It claims that it's concerned about this issue. It puts nothing on the table about that. It talks about development of a private member's bill, yet it hasn't even read the existing piece of exposure legislation that sits there for it to have a look at. What is your perspective on the exposure draft? Do you have a view?


Have you made any comments to the government in respect of the exposure draft that was released on 23 October 2017? What is your perspective? You claim to have real concerns about this matter and yet one of your senators comes into this place today and says that they haven't seen any legislation. 


What rock have you been hiding under? Yes, I've been out of this place, but it's clear that the government has had a clear path of action on this matter over a period of time, and the opposition hasn't made a case in respect of the questions asked in question time. (Time expired)

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:15):  We actually have seen that exposure draft legislation. We picked it up, word for word, and submitted it as a private member's bill, so they'll have an opportunity. They've done nothing. They've become captive to the payday lenders and the shonks out there. That's who they've become captive to. We're going to stand up for these people, so we've submitted a private member's bill. It's up to them to have a vote on it, but we know who they represent.


It has been an extraordinary week for the National Party in this place. We know that they've become captive to the payday lenders. We know that they've become the drivers of the 'Parliamentary Friends of Payday Lenders'. We've also seen in this extraordinary week how divided the coalition is in this place. We saw no better example of that than in the last hour, when the Deputy Prime Minister was under significant pressure. The Nationals did their best to defend him—it was pretty lame—but in the Senate did we see one Liberal stand up and defend him? Not one. This shows you the division between the Liberals and the Nationals when it comes to defending the Deputy Prime Minister.


This division also has consequences for people. The consequences are that people are being ripped off. They are being ripped off because this government won't progress the legislation that is going to crack down on the people doing this unscrupulous work. They try to dismiss the 'Parliamentary Friends of Payday Lenders', but George Christensen put his name to it. He was prepared to say that he was putting pressure on the government to back down. This is the same National Party that represents some of the poorest electorates in the country. I know that, in my own state of Queensland, Wide Bay is represented by a National. It shows you who they are prepared to defend—that is, big business, at the expense of those who can least afford it. We've seen continuing examples of George Christensen, the member for Dawson, dictating policy to the Liberal Party. It is something that is having a direct consequence on people in regional Queensland.


These predatory loan sharks and these shonky rent-to-buy traps have been exposed through the process, but the government is walking away from the reforms. Mums, dads and families have fallen victim to these unscrupulous operators and lenders and to those peddling the mercenary rent-to-buy schemes. That is the side that the Liberals and Nationals have chosen to be on over this week. They are either too distracted by their own internal problems or too paralysed by division—probably a mixture of both—to actually represent the people who need it. 


I give full credit to my good friend the member for Oxley, Milton Dick, and the shadow minister and member for Perth, Tim Hammond, who have put maximum pressure on the government over that this week. This is so important. They've been working with community groups, church groups and other community organisations, to expose why this is actually an urgent proposition. The government's own report found some examples where families were paying over $3,000 for basic household goods that would usually cost just over $345. The response from those opposite is just to turn a blind eye—this isn't an important matter; there is no urgency. 


Other examples include a person on Newstart buying goods valued at $1,550 for $5,668 and being told that the contract they were entering into was for one year; however, it was for two years. Furthermore, the customer thought that they were buying goods, but instead were only renting them. This is the type of behaviour that the government is letting continue. 


Centrelink recipients have been shown to be ripped off by these unscrupulous practices as well. For instance, a freezer with a retail price of $319 cost one recipient over $1,000, with an equivalent interest rate of 372 per cent. One reported case had a consumer getting a loan from a rent-to-buy scheme for $350 to buy a washing machine, and it ended up costing the consumer over $3,500 to pay back because there was no tail end to it.


These are some of the practices that have been exposed through the government processes that led to the draft legislation, yet they continue to sit on it. So Labor will absolutely apply maximum pressure to the Liberals and the Nationals. We want them to deliver this legislation because this cannot continue. The Labor Party will absolutely stand up for those who are vulnerable to loan sharks and this sort of predatory behaviour.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-02-15,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (16:29):  I rise to speak on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 and, of course, this is one of those very, very difficult issues of conscience. Can I say at the outset, before I make some personal remarks, I do want to set out some parameters and indicate that the government does not plan to repeal the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 and has no intention of reconsidering the self-governing acts of the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory at this time.


The Australian government recognises that members of the community have strong views about dying with dignity, compassion and minimal pain. The underlying principle of our investment in health services is quality of life, and this includes, of course, end-of-life care. The Australian government believes that people should have access to quality palliative care and relief from pain and suffering and that, where possible, people should be able to choose the extent of active medical treatment they receive.


The Australian government provides funding for a number of initiatives to encourage delivery of quality palliative care and to improve access to services for people who are dying, including advanced care planning and the documentation of end-of-life care wishes. The Australian government will monitor and consider the impacts of the Victorian voluntary assisted dying legislation on various programs, noting that the Victorian legislation will come into effect from mid-2019.


Euthanasia was unlawful in Australia in all states and territories until the passage of the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017 in Victoria in November 2017. State governments are generally responsible for laws pertaining to voluntary assisted dying and euthanasia. Recently, several states and territories have revisited their voluntary assisted dying and euthanasia laws. On 22 November in Victoria, the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017 passed the upper house, and it passed the lower house on 29 November 2017. As I said, the legislation comes into effect from 19 June 2019.


In New South Wales, the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017 was defeated in the New South Wales Legislative Council on 16 November 2017 by one vote—20 votes to 19—and I'm very pleased, as a senator from New South Wales, that that did happen.


In Western Australia, the parliament has established the Joint Select Committee on End of Life Choices to inquire into the need for laws in Western Australia to allow citizens to make informed decisions about their own end-of-life choices. The committee is due to report by 23 August 2018.


In the ACT, the government established a Legislative Assembly committee to examine end-of-life choices in the ACT. The committee will report its findings to the assembly by the last sitting week of 2018. The Commonwealth euthanasia laws would need to be repealed for the ACT to legislate for voluntary assisted dying. The Commonwealth Euthanasia Laws Act 1997, which inserted limited provisions into the self-government acts of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, prohibits the legislative assemblies of the ACT and the Northern Territory from making laws permitting euthanasia.


The Commonwealth government is carefully considering any possible interaction between the Voluntary Assisted Dying Act 2017, which was recently passed in Victoria, and relevant Commonwealth provisions. We do not, as I said, support the establishment of national voluntary euthanasia laws. We don't propose to repeal those laws, and we have no intention of reconsidering the self-governing acts of the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory at this time.


Under the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Office of Drug Control, there are approved medicines that, in various combinations and in high doses, could be used to effect euthanasia; for example, anaesthetics, painkillers, sedatives and neuromuscular blockers. These medicines would not require specific import for this purpose.


The use of such existing medicines in those combinations would be considered an off-label use—that is, outside the current TGA registered indications for these products. This is not illegal, but off-label use must be in accordance with good medical practice. The Medical Board of Australia is responsible for defining such practice. Preparation of a specific combination of high-dose medicines could—but not necessarily—be carried out by a compounding pharmacist within the state of Victoria. Compounding by a pharmacist for an individual named patient is regulated by state law and not Commonwealth law.


The potential to import specific drugs to facilitate euthanasia rather than using combinations may require the issue of an import licence from the Office of Drug Control if the substance to be imported is otherwise a prohibited substance. There are provisions under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 whereby doctors may obtain access under the special access scheme to unregistered medicines where such use is medically required. The Medical Benefits Schedule does not provide specific benefits for specific euthanasia related services and, at present, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, the PBAC, has not recommended a medicine for listing on the PBS for euthanasia purposes.


I wanted to give these parameters as a preface to our position, but I now want to add, if I can, some personal reflections on this issue. Recently, of course, we had the debate in the Victorian parliament. It was certainly a very emotional debate and it is—as it was in the New South Wales parliament. What was very clear from the Victorian debate was that there was opposition to this. In particular, the Australian Medical Association, Palliative Care Victoria and other organisations opposed it; and, of course, church members and faith leaders also came out against it.


Can I say that the taking of one's life—whether it be a son or a daughter, a brother or a sister, or a mother or a father—is a crime under the Commonwealth legislation and it is a crime under state law. I have spent many, many years involved in voluntary work in the community since the early eighties. At the age of 23, I was a founding board director of a nursing home in the Illawarra. So issues of ageing have been of particular concern to me, especially in culturally and linguistically diverse communities. To have a situation where potentially the sick, the disabled, the mentally ill and the elderly, often at the most vulnerable time in their life and often in circumstances where they cannot make decisions for themselves—to simply say that we can take that life, to me, is from a faith perspective not right. And from a humanity perspective it is not right either. Of course, we know that there are people who do want to push for voluntary assisted dying. I think it is the thin end of the wedge. We know that this has been the subject of consideration by various committees in the past. But I believe there is a silent majority in Australia who do not believe that voluntary assisted dying in our society is a road that we should be going down.


As I said, I have been involved since the early 1980s, and have seen so many different aspects of ageing and aged care. Indeed, I was a shadow minister for ageing. At that time, I had the opportunity to visit about a third of the aged-care facilities in this country. Of course, when you go through an aged-care facility, you often see people there who have no-one or who have only one or two people. One of the things that struck me very much, particularly now as we have so many people who have dementia, was that about two-thirds of the people who are in our nursing homes have dementia. It is one of the most heartbreaking things that I have seen.


There's another side to the whole ageing issue: I used to call it the 'three Gs' when I was the shadow minister. A former minister passed that to me and said, 'This is how I refer to it.' They are the three Gs: grief, because you are grieving—you are putting a loved one in an aged-care facility; guilt, because you feel that you can't look after them and you feel bad; and greed. Regrettably, if we have the situation where we do have euthanasia laws, I think that it is the third of these that could give licence to people who might be persuaded that this is the best thing for their mother, brother, sister or whoever—most especially their mother or father—and, therefore, they are encouraged to euthanase.


My father died a number of years ago through dementia. When I saw what he went through, particularly as an older person from a culturally and linguistically diverse background, it was very difficult. They're really the people in our society that I am particularly concerned about, because often they can't speak English very well. Sorry, this is a little difficult. They really are the people who I feel may be most vulnerable. Therefore, what I think is really important, as we consider these sorts of laws, is to make sure that we have good palliative care available—because, in the end, good palliative care is so important.


It's also very important that we provide support in our residential facilities to enable people to be comfortable at the end of life. Often, many people who have dementia get to a particular point when they say, 'That's it.' I don't know what happens. I know with my own dad that about three months before he passed away, he actually did recognise me, which was really good. My father had been suffering from dementia for about three or four years. And then one day he just suddenly decided that that was it, and he stopped eating. Then a week later he passed away. But my father was fortunate. He had good care; he had a family around him. He had somebody who understood the system and was able to ensure that he had the best of care. But not everybody is in those circumstances.


I know that we as legislators here always want to do the best; we always want to make sure that we put in place the best possible framework and the best possible parameters to assist people. This is an area that gives licence to take away a human life, particularly in certain circumstances; they may be financial or others. Unfortunately, if you do have this available, I think that it is the thin edge of the wedge. I think that it will lead to loss of life—taking life—in those circumstances. As a Christian and as somebody who doesn't believe in taking life like this, I think that it is something that will be very detrimental to our society.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Kitching
):  Thank you for sharing your story, Senator Fierravanti-Wells.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,30,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2018-02-15,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Acting Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (16:45):  I too thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her contribution—both the personal and the broader policy considerations. They are very pertinent.


I might commence by briefly reflecting on some of the background to this matter. I asked colleagues in the chamber earlier today about who still remained in the Senate from when we considered the Andrews bill in 1997. There are four of us: Senator Macdonald, who was in continuation on the last occasion when this matter was being discussed, Senator Carr, me and Senator Abetz. As we reflect on the relatively high turnover of the Senate in recent times, it is interesting to note that there are only four of us who were here in 1997—20 years ago—who still remain.


When I reflect on that discussion—and it is perhaps the last time I dealt with my own views on this issue—it happened in a different context and it was done in a different manner. Earlier this week I made a brief statement in relation to formal business, or housekeeping as we call it, and I'll make a similar reflection now. I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for raising this matter. It's a very important issue, and it certainly warrants senators discussing issues such as this regularly, but I'm not sure that the general business part of our program is the best way to proceed with a bill of this character. It will surprise Senator Leyonhjelm to know when the last occasion the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 was before us. It was as long as 12 months ago. Twelve months ago, 16 February, we had some second reading debate speeches and then nothing further in relation to the debate on this bill.


So last year was the last time, but there have been a few other occasions where this issue has also been raised; however, never with the priority that was accorded this matter when, back with the Andrews bill, the Howard government ceded government business time for that bill to be addressed as part of government business. Indeed, the program for the Senate during the time in which it was debated allowed time for all senators to seriously consider the issues, to inform themselves on the matter, to respond to the public debate on the issue, and, indeed, to form their views. I don't think the piecemeal way in which general business deals with issues, which is in snippets, is the best way for an issue as serious as this to be addressed and to be brought to the fore of the minds of all senators concerned.


Perhaps the other personal reflection I would make, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, still here in the chamber, is that my personal experience didn't really fit your 'three Gs' characterisation. I was very fortunate. I, like you, had all the resources of someone in senior public office. It was ahead of the period when I was the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, but I'm a professionally qualified social worker; I know how to work systems. I could identify the elements that would best assist in the situation, but even I was confounded by the funding arrangements at the time. Of course, for families contemplating putting a family member into aged care, to understand even the basic funding arrangements, to make the financial arrangements to best care for their family member and then to supplement them with all the other known supports that will ensure quality of care is a matter, I think, we're yet to succeed on. Palliative care is the other side to that situation. But, even ahead of palliative care, the transition between acute hospital care and aged care is one where, if someone doesn't have a very proactive family member, it is all too easy for hospital teams to conclude that not much more can be done.


I remember my father, after his first stroke, went into rehabilitation arrangements, and we made a transition back home. I remember the next occasion when he had a stroke and ended up in acute care. The suggestion was that his cognitive capacity, due to dementia, was such that not much more could be done. We ignored that advice. Our government of the day, I think, had established a transitionary rehabilitation program where those things could be measured outside of an acute hospital environment. My father was able to return to one of the joys of older people, which is being able to consume good food rather than live the remainder of his life consuming slush, because he had family members that could advocate and could work within a system to ensure the quality of his care was the best he could receive.


The final point I'd like to make, without going into too much detail—though I probably could—is a credit to Villa Maria. He was placed in a nursing home that was established probably about 15 years prior as what we would regard as best practice. It had dated a little bit by then, and it wasn't the best practice in dementia care as we could consider it at the time. But the care and the preparedness to go above and beyond routines is what that home and that organisation offers a lot of elderly Australians, and I want to pay credit to them.


With that background, let me say that voluntary euthanasia is a serious issue with a profound effect on all in our community. All of us would have a story. Too often it is characterised by simplistic and emotional language and reporting which hampers a reasoned debate, which is part of my reflection on dealing with matters such as this in a piecemeal fashion. My opposition to voluntary euthanasia is twofold: firstly, that it cannot be safely legalised; and, secondly, that euthanasia laws pose profound risks to many people who are ill, vulnerable and/or disabled. I have the deepest sympathy for people in severe pain and distress who are terminally ill and seek relief from their suffering. Palliative care, as I mentioned earlier, is one area we can do much, must better. But I do not believe that euthanasia, where life can be legally extinguished by another human being, is the solution.


Euthanasia advocates argue that society should legalise what already occurs in the medical profession. But I'm not sure that characterises what happens in medicine particularly well, and also I don't think that's sufficient justification to change the law. If doctors are breaking the law when euthanasia is illegal, what realistic constraints are there were it to be legalised? I have grave concerns about the lack of protection for those seeking a lethal injection or assisted suicide. What protection does a person in pain and severe distress, who may ardently believe that they wish to die at the time that they make the request, have?


How is the administration of a lethal dose by a third party a matter of individual rights or liberalism? I think that, too, is a question that needs to be challenged. As politicians we must accept responsibility for the vulnerable and disadvantaged and offer them protection beyond a superficial freedom of choice.


It is argued that the right to die is a matter of individual rights, that it is an individual choice and a matter of personal dignity. I have a different view about what constitutes personal dignity. What the individual wishing to die is asking is to be killed by another party. What is being requested is for the doctor to determine whether a patient will have a worthwhile life. Should we as a society endorse some people's suicides and not others? We must always balance individual rights and the public interest. While many people may wish to have the right to choose the timing of their death and the circumstances, that in itself is not a strong basis for social policy.


Another argument is that doctors, as part of palliative care practice, are presently killing patients by administering pain relievers in doses that are lethal. This goes back to my earlier point about how well characterised existing medical practice is. The point here is that palliative care experts intend to relieve patient pain, not to kill, and that is critical. We need to invest more in good palliative care. A 2015 Victorian Auditor-General report found that, while access to palliative care in the state has improved:


… some metropolitan community palliative care services are struggling to cope with demand …


Indeed, aged-care facilities are also struggling to do this well.


It would be wrong not to look at overseas experience. Legalisation begins with tight restrictions that get expanded over time. The Netherlands was the first country to legalise euthanasia, in 2001; now the age of eligible patients is 12. In Belgium there are no age restrictions. The category of what constitutes an illness is ever-expanding as well, with the Netherlands now considering euthanasia for—I don't know how you would define this—'completed life'. I agree with Senator Leyonhjelm when he said in his second reading speech that this is an issue about all of us; indeed, that is why I believe you must balance individual rights with the public interest.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,30,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-02-15,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:58):  I rise in support of the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. In 1995 the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly enacted this legislation. It passed a law which reflected not only the will of Northern Territorians but also the strongly-held views of the majority of all Australians. It was the first time anywhere in the world that a legislature had authorised voluntary assisted dying. This was compassionate, groundbreaking policy. The Howard government decided to use its constitutional power to run over the Northern Territory assembly's right to make laws affecting Territorians. The Greens rejected that at the time, and we reject the idea that the Commonwealth can use its own constitutional power to change the laws that the federal government of the day disagrees with. It is on that basis that we believe this bill has merit.


This bill is about compassion and the right to end-of-life choices. This bill is about support for the rights of the terminally ill to choose the manner and timing of their death. Let us be clear: we are talking about terminally ill individuals who are experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness. We are talking about adult individuals who wish to receive medical assistance to end their life peacefully at a time of their choosing. There are already so many countries around the world which take a compassionate approach—Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Canada and parts of the USA, just to name a few. In 1995, Territorians voted to take the compassionate approach. It's time they were afforded the self-determination to do that.


Time and time again, we hear of opinion polls which demonstrate that the majority of Australians support voluntary assisted dying. In November last year, Roy Morgan found that 87 per cent of Australians support voluntary assisted dying. This support from voluntary assisted dying cuts across party lines. It cuts across gender and across age.


While the debate has been used by some politicians to divide us, it is quite clear that this is not a divisive issue. Australians support a compassionate approach to end-of-life choices. Having said that, I'm also a strong advocate for palliative care. Any debate around voluntary assisted dying must also acknowledge that, in conjunction with compassion and a compassionate approach to end-of-life choices, we also need a well-resourced palliative care system. We need to ensure that the palliative system is adequately funded, and that it stays that way. But even with the most well-funded palliative care system, Palliative Care Australia has acknowledged that it cannot relieve all pain and suffering, even with optimal care. This is why we need both: a strong palliative care system that delivers services across Australia and regional and rural communities, and access to robust, voluntary assisted dying measures for the terminally ill.


In 1997, Kevin Andrews succeeded in pushing a private member's bill through the parliament. It overturned the first legislation permitting assisted suicide in Australia, enacted in the Northern Territory. Since this time, my Greens colleagues in many states and territories and in this place have been working tirelessly on this issue, as have hundreds of enormously committed volunteers and workers in organisations right across the country. In my home state of Western Australia, the parliament established a joint select committee of the legislative assembly and legislative council to inquire into and report on laws in Western Australia to allow citizens to make informed decisions regarding their own end-of-life choices. I believe that Territorians should have the same right, and I look forward to restoring the rights of the territories. We support this bill.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-02-15,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (17:02):  We've just had three contributions on this matter from colleagues with a great depth of experience, both in this place and on this topic, that I can't hope to mirror, and it is very worthwhile. For me, as someone who has been in this place for five short months, it is good to hear the words of much more experienced colleagues on what is a very difficult policy area. Obviously, it is a matter that has been considered in this parliament and in various state and territory parliaments quite a few times over the years, and we've recently seen a very protracted debate on legislation in this area in Victoria.


As a starting point, though, I would point out that the bill we're currently looking at is not actually about euthanasia; it is more about state and territory rights. The bill is called the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. The explanatory memorandum states:


The purpose of the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 is fourfold.


First, it reduces the extent of Commonwealth interference with the laws of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.


Second, it will encourage competitive federalism—the process whereby each state enacts laws in competition with the others—thereby refining and improving law-making.


Third, it recognises the right of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to legislate for assisted suicide in their respective jurisdictions.


Fourth, it ensures that the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act (NT) is not automatically revivified, allowing the Parliament of the Northern Territory to revisit the issue in a time and manner of its choosing.


As previous speakers have said—and I think it is important to repeat—this is a very sensitive, complex topic; one that engenders a lot of strong community feelings, and one that's been extensively debated in this place. But the issue of territories' rights, in particular, is one that should not merely be viewed through the prism of states' rights.


We do have a Federation, made up of six states and two territories. There is a reason why we have six states and two territories, not six states or eight states. The Federation came into existence on 1 January 1901—inspired by the US constitution, certainly. It was the coming together of the six British colonies seeking their independence from Great Britain, envisaging the benefits of unrestricted trade throughout the Federation and the benefits of a combined armed force, a single currency and a single rate of export excise. But they also wanted to retain certain powers for themselves, not to be usurped by a central government. Those of us who are federalists—and I acknowledge that Senator Leyonhjelm is a federalist—recognise that, over time, these powers have been significantly eroded by successive decisions of the High Court. The powers of the Commonwealth have been significantly expanded through that process, and the areas in which the Commonwealth has taken an active role have been significantly expanded.


However, I don't think we should, through that process, automatically assume that the rights of territories are those of states. As I've stated, legislation has recently been passed in Victoria in the area of euthanasia. That is completely correct, in that it was the right of the Victorian parliament to pass those laws, and of the citizens of Victoria to now live under those laws. However, the territories have a different status. They are a different legal entity under our Constitution, and were never envisaged to have the same rights or responsibilities as the states. I think there is a broader discussion that we should have, Senator Leyonhjelm, about the future of the territories within the Commonwealth and how that should change over time. But I think that is beyond the topic of this bill, and certainly beyond the more narrow issue of discussing euthanasia.


When you're dealing with euthanasia, I think it's very important to recognise that this is a topic that invokes a lot of passion. It's an area where, I think, people's views have changed over time and are probably different at different stages in their lives. I often think about this issue in parallel with the issue of capital punishment. As a younger man, I didn't have any particular moral objection to capital punishment. But, over time, I came to realise that, regardless of my position on capital punishment, the legal system could not be made robust enough for capital punishment to be used within Western societies in a way that would stand any sort of robust examination. We've seen in the US a number of states move away from capital punishment for that reason—because it has been shown that the legal system failed to provide adequate checks and balances to ensure that this ultimate punishment of the state could be used effectively.


And I think this is the problem many have in the area of euthanasia. Regardless of how you feel about the topic itself, can we be certain that we can craft a legal regime that will actually provide adequate protections to people, particularly those in the most vulnerable of circumstances: people with either a diagnosed or an undiagnosed mental illness or people who are in a lot of pain? We heard from previous speakers about the importance of palliative care and the importance of pain management, and I certainly would echo those thoughts. It's an area where I think that, as a society and as a medical profession and a health system, we probably need to look at doing more.


Pain is certainly one of those areas where there is some quite remarkable work being done by researchers. I was meeting in my office during National Science Week with a young researcher who was looking at some very new, highly targeted ways of delivering pain management drugs within the brain. Obviously, technologies like that are very exciting and can potentially be a significant game changer in this area, as we give people who are in very desperate circumstances new options, new opportunities, new ways of dealing with the very serious and confronting problems they face.


This is why it has to always be an underlying principle of any government, and certainly this government, to continue to invest in quality of life through our health systems and, as I said, particularly in palliative care and pain management. People need access to quality palliative care. They need to be able to gain relief from pain and suffering, and, where possible, they should be able to choose the extent of active medical treatment they receive.


Euthanasia has been a matter for state parliaments, and that is—as I stated earlier in terms of the place of federalism in our structures of government—how it should be dealt with. The territories, as I've stated, lie in a slightly different category. I think that we need to ensure that, when we consider these issues, we do so from a holistic viewpoint, not merely based on the idea that we are in some way restoring territories' rights. In my view of federalism, those rights did not exist in the way they are described in this bill in the first place. They were rights that were provided for in the Constitution for the states. The territories are not states, and therefore the rights do not flow in the same way.


The Commonwealth government is carefully considering the interaction between the Voluntary Assisted Dying Act 2017, which was recently passed in Victoria, and relevant Commonwealth provisions. I think that is something that we need, obviously, to keep an eye on. I think that as a parliament and as a government it's important to look at the operation of laws in other jurisdictions. Regardless of where you stand on the issue itself, we now have laws in place in Victoria. We need to monitor those. We need to watch how that is changing the environment for people who perhaps choose to act under those laws. I think we need to keep a watching brief on this topic.


But when this topic does come up in federal parliament at some point in the future, and I suspect it probably will, I think we do need to take a very holistic view of this issue and look at all the interactions of the various legal systems. In the main, I think this should be a matter that we leave to state governments. I don't think that we need to revisit the debates of the late nineties in this area at this point, and I don't think this bill would be the correct manner in which to do it. I seek leave to continue my remarks. 


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-02-15,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (16:29):  I rise to speak on the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 and, of course, this is one of those very, very difficult issues of conscience. Can I say at the outset, before I make some personal remarks, I do want to set out some parameters and indicate that the government does not plan to repeal the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 and has no intention of reconsidering the self-governing acts of the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory at this time.


The Australian government recognises that members of the community have strong views about dying with dignity, compassion and minimal pain. The underlying principle of our investment in health services is quality of life, and this includes, of course, end-of-life care. The Australian government believes that people should have access to quality palliative care and relief from pain and suffering and that, where possible, people should be able to choose the extent of active medical treatment they receive.


The Australian government provides funding for a number of initiatives to encourage delivery of quality palliative care and to improve access to services for people who are dying, including advanced care planning and the documentation of end-of-life care wishes. The Australian government will monitor and consider the impacts of the Victorian voluntary assisted dying legislation on various programs, noting that the Victorian legislation will come into effect from mid-2019.


Euthanasia was unlawful in Australia in all states and territories until the passage of the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017 in Victoria in November 2017. State governments are generally responsible for laws pertaining to voluntary assisted dying and euthanasia. Recently, several states and territories have revisited their voluntary assisted dying and euthanasia laws. On 22 November in Victoria, the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017 passed the upper house, and it passed the lower house on 29 November 2017. As I said, the legislation comes into effect from 19 June 2019.


In New South Wales, the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017 was defeated in the New South Wales Legislative Council on 16 November 2017 by one vote—20 votes to 19—and I'm very pleased, as a senator from New South Wales, that that did happen.


In Western Australia, the parliament has established the Joint Select Committee on End of Life Choices to inquire into the need for laws in Western Australia to allow citizens to make informed decisions about their own end-of-life choices. The committee is due to report by 23 August 2018.


In the ACT, the government established a Legislative Assembly committee to examine end-of-life choices in the ACT. The committee will report its findings to the assembly by the last sitting week of 2018. The Commonwealth euthanasia laws would need to be repealed for the ACT to legislate for voluntary assisted dying. The Commonwealth Euthanasia Laws Act 1997, which inserted limited provisions into the self-government acts of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, prohibits the legislative assemblies of the ACT and the Northern Territory from making laws permitting euthanasia.


The Commonwealth government is carefully considering any possible interaction between the Voluntary Assisted Dying Act 2017, which was recently passed in Victoria, and relevant Commonwealth provisions. We do not, as I said, support the establishment of national voluntary euthanasia laws. We don't propose to repeal those laws, and we have no intention of reconsidering the self-governing acts of the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory at this time.


Under the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Office of Drug Control, there are approved medicines that, in various combinations and in high doses, could be used to effect euthanasia; for example, anaesthetics, painkillers, sedatives and neuromuscular blockers. These medicines would not require specific import for this purpose.


The use of such existing medicines in those combinations would be considered an off-label use—that is, outside the current TGA registered indications for these products. This is not illegal, but off-label use must be in accordance with good medical practice. The Medical Board of Australia is responsible for defining such practice. Preparation of a specific combination of high-dose medicines could—but not necessarily—be carried out by a compounding pharmacist within the state of Victoria. Compounding by a pharmacist for an individual named patient is regulated by state law and not Commonwealth law.


The potential to import specific drugs to facilitate euthanasia rather than using combinations may require the issue of an import licence from the Office of Drug Control if the substance to be imported is otherwise a prohibited substance. There are provisions under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 whereby doctors may obtain access under the special access scheme to unregistered medicines where such use is medically required. The Medical Benefits Schedule does not provide specific benefits for specific euthanasia related services and, at present, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, the PBAC, has not recommended a medicine for listing on the PBS for euthanasia purposes.


I wanted to give these parameters as a preface to our position, but I now want to add, if I can, some personal reflections on this issue. Recently, of course, we had the debate in the Victorian parliament. It was certainly a very emotional debate and it is—as it was in the New South Wales parliament. What was very clear from the Victorian debate was that there was opposition to this. In particular, the Australian Medical Association, Palliative Care Victoria and other organisations opposed it; and, of course, church members and faith leaders also came out against it.


Can I say that the taking of one's life—whether it be a son or a daughter, a brother or a sister, or a mother or a father—is a crime under the Commonwealth legislation and it is a crime under state law. I have spent many, many years involved in voluntary work in the community since the early eighties. At the age of 23, I was a founding board director of a nursing home in the Illawarra. So issues of ageing have been of particular concern to me, especially in culturally and linguistically diverse communities. To have a situation where potentially the sick, the disabled, the mentally ill and the elderly, often at the most vulnerable time in their life and often in circumstances where they cannot make decisions for themselves—to simply say that we can take that life, to me, is from a faith perspective not right. And from a humanity perspective it is not right either. Of course, we know that there are people who do want to push for voluntary assisted dying. I think it is the thin end of the wedge. We know that this has been the subject of consideration by various committees in the past. But I believe there is a silent majority in Australia who do not believe that voluntary assisted dying in our society is a road that we should be going down.


As I said, I have been involved since the early 1980s, and have seen so many different aspects of ageing and aged care. Indeed, I was a shadow minister for ageing. At that time, I had the opportunity to visit about a third of the aged-care facilities in this country. Of course, when you go through an aged-care facility, you often see people there who have no-one or who have only one or two people. One of the things that struck me very much, particularly now as we have so many people who have dementia, was that about two-thirds of the people who are in our nursing homes have dementia. It is one of the most heartbreaking things that I have seen.


There's another side to the whole ageing issue: I used to call it the 'three Gs' when I was the shadow minister. A former minister passed that to me and said, 'This is how I refer to it.' They are the three Gs: grief, because you are grieving—you are putting a loved one in an aged-care facility; guilt, because you feel that you can't look after them and you feel bad; and greed. Regrettably, if we have the situation where we do have euthanasia laws, I think that it is the third of these that could give licence to people who might be persuaded that this is the best thing for their mother, brother, sister or whoever—most especially their mother or father—and, therefore, they are encouraged to euthanase.


My father died a number of years ago through dementia. When I saw what he went through, particularly as an older person from a culturally and linguistically diverse background, it was very difficult. They're really the people in our society that I am particularly concerned about, because often they can't speak English very well. Sorry, this is a little difficult. They really are the people who I feel may be most vulnerable. Therefore, what I think is really important, as we consider these sorts of laws, is to make sure that we have good palliative care available—because, in the end, good palliative care is so important.


It's also very important that we provide support in our residential facilities to enable people to be comfortable at the end of life. Often, many people who have dementia get to a particular point when they say, 'That's it.' I don't know what happens. I know with my own dad that about three months before he passed away, he actually did recognise me, which was really good. My father had been suffering from dementia for about three or four years. And then one day he just suddenly decided that that was it, and he stopped eating. Then a week later he passed away. But my father was fortunate. He had good care; he had a family around him. He had somebody who understood the system and was able to ensure that he had the best of care. But not everybody is in those circumstances.


I know that we as legislators here always want to do the best; we always want to make sure that we put in place the best possible framework and the best possible parameters to assist people. This is an area that gives licence to take away a human life, particularly in certain circumstances; they may be financial or others. Unfortunately, if you do have this available, I think that it is the thin edge of the wedge. I think that it will lead to loss of life—taking life—in those circumstances. As a Christian and as somebody who doesn't believe in taking life like this, I think that it is something that will be very detrimental to our society.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Kitching
):  Thank you for sharing your story, Senator Fierravanti-Wells.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,30,2
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2018-02-15,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Acting Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (16:45):  I too thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her contribution—both the personal and the broader policy considerations. They are very pertinent.


I might commence by briefly reflecting on some of the background to this matter. I asked colleagues in the chamber earlier today about who still remained in the Senate from when we considered the Andrews bill in 1997. There are four of us: Senator Macdonald, who was in continuation on the last occasion when this matter was being discussed, Senator Carr, me and Senator Abetz. As we reflect on the relatively high turnover of the Senate in recent times, it is interesting to note that there are only four of us who were here in 1997—20 years ago—who still remain.


When I reflect on that discussion—and it is perhaps the last time I dealt with my own views on this issue—it happened in a different context and it was done in a different manner. Earlier this week I made a brief statement in relation to formal business, or housekeeping as we call it, and I'll make a similar reflection now. I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for raising this matter. It's a very important issue, and it certainly warrants senators discussing issues such as this regularly, but I'm not sure that the general business part of our program is the best way to proceed with a bill of this character. It will surprise Senator Leyonhjelm to know when the last occasion the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 was before us. It was as long as 12 months ago. Twelve months ago, 16 February, we had some second reading debate speeches and then nothing further in relation to the debate on this bill.


So last year was the last time, but there have been a few other occasions where this issue has also been raised; however, never with the priority that was accorded this matter when, back with the Andrews bill, the Howard government ceded government business time for that bill to be addressed as part of government business. Indeed, the program for the Senate during the time in which it was debated allowed time for all senators to seriously consider the issues, to inform themselves on the matter, to respond to the public debate on the issue, and, indeed, to form their views. I don't think the piecemeal way in which general business deals with issues, which is in snippets, is the best way for an issue as serious as this to be addressed and to be brought to the fore of the minds of all senators concerned.


Perhaps the other personal reflection I would make, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, still here in the chamber, is that my personal experience didn't really fit your 'three Gs' characterisation. I was very fortunate. I, like you, had all the resources of someone in senior public office. It was ahead of the period when I was the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, but I'm a professionally qualified social worker; I know how to work systems. I could identify the elements that would best assist in the situation, but even I was confounded by the funding arrangements at the time. Of course, for families contemplating putting a family member into aged care, to understand even the basic funding arrangements, to make the financial arrangements to best care for their family member and then to supplement them with all the other known supports that will ensure quality of care is a matter, I think, we're yet to succeed on. Palliative care is the other side to that situation. But, even ahead of palliative care, the transition between acute hospital care and aged care is one where, if someone doesn't have a very proactive family member, it is all too easy for hospital teams to conclude that not much more can be done.


I remember my father, after his first stroke, went into rehabilitation arrangements, and we made a transition back home. I remember the next occasion when he had a stroke and ended up in acute care. The suggestion was that his cognitive capacity, due to dementia, was such that not much more could be done. We ignored that advice. Our government of the day, I think, had established a transitionary rehabilitation program where those things could be measured outside of an acute hospital environment. My father was able to return to one of the joys of older people, which is being able to consume good food rather than live the remainder of his life consuming slush, because he had family members that could advocate and could work within a system to ensure the quality of his care was the best he could receive.


The final point I'd like to make, without going into too much detail—though I probably could—is a credit to Villa Maria. He was placed in a nursing home that was established probably about 15 years prior as what we would regard as best practice. It had dated a little bit by then, and it wasn't the best practice in dementia care as we could consider it at the time. But the care and the preparedness to go above and beyond routines is what that home and that organisation offers a lot of elderly Australians, and I want to pay credit to them.


With that background, let me say that voluntary euthanasia is a serious issue with a profound effect on all in our community. All of us would have a story. Too often it is characterised by simplistic and emotional language and reporting which hampers a reasoned debate, which is part of my reflection on dealing with matters such as this in a piecemeal fashion. My opposition to voluntary euthanasia is twofold: firstly, that it cannot be safely legalised; and, secondly, that euthanasia laws pose profound risks to many people who are ill, vulnerable and/or disabled. I have the deepest sympathy for people in severe pain and distress who are terminally ill and seek relief from their suffering. Palliative care, as I mentioned earlier, is one area we can do much, must better. But I do not believe that euthanasia, where life can be legally extinguished by another human being, is the solution.


Euthanasia advocates argue that society should legalise what already occurs in the medical profession. But I'm not sure that characterises what happens in medicine particularly well, and also I don't think that's sufficient justification to change the law. If doctors are breaking the law when euthanasia is illegal, what realistic constraints are there were it to be legalised? I have grave concerns about the lack of protection for those seeking a lethal injection or assisted suicide. What protection does a person in pain and severe distress, who may ardently believe that they wish to die at the time that they make the request, have?


How is the administration of a lethal dose by a third party a matter of individual rights or liberalism? I think that, too, is a question that needs to be challenged. As politicians we must accept responsibility for the vulnerable and disadvantaged and offer them protection beyond a superficial freedom of choice.


It is argued that the right to die is a matter of individual rights, that it is an individual choice and a matter of personal dignity. I have a different view about what constitutes personal dignity. What the individual wishing to die is asking is to be killed by another party. What is being requested is for the doctor to determine whether a patient will have a worthwhile life. Should we as a society endorse some people's suicides and not others? We must always balance individual rights and the public interest. While many people may wish to have the right to choose the timing of their death and the circumstances, that in itself is not a strong basis for social policy.


Another argument is that doctors, as part of palliative care practice, are presently killing patients by administering pain relievers in doses that are lethal. This goes back to my earlier point about how well characterised existing medical practice is. The point here is that palliative care experts intend to relieve patient pain, not to kill, and that is critical. We need to invest more in good palliative care. A 2015 Victorian Auditor-General report found that, while access to palliative care in the state has improved:


… some metropolitan community palliative care services are struggling to cope with demand …


Indeed, aged-care facilities are also struggling to do this well.


It would be wrong not to look at overseas experience. Legalisation begins with tight restrictions that get expanded over time. The Netherlands was the first country to legalise euthanasia, in 2001; now the age of eligible patients is 12. In Belgium there are no age restrictions. The category of what constitutes an illness is ever-expanding as well, with the Netherlands now considering euthanasia for—I don't know how you would define this—'completed life'. I agree with Senator Leyonhjelm when he said in his second reading speech that this is an issue about all of us; indeed, that is why I believe you must balance individual rights with the public interest.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-02-15,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:58):  I rise in support of the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. In 1995 the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly enacted this legislation. It passed a law which reflected not only the will of Northern Territorians but also the strongly-held views of the majority of all Australians. It was the first time anywhere in the world that a legislature had authorised voluntary assisted dying. This was compassionate, groundbreaking policy. The Howard government decided to use its constitutional power to run over the Northern Territory assembly's right to make laws affecting Territorians. The Greens rejected that at the time, and we reject the idea that the Commonwealth can use its own constitutional power to change the laws that the federal government of the day disagrees with. It is on that basis that we believe this bill has merit.


This bill is about compassion and the right to end-of-life choices. This bill is about support for the rights of the terminally ill to choose the manner and timing of their death. Let us be clear: we are talking about terminally ill individuals who are experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness. We are talking about adult individuals who wish to receive medical assistance to end their life peacefully at a time of their choosing. There are already so many countries around the world which take a compassionate approach—Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Canada and parts of the USA, just to name a few. In 1995, Territorians voted to take the compassionate approach. It's time they were afforded the self-determination to do that.


Time and time again, we hear of opinion polls which demonstrate that the majority of Australians support voluntary assisted dying. In November last year, Roy Morgan found that 87 per cent of Australians support voluntary assisted dying. This support from voluntary assisted dying cuts across party lines. It cuts across gender and across age.


While the debate has been used by some politicians to divide us, it is quite clear that this is not a divisive issue. Australians support a compassionate approach to end-of-life choices. Having said that, I'm also a strong advocate for palliative care. Any debate around voluntary assisted dying must also acknowledge that, in conjunction with compassion and a compassionate approach to end-of-life choices, we also need a well-resourced palliative care system. We need to ensure that the palliative system is adequately funded, and that it stays that way. But even with the most well-funded palliative care system, Palliative Care Australia has acknowledged that it cannot relieve all pain and suffering, even with optimal care. This is why we need both: a strong palliative care system that delivers services across Australia and regional and rural communities, and access to robust, voluntary assisted dying measures for the terminally ill.


In 1997, Kevin Andrews succeeded in pushing a private member's bill through the parliament. It overturned the first legislation permitting assisted suicide in Australia, enacted in the Northern Territory. Since this time, my Greens colleagues in many states and territories and in this place have been working tirelessly on this issue, as have hundreds of enormously committed volunteers and workers in organisations right across the country. In my home state of Western Australia, the parliament established a joint select committee of the legislative assembly and legislative council to inquire into and report on laws in Western Australia to allow citizens to make informed decisions regarding their own end-of-life choices. I believe that Territorians should have the same right, and I look forward to restoring the rights of the territories. We support this bill.

Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (17:02):  We've just had three contributions on this matter from colleagues with a great depth of experience, both in this place and on this topic, that I can't hope to mirror, and it is very worthwhile. For me, as someone who has been in this place for five short months, it is good to hear the words of much more experienced colleagues on what is a very difficult policy area. Obviously, it is a matter that has been considered in this parliament and in various state and territory parliaments quite a few times over the years, and we've recently seen a very protracted debate on legislation in this area in Victoria.


As a starting point, though, I would point out that the bill we're currently looking at is not actually about euthanasia; it is more about state and territory rights. The bill is called the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015. The explanatory memorandum states:


The purpose of the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation) Bill 2015 is fourfold.


First, it reduces the extent of Commonwealth interference with the laws of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.


Second, it will encourage competitive federalism—the process whereby each state enacts laws in competition with the others—thereby refining and improving law-making.


Third, it recognises the right of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to legislate for assisted suicide in their respective jurisdictions.


Fourth, it ensures that the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act (NT) is not automatically revivified, allowing the Parliament of the Northern Territory to revisit the issue in a time and manner of its choosing.


As previous speakers have said—and I think it is important to repeat—this is a very sensitive, complex topic; one that engenders a lot of strong community feelings, and one that's been extensively debated in this place. But the issue of territories' rights, in particular, is one that should not merely be viewed through the prism of states' rights.


We do have a Federation, made up of six states and two territories. There is a reason why we have six states and two territories, not six states or eight states. The Federation came into existence on 1 January 1901—inspired by the US constitution, certainly. It was the coming together of the six British colonies seeking their independence from Great Britain, envisaging the benefits of unrestricted trade throughout the Federation and the benefits of a combined armed force, a single currency and a single rate of export excise. But they also wanted to retain certain powers for themselves, not to be usurped by a central government. Those of us who are federalists—and I acknowledge that Senator Leyonhjelm is a federalist—recognise that, over time, these powers have been significantly eroded by successive decisions of the High Court. The powers of the Commonwealth have been significantly expanded through that process, and the areas in which the Commonwealth has taken an active role have been significantly expanded.


However, I don't think we should, through that process, automatically assume that the rights of territories are those of states. As I've stated, legislation has recently been passed in Victoria in the area of euthanasia. That is completely correct, in that it was the right of the Victorian parliament to pass those laws, and of the citizens of Victoria to now live under those laws. However, the territories have a different status. They are a different legal entity under our Constitution, and were never envisaged to have the same rights or responsibilities as the states. I think there is a broader discussion that we should have, Senator Leyonhjelm, about the future of the territories within the Commonwealth and how that should change over time. But I think that is beyond the topic of this bill, and certainly beyond the more narrow issue of discussing euthanasia.


When you're dealing with euthanasia, I think it's very important to recognise that this is a topic that invokes a lot of passion. It's an area where, I think, people's views have changed over time and are probably different at different stages in their lives. I often think about this issue in parallel with the issue of capital punishment. As a younger man, I didn't have any particular moral objection to capital punishment. But, over time, I came to realise that, regardless of my position on capital punishment, the legal system could not be made robust enough for capital punishment to be used within Western societies in a way that would stand any sort of robust examination. We've seen in the US a number of states move away from capital punishment for that reason—because it has been shown that the legal system failed to provide adequate checks and balances to ensure that this ultimate punishment of the state could be used effectively.


And I think this is the problem many have in the area of euthanasia. Regardless of how you feel about the topic itself, can we be certain that we can craft a legal regime that will actually provide adequate protections to people, particularly those in the most vulnerable of circumstances: people with either a diagnosed or an undiagnosed mental illness or people who are in a lot of pain? We heard from previous speakers about the importance of palliative care and the importance of pain management, and I certainly would echo those thoughts. It's an area where I think that, as a society and as a medical profession and a health system, we probably need to look at doing more.


Pain is certainly one of those areas where there is some quite remarkable work being done by researchers. I was meeting in my office during National Science Week with a young researcher who was looking at some very new, highly targeted ways of delivering pain management drugs within the brain. Obviously, technologies like that are very exciting and can potentially be a significant game changer in this area, as we give people who are in very desperate circumstances new options, new opportunities, new ways of dealing with the very serious and confronting problems they face.


This is why it has to always be an underlying principle of any government, and certainly this government, to continue to invest in quality of life through our health systems and, as I said, particularly in palliative care and pain management. People need access to quality palliative care. They need to be able to gain relief from pain and suffering, and, where possible, they should be able to choose the extent of active medical treatment they receive.


Euthanasia has been a matter for state parliaments, and that is—as I stated earlier in terms of the place of federalism in our structures of government—how it should be dealt with. The territories, as I've stated, lie in a slightly different category. I think that we need to ensure that, when we consider these issues, we do so from a holistic viewpoint, not merely based on the idea that we are in some way restoring territories' rights. In my view of federalism, those rights did not exist in the way they are described in this bill in the first place. They were rights that were provided for in the Constitution for the states. The territories are not states, and therefore the rights do not flow in the same way.


The Commonwealth government is carefully considering the interaction between the Voluntary Assisted Dying Act 2017, which was recently passed in Victoria, and relevant Commonwealth provisions. I think that is something that we need, obviously, to keep an eye on. I think that as a parliament and as a government it's important to look at the operation of laws in other jurisdictions. Regardless of where you stand on the issue itself, we now have laws in place in Victoria. We need to monitor those. We need to watch how that is changing the environment for people who perhaps choose to act under those laws. I think we need to keep a watching brief on this topic.


But when this topic does come up in federal parliament at some point in the future, and I suspect it probably will, I think we do need to take a very holistic view of this issue and look at all the interactions of the various legal systems. In the main, I think this should be a matter that we leave to state governments. I don't think that we need to revisit the debates of the late nineties in this area at this point, and I don't think this bill would be the correct manner in which to do it. I seek leave to continue my remarks. 


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2018-02-15,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:15):  I move:


That the Senate—


(a) acknowledges that the $210 million funding cut to South Australian schools and $68 million in Tasmanian schools, in 2018 and 2019, means that schools will face significant cuts; and


(b) calls on the Australian Government to immediately reinstate the funding previously committed to South Australian and Tasmanian schools.


This is a very important motion. Tasmanian families have the right to know where the Turnbull government stands on education, because from what we've seen the Liberals cannot be trusted on schools. Instead of doing dirty secret deals to cut school funding, Prime Minister Turnbull should tell parents and teachers the truth. Does he care about the best quality education for all Australian children? This motion gives him the opportunity to demonstrate that either he cares about students or he has priorities other than the best possible start for our next generation. Government is about priorities and, if the Liberals vote no on this motion, it is clear that their priorities are not with the parents, the teachers or the children of Australia. If the Liberals vote no on this motion, it demonstrates loud and clear to the people of Tasmania that they don't care. To be frank, I think if they cared they wouldn't be cutting $68 million from Tasmanian schools over the 2018 and 2019 school years—$68 million! 


The Turnbull government has cut millions from our schools, and the Tasmanian Liberals have sat by and done nothing. That is $12 million cut from schools in Lyons: $12 million cut from schools such as the Sheffield District High School, the Deloraine High School and the Campbell Town District High School. It is $12 million cut from schools like Beaconsfield Primary School, St Helens District High School and Brighton Primary School, amongst others. 


The Turnbull government has cut millions from our schools and again the Tasmanian Liberals have sat by and done nothing. It represents $12.2 million worth of cuts to schools in Franklin. That is $12.2 million taken from teaching and learning in schools such as Rosny College, Rokeby Primary School and Kingston High School. It is $12.2 million in cuts to schools such as Dover District School, Howrah Primary School and Margate Primary School, amongst many others. 


The Turnbull government has cut millions from our schools, and again the Tasmanian Liberals have sat by and done nothing. In Denison, the Liberals are cutting $14.4 million from schools like Austins Ferry Primary School, Cosgrove High School and Claremont College. It is $14.4 million that teachers will not have for their students' learning at Glenorchy Primary School, Newtown Boys High School, Ogilvie High School for girls and Lenah Valley Primary School, amongst many others. 


The Turnbull government has cut millions from our schools, and the Tasmanian Liberals have sat by and done nothing. It will be $14.7 million from schools in Braddon. That is $14.7 million from schools like Burnie High School, Boat Harbour Primary School and Smithton High School. It is $14.7 million from some of our most remote students at the King Island District High School, Mountain Heights School and Redpa Primary School, amongst others. 


The Turnbull government has cut millions from our schools, and the Tasmanian Liberals have sat by and done nothing. And it will be $14.7 million cut from schools in Bass. That is $14.7 million cut from teaching and learning at schools like Youngtown Primary, Launceston College and Port Dalrymple School. It is $14 million of cuts to schools such as Queechy High School, Scottsdale Primary School and the Bridport Primary School, amongst others.


The Turnbull government has cut millions from our schools and the Tasmanian Liberals have sat by and done nothing across the state of Tasmania. Funding for students with disability will go from $18 million last year to $9.7 million this year. That's a cut of $8.3 million. The cut will hurt our most disadvantaged and vulnerable students—a cut of basically 50 per cent in one year. Whatever did Tasmanian students with a disability do to deserve such cruelty? Whatever did the parents and the loved ones of those students do? It is a typical decision of a Liberal Party that does not care about Tasmanian students, that does not care about Tasmanian families. They just care about cuts, cuts and more cuts.


Prime Minister Turnbull and the Liberals have no vision for students, no compassion for the tireless efforts of our teachers, our teacher aids, our school support workers and our attendants, and no respect for parents. Quite simply, you cannot trust the Liberals with schools, just like you can't trust the Liberals with health, you can't trust the Liberals with biosecurity and you can't trust the Liberals with energy.


A vote for Labor on 3 March is a vote for a majority government that will put people first. Take our education policy. We want to make Tasmania the education state. The policy covers four key areas for success: one, restoring teacher numbers; two, building our education base; three, embedding a culture of lifelong learning; and, four, making education fairer. Working with the Shorten Labor government here in Canberra, a White Labor government will ensure that Tasmania has its fair share of education funding after the cuts by Malcolm Turnbull and his big brother, Mr Tony Abbott.


Across Tasmania, Labor will get teachers into classrooms to not only repair the damage done by the Liberals but exceed that. We're going to restore the damage and do more so that all our children get the best start. A Rebecca White Labor government will put 201 full-time-equivalent teachers into our schools. This comprises 89 new teachers, 40 early learning teachers, 50 teachers back into school communities and 22 early childhood intervention service teachers. A Rebecca White Labor government will invest in an additional 30 full-time-equivalent support staff like school psychologists, speech and language pathologists, occupational therapists and school social workers. This will ensure that the services students need for achieving their best are wrapped around them in a school environment. And Labor will hire 30 full-time-equivalent teacher assistants and administration staff to reduce the pressure on our teachers. It's not just about teacher numbers but how teachers are actually supported at work. That's what makes a difference to our children's education.


Teachers' claims for workers compensation related to stress increased by 60 per cent between 2015-16 and 2016-17. This is not only having an unacceptable impact on staff but is costing the budget around $2 million a year. Labor will establish a working group to improve health and safety outcomes in our schools. It's also about investing in school upgrades and new schools where appropriate. A majority Rebecca White Labor government will also commit $40 million to build a new co-ed public high school in Hobart, $20 million for a new kinder to grade 12 school in Penguin and $22 million for a new kinder to grade 12 school in Sorell. In comparison, the Liberals are at their deceitful best. They have tried to make their funding promise sound better than it is by including money that wouldn't be spent until after 2022—after the next state election. What sort of ridiculous trickery is that?


It's the same time frame as their deceitful promises on a health system that, until last week, the health minister refused to concede was in crisis. Before the last election, the Liberals promised to protect frontline staff—and then, after they were elected, cut two teachers from almost every school in Tasmania.


Labor's election commitment is fully funded over the budget cycle. The Liberals are lost at sea with a policy that doesn't do enough over the next four years. I urge the Senate to pass this motion to support Labor's calls for the Australian government to immediately reinstate the funding previously committed to our schools—because we know that the Tasmanian Liberals won't stand up and fight for our students.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-02-15,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (17:25):  I too stand today to speak on the motion moved by Senator Urquhart in relation to school funding.


Whilst we are talking about schools, can I take this opportunity to put on the record my deep sympathies for the absolute tragedy that happened in Florida while we were sleeping overnight. Seventeen young people lost their lives in a school shooting. I know anybody and everybody in this place who has children will understand the trauma and fear that that strikes to our very hearts when we hear those terrible, terrible stories. Seeing those young children on the television this afternoon, as a mother of a 15-year-old, I can only say it makes me absolutely sick to the stomach that something like this could happen. I'm sure everybody in this chamber will join me in expressing our deepest sympathy and our condolences, and assure everybody who is going through the most extraordinary pain in Florida today, as we speak, that our thoughts are well and truly with them. It is a very, very sad day for the education system in the US. It is a very sad day for a lot of people. It is a very sad day for the world, that this kind of thing continues to happen.


Before us today we have a motion that is asking this place to acknowledge two particular actions. One is in relation to a supposed cut in funding to South Australian schools and to Tasmanian schools, and a call on the government to reinstate this funding. In order for us to be able to support any motion in this place, one would expect that it would have to be based in fact. There seems little point for those on this side of the chamber—or anybody in this chamber for that matter—to come into this place and support something that is factually incorrect. Senator Urquhart and her colleagues know darn well that what they've got before us is not true. They're asking us to acknowledge something that is not based in fact.


I would like to think that the coalition and others in this place would come into this chamber and acknowledge the significant contribution that the Turnbull federal government has made to improving education standards in Australia and to improving education outcomes for our young children, and also, particularly, acknowledge the fact that there has been a significant increase in investment in funding to our schools. If we want to put the facts on the record, the Commonwealth Quality Schools package will deliver recurrent total funding—a record—of $249.8 billion between now and 2027. This year, this is a year-on-year growth for all schools and all sectors. I know those opposite will probably jump in and say, 'But that's a cut on what we promised'. I heard Senator Urquhart say before that all of the promises that they have made are fully funded. I would question whether that is actually accurate, because, according to the budgetary statements and information that I've received, much of the promise that was made in relation to school funding by those opposite wasn't funded. In fact, I think they forgot to fund a couple of the states in their forward program—just minor oversights that we forget to mention when we come into this place and make a contribution.


That other point that's worth making is that the Commonwealth funding will grow faster than broader economic growth, with the total Commonwealth funding growing by approximately 77.1 per cent over the next 10 years. I don't know about you, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I reckon if I put 100 bucks in the bank today and I knew that I was going to get 77 per cent growth over the next 10 years, I would think that was a reasonably good return on my investment. We need to stress that the government spending increases are real and that they are in the budget. This is fundamentally different to the budgeting and the promises that were made by those opposite.


Whilst I absolutely refuse to accept the premise of the motion that's before us, I would say it is not just money that makes for a good education system. Just adding money does not deliver an outcome. We have seen time and again, in myriad different places, that those opposite think that, if you just throw money in and tick a box, it'll all be okay. There is a series of different things we can do in our education and there is a series of different things that Senator Birmingham, as the minister responsible for education, has managed to get legislated so that we can actually provide a much better education system—a much more targeted, child-specific, outcome-driven education system—for our young people here in Australia. For the first time, we're moving towards having greater transparency, greater fairness and greater equity because we have moved to a needs based funding model. I think that that will truly reflect what it is that is going to deliver the best possible outcome for our young people. As you and I both know, Mr Acting Deputy President, there is no greater investment that we can make as a country than the investment in the education of our young people.


Labor's so-called $17.5 billion is only about their own unfunded promises. If those opposite would like to come back in here with a factual motion that talks about the actual behaviour that's happened in the budget, I'm sure those on this side of the chamber would be keen to support the motion put forward by Senator Urquhart, but we're not going to support a motion which is factually incorrect.


I noticed Senator Urquhart went through a number of different schools in Tasmania. Obviously this particular motion has been put before this chamber as an election stunt. You'd think that's what it was, given there's an election currently in progress in Tasmania and the writs are to be issued in South Australia tomorrow night, and this particular motion applies only to education funding in Tasmania and South Australia. Before I move on to my home state of South Australia and put on the record some facts about what's really going on in South Australia, it's important that we put on the record that Commonwealth funding for all schools in Tasmania will grow and will continue to grow year-on-year from $410 million last year up to $602 million in 2027. That is an extra $192 million—I repeat: an extra $192 million—which is a 46.7 per cent increase. Over the next four years there is an average of a 4.9 per cent increase per student for all schools. I don't know which part of that one could possibly suggest was a funding cut. All Tasmanian schools are beneficiaries of the government's faster six-year transition between now and 2023 to the government's schooling resource standard, which adds an extra $22 million over that period and $71 million over the 10-year period to 2027. No Tasmanian independent schools are expected to have their funding reduced under the new funding model as they transition. The Tasmanian Catholic systemic sector receives real funding, with annual per-student growth of five per cent over that same period. So it's a little bit hard for us to take seriously the motion that's before us when the facts actually contradict what has been put forward in this motion.


I also draw to attention that in South Australia exactly the same story exists. South Australian schools are going to be receiving real funding increases, with government schools being the biggest winners. Commonwealth funding to local schools will grow strongly into the future. Unquestionably the first thing I'd suggest is that those opposite may like to avail themselves of the increased funding and better opportunities within our schools, because they might like to learn how to add up. It's very difficult to see how they can possibly suggest that an increase across the board for just about every school, in every sector and for every child can possibly be a funding cut.


But let's now talk about some of the things that are happening in South Australia. I'm really quite surprised that those opposite would want to come into this place and debate a motion about the education system in South Australia when you consider the absolute debacle that is currently unfolding and has been unfolding through 2017 in South Australia, particularly in the relation to the South Australian government's handling of TAFE SA. Over 1,000 students who had undertaken courses in our TAFE colleges were found not to have actually achieved their standards or their certifications, because the courses when audited were found to be inadequate. So that's 1,000 young people who thought they'd graduated from a course, who had paid their money, done their schooling and come out the other end of their course, only to find, because of the inadequacy of the administration of the South Australian TAFE system, that they no longer actually had those. Many of them had to go back to revisit their courses and to redo a lot of their study. This is a tremendously sad indictment of the administration of their education system in South Australia. So, as I say, I find it quite bizarre that those opposite would want to come here and start digging up issues about education in South Australia.


Consider children in custody, while we're on the subject of children. The South Australian government's track record about protecting children in custody is absolutely horrific. To think that these children, some of the most vulnerable children in our society, children who have been through tremendously traumatic circumstances, who are supposedly being put into custody, then find themselves in a situation where they're not being protected; in fact, they are just continuing to be exposed to increased levels of risk—and the South Australian government still has failed to really address the systemic problem in looking after our children.


And then you can bounce to other sectors such as our aged-care sector in South Australia. Once again, the South Australian government has a case to answer in relation to the delivery of appropriate protection of the aged in our society.


Anyway, I digress. What we're talking about here is, I suppose, probably one of the most fundamental issues that happens in this place from day to day, and that is that, if you say something often enough and you say it loud enough and enough people say it, all of a sudden the world thinks it's actually true. We need to put on the record—



Senator Gallacher interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  Those opposite and you, Senator Gallacher, from my home state of South Australia, where I'm sure you're very concerned about the young people who aren't being looked after and our old people who aren't being looked after—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senators, via the chair!




Senator RUSTON:
  But we're really happy about the young children in our schools who are getting extra education opportunities because of the education policies of this government and the funding from this government to our South Australian schools.


But let's be clear about this: you can't come into this place and say lies. You can't come into this place and try and create an impression that something is the case when it's not. I can't tell you a better example than last night. Last night we came in here to debate the water disallowance motion that was put forward by Senator Hanson-Young. Now, if ever I have seen an attempt by somebody to try and create a false impression, a distorted impression, a factually incorrect impression, about what was going on, that was the case last night. You can't come in with motions like we've got here that say that we're having cuts and then try and condemn those opposite, us, for not supporting this motion. You've got to put the facts on the table.


The government are absolutely transparent in everything we do. I am quite happy to come in here, and I'll support any motion that gets put forward by those on the other side as long as it's factually correct. Last night Senator Hanson-Young came in here, and she made some of the most outrageous allegations, particularly outrageous allegations about Minister Littleproud. She was making allegations that were factually incorrect. She came in here and said that his brother-in-law had somehow stolen water. Now, first of all, the person that Senator Hanson-Young was referring to was not Minister Littleproud's brother-in-law. In fact, he was some distant relation of Minister Littleproud's wife. You can't use this place to conflate a story, because we have a very serious responsibility. When people listen to what we're saying, they think we have to tell the truth. They think that we are telling the truth. But when you have a situation where people are prepared to come in here and make outrageous statements, eventually the public start thinking, 'Well, what is the truth?' So then when you come in here and actually tell the truth, nobody believes you. I think there was once a book written about that, Mr Acting Deputy President. Wasn't there a story called Peter and the Wolf,about a little boy who kept saying, 'There's a wolf! There's a wolf!'? There wasn't any wolf—until the day there was a wolf. We just need to be very, very careful that we don't bring this place into a greater level of disrepute by coming in here and telling stories about things that aren't true and creating false impressions, creating 'alternative facts' and 'alternative truths', because eventually it will come back and bite us all on the tail.


Back to our education system: I've got to say, as a South Australian, that I am extraordinarily proud of the changes in our education space that have been made by the government of which I am a member. I am extraordinarily proud of the outcomes that are being delivered on the ground in our home state of South Australia—Senator Gallacher, opposite, is also a member of that community. It is a good news story, a great news story.


I think that as Australians we are, by our very nature, the kind of people who are prepared to give everything a go, but we're also confidence players. By constantly coming into this place, or going out in the media, making false representations, and making things sound bad when they're not bad but are actually quite good, all we serve to do is create a bad feeling in our communities. We create negative vibes in our schools and we make people feel that they're inferior when they're not. I think maybe the time has come that we call this out for exactly what it is: nothing more than blatant political behaviour—in this instance, obviously, so they can go back and spread all this information around the electorates in Tasmania and South Australia. They can make accusations here because they know that the parliamentary privilege that applies in this place means they don't have to tell the truth. They don't have to put on the record the fact that record school funding has been applied to all schools, across all states, across all regions, across all school sectors in Australia under this government.


Senator Birmingham, as the Minister for Education and Training, has delivered not only more money but also a better system so that we have better targeting of our money to our students. It's needs-based. We identify the individual student and we deliver on it. The other really good thing about the reforms that Senator Birmingham brought through this place, and the increased benefits that are being delivered in our education system, is that he has also recognised the huge contribution that comes out of rural and regional centres. He's recognised the fact that those children—who don't live in capital cities—equally need quality education outcomes.


If we want to get into the real election mode of all this and talk about South Australia, Mr Weatherill, the Premier of South Australia, is on the record as saying he doesn't need to worry about doing anything like spending additional money on or providing any additional impetus for rural or regional South Australia because there are no votes out there for him. He's actually on the public record as saying that. We all knew he thought that, and his behaviour has always indicated that, but it takes a special kind of guy to stand in front of the cameras and say, 'I'm not doing anything for rural and regional South Australia because there are no votes out there for me.' I've got to say, it's a very sad indictment of the government in South Australia, a tremendously sad indictment of the government of South Australia, that he would actually say that.


Hopefully, on the night of 17 March we will have a new government in South Australia, and the new Premier of South Australia will be somebody who does care about rural and regional South Australia. A Steven Marshall-led Liberal government will continue to put emphasis on and prioritise rural and regional South Australia. Steven's campaign, Regions Matter, has been really penetrating the regions. They've come up with a Royalties for Regions program so we can recognise that much of the economic activity, the powerhouse of our economy, actually comes from our farmers, who grow our food—farmers who are working along the Murray-Darling Basin, I might add. They are the people who grow our wheat, the people who run the sheep to provide the meat that we eat, and the wool, and the people who grow our vegetables and our fruit. They are the people that Steven Marshall thinks are just as important as the people who live in the Adelaide CBD.


I'm really quite surprised that those opposite would bring this motion into this place and give me the opportunity to tell you about all the really good things that are going on in South Australia. I commend our fantastic education system. I commend Senator Birmingham—a South Australian, I might say—who has delivered a fantastic quality education program for all children in all states of Australia, not just Tasmania and South Australia. We have delivered a great education system. It's fully funded and it has increased funding. The motion before us stands to be condemned. It not just frivolous; it is factually incorrect and misleading. You should be ashamed of it.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-02-15,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:45):  That final contribution is probably where I'd like to start. I rise to support Senator Urquhart's motion before the Senate.



Senator Ruston interjecting—




Senator GALLACHER:
  Senator Ruston, your factional boss, the Honourable Christopher Pyne, said on 21 August 2013 that 'every single school in Australia will receive, dollar for dollar, the same federal funding over the next four years whether there is a Liberal government or a Labor government after 7 September'. It is straightforward: to get elected, particularly in South Australia, he promised exactly the same funding into the future which you're now running away from. Let's look at other contributions from South Australia. On 21 September 2016 former senator Nick Xenophon said: 'Together with my colleagues Senator Stirling Griff, Senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore and Rebekha Sharkie MP, we stand by the full implementation and full funding of Gonski. In particular, we support the current system of indexation and we'll oppose any move to change it.' So, two of the contributors in this debate in South Australia appear to have walked away from their electoral promises and commitments.


But what does all that really mean? Prior to 2011, I wouldn't have been able to contribute in this debate. But as a senator since then I have visited a number of schools, particularly in the electorate of Grey—Roxby Downs, Port Pirie, Coober Pedy, Andamooka, the Pitjantjatjara Lands, Ellerston, Cummins, Port Lincoln, Ceduna and Port Augusta West. Port Augusta West is one of the most disadvantaged schools in the state. Extremely good work is done by those teachers and principals. They are really delivering, and they are combatting some of the extreme examples of disadvantage in our society. Those are the places that are going to get cut. Those are the places that are not going to get the additional funding promised. And it's scandalous. It really is. The total electorate of Giles would suffer diminished funding of $5 million.


What did the kids at the Amata Anangu School in the APY Lands do to deserve lesser facilities, lesser training and lesser services to get them into a functioning economy or to literacy of a high standard? What about the kids in the Andamooka Primary School, the Coober Pedy Area Primary School, the Cowell Area School, the John Ayers School and the Ernabella Anangu School? These are real schools which are combatting rural disadvantage. In the APY Lands we have really significant challenges which we need to address. I think those on the other side understand that, but they made this razor gang decision to cut back on the education spend and put in place a smaller increase. They're putting in place a small increase. They are not going to take on the real challenges that we face. They're not going to fund the real challenges we face in some of these areas. I could go shallow political partisan and say Prince Alfred College, St Peters and Rostrevor, where all their kids go to school, are okay because they charge $25,000 or $30,000 in school fees. But there is real work to do in the public education system. There is real work to do to get kids, particularly those from Indigenous and disadvantaged rural areas, to a higher degree of literacy so that they can get into the economy and contribute. That's what closing the gap is all about. 


In the area of Giles, five and a bit million dollars will be ripped off schools that, in a lot of cases, are dealing with people of real disadvantage. In the electorate of Newland it is $4.2 million. What did the parents and students in that area do to get diminished capacity to get educated and fulfil jobs in the new economies that are coming? In the electorate of Torrens it is $2.1 million. There is more again if you go over the page and look at the electorate of Lee, which is $3 million. Grange Primary School, Hendon Primary School, Seaton High School, Seaton Park Primary School, West Lakes Shore School and Westport Primary School—why did these people have to suffer diminished funding and, therefore, diminished opportunity to participate in an education system delivering for the 21st century?


Let's walk over the road and have a look at the other great institution in education in Australia: the Catholic education system. It's probably not well known, but the first building they built in Australia was a school. They knew what got people into the economy: education. They are absolutely incensed at what this government is doing. They have threatened to campaign against the Treasurer himself if he doesn't restore the parity funding that they were promised. These people are not particularly political in their contributions, but they are very vehement about delivering in their education system. I have visited a number of higher education and primary schools run by the Catholic education people and I've got to say that they are a startlingly good example of what can be achieved. They are not happy with this model. Catholics are warning MPs on school funding. They've said:


The National Catholic Education Commission has warned Coalition MPs they will be targeted if the government doesn't use the 2018 budget to reverse a '$1.1 billion …


I don't think that's an idle threat. I don't think that they come to the argument without really good credentials. You only have to spend a modest amount of time at a Catholic school anywhere in your state or territory to know that these people are committed, that those schools are well run, that those schools are thrifty and that they do educate some of the most disadvantaged people in the community to a very high standard.


So it can't be just: 'The Labor Party are making it up. The Labor Party have been there too long.' All of the concerns coming out are from the true practitioners and stakeholders in the education sector. Senator Birmingham and Senator Ruston have been given the argument: 'We're increasing funding. We're not funding it the same as the full Gonski. Go out there and sell it.' They're doing what their superiors in cabinet tell them to do, but it's not washing.


One of the real great honours that I have is to travel around the electorate of Grey. Having done that for nearly seven years now, I have sorted out a couple of things here and there. People talk quite genuinely and openly about the challenges they face. The challenges they face, particularly with kids from disadvantaged regional parts of South Australia, are immense. There are areas of excellence where people are achieving really good outcomes—and Port Augusta West Primary School is one of those areas. Despite the challenges they face, they are doing really well. Another area is Ceduna. There has been great debate here in this chamber about whether the cashless welfare card is a success or not. We know that school attendance is up in those areas. We also know that, if the kids can get to school and get a reasonable start in their educational life, there's a much greater chance that they will participate genuinely in the workforce.


The Liberals in South Australia have said—it's part of their corflute material and all the rest of it—'We will match Labor dollar for dollar.' It's just that they haven't fulfilled that commitment. The Hon. Christopher Pyne, a consummate politician, has been able to articulate many positions over his very long career. I suppose he'll probably go on for another 10 years shifting shape, shifting positions and managing to weather the respective storms. But I think it is really low of the coalition to say that the ALP in South Australia, the Catholic education system nationally, the Australian Education Union and others are all wrong—that we're actually doing better than what was promised—because it's clearly not the case. The facts are not shared.


Senator Ruston mentioned the TAFE system. I suppose, if you're going to throw an egg, you might as well get one that's rotten and see what you can do! But what was the contribution that Senator Birmingham gave to former Senator Day? It was a $2 million grant without a lot of strings attached—very few strings attached—to train probably about 20 people. When it suited them to do accommodations in here, there seemed to be largesse that was exercised in that particular area. It's a matter of public record that the $2 million grant was given with minimum strings attached and minimum scrutiny, and we're still waiting to see what the outcome of that investment was.


We know that Peter Vaughan, the former CEO of Business SA, chaired the TAFE SA organisation. What I know from talking to people who are actually in that sort of industry is that the failings were more in governance and Australian standard qualitative assessments rather than failure of delivery of professional courses. It's just that there is a whole series of ticks, checks and balances in the qualitative assessment of those courses which may or may not have been followed—we'll soon find out, I suppose. So they are throwing a few red herrings being thrown here and there.


I totally refute the allegation that Premier Weatherill doesn't care about regional South Australia. I have spent a reasonable amount of time there; when we're not in Canberra, I make a point of visiting regional South Australia. He has ministers out there working in this sector, and they are visible. They do make decisions and, from the feedback I get, whilst no-one gets everything they want, things are on the improve. There have been problems in all sectors of the country, I think, in the running of these very ambitious education programs. But to say that he doesn't care about it and there are no votes in it is totally wrong. We hold the electorate of Giles. It is a Labor seat. We have upper house members of the South Australian parliament who get a vote from regional areas.


The South Australia Liberal Party's problem is that it can't win enough seats to find its way into government. You've got a leader over there, Mr Steven Marshall, who at the last election, in front of the TV cameras, exhorted everybody to vote Labor. 'I think a vote for Labor would be in order here'—those were his words, or thereabouts. You've got a hopeless leader. You've got a duplicitous situation about funding. You've got the Hon. Christopher Pyne saying: 'We'll match Labor dollar for dollar. It makes no difference whether it's a Liberal government or a Labor government—this is going forward.' That's what on his corflute; that's what his DL has said. But, when the Liberals got into government, he had to quickly back down. They had to do their razor gang cuts, pull back the estimates and send their people out to sell another argument. It's truly disgraceful.


But, as Senator Ruston said, on 17 March there'll be a choice. People will make that choice. The Labor Party is confident that its position in respect of education is superior. It's superior for this reason: we're on the side of the angels. We're on the side of the people who need a leg-up in the economy. We're not on the side of Prince Alfred College, St Peters and all of those privileged areas where all of the landed gentry and the Liberals go to school. We're on the side of people who go to the Amata Anangu School and the Ernabella Anangu School. We're on the side of those who need to get greater resources into these schools so they can get the education they truly deserve as Australians and go in, compete and get jobs in the economy. That's why we'll be successful; that's why our funding is necessary. Those on the other side would do very well to look at what they promised and assess it against what they delivered. Don't come into the chamber, implying this side of the chamber is playing untruthfully or without— (Time expired)

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (18:00):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Proceeds of Crime Amendment (Proceeds and Other Matters) Bill 2017 will make amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002to further enhance the proceeds of crime regime.


The amendments in the bill will allow proceeds authorities, such as the Australian Federal Police, to restrain and forfeit property where illicit funds are used to make payments on that property. The bill does this by amending key terms in the act, including 'lawfully acquired', 'proceeds', 'instruments', 'improvements' and 'derived from an offence'.


These amendments are necessary as developments in case law have indicated that a person's interest in property is fixed at the moment of initial acquisition, and that any subsequent payments on the property are irrelevant to determining if the property is lawfully acquired or derived from crime.


This loophole could allow organised crime groups to use a web of financial arrangements and asset protection structures to avoid forfeiture of property. For example: criminals may be able to avoid the current proceeds regime by funneling money into ongoing property maintenance and restoration costs, mortgage repayments and improvements.


The existence of this loophole is contrary to the central purpose of the act, which is to undermine the profitability of criminal enterprises.


The amendments in the bill support this central purpose by allowing proceeds authorities to restrain and forfeit property where illicitly obtained money is used to service repayments on loans taken out on the property or fund improvements to the property.


The amendments are designed to function alongside existing provisions in the act which protect individuals who unknowingly acquire proceeds of crime or do so lawfully. These individuals can continue to draw on robust protections which allow them to: exclude their property from forfeiture or restraint, transfer forfeited property back to themselves or obtain compensation for the proportion of the value of the property they obtained lawfully.


This bill demonstrates the government remains committed to making our communities safer by taking effective steps to combat the parasitic effect of serious and organised crime, which is estimated to cost Australia $36 billion every year.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  In accordance with standing order 111, further consideration of this bill is now adjourned to 19 March 2018.

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (18:03):   I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This document is the report from the Human Rights Commission from May last year to the former Attorney-General, then Senator George Brandis about nine Vietnamese men in detention. They were interviewed, making protection visa or refugee claims, back in 2013 by then Department of Immigration and Border Protection officials in the presence of Vietnamese officials. Indeed, some interviews with Vietnamese detainees were conducted by Vietnamese officials.


Hopefully, it doesn't need elaborating to this chamber or to the wider public that there are still very significant human rights problems in Vietnam. I won't detail them here, but there are plenty of them on the public record from relevant agencies, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. It's a very basic standard that when somebody is fleeing persecution and seeking protection from Australia or from another nation because of what they allege to be serious persecution in the country they fled from that officials from that government they fled from not be part of their identity process or their interviews or claims to be heard. It would seem to be pretty self-evident but is clearly not self-evident to the immigration department.


It is worth noting that this report by Gillian Triggs, no longer in the position of President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, made a number of recommendations, some of them consistent with previous recommendations by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, which also investigated the matter. It's pleasing to see that the department—and the minister, I presume—agreed with at least some of those recommendations, including for compensation to be paid to two of those people, although not for the rest. Nonetheless, it provides yet another example—certainly not a standalone or rare case—of poor process and culture in this department.


I speak of this particularly because in my home town of Brisbane I had the privilege of being able to give a short speech at the Lunar New Year Tet festival of the local Vietnamese community in Inala in the south west. The local member, Milton Dick, gave quite a fine speech—short, as they always are at these events. A short speech is a good speech; I have only two minutes left on this one, which is all I need to make the key point. As the local member said, the Vietnamese community in settling in Australia have been amongst the most successful demonstrations of a community fleeing persecution, war and terror, building new lives and contributing massively to the culture, economy, diversity, stability and deeper strength of our modern multicultural nation. But the minds and hearts of the people and their descendants continues, as it does for all of us for many subsequent generations, to be partly back concerned about what happens in the country where they came from. They continue to be concerned about the serious human rights breaches and problems in the totalitarian regime of Vietnam.



I mention that because it is common at such events for politicians and representatives of all stripes to make nice comments about what a great job the Vietnamese community have done and continue to do. It's a good thing for all of us to be able to acknowledge, but it is also a key example of the benefit that comes from welcoming, accepting and supporting people who are fleeing persecution, rather than forcing them back, pushing them away or, in this case, trying to screen out their claim of refugee status—fleeing serious persecution—from even being considered at all. If we had, back in the mid-1970s, taken the approach of screening out and not even listening to people who claimed to be fleeing serious persecution, we would not have a Vietnamese community here at all and would not be able to make these nice speeches and to acknowledge the contributions they have made. That same principle applies here today: let's go back to welcoming people or at least listening to their claims of persecution. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-02-15,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:15):  I would like to take note of item 8, the Finance and Public Administration References Committee report Appropriateness and effectiveness of the objectives, design, implementation and evaluation of the Community Development Program (CDP). The report was tabled out of session at the end of last year. I think this report is a very significant one, and I think it is particularly apt to be talking about it this week, where we had the Closing the Gap report tabled by the Prime Minister on Monday, and on Tuesday we had the 10th anniversary of the apology to the stolen generations. Much was made by the government of some of the progress on some of the targets, but, of course, employment is not one where we are meeting the target.


On CDP, this week the Minister for Indigenous Affairs has been making a lot of all of the programs and has also been trying to say that CDP is a really good program. Well, he must be talking to a different program than the one that we reviewed through this inquiry. The inquiry makes 22 recommendations that go to the issues that we found during the inquiry. We went to a number of communities, where we heard that people did not like the program and that it was not delivering. They found it involved menial tasks. When we were in Kalgoorlie we heard in person from the police superintendent of the Kalgoorlie region, and we heard via teleconference from the superintendent for the Mid West region, who is based in Geraldton. They gave us some really valuable evidence that pointed to their concerns around the impact that CDP had in fact had on Aboriginal communities in the Goldfields area and in the Mid West region of Western Australia. They said that people were complaining that a lot of Aboriginal people were coming into Kalgoorlie and they were homeless. Their evidence was that they think that's related to CDP, because so many people were being breached, for either No Show, No Pay or for eight weeks for noncompliance. They had no sources of income so they were coming into Kalgoorlie to try to find some work or some support. I urge people to read the transcript and look at what the police said.


As I mentioned, the inquiry made a number of recommendations. Recommendation 1 states:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government immediately replace the current CDP compliance and penalty regime with obligations that are no more onerous than those of other income support recipients. CDP participants must have the same legal rights and other responsibilities as other income support participants, taking into account special circumstances such as remote locations and cultural obligations.


This goes to the heart of one of the major problems with CDP—that is, the huge number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are being breached, either for No Show, No Pay or for so-called serious noncompliance. That may be, for example, that somebody has had some cultural business and has had to go to take care of that, and has not been able to get back into town on the day they said they would, because there is no transport. They instantly get a No Show, No Pay, for example. I'll come shortly to that bigger issue of cultural responsibilities not being accommodated for in CDP. What happens is that people are then docked $50. When you are on Newstart, that's a significant amount of money—if it's a No Show, No Pay. That has an instant impact on how you feed yourself and your basic cost of living, and if you're supporting a family that's particularly important. So the rest of the community also then is supporting you. And I had that, again, direct from members of the community.


We were speaking to somebody who is doing research on this just the other day, in fact, and they said that they've calculated that the penalties have taken about $17 million out of communities. That's a significant amount of money that has come out of communities. What those penalties are doing is having a really negative effect on individuals and communities.


But the other point of that recommendation is there are different rules for CDP. Predominantly, it's Aboriginal people who are on CDP. In my belief, it's a discriminatory program because it is treating Aboriginal people differently, and they have much more onerous requirements than if you're on the Work for the Dole scheme that is operating outside remote and regional areas.


The second recommendation was that CDP requirements should be adjusted to ensure that participants are able to meet them for the majority of the time and that they be more closely aligned with the requirements for other income support participants, like those on Work for the Dole or work-like activity. Participants should have the general obligations and benefits of any other worker. As I said, they are treated differently, and the program is discriminatory—again, despite what the minister and the government claim.


Very importantly, we recommended in the committee that the eight-week serious noncompliance penalty should not be applied during the transition period except under exceptional circumstances. We talk about the 'transition period' because the minister's said repeatedly that they're going to be changing CDP—that CDP is going to change, and it's going to change to more of a community wages program, to be more like what CDEP used to be. He made that announcement in Garma—it was very well received, I will say—yet it still hasn't happened. We're now in February, so it's been seven months. It still hasn't happened. When I was asking him about that in estimates towards the end of last year, we had a number of questions and answers around how it's going to work in, how it's operating, the consultation period and the consultation process, which still seems to be going very slowly. When I talked to some Aboriginal people in community recently, they hadn't been involved in any consultation. That's not to say that it hadn't happened elsewhere, but they hadn't been involved in any consultation.


One of the issues here is this. If we are going to community wages, the committee made recommendations about how, whatever the new program looks like, it should make sure that Aboriginal people are working for the minimum wage, because at the moment they certainly aren't working for the minimum wage, and that that should be more of a community-wage-type program, which CDEP used to be. But, of course, if you are supposedly paying people a wage, you can't income-quarantine that wage, so how's it going to work in the communities that have the cashless welfare card, if people are on CDP? The minister admitted that that is something that they are looking at. They're trying to do that, so they're trying to work a way around it. I still haven't heard a satisfactory answer about how you move to genuine community wages if you are going to income-manage it. That is not genuine community wages. So that is a fundamental problem, I think, with where they're going with the transition, and the minister admitted that they are looking at that issue.


Now, that takes me to a very quick point, because I'm about to run out of time. APO NT, the Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory, made to the inquiry a very, very substantive submission that outlined a new way that you could run a community-development-type program that actually met Aboriginal community needs and delivered a minimum-wage-style approach, that had proper training and that had a scaled approach, yet we still haven't seen a response from government to APO NT's position. There are a number of Aboriginal organisations that have given deep thought to this. It has strong support from the broader Aboriginal community, yet we still haven't seen the government's response.


Here is a group of organisations that want to work 'with'. Do you remember the Prime Minister said, 'We don't do; we do with'? Well, here's a perfect opportunity to work with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. They have come up with a plan—a really well thought out, reasoned plan. I urge the government to go back, talk to APO NT, talk to those organisations and start delivering a plan that the Aboriginal community has come up with. I tell you what: you'll get a much better outcome. You won't get Aboriginal communities suffering as they are under CDEP and you'll get outcomes.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

I urge the government to go back, talk to APO NT, talk to those organisations and start delivering a plan that the Aboriginal community has come up with. I tell you what: you'll get a much better outcome. You won't get Aboriginal communities suffering as they are under CDEP and you'll get outcomes.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (18:36):  As many of you know, over the last two days we've seen hundreds of scientists descend upon this building to talk with parliamentarians and each other about their projects, ideas and collaborations as part of the 19th annual Science meets Parliament event. The two days have been filled with activities and meetings, which demonstrate to us in this building the importance of science, research and development to jobs in a growing economy.


I had the pleasure of attending a number of the events, including the Superstars of STEM roundtable breakfast at Questacon earlier this week. I met 11 women who have been part of a program to promote and support women in STEM. I learnt a lot from Dr Rebecca Johnson, the director of the Australian Museum Research Institute, whose work in wildlife forensics uses genome science to improve conservation efforts of Australia's endangered species. I'd also like to take this opportunity to congratulate all of the Superstars of STEM: Dr Sanam Mustafa, Dr Jodie Ward, Dr Pallave Dasari, Dr Rebecca Johnson, Dr Sue Keay, Dr Caroline Ford, Dr Tien Huynh, Dr Fiona Kerslake, Dr Tamara Keeley, Dr Jillian Kenny and Dr Lisa Mielke.


Like many other parliamentarians, I also had the opportunity to welcome some of the Science meets Parliament delegates into my office for a meeting, where I was able to learn about their work and give them the opportunity to ask me how the government can help. I met Dr Kate Grarock, a local Canberra Sanctuary ecologist who works at Mulligans Flat in Canberra's north. She has been instrumental in restoring some of the critically endangered grassy woodlands in the region, including by reintroducing local extinct species. It was great to learn more about her work after I had the opportunity to visit Mulligans Flat with the then Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, a couple of years ago to witness the reintroduction of one such species—the eastern bettong.


I also learnt a lot from Dr Keith Barnard, a research group leader with CSIRO, who is involved with the minerals resources processing program. Keith has been doing great work in changing the way CSIRO engages with industry, particularly the mining industry, so that there is more of a partnership between science and industry when it comes to getting the most from our abundant mineral resources.


If any of you watched SBS's Catalyst program during the week, you'll have already learnt of Associate Professor Alan Duffy's work in astrophysics. I was grateful to hear more of his work as the lead scientist at the Royal Institution of Australia. He is at the cutting end of understanding how galaxies, like the Milky Way, form and is pioneering research into dark matter, with the soon to be launched dark matter detector called SABRE.


Finally, Claire Edmunds is a PhD candidate at the Australian Institute of Physics. She is working on one of the big scientific issues of the day—quantum computing. Claire is based at the Sydney Nano Institute, which I visited earlier this year. She uses charged atoms to demonstrate and develop quantum control techniques.


There is no substitute for hearing directly from the people at the coalface of scientific endeavour, and I was grateful for the opportunity to meet with Kate, Keith, Alan and Claire and hear about the great work they are doing to increase Australia's knowledge, expertise and innovative culture. There were, of course, hundreds more scientists who descended on parliament this week, and they have equally compelling stories to tell. Science meets Parliament was once again a great success, and I hope all parliamentarians take every chance they get to engage with their local scientific community.


This week we also witnessed an outstanding maiden speech from Senator Jim Molan. It was great to hear some of his insights from his 40 years of distinguished service in the military and some of the work he has done since leaving the military, including on Operation Sovereign Borders. I would again make the point that we saw disgraceful attacks on him from the Greens and, indeed, some in the Labor Party such as Senator Cameron. I reject those attacks, and I think most Australians reject those attacks absolutely and completely.


We also saw another maiden speech this week—in the ACT assembly. I would like to pay tribute to and congratulate Candice Burch, the newest Liberal member of the ACT Legislative Assembly. Candice comes in on a casual vacancy caused by the very sad death of the Steve Doszpot, which I spoke about in this place before Christmas. Steve will, of course, be greatly missed. Candice is an outstanding young parliamentarian. In fact, Candice coming into the ACT assembly means that the Liberal opposition, which holds 11 of the 25 seats in the ACT assembly, now for the very first time has a majority of women—six women out of 11. I think it is worth acknowledging that milestone. The Labor Party in the ACT also, I believe, has a majority. But the milestone that has been achieved by the Liberal Party in the ACT, with six outstanding women and five outstanding men, has been achieved without quotas. If I were to reflect on it, I would say it has come about because of a culture that has enabled people to be their best—be they men or women.


Looking at the diversity of those women and men, they represent multicultural diversity in Australia and the ACT. We have people like Elizabeth Lee, who has a Korean background. Candice Burch came from South Africa. Giulia Jones has an Italian background and Elizabeth Kickert has a Pacific Islander background. It is a really diverse and capable team. I think it is worth paying tribute to them.


In particular, I pay tribute to Candice on her maiden speech, which I thought was outstanding. She spoke about her family's journey. She spoke about her work as a Commonwealth public servant in the Department of Finance. She has an economics background and I think she'll be a great addition to the team in terms of her knowledge of the economy and finance. Also, she spoke very passionately about freedom and the values that led her to join the Liberal Party, stand for election and, in sad circumstances, come in on a countback and have the opportunity to serve the people of the ACT and the people of the Kurrajong electorate. For those from other places, Kurrajong is in the inner north and inner south of Canberra. Where we are sitting right now is in the inner south of Canberra. Just on the other side of the lake, on the other side of the city, is the inner north, which is the other part of the electorate of Kurrajong. So Candice is representing the inner north and the inner South, along with Elizabeth Lee, the other Liberal who represents the seat.


Candice spoke very passionately about what she wants to do for her electorate. She spoke about the great freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise. These freedoms are foundational to the Liberal Party and they are foundational, I believe, to Western democracy—the idea that, with only the smallest of limits, people should be free to say what they like, free to sometimes say things that might offend other people, free to practice their faith, free to believe in whatever god they want or to not believe in God, free to express those religious views and free to live that faith in action, which is a great thing. Freedom of enterprise is about the ability to go about your life without having the government interfere in a burdensome way—to be able to go out there and start a business, to be able to employ people, to be able to be innovative and not have the government hold you back. These are foundational. People can do this. People have the opportunity to speak freely, to worship freely and to look after themselves and their family by earning a living, working hard and starting a business. Then, of course, there are things like freedom of association—the ability to join a union or not join a union and to be part of an organisation or not part of an organisation. If we protect these freedoms and these values, our nation will continue to be a wonderful place for decades and centuries into the future.


These are things that are foundational to the Liberal Party. I'm really pleased that we have a new member of the ACT Legislative Assembly who stands for those values and will stand up for those freedoms—sometimes when it's unpopular—and she'll do it as part of a really great team led by Alistair Coe, the Leader of the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition, who is taking it to the ACT Labor-Greens government. But she'll do it as part of a team of which, for the first time, the majority are women. It has been achieved because of a culture that has enabled great women to put their hands up to have those opportunities to put themselves to the electorate, and the electorate has responded. I congratulate Candice and the entire team.
