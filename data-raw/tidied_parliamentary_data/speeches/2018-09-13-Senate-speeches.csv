Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:32):  I've not had a lot of time to look at the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018. I understand they have been brought on in a bit of a rush. Clearly the government is a bit short of business again, so I'll give this lengthy consideration. It is a tragedy to see the once-great Liberal Party descend to this level of chaos and indecision so soon after they thought they'd sorted out all their problems. But they were able to find this somewhere deep in the barrel. They ducked in and produced some legislation that they had to get exempted from the cut-off to allow it to proceed. This is not controversial legislation. It's a straightforward matter. I guess you'll have to dig a lot deeper to get to the next piece of legislation. This will not take a long period of time, I expect, because Labor supports the bills.


As much of this legislation goes to development measures as it does to customs and trade matters. These measures amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to implement the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus, known as PACER Plus. Australia, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu signed this agreement last year. The agreement is a comprehensive regional economic integration agreement, consistent with World Trade Organization rules. It covers a range of goods and services, investment and established rules and commitment between the various parties to the agreement. 


The agreement also, as the bill outlines, includes an aid component to help with the development of the region. Under the agreement, tariffs will be cut on 88.5 per cent of Australian exports to signatory countries, apart from New Zealand. It also means that there will be no tariffs on goods imported from signatory countries to Australia, apart from New Zealand. Under the agreement, we will also provide some $4 million to assist Pacific island nations to prepare to ratify this agreement and $19 million for them to update their customs processes. That, of course, does not even begin to compensate for the $11 billion this government has cut from the aid budget. There's a bit of irony that we should be debating bills that provide $4 million when some $11 billion has been cut from the budget.


The agreement has been scrutinised by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which has recommended that the agreement include an independent economic analysis of the merits of this agreement. That's a proposition that this chamber should fully endorse. The JSCOT has made the same recommendation for other trade bills, including some of the more contentious legislation that is to come before the chamber. The Labor Party will have more to say on this matter when those bills are introduced, but I give notice that a future Labor government will ensure that all future trade agreements are subject to independent economic analysis.


These bills provide for 'free' rates of customs duty, which, when enacted, will mean that a new schedule will be provided for excise-equivalent rates of duty on certain alcohol, tobacco and fuel products in accordance with this agreement. The amendments provide for certain concessional items listed under the Customs Tariff Act to maintain customs duty rates in line with the applicable concession items and in accordance with the agreement. Complementary amendments will be made to the Customs Act by the customs amendment bill to introduce new rules of origin for goods imported into Australia from parties to the agreement. The bill provides that these new rules will determine what eligible goods would be subject to preferential treatment of customs duty in accordance with the agreement. The bill contains no matters which we would regard as being contentious, and it is surprising that it is not being considered in the non-controversial bills section of our normal business. The Labor Party is pleased to support it.


I had a look at the details of some of the measures that have taken my interest in regard to Niue. It is a country of some importance, as the ABC told us in a recent story. Niue is a country with a population of about 1,800. I'm told that about 80 per cent of them are actually from New Zealand and that many of them participate in sporting clubs in New Zealand. Of particular note was the appearance of a mallard duck in Niue. People can't quite work out where it's come from. The ABC has given us very good coverage of the issue; there is a lot of news generated in the Pacific these days from the ABC. The duck even has a name—Trevor—and is said to have come from New Zealand. It's described as a major problem, because there are no wetlands and no ponds on Niue, so the fire brigade has to provide the necessary water conditions for Trevor the mallard duck. I understand that it's named Trevor after the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. It's said to be a very miserable duck, because it is so lonely. Unfortunately, there are no other ducks on Niue, so it has no partners. We're looking forward to seeing what other biosecurity issues have arisen as a result of this matter and whether or not this agreement will cover these questions in the future.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:38):  I rise to add the Greens contribution to this PACER Plus legislation. The Greens remain concerned about the power imbalances in PACER Plus negotiations. We've been concerned for quite some time that Australia and New Zealand have used their big-brother, or big-sister, influence in the region to a point where they have disenfranchised some of the smaller nations in our region and undermined their genuine ability to participate.


We know, of course, that Papua New Guinea and Fiji, the two largest Pacific island nation economies, are notably absent from this deal, and that Vanuatu and Tonga have at various times withdrawn from the process. We've been concerned that in a modern world such as this, where Australia has a responsibility to help those in our region who aren't as big, don't have democracies that are as stable and aren't able to sustain themselves economically in the way Australia is able to, we have in fact stood over them in these negotiations. We are concerned that that is now being reflected in the PACER Plus arrangement that we're debating today.


The refusal of Papua New Guinea and Fiji to sign the agreement is significant, because they represent 80 per cent of the combined GDP of Pacific island countries. If 80 per cent of the economies are not even represented in this deal, you've got to ask yourself why—why is Australia pursuing this in this manner? It raises the question of whether small Pacific nations felt unfairly pressured by Australia and New Zealand to enter the agreement. Anecdotally, of course, we have heard from representatives of these island nations that, yes, they did indeed feel put upon by Australia and New Zealand and felt the pressure immensely.


The primary impact of PACER Plus is to decrease tariffs on Australian and New Zealand exports to these Pacific countries. It's very clear that, as the big nations, we are getting the best deal out of this. Some would say that's fine, except that we live in a neighbourhood and we have a responsibility, as the wealthiest nation, the largest economy in the region, to play better and be a bit fairer in this. We know that this disproportionate pact, which benefits Australia and New Zealand, could easily just be agreed to. But what does that mean and what signal does that send to countries in the rest of the region, particularly the smaller ones, who feel they had to agree or are going to be resentful, going forward, of this and the attitude that's been presented by Australia?


Proposals by Australia and New Zealand to introduce or increase consumption taxes to offset tariff cuts will not provide adequate compensation for revenue loss. Studies have demonstrated that replacing tariffs with consumption taxes in developing nations only compensates for 30 per cent of lost revenue. Countries in the Pacific region are increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and it's extraordinary that this deal does nothing to address the real-life impact on these countries of rising sea levels and the other impacts of climate change. We know that, despite a growing urgency to support Pacific island countries to combat climate change, this declaration does zilch. Despite the government signing a declaration just weeks ago identifying climate change as the greatest single threat to Pacific peoples, PACER Plus does not even include proper environmental protection measures. It's a case of 'Look over here while we do something else'; of refusing to tackle what will be, beyond any doubt, the biggest impact into the future for our Pacific island neighbours. We know that climate change needs to be tackled and we know that they need help in dealing with that, yet Australia continues to just turn the other cheek. It's not good enough at all.


Tariff cuts will disproportionately affect women in the Pacific region. Women in Pacific communities are largely employed in the industries that will be affected most by these tariff cuts, such as clothing manufacturing and small-scale agriculture. We hear a lot in this place from various NGOs and community based organisations about what Australia can do to show leadership in the region in relation to empowering women, giving them a voice and giving them independence and the ability to be economically sustainable.


This deal, because of its nature, and because it has been managed quite heavy-handedly from the Australian perspective, is going to impact on our sisters in the Pacific region and those Pacific Islands disproportionately. I think this place needs to consider that when looking at this legislation. The last thing we want is women in the Pacific to be even more disadvantaged just because Australia wanted to squeeze more money out of our poor neighbours and our poor cousins throughout the Pacific. It's not good enough. We should be doing more to support women in the Pacific, not simply allowing this to go through and think it doesn't have an effect. When we talk about clothing manufacturing or small-scale agriculture, we should be doing much more to help these women and their families and communities to become self-sustaining and economically robust. This does the exact opposite. This rips the carpet out from beneath them. It will have dire impacts on these women unless we do something to fix it.


The Greens, as I've said, remain very concerned about this. We won't be supporting it. We wish that the government would have been a little more considerate of the desires and concerns raised by our Pacific island neighbours. The fact that climate change isn't in here and the fact that it disproportionately impacts on the poorest women in our region are enough for me to say that this isn't something that Australia should be pursuing.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (09:46):  I'm very pleased to speak in support of the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018. The key theme of these bills is to promote an open Pacific economic integration and to advance development in the Pacific. PACER Plus is a unique framework and an important part of our trade agenda in the region. The Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations, PACER Plus, is a unique framework because it is both a development centred agreement plus a regional free trade agreement. The agreement includes a substantial development assistance package of $7.7 million to help countries to prepare to ratify the agreement, and a further $25 million in the implementation assistance after entry into force.


But I cannot go beyond making some observations in relation to what Senator Hanson-Young just said. It demonstrates, yet again, the Greens total lack of understanding and a patronising attitude in relation to our neighbours. On the issue of women, clearly, Senator Hanson-Young, you are not aware that the negotiations for PACER Plus commenced in 2009 and they concluded in Brisbane in April 2017. They have been worked through assiduously with our Pacific island neighbours. PACER Plus opened for signature in June 2017, and, to date, has been signed by 11 countries: Australia, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. I have to say that your patronising comments in relation to these countries demonstrate, yet again, your total lack of understanding of what is happening in our neighbourhood.


On the issue of women, we have had a very successful program of Pacific women shaping Pacific development. It's been a $320 million project over 10 years and has brought considerable benefits to our Pacific island sisters. On the issue of climate change, as part of the $1 billion commitment that Australia gave as part of its commitment to the Paris agreement, $300 million over four years is for building Pacific resilience and addressing climate issues in the Pacific. That's in addition to the $200 million that went to the Green Climate Fund. So, Senator Hanson-Young, before you come in here and pontificate on matters that you know absolutely nothing about, why don't you go and check your facts before you are critical about these issues?


Let me get back to PACER Plus. PACER Plus will help drive economic prosperity and raise living standards in our region. Our foreign policy white paper points out that being open to trade and investment creates wealth and supports higher living standards. A strong rules based liberalised international trading system is in the interests of all countries, including providing opportunities for developing countries to engage more in international trade. Perhaps those opposite haven't looked, but some Pacific island countries are in the process of moving towards graduation in relation to their economic status. It is important that Australia be amongst the first countries to ratify the agreement, as early ratification would signal our clear commitment not just to PACER Plus but to this important rules based trade in the Indo-Pacific region.


PACER Plus will deliver modest economic and commercial benefits to Australia, and I'm sure that the minister will elaborate on some of these benefits to Australia—modest though they are, commensurate with the size of participating Pacific island economies. In particular Australian producers of goods, suppliers of services and investors will benefit from more liberal and secure market access in the Pacific. By promoting growth and development, and strengthening reform processes in the Pacific, PACER Plus will expand commercial opportunities for Australian countries in the region to trade with their Pacific neighbours. Pacific island countries will have eliminated tariffs on the vast majority, 91.5 per cent, of their tariff lines, covering the bulk, 88.5 per cent, of Australia's exports. Based on 2016 data this represents a total value of $360 million when PACER Plus is fully implemented.


Australia's largest services exports to the Pacific are tourism and travel services, transport services and financial services, including insurance. Our Pacific island country signatories have made commitments in each of these sectors, many for the first time. Australian service suppliers will benefit for the first time from commitments from non-WTO members such as the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue and Tuvalu. The 'most favoured nation' provisions in the agreement will help safeguard access for Australian producers of goods, suppliers of services and investors in the event that Pacific island countries apply more favourable treatment for the producers, suppliers and investors of nonparties, such as under free trade agreements.


Our foreign policy white paper identified the following:


Economic integration within the region and with Australia and New Zealand is vital to the economic prospects of the Pacific. Growth is constrained for most countries because of a combination of remoteness from markets, limited land and resource bases, the dispersal of people over many islands and environmental fragility.


The underlying impetus for negotiating PACER Plus and its goals of regional economic integration align with the narrative in our foreign policy white paper. The formation of an interconnected Pacific market which includes Australia and New Zealand will enable Pacific island countries to create a larger market not only for its consumers but also for its producers.


PACER Plus will not only cover trade in goods but also extend to trade in services, in investment, in labour mobility and in development assistance. For many countries in our region this will be the first WTO-compliant free trade agreement. When in force it will stand as a valuable example of the region's collective effort to work together towards greater economic integration. By establishing a common framework through which to transact each element of the participating country's economic relationships, PACER Plus supports the long-term economic development of Pacific island countries through closer integration with Australia and New Zealand, with each other and with the global economy. We recognise that it is important that, for trade to thrive, trade liberalisation has to be accompanied by a supportive policy environment, and that includes sound economic management, reforms and effective service delivery. We have committed to assist our Pacific island neighbours with transition, and we've taken careful consideration of issues like implementation time lines.


The region continues to experience significant economic, social and environmental challenges, and, having been minister from February 2016 until recently, I saw this firsthand. I had the opportunity to visit many parts of the Pacific. Indeed, I made over 35 trips to the Pacific during this time, and I saw for myself that distance and weak infrastructure make international trade expensive, but small domestic markets and narrow production bases mean that countries rely on it for income and consumption. And whilst the agreement provides a regional framework for trade and economic integration, dedicated assistance to each of these countries will be vital to address the barriers that those countries are facing and, of course, to unlock the potential of the Pacific and its ability to partake in the benefits.


An important component of this is the readiness package. We and New Zealand have provided assistance for readiness activities. To help signatories, we are supporting processes like legislative drafting to assist the signatories to review and update their relevant national laws and regulation as well as customs modernisation, harmonisation, implementation of up-to-date tariff codes and transposition of schedules so that each signatory will be able to implement the latest version of the internationally recognised system known as the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. There will be training on notification requirements, including helping governments and private sectors in those Pacific island countries to meet the obligations around transparency. There will be funding for public outreach and stakeholder engagement, and there will also be revenue planning and mitigation to help signatories manage any impact on government revenues associated with tariff reductions. There's also a PACER Plus implementation package. Upon entry into force, Australia and New Zealand will provide a further funding package of $19 million and NZ$7 million respectively over five years, and this will focus on rules of origin and the implementation of those tariff commitments; customs; sanitary and phytosanitary measures; technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment; trade in services; and investment.


One of the key advantages of PACER Plus—and I have had many conversations with different Pacific island country stakeholders, ministers and the private sector—is that, in short, if Pacific island countries get their biosecurity systems up to a level at which they can export to Australia and New Zealand, then they can export to any other country around the world. Therefore, this is a very, very good thing for the Pacific. This is one of the key features that they have been asking us for, and that's why PACER Plus is so important.


One of the other components of development assistance, particularly in the Pacific, has been our Aid for Trade program. As part of PACER Plus, Australia remains committed to our Aid for Trade funding target of 20 per cent of our overseas development assistance budget in the Pacific. This target, of course, will complement the party's own trade related initiatives as Pacific island countries seek to increase growth, generate jobs and increase living standards for their people. Let me share some examples with the Senate of how this is being done. It's being done through agriculture export development. The Pacific Horticultural and Agricultural Market Access Program, PHAMA, helps Pacific exporters meet quarantine standards and other market access requirements of trading partners. It's being done through trade facilitation, export promotion and investment. We have increased funding to the Oceania Customs Organisation to help strengthen Pacific customs administrations, and we will continue our longstanding support for Pacific Trade Invest which provides high-quality export facilitation, investment and tourism promotion services across the region.


A separate non-binding arrangement on labour mobility has also been signed by Australia, New Zealand and Pacific island signatories to PACER Plus. Our new Pacific labour scheme will allow workers from the Pacific to take up non-seasonal low-skilled and semiskilled work in rural and regional Australia in growth sectors such as tourism and hospitality, disability and aged care, and non-seasonal agriculture. Why? Because it's about capacity building. It's about developing and affording opportunities to our Pacific island neighbours and people there to develop their skills, to come to Australia, to work in Australia and then to take those skills back into the Pacific, which is vitally important for their own economic development.


This, of course, is in parallel with our Seasonal Worker Program. Our Seasonal Worker Program will be streamlined to give more Australian employers access to a reliable, seasonal workforce drawn from the Pacific and Timor-Leste. We know how successful the Seasonal Worker Program has been for our Pacific island neighbours. Since its inception, about 12,000 or 13,000 Pacific island workers have come to Australia, and they often take back to their countries net gains of $5,000 or $6,000, which has enabled families to send their children to school, buy their own homes and do those things that are very important: to pay for their education, to set up businesses, and to build houses and community facilities. Of course, we will continue to work on all the outstanding partners to the agreement, because we consider that the benefits for Pacific economies outweigh any potential costs. I know that those discussions are ongoing, and I'm sure the minister will elaborate on how those are progressing.


Whilst PACER Plus will reduce government tariff revenue, it includes lengthy implementation schedules. The first tariff reductions are not required until 10 years after the agreement enters into force, and they are then phased in over the following 25 years. This means that all of the tariff reductions will not be fully implemented until 2053 at the earliest. That well and truly will enable Pacific island countries to take the implementation of this agreement at their own pace and implement it fully within their own economic systems.


The agreement underscores the role of open trade and investment in enabling economic development and rising living standards across our region. The agreement will cover an additional 1.5 million people who are not presently captured under Australia's existing FTAs. Whilst the commercial value of the trade with Pacific island countries is modest, this agreement will lay the foundations for its future growth. In 2015, Australia's goods and services two-way trade with participating Pacific countries totalled $1.2 billion of our total trade.


As I have said, PACER Plus is an unique agreement, because it is both a trade and a development agreement. It has the potential to shape and reshape the economic fundamentals of the Pacific region by creating new opportunities for trade and investment in our neighbourhood. Overall, we will see simplification and enhancing of regional trade, and also, of course, we will help Pacific island countries grow their economies by accessing international markets. It will facilitate greater integration of Pacific island economies into the global rules-based trading system and, of course, reshape the economic fundamentals of the Pacific region, creating new opportunities for trade and investment that will drive economic growth and, as I have said, raise living standards. It will also help Pacific island countries modernise their economies. For example, we will be able to assist Pacific island countries to modernise their customs and tax systems in preparation for implementation of PACER Plus. Our assistance will help build capacity in trade promotion, in investment facilitation, in biosecurity, and in micro, small and medium enterprises. The region has been slow to implement structural reform, and more needs to be done to integrate business environments and promote intraregional trade and investment. This is a great opportunity to promote reform, and it will provide an important impetus for change.


PACER Plus is also designed to remain open to the participation of nonparties, including Fiji and PNG. The agreement will be beneficial for all Pacific island countries, including Fiji and Papua New Guinea, if and when they decide to become parties. And I know that those discussions are ongoing. I, myself, was part of those discussions as minister. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties noted that the absence of Fiji and PNG from PACER Plus may impact the scope of PACER Plus, but it also noted that, due to the long time frame over which PACER Plus will be implemented, there is sufficient opportunity for these countries to join the agreement if satisfactory conditions can be negotiated.


French Polynesia and New Caledonia, having now become full members of the Pacific Islands Forum, can apply to accede to PACER Plus, and perhaps the minister can also advise us as to how those negotiations are going. As with other parties, participation would require them to conclude negotiations on their market access schedules, and we know that those discussions have been had with countries around their potential involvement. As part of the readiness package, parties will be supported in their preparation to initially implement and ratify the agreement to respond to the needs assessment undertaken by the independent Office of the Chief Trade Adviser. Australia, as I have indicated, and New Zealand are assisting with those readiness activities. (Time expired)

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:06):  As it stands, the Greens do not support PACER Plus, and we won't be supporting this legislation. It's worth pointing out that Papua New Guinea and Fiji, the two largest Pacific island nation economies, are notably absent from this deal, and Vanuatu and Tonga have, at various times, withdrawn from the process. But what remains the elephant in the room as far as the Australian government is concerned in its dealings with our Pacific island neighbours is climate change. Of course, climate change is the elephant in the room as far as this government is concerned with regard to a whole range of public policy matters that it considers, but it is particularly relevant when we think about our Pacific neighbours. There are many Pacific island nations that have actually shown fantastic global leadership on the issue of climate change, and that's because they are going to be disproportionately impacted by climate change, particularly sea level rise, when in fact at a global level they have contributed next to nothing to the problem.


It's all very well for Senator Fierravanti-Wells to get up and talk today about some pitifully small amounts of money that Australia has allocated to Pacific island nations to prepare for the climate catastrophe that is looming for them, but let's be clear about the actual opportunity here for Australia. We need to show leadership in emissions reduction, not hand over some pitifully small amounts of money to nations that are likely to disappear off our global maps by the end of the century as a result of sea level rise. What's the Australian government proposing—that a nation like Kiribati, for example, get a few hydraulic jacks under it and jack itself up a couple of metres to avoid it disappearing underneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean in the next century or so? It beggars belief that we had a Pacific Islands Forum recently where the LNP government took deliberate steps to undermine serious action on climate change. And, remember, this government is a wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil fuel sector in this country. The LNP receives tens of millions of dollars in donations every year from dirty, polluting big corporations. We've got a Prime Minister who, of course, is infamous for waving a lump of coal around in the House of Representatives. Typically, he had to have that lump of coal covered in lacquer so he wouldn't get his hands dirty. Well, it didn't work for the Prime Minister, because his hands are filthy with coaldust and they are filthy from accepting donations from big fossil fuel companies.


This is a government made up of climate change deniers, a government made up of climate criminals, and it is posing an existential threat to some Pacific island nations. And do you know what? They know all this. Remember that the Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott were caught on camera a few years ago having a good old laugh at the impacts of sea level rise on Pacific island nations. Until Australia steps up on emissions reduction, until we become a global leader on climate change, we are a bad neighbour to Pacific island countries. We need to do more. We need to take stronger action. We ought to be a global leader in emissions reduction. And we ought not believe that we can somehow buy off Pacific island nations with pitifully small amounts of foreign aid money that, in the words of the government, will enable them to build climate resilience into their economies and their communities when, in fact, it will do next to nothing to help our Pacific island neighbours avoid the most serious impacts of the disruption to our climate—which half of this government don't believe is being caused by humans and which the other half are not prepared to take the required action on because they have been bought off by the fossil fuel sector.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:12):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the associated bill. I would note that the bill is, I think rather fittingly, the first bill I am taking through this chamber, and I'm very happy and proud that it is this particular bill.


First of all, I'd like to thank those opposite for their support for this very important bill. I think bipartisanship on this particular issue for our Pacific neighbours is particularly important. Before I go into the specifics of the bill, I would like to address a number of the issues raised by the two Greens senators speaking on this. I think there are a number of areas where they have grossly misrepresented the nature and the benefits of this PACER agreement. Also, clearly, they have no understanding of the strategic context. So I'd like to deal with both of those first.


In relation to the issue of who is joining this, 11 Pacific countries, as we know, have engaged in this already. In relation to the issue of Papua New Guinea, we would note that this is not the end of the agreement; this is just the start. The nations that are still considering joining this agreement are of course very welcome, but I would point out to the Greens that this is a sovereign decision of those nations. In relation to several comments from Senators McKim and Hanson-Young, I'd make this point: like my colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells, I found them extremely patronising to those nations involved. These negotiations have been extensive and they have been done with the utmost mutual respect on behalf of all of the nations involved. Our officials and the former minister, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, as we've heard, were deeply engaged in this process. But I don't think the senators stopped to think about that or about our trade negotiators, who have spent many months, if not years, on these negotiations. I think that to suggest they were bullying or intimidating our partners in the region is, quite frankly, insulting, and the facts certainly do not bear that out.


In relation to the bill itself, PACER Plus is a regional-development-centred trade agreement. That is why I'm particularly proud to be taking the bill through this chamber today. To date, PACER Plus, as I said, has been signed by 11 member of the Pacific Islands Forum—that is, Australia, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. As I said, this is just the start, and negotiations and discussions still continue with other nations. 


PACER Plus will provide commercial opportunities for Australian exporters and investors in a range of sectors. These opportunities will increase over time as the provisions of the agreement lead to more open and transparent policies as wider relationships are built regionally and beyond. The agreement itself reflects Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific island countries' commitment to the principles of free and open trade. The underlying impetus for negotiating the PACER Plus and its goals of regional commercial integration is the formation of an interconnected Pacific market that includes Australia and New Zealand, which will enable the Pacific Islands greater access to a larger market for their own consumers and also for their producers, and that is a very good thing. 


Despite the somewhat patronising and insulting comments from the Greens, I would just like to remind those in this chamber what this agreement is actually about. Australia and the Pacific island countries are longstanding partners and friends. We have common interests in both economic progress and regional stability. Our partners in the region range from countries richly endowed with people and resources to small atolls with geographically isolated populations. The PACER Plus agreement reflects this diversity as a comprehensive free trade agreement tailored to help Pacific island countries address their specific development challenges and also to assist them in a very sovereign respectful way to better participate in global trade and engage more effectively into global markets. 


The coalition government has the most ambitious trade agenda in Australia's history. PACER Plus, a unique trade agreement to drive economic prosperity and raise living standards in our region, will complement our trade agreements already in force, which, I would note very happily, are delivering record export growth and creating hundreds of thousands of more local jobs. 


As Senator Fierravanti-Wells has said, this is not a policy done in isolation and it is an important part of the objectives of Australia's white paper—and, again, I commend Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her role in developing this. The Foreign policy white paper has an important process called stepping up. Stepping up support for a more resilient Pacific is one of five priorities for Australia's foreign policy and is set out in the 2017 Foreign policy white paper released only 12 months ago. The white paper states that the Pacific is of fundamental importance to Australia and that 'Australia will engage with the Pacific with greater intensity and ambition'. 


The white paper also announced new regional security cooperation initiatives, including the Australia Pacific Security College and work to improve regional information sharing. And we on this side of the chamber, and also the Labor Party, can see that this is an important role for Australia to play in our region. The white paper further reinforces the announcements made by Prime Minister Turnbull at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting year that Australia would step up its engagement through three things—that is, stronger partnerships for economic growth; stronger partnerships for security; and stronger relationships between people—and our PACER Plus agreement assists and works in all three of those areas. 


Australia's longstanding development assistance to the Pacific has helped address many of the acute challenges facing the region over many years, including climate change and responding to natural disasters; sustaining economic growth and boosting education, skills and jobs for growing populations; gender equality and recognising the central role women play in achieving better development outcomes for their nations; the threat of major disease outbreak; and, increasingly, the threat of transnational crime across the Pacific. However, we do recognise that the complexities of these challenges demand deeper engagement, integrated policy and fresh ideas to drive transformative change in the region, and this is where PACER Plus assists in that process. Australia's stepped-up engagement is our response to these significant long-term challenges.


In relation to the bills, while PACER Plus provides a framework for integration, dedicated assistance is critical to barriers in Pacific Islands signatories and unlocking the benefits PACER Plus provides for this assistance. The PACER Plus bills represent the key legislative changes required to give effect to the new rules of origin required to implement PACER Plus. The Customs Act 1901 is being amended to include the new rules-of-origin requirements and to enable a full set of related product-specific rules to be made in keeping with our modern free trade agreements. The amendments contained in the legislation will enable eligible goods that satisfy PACER Plus rules of origin to be entered into Australia at preferential rates of customs duty. The Customs Tariff Act 1995 is being amended to set out the preferential rate of customs duty for goods that satisfy the new rules-of-origin requirements. These new rules are consistent with existing arrangements for duties imposed on excise equivalent goods. 


Without these amendments, Australia would not be able to complete its domestic arrangements, and the agreement would not be able to enter into force. This would prevent Australian businesses from receiving the various benefits that would flow from the agreement, but it would also prevent the equally significant, if not more significant, benefits that would flow to the PACER Plus partners. It is important that Australia be amongst the first eight countries to ratify, as early ratification would signal Australia's commitment to PACER Plus. As we've talked about in this chamber and in other places many times, PACER Plus is very important for the maintenance of rules based order and rules based trade in the Indo-Pacific region. As I said, PACER Plus does provide commercial opportunities for Australian exporters and investors in a wide range of sectors. These opportunities will increase over time as the provision of the agreement will lead to more open and transparent policies, both here and across the other 10 partners who have already signed up. This agreement reflects our principles of free and open trade and rules based trade. PACER Plus will enter into force 60 days after the eighth signatory notifies Tonga, as the depositary, that it has ratified the agreement.


I'd just like to come back to the point that the Greens made in relation to the 11 countries who are ratifying this and are initial signatories. They specifically raised Fiji and Papua New Guinea. As I've noted in this place, PACER Plus is a truly regional agreement which has 11 Pacific Islands Forum members. PACER Plus will deliver benefits for these nations. Despite the assertions of those on the Greens benches, this hasn't been done in a way that is disrespectful of these nations' sovereignty and it is not disrespectful of those governments. This has been done over an extended period of time with them as partners. Extensive engagement has been undertaken by these nations. In fact, the information that I have back from the minister and the teams who were responsible for this at the time is that this was done in a truly respectful way. We listened to our Pacific partners. There was wide consultation.


The development assistance that is so important that is embedded in this agreement was worked out with each of the individual Pacific island nations, to find out what they needed for this. I would say—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—to my Greens colleagues in this chamber: this was done with them as full sovereign partners in the process. It was done in a new way to provide the development assistance from Australia and New Zealand that these nations recognise that they need to develop their capability, their processes, their systems and their trade regulations and legislation to make sure that they can engage in the international trade environment.


The Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 represent the main legislative changes for the new rules of origin under PACER Plus. 


With those comments I again thank those opposite in the Labor Party for their engagement and support for these bills, I thank all those officials who were engaged in these negotiations for that time, and I also commend the government for this agreement, because I as the minister now responsible think that this is the way forward for our free trade agreements: to not only look at how we as a nation might benefit from this process but also assist other nations and other regional partners, ensuring they are capable of maintaining sovereign trade interests and trade with other countries where their size and their location may in the past have prohibited them from doing so. I commend these bills to the Senate.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:27):  Contrary to the assertion by the Greens senators in this place, all 11 countries have entered into this agreement as equals, because they realise that there are benefits to their own nations. They have done so in close consultation with our trade officials at minister-to-minister level. A number of countries have been very clear, and we've consulted with them, on the development support they need so they can engage as equal partners in international trade relationships.


PACER Plus is a landmark agreement that covers goods, services and investment. It removes barriers to trade, including tariffs, increasing the flow of goods and investment in the region, generating growth and jobs, and raising living standards in all of its signatory countries. Ultimately what's in it for the nations who have already come on board is the fact that they realise that this is a pathway to greater industry, greater exposure to international markets and greater job opportunities and income for their families, which, as I said previously, is at the heart of the Australian government white paper's proposal for the Pacific, which I know you are fully aware of, Senator Fierravanti-Wells.


PACER Plus is unique. It is both a trade and a development assistance agreement. Australia and New Zealand have committed $33 million in development assistance to help Pacific island countries implement their commitments and strengthen their capacity to trade. That, as all of us in this place except the Greens realise, is a good thing for all the nations involved. There are a number of specific proposals. It provides a vehicle for Pacific island nations to liberalise and reform their economies, a number of which are very small, and also to reverse their economic marginalisation at a pace they are comfortable with. As Senator Fierravanti-Wells noted earlier on, this process takes us through to the 2050s, so it is up to the nations involved as to the time frame and how we do that. Each of the nations has to be comfortable with a range of flexibilities that recognise their own special challenges.


The PACER Plus will also help to facilitate trade in the Pacific island countries. That means it will enhance transparency and harmonisation and reduce the cost of trading and doing business for each one of these Pacific island nations. It also establishes in the development corporation chapter a framework for mutually agreeing with Australia and New Zealand the appropriate support to assist the Pacific island countries develop their capacity to trade. It also provides a modern template for engaging in international trade. This is important for Pacific island countries, as it is for every other country in the world that is not a member of the World Trade Organization, and it is also very important for the Pacific island countries as they move forward and have a greater capacity to negotiate other free trade agreements elsewhere. Probably the fifth major benefit is that, under labour mobility arrangements, it actually expands the opportunity for labour mobility opportunities amongst Pacific island countries, and that includes Australia.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (10:30):  One of the wrong assertions, I think, which has been made in relation to PACER Plus is that Pacific island countries would suffer revenue loss as a result of their PACER Plus commitments. Minister, can you just elaborate on that?

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2018-09-13,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:31):  Thank you very much for your question. This issue was raised again in this debate by the Greens senators. Revenue loss will occur under this agreement, but it will be very modest and very small in comparison to the benefits that will flow from these agreements. Reliance on custom duties has been, in the long term, in decline across the Pacific already. Kiribati abolished all of its ordinary customs duty on imports in 2014, while the Cook Islands and Niue apply tariffs on relatively few tariff lines. Most Pacific island countries generally have low tariffs and all Pacific island countries have been negotiating tariff reductions under their existing free trade agreements and with the WTO. 


The Office of the Chief Trade Adviser estimated that, when PACER Plus tariff reductions are fully implemented, reductions in tariff revenue for most countries will equate to between one and three per cent of current government revenue. Australia will, of course, continue to assist Pacific island countries undertaking revenue reform through the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund. Target assistance is also available to Pacific island countries under the PACER Plus Readiness Package. Yes, there will be some very modest, one to three per cent, initial impacts in some nations, but the benefits that this arrangement will bring will far outweigh that. We are also providing many other opportunities to assist these nations as they move through that transition period.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:33):  As I pointed out in my speech—and I thank the senator for the question—PACER Plus is a truly regional agreement, and the first 11 nations are just the start. Discussions continue with a number of other nations—in particular, with Fiji and Papua New Guinea. Australia would very much like to see Papua New Guinea and Fiji join because they have much to contribute to and, I think, would also gain from PACER Plus but, ultimately, as with all nations, their participation is a sovereign matter for their respective governments. PACER Plus will remain open for others to join, including Fiji and Papua New Guinea, even after it comes into force.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (10:34):  One of the things that obviously has been a feature of discussions in the Pacific is very much the concept of 'talanoa'—the sitting down, the understanding and the talking through. That has really been the spirit with which this agreement has been under consideration and under discussion. Perhaps at times there have been issues pertinent to whether this is in the public interest of a particular country. Can you elaborate on the ability of Pacific island nations to regulate and to ensure that what they are doing is in the public interest and to put those public interest issues to bed?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:35):  That is another very good question that goes to the heart of some of the matters that have been raised here in this chamber. Pacific Islands countries don't lose their ability to regulate as a result of PACER Plus. One of the most important points here is that this is still respectful of all nations' sovereignty. PACER Plus does not compel parties to give up their regulatory powers and parties are able to introduce new regulations or amend existing regulations.


The commitment of PACER Plus to preserve the right of parties to regulate is highlighted clearly in the preamble to the agreement, which I'll share with the chamber. The preamble says this:


Recognising their right to regulate and their resolve to preserve the flexibility of the Parties to set legislative and regulatory priorities, safeguard public welfare, and protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, the environment—


I'm sure the Greens would like to know that it does respect their sovereignty in relation to the environment—


the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources, the integrity and stability of the financial system and public morals;


So that clearly does indicate that the nations do not lose their ability to regulate as a result of this agreement.

Is this going to in any way impede the ability of countries to regulate in relation to those? I'm talking more about kava and other issues that are important to Pacific Islands countries.

I know work was being done in relation to that. Can you tell us where that work is at and what the outcome of that analysis is?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:37):  Yes, I can. According to the National Interest Analysis, once PACER Plus is fully implemented Australian exporters will gain tariff-free access to PACER Plus markets for nearly 92 per cent of all tariff lines carrying 88 per cent of Australian exports to the region. There are clearly significant benefits to Australian exporters and many different commodities right across our nation.


Economic modelling of trade agreements is only one tool to assess whether an agreement is in the national interest. DFAT commissions economic modelling of trade agreements on a case-by-case basis. I've been advised that statistical and methodological limitations mean that current models are unable to estimate the total impact of a free trade agreement on the economy. For example, it is difficult to model accurately the changes to non-tariff barriers, trade facilitation, increased regulatory certainty and other aspects of a free trade agreement such as the rules that are imposed. Also, statistical data on international trade and services, and investment flows into the Pacific, are incomplete.


Two qualitative assessments were undertaken of PACER Plus as a whole. The first one was by the Institute for International Trade at the University of Adelaide, who prepared a report called the Research study on the benefits, challenges and ways forward for PACER Plus, and they did this in June 2008. It did provide an early assessment of issues for consideration in the negotiations. The second one was by the Office of the Chief Trade Adviser, who undertook and published the PACER Plus impact and sustainability assessment in 2016. It was prepared independently by the organisation with input from consultants. It presented an assessment of the potential economic, social and environmental impacts of trade liberalisation under PACER Plus for the Pacific Islands nations themselves.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (10:39):  Earlier this year the opposition joined then Foreign Minister Bishop and me on a trip to the North Pacific. Obviously, one of the issues under discussion was the North Pacific countries of the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. They have concluded negotiations on PACER Plus, but they haven't yet signed. There was also an issue there in relation to the compact because they are compact countries with the United States. Minister, can you elaborate on where we're at with the North Pacific countries? In particular, can the North Pacific still join PACER Plus if they don't sign the agreement before it enters into force? How does that work vis-a-vis the compact with the United States?

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2018-09-13,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:40):  The short answer is yes. Should the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands not sign PACER Plus before it enters into force, they will be able to accede to the agreement as per provision 9 of article 15, which covers accession. The Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and the Republic of Marshall Islands already have full suites of market access schedules in the PACER Plus legal text. This would significantly expedite their accession to PACER Plus should they decide to do so, but we would very much prefer the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and the Republic of Marshall Islands to sign PACER Plus as soon as possible so they can start to benefit from the agreement as soon as possible and also access the readiness package that is being made available as part of this agreement.


In relation to French Polynesia and New Caledonia, they joined the Pacific Islands Forum as full members last year. As such, we would also welcome their accession to PACER Plus should they so decide. We would be pleased to see them both join PACER Plus because both nations have much to offer the other nations in that agreement. But also I believe they have much on offer from the agreement with greater economic engagement with other nations in their region. But, as with other new parties, their participation would require French Polynesia and New Caledonia to take an initial market access offer to actually commence the negotiations. We will continue to engage with both countries, should they so desire, on the PACER Plus arrangements.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (10:42):  I have one other area which I'd like to cover. We do have other trade agreements that include Pacific island countries, including the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement. Minister, can you outline how PACER Plus is going to work in that framework and, in particular, how it will interact with other frameworks of which Pacific island countries are members?

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2018-09-13,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:42):  In short, again, the answer is yes. There are a number of forums and arrangements. The first one is with the World Trade Organization, and some Pacific island nations are already members of the World Trade Organization, as Australia is. WTO members already include Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Other Pacific island countries do not have the resources needed to participate yet in the WTO, but that is exactly one of the reasons why this PACER Plus program, and its assistance program, is so important. It allows and facilitates these nations to enter the WTO.


Regional economic integration between PACER Plus parties will lead to the deeper and broadened economic integration that is possible between WTO members and it will do so close to home. PACER Plus will cover investment, establish modern rules of origin and also facilitate regulatory cooperation. PACER Plus will actually bring some benefits to WTO membership for Pacific island countries that do not yet have the resources to do so, and that is absolutely a great thing for these nations. It is providing them with development assistance so that they can fully participate in the World Trade Organization arrangements, as well as in other agreements. PACER is a treaty, but it doesn't contain any trade provisions. PACER itself is not a trade agreement, but PACER does have a closed membership.


Another organisation, the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement, is not itself a regional economic integration agreement and it does not provide for the liberalisation of all of Australia's tariffs, so it is nonreciprocal from Australia's perspective. These rules of origin are antiquated, because they don't cover services, investment, transparency, cooperation or development assistance. Another benefit of the new agreement, PACER Plus, is that it provides greater sovereign capabilities for partners to PACER Plus.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (10:45):  Senator Carr earlier made a wrong assertion, I think, that we had the $11 billion. Perhaps, Senator Carr, I can correct you on the issue of your allegation of cuts of $11 billion from the foreign aid budget. This all started when Tanya Plibersek, some years ago, started spreading fictitious and misleading information about your record on foreign aid. Tanya Plibersek repeatedly made claims that the coalition had cut $11.3 billion from the foreign aid budget. This is wrong. It stems from misinformation—lies—and projected forecasts under your own inflated fiscal mismanagement. Only those opposite can spread lies about trying to spend money that they didn't have beyond the forward estimates.


Let me take you through the history, because I keep hearing those opposite going on and on about this $11 billion. ABC's Fact Check found Tanya Plibersek's claim on Labor's own foreign aid budget, that Labor doubled the aid budget whilst in government, was overblown. Looking at real foreign aid spending, Labor's last budget showed that foreign aid, based on 2011-12 prices, increased from $3.5 billion in 2007-08 to a forecast $5.5 billion in 2013-14, which was an increase of only 55 per cent, not the doubling that Tanya Plibersek keeps harping on about. The reason I go back to this is that this is a lie upon a lie that goes back to 2015. Those opposite keep harping on about this when they know it is not right. Indeed, in an op-ed penned in 2006, Tanya Plibersek wrote, 'Our aid efforts should be focused on the alleviation of extreme poverty, not on short-term political gain, such as funding the Pacific Solution.'


I have to say to those opposite that this is hypocrisy writ large, because for a short time when you were in government you actually diverted money from the aid budget for onshore processing costs for asylum seekers. Indeed, you became one of the highest recipients of your own aid budget. The countries that suffered most as a consequence of that act were the very Pacific island countries that you are now coming in here and bleating about. I really wanted to put that on the record because, Senator Carr, you should go back and check your facts. When the ABC's Fact Check tells you that you have your figures wrong, perhaps you ought to heed those comments.


I have a final question for the minister. On balance, assertions have been made that this is not a framework that is actually going to benefit Pacific island countries. We have heard this peddled by those opposite. Can you, in your summing up comments, outline for us the actual economic gain that this is going to give to Pacific island countries?

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2018-09-13,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:49):  Yes, I can. There are a number of elements to that support. One of the points I'd make is that the Pacific region continues to experience significant social, economic and environmental challenges. We all in this place acknowledge that. Distance and weak infrastructure make international trade expensive, and small domestic markets and narrow production bases mean that countries rely on their internal economies for growth and for consumption. While PACER Plus provides the framework for regional trade and economic integration, dedicated assistance is absolutely critical to addressing barriers in signatory countries and to unlocking the Pacific's ability to partake in a global market.


The PACER Plus Readiness Package—which I think the Greens senators who spoke earlier clearly hadn't even read, or understood what was there—is absolutely vital to providing those benefits. The readiness package is that Australia and New Zealand will provide joint funding packages of $8 million for readiness activities. This is to assist signatories from other nations to ratify their PACER Plus agreements and also, as we've said, other agreements—for example, through the WTO framework.


The support that we're providing in this bill is for things like, firstly, legislative drafting to assist signatories to review and update relevant laws and regulations in their own countries. Secondly, there is Customs modernisation and harmonisation, implementation of up-to-date tariff codes and transposition of schedules. Those sound a little bureaucratic but are vitally important for small nations to be able to do. Each signatory will be able to implement the latest version of the internationally recognised systems known as the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding Systems. Again, it sounds very bureaucratic and technical, but for these nations to engage fully in the World Trade Organisation and also in other FTAs this has to be done.


We're also providing support to those nations as they require. There is training on notification requirements, including helping governments and private sectors to meet PACER Plus obligations around transparency. We're  providing funding support for public outreach and stakeholder engagement, and also for revenue planning and mitigation to help signatories manage any impact on their government revenue associated with tariff reduction, as discussed earlier.


As part of PACER Plus, Australia's commitment to an aid-for-trade funding target is for 20 per cent of its official ODA budget in the Pacific. This target complements the party's own trade related initiatives to increase economic growth, to generate jobs and to increase living standards in each and every one of these Pacific nations. As I said, they're challenged by distance, by size and also by having very small agencies which need to be able to deal with those issues.


I will leave you with two examples. The first one is agricultural export development. The Pacific Horticultural and Agricultural Market Access Program helps Pacific exporters meet the quarantine standards and other market access requirements of their trading partners. Again, it is very practical and very development focused assistance to enable these countries to engage in the international trading market. The second example is trade facilitation export and promotion and investment. Australia has increased funding to the Oceania Customs Organisation to help to strengthen Pacific Customs administrations, and will continue our longstanding support for Pacific trade and investment. It provides high-quality export facilitation investment and tourism promotion services across the region.


My final comment to this chamber is that I wholeheartedly endorse PACER Plus and the enabling legislation. This is a good thing. I'd conclude by, again, thanking the Labor Party for their engagement and their support for this very important bill to enable the PACER Plus program. Thank you.

 (Victoria) (09:32):  I've not had a lot of time to look at the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018. I understand they have been brought on in a bit of a rush. Clearly the government is a bit short of business again, so I'll give this lengthy consideration. It is a tragedy to see the once-great Liberal Party descend to this level of chaos and indecision so soon after they thought they'd sorted out all their problems. But they were able to find this somewhere deep in the barrel. They ducked in and produced some legislation that they had to get exempted from the cut-off to allow it to proceed. This is not controversial legislation. It's a straightforward matter. I guess you'll have to dig a lot deeper to get to the next piece of legislation. This will not take a long period of time, I expect, because Labor supports the bills.


As much of this legislation goes to development measures as it does to customs and trade matters. These measures amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to implement the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus, known as PACER Plus. Australia, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu signed this agreement last year. The agreement is a comprehensive regional economic integration agreement, consistent with World Trade Organization rules. It covers a range of goods and services, investment and established rules and commitment between the various parties to the agreement. 


The agreement also, as the bill outlines, includes an aid component to help with the development of the region. Under the agreement, tariffs will be cut on 88.5 per cent of Australian exports to signatory countries, apart from New Zealand. It also means that there will be no tariffs on goods imported from signatory countries to Australia, apart from New Zealand. Under the agreement, we will also provide some $4 million to assist Pacific island nations to prepare to ratify this agreement and $19 million for them to update their customs processes. That, of course, does not even begin to compensate for the $11 billion this government has cut from the aid budget. There's a bit of irony that we should be debating bills that provide $4 million when some $11 billion has been cut from the budget.


The agreement has been scrutinised by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which has recommended that the agreement include an independent economic analysis of the merits of this agreement. That's a proposition that this chamber should fully endorse. The JSCOT has made the same recommendation for other trade bills, including some of the more contentious legislation that is to come before the chamber. The Labor Party will have more to say on this matter when those bills are introduced, but I give notice that a future Labor government will ensure that all future trade agreements are subject to independent economic analysis.


These bills provide for 'free' rates of customs duty, which, when enacted, will mean that a new schedule will be provided for excise-equivalent rates of duty on certain alcohol, tobacco and fuel products in accordance with this agreement. The amendments provide for certain concessional items listed under the Customs Tariff Act to maintain customs duty rates in line with the applicable concession items and in accordance with the agreement. Complementary amendments will be made to the Customs Act by the customs amendment bill to introduce new rules of origin for goods imported into Australia from parties to the agreement. The bill provides that these new rules will determine what eligible goods would be subject to preferential treatment of customs duty in accordance with the agreement. The bill contains no matters which we would regard as being contentious, and it is surprising that it is not being considered in the non-controversial bills section of our normal business. The Labor Party is pleased to support it.


I had a look at the details of some of the measures that have taken my interest in regard to Niue. It is a country of some importance, as the ABC told us in a recent story. Niue is a country with a population of about 1,800. I'm told that about 80 per cent of them are actually from New Zealand and that many of them participate in sporting clubs in New Zealand. Of particular note was the appearance of a mallard duck in Niue. People can't quite work out where it's come from. The ABC has given us very good coverage of the issue; there is a lot of news generated in the Pacific these days from the ABC. The duck even has a name—Trevor—and is said to have come from New Zealand. It's described as a major problem, because there are no wetlands and no ponds on Niue, so the fire brigade has to provide the necessary water conditions for Trevor the mallard duck. I understand that it's named Trevor after the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. It's said to be a very miserable duck, because it is so lonely. Unfortunately, there are no other ducks on Niue, so it has no partners. We're looking forward to seeing what other biosecurity issues have arisen as a result of this matter and whether or not this agreement will cover these questions in the future.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-09-13,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (09:38):  I rise to add the Greens contribution to this PACER Plus legislation. The Greens remain concerned about the power imbalances in PACER Plus negotiations. We've been concerned for quite some time that Australia and New Zealand have used their big-brother, or big-sister, influence in the region to a point where they have disenfranchised some of the smaller nations in our region and undermined their genuine ability to participate.


We know, of course, that Papua New Guinea and Fiji, the two largest Pacific island nation economies, are notably absent from this deal, and that Vanuatu and Tonga have at various times withdrawn from the process. We've been concerned that in a modern world such as this, where Australia has a responsibility to help those in our region who aren't as big, don't have democracies that are as stable and aren't able to sustain themselves economically in the way Australia is able to, we have in fact stood over them in these negotiations. We are concerned that that is now being reflected in the PACER Plus arrangement that we're debating today.


The refusal of Papua New Guinea and Fiji to sign the agreement is significant, because they represent 80 per cent of the combined GDP of Pacific island countries. If 80 per cent of the economies are not even represented in this deal, you've got to ask yourself why—why is Australia pursuing this in this manner? It raises the question of whether small Pacific nations felt unfairly pressured by Australia and New Zealand to enter the agreement. Anecdotally, of course, we have heard from representatives of these island nations that, yes, they did indeed feel put upon by Australia and New Zealand and felt the pressure immensely.


The primary impact of PACER Plus is to decrease tariffs on Australian and New Zealand exports to these Pacific countries. It's very clear that, as the big nations, we are getting the best deal out of this. Some would say that's fine, except that we live in a neighbourhood and we have a responsibility, as the wealthiest nation, the largest economy in the region, to play better and be a bit fairer in this. We know that this disproportionate pact, which benefits Australia and New Zealand, could easily just be agreed to. But what does that mean and what signal does that send to countries in the rest of the region, particularly the smaller ones, who feel they had to agree or are going to be resentful, going forward, of this and the attitude that's been presented by Australia?


Proposals by Australia and New Zealand to introduce or increase consumption taxes to offset tariff cuts will not provide adequate compensation for revenue loss. Studies have demonstrated that replacing tariffs with consumption taxes in developing nations only compensates for 30 per cent of lost revenue. Countries in the Pacific region are increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and it's extraordinary that this deal does nothing to address the real-life impact on these countries of rising sea levels and the other impacts of climate change. We know that, despite a growing urgency to support Pacific island countries to combat climate change, this declaration does zilch. Despite the government signing a declaration just weeks ago identifying climate change as the greatest single threat to Pacific peoples, PACER Plus does not even include proper environmental protection measures. It's a case of 'Look over here while we do something else'; of refusing to tackle what will be, beyond any doubt, the biggest impact into the future for our Pacific island neighbours. We know that climate change needs to be tackled and we know that they need help in dealing with that, yet Australia continues to just turn the other cheek. It's not good enough at all.


Tariff cuts will disproportionately affect women in the Pacific region. Women in Pacific communities are largely employed in the industries that will be affected most by these tariff cuts, such as clothing manufacturing and small-scale agriculture. We hear a lot in this place from various NGOs and community based organisations about what Australia can do to show leadership in the region in relation to empowering women, giving them a voice and giving them independence and the ability to be economically sustainable.


This deal, because of its nature, and because it has been managed quite heavy-handedly from the Australian perspective, is going to impact on our sisters in the Pacific region and those Pacific Islands disproportionately. I think this place needs to consider that when looking at this legislation. The last thing we want is women in the Pacific to be even more disadvantaged just because Australia wanted to squeeze more money out of our poor neighbours and our poor cousins throughout the Pacific. It's not good enough. We should be doing more to support women in the Pacific, not simply allowing this to go through and think it doesn't have an effect. When we talk about clothing manufacturing or small-scale agriculture, we should be doing much more to help these women and their families and communities to become self-sustaining and economically robust. This does the exact opposite. This rips the carpet out from beneath them. It will have dire impacts on these women unless we do something to fix it.


The Greens, as I've said, remain very concerned about this. We won't be supporting it. We wish that the government would have been a little more considerate of the desires and concerns raised by our Pacific island neighbours. The fact that climate change isn't in here and the fact that it disproportionately impacts on the poorest women in our region are enough for me to say that this isn't something that Australia should be pursuing.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-09-13,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (09:46):  I'm very pleased to speak in support of the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018. The key theme of these bills is to promote an open Pacific economic integration and to advance development in the Pacific. PACER Plus is a unique framework and an important part of our trade agenda in the region. The Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations, PACER Plus, is a unique framework because it is both a development centred agreement plus a regional free trade agreement. The agreement includes a substantial development assistance package of $7.7 million to help countries to prepare to ratify the agreement, and a further $25 million in the implementation assistance after entry into force.


But I cannot go beyond making some observations in relation to what Senator Hanson-Young just said. It demonstrates, yet again, the Greens total lack of understanding and a patronising attitude in relation to our neighbours. On the issue of women, clearly, Senator Hanson-Young, you are not aware that the negotiations for PACER Plus commenced in 2009 and they concluded in Brisbane in April 2017. They have been worked through assiduously with our Pacific island neighbours. PACER Plus opened for signature in June 2017, and, to date, has been signed by 11 countries: Australia, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. I have to say that your patronising comments in relation to these countries demonstrate, yet again, your total lack of understanding of what is happening in our neighbourhood.


On the issue of women, we have had a very successful program of Pacific women shaping Pacific development. It's been a $320 million project over 10 years and has brought considerable benefits to our Pacific island sisters. On the issue of climate change, as part of the $1 billion commitment that Australia gave as part of its commitment to the Paris agreement, $300 million over four years is for building Pacific resilience and addressing climate issues in the Pacific. That's in addition to the $200 million that went to the Green Climate Fund. So, Senator Hanson-Young, before you come in here and pontificate on matters that you know absolutely nothing about, why don't you go and check your facts before you are critical about these issues?


Let me get back to PACER Plus. PACER Plus will help drive economic prosperity and raise living standards in our region. Our foreign policy white paper points out that being open to trade and investment creates wealth and supports higher living standards. A strong rules based liberalised international trading system is in the interests of all countries, including providing opportunities for developing countries to engage more in international trade. Perhaps those opposite haven't looked, but some Pacific island countries are in the process of moving towards graduation in relation to their economic status. It is important that Australia be amongst the first countries to ratify the agreement, as early ratification would signal our clear commitment not just to PACER Plus but to this important rules based trade in the Indo-Pacific region.


PACER Plus will deliver modest economic and commercial benefits to Australia, and I'm sure that the minister will elaborate on some of these benefits to Australia—modest though they are, commensurate with the size of participating Pacific island economies. In particular Australian producers of goods, suppliers of services and investors will benefit from more liberal and secure market access in the Pacific. By promoting growth and development, and strengthening reform processes in the Pacific, PACER Plus will expand commercial opportunities for Australian countries in the region to trade with their Pacific neighbours. Pacific island countries will have eliminated tariffs on the vast majority, 91.5 per cent, of their tariff lines, covering the bulk, 88.5 per cent, of Australia's exports. Based on 2016 data this represents a total value of $360 million when PACER Plus is fully implemented.


Australia's largest services exports to the Pacific are tourism and travel services, transport services and financial services, including insurance. Our Pacific island country signatories have made commitments in each of these sectors, many for the first time. Australian service suppliers will benefit for the first time from commitments from non-WTO members such as the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue and Tuvalu. The 'most favoured nation' provisions in the agreement will help safeguard access for Australian producers of goods, suppliers of services and investors in the event that Pacific island countries apply more favourable treatment for the producers, suppliers and investors of nonparties, such as under free trade agreements.


Our foreign policy white paper identified the following:


Economic integration within the region and with Australia and New Zealand is vital to the economic prospects of the Pacific. Growth is constrained for most countries because of a combination of remoteness from markets, limited land and resource bases, the dispersal of people over many islands and environmental fragility.


The underlying impetus for negotiating PACER Plus and its goals of regional economic integration align with the narrative in our foreign policy white paper. The formation of an interconnected Pacific market which includes Australia and New Zealand will enable Pacific island countries to create a larger market not only for its consumers but also for its producers.


PACER Plus will not only cover trade in goods but also extend to trade in services, in investment, in labour mobility and in development assistance. For many countries in our region this will be the first WTO-compliant free trade agreement. When in force it will stand as a valuable example of the region's collective effort to work together towards greater economic integration. By establishing a common framework through which to transact each element of the participating country's economic relationships, PACER Plus supports the long-term economic development of Pacific island countries through closer integration with Australia and New Zealand, with each other and with the global economy. We recognise that it is important that, for trade to thrive, trade liberalisation has to be accompanied by a supportive policy environment, and that includes sound economic management, reforms and effective service delivery. We have committed to assist our Pacific island neighbours with transition, and we've taken careful consideration of issues like implementation time lines.


The region continues to experience significant economic, social and environmental challenges, and, having been minister from February 2016 until recently, I saw this firsthand. I had the opportunity to visit many parts of the Pacific. Indeed, I made over 35 trips to the Pacific during this time, and I saw for myself that distance and weak infrastructure make international trade expensive, but small domestic markets and narrow production bases mean that countries rely on it for income and consumption. And whilst the agreement provides a regional framework for trade and economic integration, dedicated assistance to each of these countries will be vital to address the barriers that those countries are facing and, of course, to unlock the potential of the Pacific and its ability to partake in the benefits.


An important component of this is the readiness package. We and New Zealand have provided assistance for readiness activities. To help signatories, we are supporting processes like legislative drafting to assist the signatories to review and update their relevant national laws and regulation as well as customs modernisation, harmonisation, implementation of up-to-date tariff codes and transposition of schedules so that each signatory will be able to implement the latest version of the internationally recognised system known as the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. There will be training on notification requirements, including helping governments and private sectors in those Pacific island countries to meet the obligations around transparency. There will be funding for public outreach and stakeholder engagement, and there will also be revenue planning and mitigation to help signatories manage any impact on government revenues associated with tariff reductions. There's also a PACER Plus implementation package. Upon entry into force, Australia and New Zealand will provide a further funding package of $19 million and NZ$7 million respectively over five years, and this will focus on rules of origin and the implementation of those tariff commitments; customs; sanitary and phytosanitary measures; technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment; trade in services; and investment.


One of the key advantages of PACER Plus—and I have had many conversations with different Pacific island country stakeholders, ministers and the private sector—is that, in short, if Pacific island countries get their biosecurity systems up to a level at which they can export to Australia and New Zealand, then they can export to any other country around the world. Therefore, this is a very, very good thing for the Pacific. This is one of the key features that they have been asking us for, and that's why PACER Plus is so important.


One of the other components of development assistance, particularly in the Pacific, has been our Aid for Trade program. As part of PACER Plus, Australia remains committed to our Aid for Trade funding target of 20 per cent of our overseas development assistance budget in the Pacific. This target, of course, will complement the party's own trade related initiatives as Pacific island countries seek to increase growth, generate jobs and increase living standards for their people. Let me share some examples with the Senate of how this is being done. It's being done through agriculture export development. The Pacific Horticultural and Agricultural Market Access Program, PHAMA, helps Pacific exporters meet quarantine standards and other market access requirements of trading partners. It's being done through trade facilitation, export promotion and investment. We have increased funding to the Oceania Customs Organisation to help strengthen Pacific customs administrations, and we will continue our longstanding support for Pacific Trade Invest which provides high-quality export facilitation, investment and tourism promotion services across the region.


A separate non-binding arrangement on labour mobility has also been signed by Australia, New Zealand and Pacific island signatories to PACER Plus. Our new Pacific labour scheme will allow workers from the Pacific to take up non-seasonal low-skilled and semiskilled work in rural and regional Australia in growth sectors such as tourism and hospitality, disability and aged care, and non-seasonal agriculture. Why? Because it's about capacity building. It's about developing and affording opportunities to our Pacific island neighbours and people there to develop their skills, to come to Australia, to work in Australia and then to take those skills back into the Pacific, which is vitally important for their own economic development.


This, of course, is in parallel with our Seasonal Worker Program. Our Seasonal Worker Program will be streamlined to give more Australian employers access to a reliable, seasonal workforce drawn from the Pacific and Timor-Leste. We know how successful the Seasonal Worker Program has been for our Pacific island neighbours. Since its inception, about 12,000 or 13,000 Pacific island workers have come to Australia, and they often take back to their countries net gains of $5,000 or $6,000, which has enabled families to send their children to school, buy their own homes and do those things that are very important: to pay for their education, to set up businesses, and to build houses and community facilities. Of course, we will continue to work on all the outstanding partners to the agreement, because we consider that the benefits for Pacific economies outweigh any potential costs. I know that those discussions are ongoing, and I'm sure the minister will elaborate on how those are progressing.


Whilst PACER Plus will reduce government tariff revenue, it includes lengthy implementation schedules. The first tariff reductions are not required until 10 years after the agreement enters into force, and they are then phased in over the following 25 years. This means that all of the tariff reductions will not be fully implemented until 2053 at the earliest. That well and truly will enable Pacific island countries to take the implementation of this agreement at their own pace and implement it fully within their own economic systems.


The agreement underscores the role of open trade and investment in enabling economic development and rising living standards across our region. The agreement will cover an additional 1.5 million people who are not presently captured under Australia's existing FTAs. Whilst the commercial value of the trade with Pacific island countries is modest, this agreement will lay the foundations for its future growth. In 2015, Australia's goods and services two-way trade with participating Pacific countries totalled $1.2 billion of our total trade.


As I have said, PACER Plus is an unique agreement, because it is both a trade and a development agreement. It has the potential to shape and reshape the economic fundamentals of the Pacific region by creating new opportunities for trade and investment in our neighbourhood. Overall, we will see simplification and enhancing of regional trade, and also, of course, we will help Pacific island countries grow their economies by accessing international markets. It will facilitate greater integration of Pacific island economies into the global rules-based trading system and, of course, reshape the economic fundamentals of the Pacific region, creating new opportunities for trade and investment that will drive economic growth and, as I have said, raise living standards. It will also help Pacific island countries modernise their economies. For example, we will be able to assist Pacific island countries to modernise their customs and tax systems in preparation for implementation of PACER Plus. Our assistance will help build capacity in trade promotion, in investment facilitation, in biosecurity, and in micro, small and medium enterprises. The region has been slow to implement structural reform, and more needs to be done to integrate business environments and promote intraregional trade and investment. This is a great opportunity to promote reform, and it will provide an important impetus for change.


PACER Plus is also designed to remain open to the participation of nonparties, including Fiji and PNG. The agreement will be beneficial for all Pacific island countries, including Fiji and Papua New Guinea, if and when they decide to become parties. And I know that those discussions are ongoing. I, myself, was part of those discussions as minister. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties noted that the absence of Fiji and PNG from PACER Plus may impact the scope of PACER Plus, but it also noted that, due to the long time frame over which PACER Plus will be implemented, there is sufficient opportunity for these countries to join the agreement if satisfactory conditions can be negotiated.


French Polynesia and New Caledonia, having now become full members of the Pacific Islands Forum, can apply to accede to PACER Plus, and perhaps the minister can also advise us as to how those negotiations are going. As with other parties, participation would require them to conclude negotiations on their market access schedules, and we know that those discussions have been had with countries around their potential involvement. As part of the readiness package, parties will be supported in their preparation to initially implement and ratify the agreement to respond to the needs assessment undertaken by the independent Office of the Chief Trade Adviser. Australia, as I have indicated, and New Zealand are assisting with those readiness activities. (Time expired)

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-09-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:06):  As it stands, the Greens do not support PACER Plus, and we won't be supporting this legislation. It's worth pointing out that Papua New Guinea and Fiji, the two largest Pacific island nation economies, are notably absent from this deal, and Vanuatu and Tonga have, at various times, withdrawn from the process. But what remains the elephant in the room as far as the Australian government is concerned in its dealings with our Pacific island neighbours is climate change. Of course, climate change is the elephant in the room as far as this government is concerned with regard to a whole range of public policy matters that it considers, but it is particularly relevant when we think about our Pacific neighbours. There are many Pacific island nations that have actually shown fantastic global leadership on the issue of climate change, and that's because they are going to be disproportionately impacted by climate change, particularly sea level rise, when in fact at a global level they have contributed next to nothing to the problem.


It's all very well for Senator Fierravanti-Wells to get up and talk today about some pitifully small amounts of money that Australia has allocated to Pacific island nations to prepare for the climate catastrophe that is looming for them, but let's be clear about the actual opportunity here for Australia. We need to show leadership in emissions reduction, not hand over some pitifully small amounts of money to nations that are likely to disappear off our global maps by the end of the century as a result of sea level rise. What's the Australian government proposing—that a nation like Kiribati, for example, get a few hydraulic jacks under it and jack itself up a couple of metres to avoid it disappearing underneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean in the next century or so? It beggars belief that we had a Pacific Islands Forum recently where the LNP government took deliberate steps to undermine serious action on climate change. And, remember, this government is a wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil fuel sector in this country. The LNP receives tens of millions of dollars in donations every year from dirty, polluting big corporations. We've got a Prime Minister who, of course, is infamous for waving a lump of coal around in the House of Representatives. Typically, he had to have that lump of coal covered in lacquer so he wouldn't get his hands dirty. Well, it didn't work for the Prime Minister, because his hands are filthy with coaldust and they are filthy from accepting donations from big fossil fuel companies.


This is a government made up of climate change deniers, a government made up of climate criminals, and it is posing an existential threat to some Pacific island nations. And do you know what? They know all this. Remember that the Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott were caught on camera a few years ago having a good old laugh at the impacts of sea level rise on Pacific island nations. Until Australia steps up on emissions reduction, until we become a global leader on climate change, we are a bad neighbour to Pacific island countries. We need to do more. We need to take stronger action. We ought to be a global leader in emissions reduction. And we ought not believe that we can somehow buy off Pacific island nations with pitifully small amounts of foreign aid money that, in the words of the government, will enable them to build climate resilience into their economies and their communities when, in fact, it will do next to nothing to help our Pacific island neighbours avoid the most serious impacts of the disruption to our climate—which half of this government don't believe is being caused by humans and which the other half are not prepared to take the required action on because they have been bought off by the fossil fuel sector.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2018-09-13,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (10:12):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the associated bill. I would note that the bill is, I think rather fittingly, the first bill I am taking through this chamber, and I'm very happy and proud that it is this particular bill.


First of all, I'd like to thank those opposite for their support for this very important bill. I think bipartisanship on this particular issue for our Pacific neighbours is particularly important. Before I go into the specifics of the bill, I would like to address a number of the issues raised by the two Greens senators speaking on this. I think there are a number of areas where they have grossly misrepresented the nature and the benefits of this PACER agreement. Also, clearly, they have no understanding of the strategic context. So I'd like to deal with both of those first.


In relation to the issue of who is joining this, 11 Pacific countries, as we know, have engaged in this already. In relation to the issue of Papua New Guinea, we would note that this is not the end of the agreement; this is just the start. The nations that are still considering joining this agreement are of course very welcome, but I would point out to the Greens that this is a sovereign decision of those nations. In relation to several comments from Senators McKim and Hanson-Young, I'd make this point: like my colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells, I found them extremely patronising to those nations involved. These negotiations have been extensive and they have been done with the utmost mutual respect on behalf of all of the nations involved. Our officials and the former minister, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, as we've heard, were deeply engaged in this process. But I don't think the senators stopped to think about that or about our trade negotiators, who have spent many months, if not years, on these negotiations. I think that to suggest they were bullying or intimidating our partners in the region is, quite frankly, insulting, and the facts certainly do not bear that out.


In relation to the bill itself, PACER Plus is a regional-development-centred trade agreement. That is why I'm particularly proud to be taking the bill through this chamber today. To date, PACER Plus, as I said, has been signed by 11 member of the Pacific Islands Forum—that is, Australia, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. As I said, this is just the start, and negotiations and discussions still continue with other nations. 


PACER Plus will provide commercial opportunities for Australian exporters and investors in a range of sectors. These opportunities will increase over time as the provisions of the agreement lead to more open and transparent policies as wider relationships are built regionally and beyond. The agreement itself reflects Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific island countries' commitment to the principles of free and open trade. The underlying impetus for negotiating the PACER Plus and its goals of regional commercial integration is the formation of an interconnected Pacific market that includes Australia and New Zealand, which will enable the Pacific Islands greater access to a larger market for their own consumers and also for their producers, and that is a very good thing. 


Despite the somewhat patronising and insulting comments from the Greens, I would just like to remind those in this chamber what this agreement is actually about. Australia and the Pacific island countries are longstanding partners and friends. We have common interests in both economic progress and regional stability. Our partners in the region range from countries richly endowed with people and resources to small atolls with geographically isolated populations. The PACER Plus agreement reflects this diversity as a comprehensive free trade agreement tailored to help Pacific island countries address their specific development challenges and also to assist them in a very sovereign respectful way to better participate in global trade and engage more effectively into global markets. 


The coalition government has the most ambitious trade agenda in Australia's history. PACER Plus, a unique trade agreement to drive economic prosperity and raise living standards in our region, will complement our trade agreements already in force, which, I would note very happily, are delivering record export growth and creating hundreds of thousands of more local jobs. 


As Senator Fierravanti-Wells has said, this is not a policy done in isolation and it is an important part of the objectives of Australia's white paper—and, again, I commend Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her role in developing this. The Foreign policy white paper has an important process called stepping up. Stepping up support for a more resilient Pacific is one of five priorities for Australia's foreign policy and is set out in the 2017 Foreign policy white paper released only 12 months ago. The white paper states that the Pacific is of fundamental importance to Australia and that 'Australia will engage with the Pacific with greater intensity and ambition'. 


The white paper also announced new regional security cooperation initiatives, including the Australia Pacific Security College and work to improve regional information sharing. And we on this side of the chamber, and also the Labor Party, can see that this is an important role for Australia to play in our region. The white paper further reinforces the announcements made by Prime Minister Turnbull at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting year that Australia would step up its engagement through three things—that is, stronger partnerships for economic growth; stronger partnerships for security; and stronger relationships between people—and our PACER Plus agreement assists and works in all three of those areas. 


Australia's longstanding development assistance to the Pacific has helped address many of the acute challenges facing the region over many years, including climate change and responding to natural disasters; sustaining economic growth and boosting education, skills and jobs for growing populations; gender equality and recognising the central role women play in achieving better development outcomes for their nations; the threat of major disease outbreak; and, increasingly, the threat of transnational crime across the Pacific. However, we do recognise that the complexities of these challenges demand deeper engagement, integrated policy and fresh ideas to drive transformative change in the region, and this is where PACER Plus assists in that process. Australia's stepped-up engagement is our response to these significant long-term challenges.


In relation to the bills, while PACER Plus provides a framework for integration, dedicated assistance is critical to barriers in Pacific Islands signatories and unlocking the benefits PACER Plus provides for this assistance. The PACER Plus bills represent the key legislative changes required to give effect to the new rules of origin required to implement PACER Plus. The Customs Act 1901 is being amended to include the new rules-of-origin requirements and to enable a full set of related product-specific rules to be made in keeping with our modern free trade agreements. The amendments contained in the legislation will enable eligible goods that satisfy PACER Plus rules of origin to be entered into Australia at preferential rates of customs duty. The Customs Tariff Act 1995 is being amended to set out the preferential rate of customs duty for goods that satisfy the new rules-of-origin requirements. These new rules are consistent with existing arrangements for duties imposed on excise equivalent goods. 


Without these amendments, Australia would not be able to complete its domestic arrangements, and the agreement would not be able to enter into force. This would prevent Australian businesses from receiving the various benefits that would flow from the agreement, but it would also prevent the equally significant, if not more significant, benefits that would flow to the PACER Plus partners. It is important that Australia be amongst the first eight countries to ratify, as early ratification would signal Australia's commitment to PACER Plus. As we've talked about in this chamber and in other places many times, PACER Plus is very important for the maintenance of rules based order and rules based trade in the Indo-Pacific region. As I said, PACER Plus does provide commercial opportunities for Australian exporters and investors in a wide range of sectors. These opportunities will increase over time as the provision of the agreement will lead to more open and transparent policies, both here and across the other 10 partners who have already signed up. This agreement reflects our principles of free and open trade and rules based trade. PACER Plus will enter into force 60 days after the eighth signatory notifies Tonga, as the depositary, that it has ratified the agreement.


I'd just like to come back to the point that the Greens made in relation to the 11 countries who are ratifying this and are initial signatories. They specifically raised Fiji and Papua New Guinea. As I've noted in this place, PACER Plus is a truly regional agreement which has 11 Pacific Islands Forum members. PACER Plus will deliver benefits for these nations. Despite the assertions of those on the Greens benches, this hasn't been done in a way that is disrespectful of these nations' sovereignty and it is not disrespectful of those governments. This has been done over an extended period of time with them as partners. Extensive engagement has been undertaken by these nations. In fact, the information that I have back from the minister and the teams who were responsible for this at the time is that this was done in a truly respectful way. We listened to our Pacific partners. There was wide consultation.


The development assistance that is so important that is embedded in this agreement was worked out with each of the individual Pacific island nations, to find out what they needed for this. I would say—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—to my Greens colleagues in this chamber: this was done with them as full sovereign partners in the process. It was done in a new way to provide the development assistance from Australia and New Zealand that these nations recognise that they need to develop their capability, their processes, their systems and their trade regulations and legislation to make sure that they can engage in the international trade environment.


The Customs Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus Implementation) Bill 2018 represent the main legislative changes for the new rules of origin under PACER Plus. 


With those comments I again thank those opposite in the Labor Party for their engagement and support for these bills, I thank all those officials who were engaged in these negotiations for that time, and I also commend the government for this agreement, because I as the minister now responsible think that this is the way forward for our free trade agreements: to not only look at how we as a nation might benefit from this process but also assist other nations and other regional partners, ensuring they are capable of maintaining sovereign trade interests and trade with other countries where their size and their location may in the past have prohibited them from doing so. I commend these bills to the Senate.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:48):  At the request of Senators Moore and Duniam, I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


(i) increased immunisation of children, which is essential for protecting them against diseases including pneumonia, polio, rotavirus diarrhoea, meningococcal and measles, now saves the lives of 2 to 3 million children per year – nevertheless, 1.5 million children still die each year globally from vaccine-preventable diseases,


(ii) in 2017, 85 % of children globally received the full course of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine, a key measure of vaccine coverage, however this left nearly 20 million children not covered by this vaccine,


(iii) globally, 85 % of children receive the polio vaccine, however gaps in polio vaccine coverage allow some children to contract the disease, with 15 cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2018 so far,


(iv) Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, to which Australia has been a consistent contributor, has supported the vaccination of more than 690 million children, and saved an estimated 9 million lives – in December 2018, Gavi will hold a mid­-term review to assess what changes to its strategy are needed to achieve increased and equitable access to vaccines, and


(v) Australia also partners with the World Bank Group to support countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific to strengthen immunisation systems and help ensure they are sustainably financed and managed;


(b) recognises that:


(i) Australia co-sponsored a resolution at the 2017 World Health Assembly to accelerate access to vaccines, calling for the extension of immunisation services beyond infancy, increasing domestic financing, and strengthening international cooperation to achieve global vaccination goals, and


(ii) funding to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), to which Australia contributes, is due to decline as polio nears eradication – this funding covers one-fifth of the World Health Organization's (WHO) costs, and accounts for a high proportion of the health and vaccination workforce in several countries, and GPEI and WHO are undertaking transition planning to ensure that skilled staff and services remain in countries where polio has been eradicated; and


(c) calls on the Australian Government to:


(i) participate in planning to accelerate progress in making vaccines available to all children, including through the Gavi mid-term review, and


(ii) work with countries now receiving polio support and multilateral agencies to ensure that transition from GPEI funding results in increased resources for other health and vaccination programs.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:37):  I move:


That the Social Security (Parenting payment participation requirements – classes of persons) Instrument 2018 (No. 1), made under subsection 500(2) of the Social Security Act 1991, be disallowed [F2018L00238].


This relates to a disallowance on the Social Security (Parenting payment participation requirements—classes of persons) Instrument 2018 (No. 1). This instrument specifies two classes of persons—specifically, the targeted participant and the intensive participant. These two classes of persons correspond with the two program streams—specifically, the targeted stream and the intensive stream—under the national expansion of the ParentsNext program in all non-remote areas of Australia that commenced on 2 July this year. This instrument supports the expansion of the ParentsNext program. This is about the ParentsNext program.


This exemption will impact 68,000 parents annually. Approximately 96 per cent of participants will be women, and 10,000 of these women will be First Nations peoples. ParentsNext is a pre-employment, compliance based program for parenting payment recipients with young children—mostly women—with the aim, supposedly, of helping them with their education and training or employment goals. Ultimately, the program is designed to increase the work readiness of parents by the time their youngest child is six and to increase female participation in the workforce. The national expansion of the program follows a trial in 10 locations from 4 April 2016 to 30 June this year. By 31 May this year, 24,109 people had participated in the trial.


As I mentioned earlier, this expanded program has two streams. The intensive stream will be operating in the 10 existing trial locations and in 20 additional locations that have a high proportion of First Nations peoples who are receiving the parenting payment. Those who are still participating in the trial of the program at the rollout date will have been transitioned to the intensive stream of the expanded ParentsNext program. The targeted stream will be delivered in jobactive employment regions across the country, except in the locations that the intensive stream will be operating in. In the instrument, two classes of persons are set out for those two streams; for each, it specifies that the parent must: have a child under the age of six, have been receiving the parenting payment for at least six months and have not been receiving income from employment in the last six months. I want you to remember that point about not receiving income for the last six months, because I'll come back to that matter later; it is one of the issues that we have with the program.


In addition, for a parent to be within the scope of the intensive stream, they must either be an early school leaver, where their youngest child is at least six months old—inother words, predominantly women, by far, are expected to be participating in this when their youngest child, their baby, is six months old—or be highly disadvantaged, where their youngest child is at least six months old or they have a youngest child aged five years of age. For a parent who was within the scope of the targeted stream, they must also be an early school leaver, where their youngest child is at least one; be highly disadvantaged, where their youngest child is at least three; or be from a jobless family, where their youngest child is at least five or they have a youngest child aged five years of age. In other words, they are trying to capture anybody who is on the parenting payment whose youngest child is aged at least five. Basically, any parent receiving the parenting payment for more than six months without receiving income from employment will be subjected to this program when their youngest child turns five. Many, though, will be subjected to it much earlier, with two of the three additional criteria for the intensive stream requiring parents to commence when their youngest child is six months old—remember that. It's when their baby is six months old.


The criteria for the intensive stream participants, which I mentioned above, differ from the criteria used for the trial. Previously, parents receiving the pensioner education supplement in the three months immediately prior to the addition to the parenting payment were not within the scope of the criteria for the trial. The government removed this additional exemption when drafting this instrument that we are discussing today. This is one of the issues that we have with this instrument. This means that those already undertaking education—such as year 12, certificate III or higher education—will be included in the scope of the eligible parents for both streams, even though they are already studying. In other words, even though they are already doing the thing that the government wants them to be doing, they are subjected to this trial. This makes you wonder why the government is including them when they are already studying.


There are also limited ways for participants to exit the program, specifically: when their youngest child turns six, if they cease receiving the parenting payment, if they move to a remote area or if they gain stable employment. Notably, taking up study is absent from this list. The definition of 'stable' is questionable, because I know, or I've heard from, people who have employment who are included on this program. If they're in employment, they shouldn't be included in the program; but people are being caught up in the program even when they're working.


Those who fall within the classes of persons for the two streams are required to engage with their choice of ParentsNext provider and create a participation plan with this provider that they then must adhere to. Because the participants of the rolled out program are also going to be subject to the targeted new compliance framework, which passed through the Senate earlier and came into effect from 1 July this year, they will receive payment suspensions if they do not meet a requirement—for instance, if they fail to agree to a participation plan, fail to attend an appointment or fail to comply with their participation plan. If they do not have a reasonable excuse for failing to meet a requirement they will receive a demerit point. Once they accrue five demerit points they will be subject to financial penalties for each subsequent demerit point they accrue, up to eight. As of the—

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-09-13,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:44):  I rise to contribute to the concurrent debate on the Education and Other Legislation Amendment (VET Student Loan Debt Separation) Bill 2018 and the Student Loans (Overseas Debtors Repayment Levy) Amendment Bill 2018. The VET student loan debt separation bill will amend the VET Student Loans Act and the Higher Education Support Act to establish VET student loans as a separate program under the VET Student Loans Act. The second overseas debtors repayment levy amendment bill will amend the Student Loans (Overseas Debtor Repayment Levy) Act to ensure that arrangements for students with VET student loan debt who are living overseas are updated to reflect the changes in these bills.


Labor cautiously supports these bills. While Labor supports increased transparency regarding student loans, this bill reminds us of all the work that needs to be done to ensure that we have a world-class postsecondary education and training system. Tweaking the current system will not deal with the profound systemic problems that we know exist in the VET system; nor will it deal with the inequalities that have grown as student loans have expanded and costs have been shifted onto young people, including apprentices and trainees. This bill reminds us that the coalition government doesn't care enough, or have the capacity, to do the hard work that needs to be done to build a better postsecondary education system.


Effective vocational education and skill formation is essential to national economic and social prosperity. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has ripped more than $3 billion out of TAFE skills and training funding over the past five years and has presided over the fall of more than 140,000 apprenticeships and traineeships. That's a lot of lives interrupted, because of the action of this government.


In towns and regional centres across Australia, TAFE campuses have closed, courses have been scaled back and fees have been increased. Nationally there has been a 30 per cent drop in government funded training happening at TAFE since this coalition government came into office.


The training regulator ASQA openly recognises that the training market has created what they call 'a race to the bottom', with fast turnaround and poor quality training putting enormous pressure on quality education and training providers like TAFE.


VET FEE-HELP turbocharged rorting where profiteering and dishonest private providers targeted students and saddled them with unfair debt. The government sat on its hands while corrupt for-profit trading providers, like Careers Australia, reeled in hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.


The future of TAFE is an issue of great national importance, but this internally riven government consistently washes its hands of it. They have no answers on jobs, no answers on skills, no answers on vocational education and no answers on TAFE. Now more than ever we need a postschool education and training system that works for every Australian. We know that the progress we need isn't being delivered in the system that this government is operating today.


In its first 100 days in government, Labor will establish a once-in-a-generation commission of review into postsecondary education. The sweeping inquiry will look at every aspect of the vocational and higher education systems to ensure that they can best respond to the needs of the Australian economy and our society. Labor's commitment to TAFE is unequivocal. TAFE is the backbone of our skills and vocational education sector. Only Labor will get rid of the rorting and guarantee secure and stable funding for TAFE, skills and apprenticeships. Labor has made the committee that at least two-thirds of public funding will go to the TAFE network, with the balance going to not-for-profit community educators, and only high-quality private providers, with demonstrable links to industry. Labor will waive the up-front fees for 100,000 students to attend TAFE and invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country. Labor will ensure that at least one in 10 jobs on priority Commonwealth-funded projects are done by an apprentice or a trainee. Labor will provide 10,000 pre-apprenticeships for young people wanting to learn a trade and 20,000 adult apprenticeships for older workers who want to or need to retrain. A government without a plan for education and training has no plan for Australia's future. It's clear that the members of the Morrison government have no plan beyond saving their own jobs.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:51):  The Education and Other Legislation Amendment (VET Student Loan Debt Separation) Bill 2018 enables the separation of VET student loan debts from other forms of higher education loan program debts. This bill also enables a clearer and more effective transition of approved courses eligible for VET student loans.


Vocational education and training is central to Australia's economic prosperity and employment outcomes for students. For the benefit of senators, I would like to outline how these changes will improve our system for students, employers and policymakers. Income contingent loans in VET help achieve this prosperity by assisting students to access higher-level VET qualifications. The government supports income contingent loans. Without them, students would miss out if they could not afford to pay full tuition fees to undertake high-level VET qualifications. 


The VET Student Loans program provides capped income contingent loans to students undertaking higher-level VET qualification. With over a year of the program being in force, it is clear that it is meeting its objectives. Completion rates are up and the course list is successfully balancing industry needs, employment outcomes and student choice. This is imperative if Australia's economy is going to have the skills sector that reacts to demand and an education system that fulfils the promises of employment to students. 


The capping of loans to $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000, with the exception of aviation courses, given their high cost of delivery, has limited the excessive price gouging experienced under VET FEE-HELP. In addition, payments in arrears and student progression requirements are ensuring that loan amounts are being paid for genuine students, putting an end to unacceptable enrolment practices in the now closed VET FEE-HELP scheme. With these measures successfully achieving their objectives, this bill will better measure the program's fiscal sustainability. 


There is currently limited capacity to measure the sustainability of the VET Student Loans program, because debtor HELP repayments are not disaggregated by loan type. Irrespective of whether the debt applies to a HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP, SA-HELP, OS-HELP, historical VET FEE-HELP, or VET student loans assistance, loan repayments are made towards a single aggregated HELP debt. This means the government cannot accurately determine what proportion of which form of HELP assistance paid by the government has been repaid by debtors. Similarly, where a HELP debt is not being repaid, it is not possible to identify the form of HELP assistance the debt relates to. This bill will separate VET student loan debts from other forms HELP debts, providing greater transparency of repayment rates for VET students and better information to inform policy decisions and the public. This information will be vital to delivering a responsive skills education system for students and employers. 


From 1 July 2019, individuals who incur a VET student loan debt will access a separate statement of account for their VET student loan debt. From 1 July 2020, the individual's notice of assessment will display VET student loan repayment details. This bill will enable more timely, transparent and accurate reporting on the financial sustainability of the VET Student Loans program and support greater public accountability of the program. The repayment thresholds, repayment rates, renewable HELP balance and indexation with respect to VET student loan debts will be the same as the repayment thresholds, repayment rates, renewable HELP balance and indexation for HELP debts. A person must start repaying a debt in relation to a VET student loan once they have finished repaying any HELP debts. Consistent with existing arrangements for HELP debts, persons residing overseas who have a VET student loan debt will be required to make repayments with respect to those debts. 


A key feature of the success of the VET Student Loans program is the course list—the VET Student Loans (Courses and Loan Caps) Determination 2016. This bill also enables better continuity and more flexibility in delivering approved courses for VET student loan providers—providers who have proven their quality through a rigorous application process. Loans are only available for courses on the course list. This list ensures students are only incurring a debt for courses that have a high national priority, meet industry needs, contribute to addressing skills shortages and align with strong employment outcomes. The list is updated twice yearly. Courses are specified by reference to their course code. If a course becomes superseded or noncurrent, or if a course is reaccredited, students cannot be approved for loans to undertake the new version of the course until the course list is updated. Each time the list is updated, a number of courses are replaced by the superseding or reaccredited version. The bill lays the groundwork for the course list to refer to the National Register as defined in section 3 of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011. The National Register is the authoritative information source on nationally recognised VET courses and training packages and their status. By enabling the course list to refer to the National Register, students will be able to be approved for a loan when a course on the list is replaced without having to wait months for the list to be updated. It is not possible to include anticipated replacement courses on the list. We considered alternatives before coming to the conclusion that referring to the National Register is the best approach.


The VET system is dynamic. A key feature is the capacity to provide nationally recognised training to build skills across almost every industry and sector in the Australian economy through over 2,000 courses. Qualifications developed under training packages are reviewed by industry on a regular basis, with the Australian Industry and Skills Committee meeting six times a year to consider course updates. A qualification only gets a course code once it is included in the National Register. The accreditation of accredited courses is considered by the relevant VET regulator. The regulator can determine to extend the currency of a course until the accreditation of the course is reviewed and approved. Reaccredited courses are assigned course codes once approved and put on the National Register. It is not possible for the course list to predict what courses will be considered and approved by the Australian Industry and Skills Committee or VET regulators in advance; nor will those courses be allocated a course code until they are approved. Updating the course list to refer to the latest version of the course on the National Register won't open up the course list and doesn't change the methodology for adding courses to the list. It just ensures that students are not disadvantaged when a course is replaced. The National Register already has clear linkages between current and superseded or expired training package courses. This ensures that students will only be able to access loans for courses that supersede training package courses on the National Register. We are working to make further changes to the National Register to ensure the accreditation of accredited courses is also clearly indicated on the National Register. These changes are expected to be made before the determination is updated to refer to the National Register. The integrity of the VET Student Loans program will not be compromised.


In addition, I would like to clarify some points that have been raised in relation to this bill. The Senate committee has reviewed the bill and found that it should be passed, with some comments made by the Greens and Labor. In reference to the comments made, the committee found that, while questions around policy differences relating to different forms of higher level education are worth examining, the committee has not received enough evidence to support the changes these submitters advocate. In addition to this, the committee saw many wide-ranging views provided to it in relation to the broader education policy, including that there should be a wholesale overhaul of the system. However, the committee believed that such suggestions were outside the scope of the committee's inquiry. Finally and importantly, the committee found that, if enacted, the bills will ensure that both policymakers and students have access to more accurate information to help inform future decisions. The committee concluded that improved accountability and fiscal sustainability are worth pursuing, and it therefore supports the bills in their entirety.


I would also like to quickly note that changes were made to the bill in the House earlier, which I will clarify for senators. Parliamentary amendments made by the House to the Education and Other Legislation Amendment (VET Student Loan Debt Separation) Bill provided for a renewable HELP balance so that VET student loan debtors' repayments, both voluntary and compulsory, will offset their HELP balance. This will apply from 2020 for repayments made after the 2019-20 financial year. These amendments are consistent with parliamentary amendments to the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Act 2018. The parliament amendments also include minor technical amendments, some that are consequential to the enactment of the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Act 2018. The others are related to the rounding down of amounts at certain steps of the calculation of a person's accumulated VET student loan debt. The amendments relating to the rounding down of amounts ensure that the Australian Taxation Office, which deals with the collection and repayment of student debts, has absolute consistency with the existing arrangements for HELP debts under HESA.


The former Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, the Hon. Karen Andrews MP, tabled a correction and addendum to the explanatory memorandum for the VET student loan debt separation bill in the House, which responds to the Senate's Scrutiny of Bills Committee's request for more information on a provision in the VET student loan debt separation bill that applies an offence of absolute liability. As I've discussed, targeting access to higher-level VET qualifications that industry needs and that are associated with strong employment outcomes is the key objective of the VET student loan program. I commend the bill.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:44):  I rise to contribute to the concurrent debate on the Education and Other Legislation Amendment (VET Student Loan Debt Separation) Bill 2018 and the Student Loans (Overseas Debtors Repayment Levy) Amendment Bill 2018. The VET student loan debt separation bill will amend the VET Student Loans Act and the Higher Education Support Act to establish VET student loans as a separate program under the VET Student Loans Act. The second overseas debtors repayment levy amendment bill will amend the Student Loans (Overseas Debtor Repayment Levy) Act to ensure that arrangements for students with VET student loan debt who are living overseas are updated to reflect the changes in these bills.


Labor cautiously supports these bills. While Labor supports increased transparency regarding student loans, this bill reminds us of all the work that needs to be done to ensure that we have a world-class postsecondary education and training system. Tweaking the current system will not deal with the profound systemic problems that we know exist in the VET system; nor will it deal with the inequalities that have grown as student loans have expanded and costs have been shifted onto young people, including apprentices and trainees. This bill reminds us that the coalition government doesn't care enough, or have the capacity, to do the hard work that needs to be done to build a better postsecondary education system.


Effective vocational education and skill formation is essential to national economic and social prosperity. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has ripped more than $3 billion out of TAFE skills and training funding over the past five years and has presided over the fall of more than 140,000 apprenticeships and traineeships. That's a lot of lives interrupted, because of the action of this government.


In towns and regional centres across Australia, TAFE campuses have closed, courses have been scaled back and fees have been increased. Nationally there has been a 30 per cent drop in government funded training happening at TAFE since this coalition government came into office.


The training regulator ASQA openly recognises that the training market has created what they call 'a race to the bottom', with fast turnaround and poor quality training putting enormous pressure on quality education and training providers like TAFE.


VET FEE-HELP turbocharged rorting where profiteering and dishonest private providers targeted students and saddled them with unfair debt. The government sat on its hands while corrupt for-profit trading providers, like Careers Australia, reeled in hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.


The future of TAFE is an issue of great national importance, but this internally riven government consistently washes its hands of it. They have no answers on jobs, no answers on skills, no answers on vocational education and no answers on TAFE. Now more than ever we need a postschool education and training system that works for every Australian. We know that the progress we need isn't being delivered in the system that this government is operating today.


In its first 100 days in government, Labor will establish a once-in-a-generation commission of review into postsecondary education. The sweeping inquiry will look at every aspect of the vocational and higher education systems to ensure that they can best respond to the needs of the Australian economy and our society. Labor's commitment to TAFE is unequivocal. TAFE is the backbone of our skills and vocational education sector. Only Labor will get rid of the rorting and guarantee secure and stable funding for TAFE, skills and apprenticeships. Labor has made the committee that at least two-thirds of public funding will go to the TAFE network, with the balance going to not-for-profit community educators, and only high-quality private providers, with demonstrable links to industry. Labor will waive the up-front fees for 100,000 students to attend TAFE and invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country. Labor will ensure that at least one in 10 jobs on priority Commonwealth-funded projects are done by an apprentice or a trainee. Labor will provide 10,000 pre-apprenticeships for young people wanting to learn a trade and 20,000 adult apprenticeships for older workers who want to or need to retrain. A government without a plan for education and training has no plan for Australia's future. It's clear that the members of the Morrison government have no plan beyond saving their own jobs. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,14,2,speech
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-09-13,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:51):  The Education and Other Legislation Amendment (VET Student Loan Debt Separation) Bill 2018 enables the separation of VET student loan debts from other forms of higher education loan program debts. This bill also enables a clearer and more effective transition of approved courses eligible for VET student loans.


Vocational education and training is central to Australia's economic prosperity and employment outcomes for students. For the benefit of senators, I would like to outline how these changes will improve our system for students, employers and policymakers. Income contingent loans in VET help achieve this prosperity by assisting students to access higher-level VET qualifications. The government supports income contingent loans. Without them, students would miss out if they could not afford to pay full tuition fees to undertake high-level VET qualifications. 


The VET Student Loans program provides capped income contingent loans to students undertaking higher-level VET qualification. With over a year of the program being in force, it is clear that it is meeting its objectives. Completion rates are up and the course list is successfully balancing industry needs, employment outcomes and student choice. This is imperative if Australia's economy is going to have the skills sector that reacts to demand and an education system that fulfils the promises of employment to students. 


The capping of loans to $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000, with the exception of aviation courses, given their high cost of delivery, has limited the excessive price gouging experienced under VET FEE-HELP. In addition, payments in arrears and student progression requirements are ensuring that loan amounts are being paid for genuine students, putting an end to unacceptable enrolment practices in the now closed VET FEE-HELP scheme. With these measures successfully achieving their objectives, this bill will better measure the program's fiscal sustainability. 


There is currently limited capacity to measure the sustainability of the VET Student Loans program, because debtor HELP repayments are not disaggregated by loan type. Irrespective of whether the debt applies to a HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP, SA-HELP, OS-HELP, historical VET FEE-HELP, or VET student loans assistance, loan repayments are made towards a single aggregated HELP debt. This means the government cannot accurately determine what proportion of which form of HELP assistance paid by the government has been repaid by debtors. Similarly, where a HELP debt is not being repaid, it is not possible to identify the form of HELP assistance the debt relates to. This bill will separate VET student loan debts from other forms HELP debts, providing greater transparency of repayment rates for VET students and better information to inform policy decisions and the public. This information will be vital to delivering a responsive skills education system for students and employers. 


From 1 July 2019, individuals who incur a VET student loan debt will access a separate statement of account for their VET student loan debt. From 1 July 2020, the individual's notice of assessment will display VET student loan repayment details. This bill will enable more timely, transparent and accurate reporting on the financial sustainability of the VET Student Loans program and support greater public accountability of the program. The repayment thresholds, repayment rates, renewable HELP balance and indexation with respect to VET student loan debts will be the same as the repayment thresholds, repayment rates, renewable HELP balance and indexation for HELP debts. A person must start repaying a debt in relation to a VET student loan once they have finished repaying any HELP debts. Consistent with existing arrangements for HELP debts, persons residing overseas who have a VET student loan debt will be required to make repayments with respect to those debts. 


A key feature of the success of the VET Student Loans program is the course list—the VET Student Loans (Courses and Loan Caps) Determination 2016. This bill also enables better continuity and more flexibility in delivering approved courses for VET student loan providers—providers who have proven their quality through a rigorous application process. Loans are only available for courses on the course list. This list ensures students are only incurring a debt for courses that have a high national priority, meet industry needs, contribute to addressing skills shortages and align with strong employment outcomes. The list is updated twice yearly. Courses are specified by reference to their course code. If a course becomes superseded or noncurrent, or if a course is reaccredited, students cannot be approved for loans to undertake the new version of the course until the course list is updated. Each time the list is updated, a number of courses are replaced by the superseding or reaccredited version. The bill lays the groundwork for the course list to refer to the National Register as defined in section 3 of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011. The National Register is the authoritative information source on nationally recognised VET courses and training packages and their status. By enabling the course list to refer to the National Register, students will be able to be approved for a loan when a course on the list is replaced without having to wait months for the list to be updated. It is not possible to include anticipated replacement courses on the list. We considered alternatives before coming to the conclusion that referring to the National Register is the best approach.


The VET system is dynamic. A key feature is the capacity to provide nationally recognised training to build skills across almost every industry and sector in the Australian economy through over 2,000 courses. Qualifications developed under training packages are reviewed by industry on a regular basis, with the Australian Industry and Skills Committee meeting six times a year to consider course updates. A qualification only gets a course code once it is included in the National Register. The accreditation of accredited courses is considered by the relevant VET regulator. The regulator can determine to extend the currency of a course until the accreditation of the course is reviewed and approved. Reaccredited courses are assigned course codes once approved and put on the National Register. It is not possible for the course list to predict what courses will be considered and approved by the Australian Industry and Skills Committee or VET regulators in advance; nor will those courses be allocated a course code until they are approved. Updating the course list to refer to the latest version of the course on the National Register won't open up the course list and doesn't change the methodology for adding courses to the list. It just ensures that students are not disadvantaged when a course is replaced. The National Register already has clear linkages between current and superseded or expired training package courses. This ensures that students will only be able to access loans for courses that supersede training package courses on the National Register. We are working to make further changes to the National Register to ensure the accreditation of accredited courses is also clearly indicated on the National Register. These changes are expected to be made before the determination is updated to refer to the National Register. The integrity of the VET Student Loans program will not be compromised.


In addition, I would like to clarify some points that have been raised in relation to this bill. The Senate committee has reviewed the bill and found that it should be passed, with some comments made by the Greens and Labor. In reference to the comments made, the committee found that, while questions around policy differences relating to different forms of higher level education are worth examining, the committee has not received enough evidence to support the changes these submitters advocate.

It's, of course, up to the Labor Party in the House of Representatives to do whatever they want to do. It's up to the Labor Party. This was and would be an entirely partisan political attack. There's no legal basis on which to pursue this. There's no legal basis on which to pursue it. There's no uncertainty. The legal advice is very clear, and I refer you in particular to the Solicitor-General's advice, which states: 'Section 44(v) … applies only where there is an ""agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth"".' And in his opinion there is 'no agreement in which Mr Dutton could have an indirect pecuniary interest by virtue of his status as a beneficiary of the RHT Family Trust'.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-09-13,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Farrell today relating to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Dutton).


The question that I asked Senator Cormann at the beginning of question time today was not simply a rhetorical question. In fact, it has serious consequences for the validity and the eligibility of our Minister for Home Affairs, Minister Dutton, to sit in the House of Representatives. A couple of weeks ago, the deposed former Prime Minister, Prime Minister Turnbull, sought legal advice from the Solicitor-General as to the eligibility of Mr Dutton to sit in the parliament. Unfortunately for Mr Dutton, of course, that advice was equivocal. The Solicitor-General didn't come to any finalised decision on the matter. So the matter, therefore, as to Mr Dutton's eligibility is still an open question. One can imagine, of course, that had Mr Dutton got three more votes he'd now be Prime Minister and we'd be debating an even more serious set of circumstances. But it's serious enough to have question marks over the validity of our home affairs minister. The home affairs minister makes all sorts of decisions that are extremely important to the security of this country, and there shouldn't be one iota of doubt.


Now, who's raising the issue of Mr Dutton's eligibility and the question as to whether he does meet that eligibility? It's not the Labor Party. We find today that, from New York, the deposed former Prime Minister Mr Turnbull is saying to his former colleagues in the Liberal Party in the government of this country that there's a question mark over Mr Dutton's eligibility to sit in this place that needs to be clarified. As Senator Macdonald would know, before Mr Turnbull came into this place he was a very, very experienced lawyer. He did a number of major cases—the Spycatcher case comes to mind. He was a very, very good lawyer. In fact, he probably should have stuck to law rather than going into politics, as luck would have it. It's his view that there are question marks over Mr Dutton's eligibility. He's saying that.


But it's not just Mr Turnbull who's raising these questions. Julie Bishop—the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party a couple of weeks ago—was a lawyer before she came into this place. I know she was a very good lawyer. She was two years behind me at the University of Adelaide Law School, so I know for a fact that she would have got a very, very good legal education. What's she saying? What is the former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, a former lawyer and foreign minister, saying about Mr Dutton's eligibility? She's saying that when this issue gets back to the parliament at some stage—one imagines next week—she's going to make up her mind about whether or not she's going to vote for the referral of Mr Dutton.


It's my view that there shouldn't be a question mark over Mr Dutton. There shouldn't be a question mark over the decisions that he might be making about important issues of national security. The issue needs to be resolved. Of course, there is a very simple way of resolving this, and it is how it was dealt with for a whole host of former MPs and senators. Mr Dutton can take the initiative and refer himself. We now know what the Solicitor-General says: his advice is inconclusive. We know what Mr Turnbull is saying; he's saying: 'Look, this issue needs to be determined. It needs to be determined quickly. It needs to be determined by the only authority that can determine the issue, and that's the High Court.' We now have the former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Ms Bishop, questioning whether she's going to support or not support Mr Dutton. This is a dysfunctional government at the moment. We need to have a government focused on the people; not on themselves. (Time expired)

I can only think that Senator Farrell may have been imbibing too much of his own wonderful wine with that presentation he just gave! He said the government should be concentrating on policy issues and on the people of Australia. Have a look at question time today. The government asked serious policy questions all the way through, and I'm delighted to—




Senator McCarthy:
  A point of order: unparliamentary language against a fellow senator.




Senator McAllister:
  On a point of order: Senator Macdonald reflected inappropriately on Senator Farrell in his remarks earlier and he ought to withdraw.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  If Senator Farrell had taken the point of order, I would have apologised, but he obviously took it in the spirit it was given. He's a wonderful man. I'm not for a moment suggesting he's drinking during the day. I was really giving him a free advertisement for his wonderful Farrell Wines, and that's what he should be concentrating on. This is a ridiculous point of order and typical of the Labor Party.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald has further explained what he meant. Unfortunately, I didn't hear it and nor did the Clerk. Please continue, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  If you had heard it you wouldn't have thought there was anything improper about it, as Senator Farrell clearly didn't. I can't understand the Labor Party sometimes.


Here we on this side are asking serious policy questions. I was delighted to be able to ask the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, Senator Canavan, about the wonderful announcement today that Adani is building a new railway line in North Queensland and Central Queensland, joining the port of Abbot Point to the Carmichael mines. That will mean those Carmichael mines can go ahead with development, with creating real jobs for Central and North Queenslanders. It's an announcement today that has absolutely brightened my heart, and I might go and get one of my favourite wines, the Farrell red wine, to celebrate such a wonderful announcement.


But what did we get from the Labor Party? This is why I doubted Senator Farrell's sanity, in a nice way. He's accusing us of talking about ourselves and not about policy issues for the people of Australia. Every question today from members of the Labor Party was about parliamentarians, about the internal workings of the Liberal Party. Can I tell people: not many people on this side of the parliament are too interested in that and, I can assure you, neither is any other Australian. They are interested in things like real jobs for Australians that the Adani mines will bring. They're interested in the NBN rollout, new black spots and, as Senator McKenzie so eloquently announced, the many initiatives happening in rural and regional Australia.


But what did the Labor Party do? They talked about politicians. There was not one question about jobs; not one question about the economy; not one question about the disadvantaged in our community; not one question about infrastructure, about development, about the economy or about reducing Labor's debt; and not one question about the more than one million jobs that have been created since the Liberal-National government has been in power. These are all the issues that Australians are interested in, and the Labor Party, under their current leadership, took their whole hour to ask about internal party matters.


That's why Mr Shorten is so detested by the Australian public. As was said during question time, Mr Morrison has been in the job only a couple of weeks, but already he leads Mr Shorten in the opinion polls as the better Prime Minister. And it's no wonder, when he leads the 'rarble'—to quote a Labor Party senator—that you see over on the other side of this chamber. They're not a group of senators interested in Australians, interested in policy issues, interested in economic issues, interested in the disadvantaged—interested in the things that Australians are interested in. All the Labor Party seem to be interested in here is internal politics. I don't know why they didn't ask a question about Senator Cameron and former Minister Obeid, who was in Senator Keneally's cabinet, and the former minister the bad Ian Macdonald—




Senator Keneally:
  On a point of order: I'd like to point out that the minister has misled the parliament and I ask him to withdraw.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That's a debating point. Please continue, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Keneally was closely associated with Mr Obeid and the bad Ian Macdonald.




Senator Keneally:
  Point of order: again the senator has misled the parliament. He is invited to read the New South Wales ICAC transcripts, and I ask him to withdraw his comments.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  These are debating points.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You see how sensitive members of the Labor Party are when we talk about the bad Ian Macdonald—that is, the New South Wales Labor minister who is now in jail for corruption—or the other bad Labor minister, Mr Obeid, who's also in jail. These people were in the cabinet when Senator Keneally was there. Why didn't they talk about them? We don't talk about them; we talk about policy issues, the things that really interest Australians.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (15:15):  Every question was about parliamentarians, and there are reasons for that. These are legitimate questions that go to the heart of the capability—or incapability—of this government to govern for the people of Australia in a way that is filled with integrity. That goes to the heart of the issues that affect the people of Australia. The former deputy leader of the Liberal Party has stood up today and raised very serious questions about a minister, Peter Dutton, and his eligibility to be in the cabinet, to represent the people of Dickson and to continue to be paid as a member of the House of Representatives. That is a very serious question that is being asked not only by the former deputy leader of the Liberal Party but also by the former Prime Minister of this country, who only two weeks ago was leading this nation, but all of a sudden it's, 'Let's not have a look at this; that's old news.' It's not old news; it is very critical news. There is a doubt as to the eligibility of a minister in the Morrison government to be in this parliament, and it is our job as the opposition and as other members in the Senate to critically question and analyse all of that.


As Senator Farrell has said, we didn't raise this today because we just wanted to; we raised it because a member of your government raised it and a former member of your government—Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as he was then—raised it. Therefore, we have to look at this. When even the Solicitor-General's advice shows there is a risk with Peter Dutton's eligibility, we should be pursuing the fact that this has to go to the High Court. His eligibility to stand in the parliament is under question, it is under a cloud, and every single decision that he makes and even every single decision that he has already made are under a serious cloud.


Over the last 18 months many senators and members—yes, some after lots of deliberation—have chosen to go to the High Court for clarity. It is the right thing to do for Peter Dutton to stand up now and say, 'I will go to the High Court to have this clarified.' It is the right thing to do to remove that doubt and send a clear message to all Australians that we in this parliament do take this seriously and that decisions made in cabinet are being made by people who are eligible to be there. That is what is in question. Instead we see blame-shifting, a blame game—'Nothing to see here'—and the Australian people are sick of it. They're fed up with it.


You have unfinished business in that cabinet. Peter Dutton needs to refer himself to the High Court. There is no other question here other than whether he is eligible to be sitting there as the member for Dickson in the cabinet, making decisions on behalf of the Morrison government, representing the people of Australia. There is way too much doubt. When you have constitutional legal experts also raising that, the doubt is very clear. So it's not about the opposition playing games here. We are doing what we have to do—that is, keeping you accountable to make sure you are doing the right thing for the people of Australia.

Senator STOKER
 (Queensland) (15:20):  I am continually shocked by the short memories of those opposite in this chamber. As they come in here and preach to us about doing the right thing when it comes to section 44, they seem to have forgotten that for months and months Labor Party parliamentarians had not just some risk of being ineligible, not just a small doubt; they had absolutely no basis on which anyone could have misunderstood their status. They were clearly ineligible to sit in this parliament because of dual citizenship issues. Nevertheless, with almost a contempt for the rules that apply to this game, those opposite happily supported three members of their team continuing to participate in the decisions of this parliament and continuing to receive all of the benefits and privileges that come with holding these offices. It was only when they were dragged kicking and screaming and were ruled out by the High Court that they faced up to reality. 


Let's compare that to the way doubts about section 44 have been dealt with on this side of the chamber. I can say, with some comfort, that this has been dealt with ethically and in a way that respects the importance of Australia's Constitution every time an issue of this nature has cropped up on the coalition side of the room. When John Alexander came to find that circumstances existed that meant he had a problem, he immediately took measures to deal with it—immediately. When Barnaby Joyce had an issue and when Senator Canavan had an issue, they were up-front about dealing with it. Senator Canavan happily stood down from his ministry and happily did what had to be done because, more than anything else, his loyalty was to this country. 


So I am reluctant to accept the sanctimonious bleating of those opposite about the eligibility of Mr Dutton. They've pointed out just how important the decisions he has made in that role are, and can I say I wholeheartedly agree that in his role he is responsible for some enormously important work. He is part of a team who, along with Scott Morrison when he was Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, has completely brought to an end the saga of boat after boat after boat of asylum seekers arriving on our shores, risking their lives at sea. He has helped put an end to this cycle of deaths at sea in the cruellest of circumstances, and he has reconfigured our immigration policy to provide fairness to those people in desperate circumstances who seek refuge in this country but who do it by the book, who follow the proper processes, who apply in a transparent and honourable way. In doing so, he has not just vastly reduced the number of people who face detention; he has completely eliminated the situation of children being in detention. We don't have to think back very long to remember a time when Labor had thousands of children in detention because they simply could not stem the flow of boats arriving on our shores. But now we have a situation where we are getting through that backlog. All of the children are out, and we can confidently say we have a fairer and more transparent process for dealing with immigration and refugee issues in this country. 


I have complete confidence in his ability as a minister. I also note that he has been transparent in providing legal advice that he has received. The Solicitor-General's advice has been obtained. Does the advice 100 per cent, hand on heart, eliminate absolutely every potential option under the sun? Well, quite honestly, I haven't yet seen a lawyer's advice that does. All lawyers acknowledge the different constellations of circumstances that can change in time. But we have a conclusive answer in the legal advice. It's plain for all to see. It's time for those in the Labor Party to stop playing games and get on with the job of working for Australians.

"Keneally, Sen Kristina",ALP,2018-09-13,"



Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (15:25):  I rise to participate in this take note debate sparked by Senator Farrell's question reflecting on a tweet sent from New York City from the former Prime Minister Mr Malcolm Turnbull. There he is, exiled to New York, tweeting away, helpfully providing information and advice—and not just to his colleagues who remain back here in Australia. I suppose he could have done that by WhatsApp or a text message, but by tweeting he provides advice not just to his colleagues in the coalition but indeed to all Australians. What was that advice? It was that the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, should be consistent in the rules. The rule that applied to Barnaby Joyce, referral to the High Court, should also apply to Peter Dutton, to resolve the legitimate and lingering questions about his suitability to sit in this parliament. I'm not often one to stand up and say Malcolm Turnbull is right, but in this instance, in the spirit of bipartisanship, I'm happy to do so, because the advice the former Prime Minister has tweeted from New York is very helpful advice that should be taken up by those opposite in this chamber.


New York is an interesting place. It's a beautiful place. It's the city that never sleeps. We know that. I'm sure many of us in this chamber and many Australians have had the opportunity to visit New York City. It turns out there's one other Australian that might get that opportunity to go to New York City: none other than the member for Chisholm in the other place, Ms Julia Banks. Yes, it seems that the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has offered the member for Chisholm the chance to go to New York City. I don't know—maybe he thinks she could catch up with Mr Turnbull. Maybe he thinks she needs a break. Possibly he thinks that it would be so handy for the Morrison government to have the member for Chisholm off in New York City for three months, because that's what she would get if she took up this offer. She would get the chance to go to New York City on a trip to the UN. She would get to go to the UN and be seconded there, away from the prying eyes of the public, away from the cameras and away from her parliamentary privilege in the lower house. She would get the opportunity to be in New York, and he would get the opportunity not to have her in front of the Australian people talking about things like bullying, intimidation and—heaven forbid!—quotas in the Liberal Party to get more women elected.


The member for Banks—excuse me, the member for Chisholm. I'll get that one right yet! The member for Chisholm, Julia Banks, has spoken quite clearly, quite forcefully and quite strongly about the need for there to be more women in the Liberal Party ranks in this parliament. She made clear in her speech last night that we're talking about quotas for women, who represent more than half our population. These are the words of the member for Chisholm:


The meritocracy argument is completely and utterly flawed. There are an equal number of meritorious Liberal women out there in the real world as there are men, but they won't come if the barriers to entry and mountains to climb are too high.


Ms Banks goes on to point out a culture of what she describes as appalling behaviour in the Liberal Party:


Appalling behaviour is an umbrella descriptor for bullying, intimidation, harassment—sexual or otherwise—or a lack of integrity. In my political journey, a culture of appalling behaviour has been widespread, pervasive and undermining, like white ants.


No wonder Scott Morrison tried to persuade her—buy her off, perhaps, and get her silence—by sending her to New York for three months!


Is this how the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, proposes to 'deal with' the problems? Is this his solution—offer a few women a few positions, a few minor promotions, and offer Julia Banks, the member for Chisholm, the opportunity to go to New York for three months so he gets her out of sight, out of mind and away from the Australian public and talking about the appalling culture, the appalling behaviour, the bullying and the intimidation going on inside the Liberal Party? I'm going to end on the words of the member for Chisholm. She says there is no 'ready fix' for this issue and she believes increasing representation of women through quotas will go some way to doing this.


Question agreed to.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (15:36):  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President Kitching, for taking the chair to allow me to present this report. I present the Senate Procedure Committee's second report of 2018 Proposal to replace the parliamentary prayer. I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


On 27 June 2018, the Senate referred to the committee a proposal to amend standing order 50 to replace the traditional parliamentary prayer with an invitation to prayer or reflection. The committee received approximately 820 submissions, the vast majority of which did not support replacing the prayer. The tenor of those submissions is recorded in the report, and the committee thanks all of those who contributed their views. Essentially the same matter was referred to the committee in 1997. On that occasion the committee reported:


It is clear that many senators who join in the prayer regard its retention as important, but among those who do not join in the prayer there does not appear to be a strong view that its proposed abolition is a significant question which should occupy the time of the Senate.


The submissions made on this occasion and the views of the committee members and their colleagues suggest the opinions are not significantly different in 2018 than they were during the 1997 inquiry. Those in favour of the prayer strongly favour its retention, whilst those opposed are less vocal and less concerned to see it changed. The committee does not consider on the evidence before it and after its own deliberations that there is momentum for change. The committee therefore does not recommend that the amendments proposed in the reference should be adopted.


The committee considered, without making any recommendation, whether an invitation to a personal prayer or reflection could be inserted alongside the current prayer. The committee also noted the practice in other jurisdictions of the chair inviting other members to read the prayer. The committee draws those options to the attention of senators. I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:38):  I rise to speak with regard to the dissenting report from the Australian Greens on this matter. The Australian Greens firmly believe that the current practice of reciting the Lord's Prayer, something that's occurred in this place since 1901, is outdated and no longer reflective of Australia's religiously diverse and secular society.


It's understandable that, back in 1901, when 97 per cent of Australians identified as Christian, this parliament would open proceedings with the Lord's Prayer. However, modern Australia is a far more diverse society. As of the last census in 2016 only half of the population identified as Christian. We have a significantly more varied and less religious population today. It no longer relies exclusively on a Christian concept of morality for guidance. Many people in this place consider themselves to be atheists, some are agnostic and some of them are followers of non-Christian faiths, and yet we start each day in this parliament with an entreaty to a Christian God.


We don't think that's appropriate. We think the time has long come to recognise that this is a secular society and that we should give people, everyone in this place, the opportunity of beginning proceedings in a way that they choose fit. In fact, the Catholic Women's League of Australia supported this general view by stating:


However, we also recognise that in an increasingly secular society not all Australian citizens choose to pray. Such an amendment recognizes the diversity in spiritual and religious beliefs and is a positive development. Therefore a space for them to reflect is important too, and provides an opportunity of mindfulness for every person engaged in parliamentary work.


It's clear that the Lord's Prayer is no longer appropriate for the representative body. This is, after all, a representative body. We are here to represent the breadth of views across the Australian community, and when half of the Australian population do not identify as Christian it's important that those views are represented in the way we conduct our business.


It's also not appropriate in a secular society. It's the Greens' strong view that the Australian parliament should uphold secular values and not have those important values undermined at the beginning of each day with something that sends precisely the opposite message. We make it very clear that this is a country where there is separation between church and state. It's a country of many faiths. In fact, it's a country where many people have no faith, and therefore our parliament should reflect that.


Our proposal is a very straightforward one. It's one where we invite people to prayer or reflection, but in silence. Basically, we put forward a proposal where we could use the opening statement that's read at the start of each day in the Legislative Assembly of the ACT. That procedure was adopted back in 1995, and not a moment too soon. To summarise: our recommendation is that as a parliament we no longer begin each day with the Lord's Prayer—something that is inconsistent with a modern multicultural, multifaith democracy—and instead we recommend that the requirement for prayer under standing order 50 be replaced with an invitation to prayer or reflection. That could be done in silence, it would be a much more inclusive gesture and it would reflect the breadth of views right across the Australian community.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:44):  As I was saying in speaking to this before we went into non-controversial legislation, this is about disallowing the instrument that puts into effect the eligibility and the parameters around the ParentsNext program. It's a program that hasn't received the level of scrutiny by this place and by others outside this place that I think it deserves.


What I had been talking about before we were went to non-controversial business was the impact of some of the compliance frameworks. As of 31 August this year, 84 participants had a demerit point. One participant had triggered a capability interview, having reached three demerit points in two months. This is the new process that came into effect in July. But their demerits were reset to zero, as the requirements were not suitable to their circumstances. Additionally 2,683 participants had received a payment suspension. This equates to 9.8 per cent of all participants at the time. While I acknowledge that if you're suspended then you will get back pay eventually, at the time that suspension can have a significant impact, depending on when that suspension occurs.


As the trial occurred prior to 1 July this year, trial participants were not subject to the targeted compliance framework. However, the evaluation of the trial provided to us by the government—and I will say here that I thank the minister for providing that evaluation—was not prior to the decision to extend this and this instrument being tabled being made publicly available. That was prior to the minister taking on this particular role; I will also acknowledge that. I do thank the minister for providing that evaluation sooner than they would have publicly released it otherwise. I'll speak about that in a bit more detail very shortly.


That evaluation also indicates that 9.1 per cent of participants experienced a suspension of their payment during the first 15 months of the trial and that three commenced participants had their payment cancelled after failing to engage in the program for 13 continuous weeks. Suspending or cancelling the payments of income support recipients with already low incomes would cause the parents enormous stress. To cancel the parenting payment of a parent with young children is an extremely harsh measure. While a small number were affected, this is nevertheless very concerning as young children would have been impacted as a consequence and would have been placed at increased risk. As this instrument also repeals the Social Security (Parenting payment participation requirements—classes of persons) Specification 2016 (No. 1), the instrument that specified the class of persons for the trial, if this instrument is disallowed then the trial instrument will be revived.


The Australian Greens cannot support the national expansion of this program. Assisting women into meaningful, productive employment, with a clear pathway, is welcome in principle. Our main concerns with the program are that it is discriminatory towards women, devalues the role of parenting, is top-down and provides people with no choice. The program fails to address the multiple barriers to employment that women face and does not assist in breaking down cycles of disadvantage for women. It is compulsory in nature and incorporates punitive measures. It also does not take account of significant unpaid work that women undertake while caring for their children. We think it undervalues the importance of parents having the choice to provide full-time parental care for the early development of their children, bearing in mind that for some this program comes in when their children are six months old.


The program should not be compulsory—the role of choice is very important when people are making life choices—and neither should it be punitive. While some parents may benefit from the activities, the program should be voluntary and should be focused on addressing the barriers to work that women face. It should also commence later. Parents have other focuses when their children are six months old. It should allow for more consideration to be given to children and family. Focusing on having mothers of young children re-enter the workforce at the earliest possible time fails to take into consideration the impact on the children and issues like, for example, the cost of child care for the parents.


The evaluation of the trial was provided to us by the government, as I just articulated. The evaluation covers the operational period from 4 April 2016 to 30 June 2017, but it doesn't cover the period of the final year of the trial. The evaluation itself acknowledges the program was difficult to evaluate. The evaluation used a mixed-method approach, using qualitative and quantitative analysis. In regard to the qualitative analysis, the Social Research Centre conducted qualitative research on the experiences of child participants and providers in eight of the 10 locations. They held 11 focus groups with participants, 13 in-depth interviews with providers and five interviews with DHS operational staff. We don't know how many participants were included in each focus group and therefore how representative the sample was in the context of the full number of participants at that time, bearing in mind that there were over 24,000. We also do not know what questions were asked or the statements that were put to them and how they selected the participants in the groups. We do not know how the 13 providers were chosen or what the questions and statements were. Lastly, we do not know what, if any, data was excluded from the analysis and the report. I make the specific point that we know from the ANAO report on the cashless welfare card that significant data was left out of the evaluation.


With regard to the quantitative analysis, administrative and survey data was used. We do not know what the survey questions were, whether they were in fact leading questions, or how they were framed or conducted. The main methodology for the measurement of program efficiency was cost per participant and the number of education or employment activities undertaken. The evaluation also explicitly states, 'quantifying the program effect of ParentsNext was difficult', and it acknowledges that this was more or less estimated. The evaluation indicates that only 53 per cent of surveyed participants thought the program had improved their chances of getting a job, and just over 25 per cent of participants did not indicate any specific assistance as being helpful. The evaluation says that many participants felt they did not have sufficient information about the program or what was required of them. This could cause some apprehension about the program when they were required to attend their first provider appointment, the report says.


Some participants were concerned about the compulsory participation requirements of the program, in principle, and for various reasons, including a lack of transport, some found it difficult to attend. The evaluation mentions that some providers and participants were of the view that parents should not be required to commence the program when their youngest child is six months of age, as this is too young. The evaluation says that some participants indicated that they were not actively considering or planning for future work at this stage of their child's life. A participant was quoted in the evaluation as saying, 'I think that 12 months would at least be the minimum, because it can take you that time to just get normal sleep patterns again. Depending on who your provider is, you can feel overwhelmed by what they're expecting you to do.'


The evaluation highlights that the willingness to engage in the program was affected by the compulsory nature of it and the threat of payment suspensions and penalties, particularly given that the lowest commencement rates were attributable to voluntary participants, at 74.3 per cent. The evaluation acknowledges that in some areas fewer jobs were available and that people in these areas may have to travel farther in order to find work. The evaluation makes a number of points that do not give me confidence in the way this program is being further rolled out and the nature of it—and I articulated when people were eligible.


We've reached out to a number of organisations to get their opinions on this particular program. We have also looked at other comments on this program. I'd just like to quote to you some of the feedback that some of the organisations paying attention to this have had from their members. One participant said, 'I told the ParentsNext provider I wanted to study nursing. She was pushing me to study a certificate in business.' Another said, 'I have gone to two appointments. A huge waste of time, after also studying at university full time. However, I am now exempt, after asking her if this was possible. But I didn't get exempt because of uni. I was exempted as I have four kids under 18 and at least one under six.' In other words, she was being asked to participate when she was actually doing something: she was studying. This is the problem with this. We've had other examples where people are working and/or studying, yet they still have to go through this program. People feel that they're compelled to do it and that they are being picked on because the government wants to control their lives. One said: 'I find the whole ParentsNext concept kind of insulting. Do they seriously feel that we can't manage our own lives, futures and careers without their mismanagement?' Another said, 'Not to mention the courses are EXPENSIVE.' That was in capitals. 'I am paying, not Centrelink, and I sure as hell'—excuse me; I'm quoting—'would like to do well and not have to repeat any classes.'


I'd like to table a letter that I've received from the minister, because we have been talking to the minister's office about this disallowance. Again, I acknowledge that I have received a letter from the Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations and the Minister for Women, the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer, and I've told her I will be tabling the letter, and I have checked with the whips. I seek leave to table that, because it explains some of the issues.


Leave granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  The minister has given some acknowledgment of some of the issues that we have raised. I table the letter. I will go into more detail when I'm summing up, but I thank the minister for engaging in a very good discussion around the program. There are some clarifications that the minister has made of the operation of the program. (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:56):  Labor opposes this motion to disallow the Social Security (Parenting payment participation requirements—classes of persons) Instrument 2018 (No. 1). This instrument underpins the expansion of the ParentsNext program, a pre-employment initiative which aims to help parents with children under the age of six to plan and prepare for future study or employment as their children approach school age.


From the outset, it's important to state that Labor understands and acknowledges the Greens' concerns and their motivation for bringing forward this disallowance motion. We also hold concerns about the expansion, but these concerns are outweighed by what we see as the potential benefits of the program for parents, predominantly young women, seeking to enter or re-enter the work force. If the regulation is disallowed and the preceding regulation is re-enlivened, many of the potential benefits of this program for participating families will be lost. These benefits include targeted and practical assistance to complete or add qualifications to become employment ready. Importantly, the program also includes early intervention assistance, such as identifying education and employment goals, developing pathways to achieve those goals and linking participants to activities and services in their local communities. For those parents in the intensive stream being delivered in 30 locations, including areas with a high proportion of Indigenous parents, there are additional supports through a participation fund, wage subsidies for potential employers and relocation assistance. The program is expected to cover around 68,000 people, of whom around 10,000 are Indigenous. More than 95 per cent of those helped are expected to be women.


The ParentsNext program has only been running in an expanded form since the beginning of July, and the rollout is happening over time. Labor are of the view that, while we cannot yet fully appraise the benefits that this program may be delivering, we are wary of taking away the support of pre-employment programs that seek to invest $263 million in parents, including Indigenous parents. The positive aspects of this program would be lost to the majority of those people if the expansion were to be shut down, with only the 10 original trial sites remaining. It would also be frustrating for those parents who have taken the step of getting involved to find that their time has been wasted and to have this program's supports taken away from them.


We oppose this motion today because it cannot, as a matter of practicality, completely resolve the concerns that are held in relation to compliance obligations. If the motion passes, there will still be many people, predominantly women, subject to the compliance obligations, and disallowing the regulation is likely to cause significant disruption, waste and job losses. The rollout has commenced on this $263 million program expansion. Fifty-eight providers have already been contracted, with contracts running from 2018 to 2021. Forty-seven of those providers are not-for-profits and five are Indigenous organisations. If the contracts are now torn up, it will likely involve payment of notice periods, payment of other costs and redundancies for providers' staff. Of course, the government should not have awarded contracts and started the rollout before this regulation had passed the disallowance period, but this failure of basic governance on behalf of the coalition should not be visited upon providers, their staff and, most importantly, the vulnerable people who are looking to enter or return to the workforce which this program is seeking to help. 


As I have previously stated, we have some concerns about the expansion as designed by the Liberal government. Labor have taken this opportunity to negotiate with the government to improve some of the early difficulties observed in relation to the program. Through our advocacy and discussions with crossbenchers and the government, we have identified key concerns and secured commitments for modifications. We acknowledge the government's willingness to negotiate on these matters. 


Some of the improvements that have been obtained through our negotiations include the government giving Labor an undertaking that they will update the ParentsNext program guidelines to ensure that parents who are engaging in study or appropriate training will be considered compliant with activity requirements. This improvement, secured by Labor, will make it clear that parents who engage in these activities will only need to participate in a quarterly catch-up with their provider to confirm their educational status and discuss whether they require any additional support. This assessment will also have added flexibility, including that it may be conducted by phone to minimise the impact on the participant. Likewise, the government have committed to investigate what can be done to assist parents who are at risk of having their payments suspended, including making sure that appointments aren't scheduled in close proximity to payment dates. The government have also given assurances that they will investigate the steps that the providers are taking to enter into cooperative partnerships with Indigenous organisations and to improve written communication in letters, emails and text messages. Communications will now reinforce to participants that they are able to bring their children to the appointments and that these environments are family-friendly. 


We believe these immediate improvements will make the program more focused on supporting parents and defray some of the problems which some parents have faced in relation to compliance. We are not saying that these changes will make the program or its expansion perfect or without difficulty. Labor acknowledge the concern of stakeholders in relation to the compliance aspects of this expansion. Generally, stakeholders support the existence of a pre-employment program for parents seeking to enter or return to the workforce, but they hold concerns about the compliance aspects of this program as presently designed. We hear those concerns and we will continue to consult stakeholders, such as the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children, ACOSS and others, about this program. We look forward to receiving further feedback as to how this program might be improved, with a view to considering what further action we could take if we form government.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-09-13,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (16:04):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those members and senators who've contributed to the constructive discussion on this instrument. ParentsNext is a pre-employment program that assists parents of young children to plan and prepare for employment by the time their children start school. The program supports parents of children aged under six who are in receipt of parenting payment, particularly those at risk of long-term welfare dependency. By expanding ParentsNext, the government is seeking to support more eligible parents with young children to plan and prepare for employment, to break the cycle of intergenerational welfare dependency, to increase female labour force participation and to help close the gap in Indigenous employment. As one of the participants said about the program: 'It's having someone in your corner. If you have 10 friends who are all stay-at-home mums who don't want to work, then it won't create a culture of desire for change.'


If we do not provide strong outcomes for disadvantaged parents, the cycle of welfare dependency will continue. Eighty per cent of young mothers on parenting payment had a parent or a guardian who was also on welfare during their upbringing. Providing tailored and flexible support to help parents increase confidence and wellbeing and achieve educational employment goals is a vital step in breaking that cycle. It's disappointing that the Greens would seek to disallow such an important instrument.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:06):  I thank people for participating in the discussion. I've got a little bit more information as final encouragement and to put on the record. The National Foundation for Australian Women report Gender lens on the budget2018-19 says:


It is unhelpful to view mothers of young children as 'unemployed workers' when they are in fact working longer hours than men in full-time positions, though largely without remuneration.


While the evaluation report that I was talking about earlier acknowledges that early intervention with parents of young children through the provision of outreach services could be an important strategy in engaging individuals in workplace participation—and it identifies ParentsNext as an example of this—we would argue that a more useful intervention would be one that was voluntary, was not punitive and had a broader scope of support to be offered to adequately address the multiple barriers to employment that jobseekers more broadly face, including safe and stable accommodation and access to transport.


Many of the people who will be on the much-expanded ParentsNext program face many levels of disadvantage. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that people who are forced to undertake activities don't have as good outcomes as those who are provided with choice. There's also a lot of evidence to show that early intervention and prevention and continued support for young families produces extremely good outcomes. Across the forward estimates, this program is going to cost $351 million. That is a lot of money that we think could be better invested. We have no argument with the government, or with Labor, that we need to be supporting young families, young mothers—people who have multiple layers of disadvantage. But we think we need to be investing it in a different way, a way that is not compliance focused. When you look at who's now eligible under this program, basically where we end up is that, under the targeted program and through the intensive program, anybody who supposedly has not worked in the last six months, who has a child over the age of five and who is on parenting payment is now subjected to ParentsNext. That's what it effectively means.


I have a number of examples where people have been caught up in this. It is just so frustrating that the government isn't acknowledging that those who are undertaking full-time study or significant study can be exempt from this program. I got rather a long email from a mother who is caught up in this process. We received correspondence from this constituent, who was sent a letter by the Department of Human Services stating she must participate in the program in August. She has a three-year-old child. She's a full-time university student and a single parent. She said:


I was assessed by the Department of Social Services last week and attended the first appointment. This took some three hours out of my day.


She then explained that she has been assessed to receive very little child support from her son's father. She said:


Often I do not receive any child support, and what I do receive does not even cover the cost of nappies. Any cut to parenting payment will have a catastrophic impact on my ability to support our family.


She went on to say:


During the assessment process I have already missed a number of phone calls from the Department of Human Services due to study and parenting responsibilities. If this was the ParentsNext contractor calling then I would likely have had my parenting payment cut. It is often difficult with small children to answer the phone or be places at a particular time. The compliance requirements of this program are unrealistic for parents of small children. Further, the reference to parents of small children as 'jobseekers' by the Department of Jobs and Small Business and the ParentsNext contractors is insulting. I note that I am not a jobseeker. I am a full-time mother and student.


Further, she said:


After the Department of Human Services assessed my eligibility for the program, they gave me two business days to attend a meeting with a ParentsNext contractor.


She had two options. She was very concerned about one particular provider, so she chose one that was farther away, but she said:


All up, I spent three hours attending the mandatory interview, or I was threatened by the department with my payment being cut. This is time I could have been devoting to my university studies and was also time I was paying for child care so I could study.


She raised issues around privacy and she argued that the program is discriminatory, saying:


The fact that I am a woman and have certain family responsibilities is being used to discriminate against me.


I've already articulated that the vast majority of participants are women. She concluded by saying:


The implementation of this program feels like a further blow, as I have less time to devote to my studies, which I ultimately hope will result in a stable, well-paid job to facilitate my son's future education.


I have other examples:


It used to be okay before when I started. I think baby before one year old.


This is obviously from an email that was done very quickly. It goes on:


You only go there every six months face to face and phone calls every two months or three. Now for a single mum on low income it's an activity that you need to attend, otherwise provide valid reason if you can't or pay is suspended. If you use all of your demerit points by not abiding with the plan then there's a pay cut and it will take three weeks to have it back.


Another person wrote:


Agreed, I am working and still have to attend simply because I am not doing 15 hours consistently per week, even though I'm not required to work yet. Multiple texts saying 'payment's been cut for not attending', even though I'm in—


expletive—


work and have told them so.


This is the issue for people who are working. They are clearly engaged; they are clearly trying to find work. The department claims they're not stable, so they're caught up in this. You have to ask why. Why do people who are studying have to participate in this program that, it's been clearly demonstrated, people feel is not appropriate?


I note that Labor claim it is all their work, although it's the Greens who were paying attention to this program, but I do thank both sides of the parliament for engaging very meaningfully in this debate. As Senator Cameron articulated, there's been a commitment that there will be more attempts to enable people who are studying to be contacted by phone to provide further guidance to the providers—or it will be in the guidelines to the provider. But a lot of these decisions are provider dependent. It's not just the fact that people have to report; it's also the fact that they feel demeaned by being on this program because they are actually already actively engaged and participating. I'd say anybody who's undertaking full-time university is actually making a very big effort to make sure that they are able to find work and engage. So I think the program is misguided. As I said, we very strongly support this level of investment. We disagree with the way the government is doing it. 


I am also very concerned about the impact this will have on First Nations peoples, particularly young women who have to engage when their child turns six months old. Many people have multiple areas of disadvantage. I'm deeply concerned that this funding should be invested much more up-front in different ways to enable people to address barriers not just to employment but to other areas of their lives. 


We support this investment. We disagree that this is the way to go. We think some of the issues about the way that this money is being invested and the approach that the program is taking are more about controlling, in a compulsory manner, people who are accessing parenting payment. That, combined with the new compliance framework, could very well have a significantly detrimental impact on women—this is largely focused on women, particularly single parents. It will have a detrimental impact on them as this program rolls out. This new program started in July, just as the new compliance framework started, so we haven't yet seen the significant impact this program could have in terms of people ending up not just having their payments suspended but with demerit points and significant penalties. 


We do acknowledge the commitments the government has made in providing clarification, in education and training, around approved activities, the pensioner education supplement and childcare provider choice. I am deeply concerned about the lack of significant numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander providers. I appreciate the commitment the government has made to pursue that. The minister says she's asked the department to provide her with further details regarding partner arrangements with ParentsNext providers who have entered into arrangements with Indigenous organisations and will forward this information separately as it becomes available. I appreciate the commitment to follow that up. We appreciate the commitment to expand the communication with participants. I think that is all significant progress, and I am glad that this process of disallowance has enabled those discussions. But we are still deeply concerned that this program is misdirected and that we could spend this $350 million in a way that better supports families and women, because this is really about women. We need to make sure that we're investing that money in the most meaningful way. We don't think this is the way to go. We will continue to review and monitor this program. I'm heartened to hear the opposition say that they are going to engage with the program more and continue to review it too, because I think it needs very close scrutiny.


And just to address the issue around the providers that have already been contracted, my concern is about the way the contracts were put in place before the disallowance period on this expired, which undermines our ability to disallow it. My response would be that these contractors could be providing very valuable services to community members and to the people who are identified as needing that level of support—doing outreach support programs. So it's not so much that I'm worried about that. I think we could still spend the money the government's allocated in a very meaningful way. But I think there's a problem with going into contracting on matters that are subject to disallowance—they're using that as an excuse to not change a program—particularly if the will of the Senate was to in fact disallow this or change a particular program. I commend the disallowance to the chamber.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:44):  As I was saying in speaking to this before we went into non-controversial legislation, this is about disallowing the instrument that puts into effect the eligibility and the parameters around the ParentsNext program. It's a program that hasn't received the level of scrutiny by this place and by others outside this place that I think it deserves.


What I had been talking about before we were went to non-controversial business was the impact of some of the compliance frameworks. As of 31 August this year, 84 participants had a demerit point. One participant had triggered a capability interview, having reached three demerit points in two months. This is the new process that came into effect in July. But their demerits were reset to zero, as the requirements were not suitable to their circumstances. Additionally 2,683 participants had received a payment suspension. This equates to 9.8 per cent of all participants at the time. While I acknowledge that if you're suspended then you will get back pay eventually, at the time that suspension can have a significant impact, depending on when that suspension occurs.


As the trial occurred prior to 1 July this year, trial participants were not subject to the targeted compliance framework. However, the evaluation of the trial provided to us by the government—and I will say here that I thank the minister for providing that evaluation—was not prior to the decision to extend this and this instrument being tabled being made publicly available. That was prior to the minister taking on this particular role; I will also acknowledge that. I do thank the minister for providing that evaluation sooner than they would have publicly released it otherwise. I'll speak about that in a bit more detail very shortly.


That evaluation also indicates that 9.1 per cent of participants experienced a suspension of their payment during the first 15 months of the trial and that three commenced participants had their payment cancelled after failing to engage in the program for 13 continuous weeks. Suspending or cancelling the payments of income support recipients with already low incomes would cause the parents enormous stress. To cancel the parenting payment of a parent with young children is an extremely harsh measure. While a small number were affected, this is nevertheless very concerning as young children would have been impacted as a consequence and would have been placed at increased risk. As this instrument also repeals the Social Security (Parenting payment participation requirements—classes of persons) Specification 2016 (No. 1), the instrument that specified the class of persons for the trial, if this instrument is disallowed then the trial instrument will be revived.


The Australian Greens cannot support the national expansion of this program. Assisting women into meaningful, productive employment, with a clear pathway, is welcome in principle. Our main concerns with the program are that it is discriminatory towards women, devalues the role of parenting, is top-down and provides people with no choice. The program fails to address the multiple barriers to employment that women face and does not assist in breaking down cycles of disadvantage for women. It is compulsory in nature and incorporates punitive measures. It also does not take account of significant unpaid work that women undertake while caring for their children. We think it undervalues the importance of parents having the choice to provide full-time parental care for the early development of their children, bearing in mind that for some this program comes in when their children are six months old.


The program should not be compulsory—the role of choice is very important when people are making life choices—and neither should it be punitive. While some parents may benefit from the activities, the program should be voluntary and should be focused on addressing the barriers to work that women face. It should also commence later. Parents have other focuses when their children are six months old. It should allow for more consideration to be given to children and family. Focusing on having mothers of young children re-enter the workforce at the earliest possible time fails to take into consideration the impact on the children and issues like, for example, the cost of child care for the parents.


The evaluation of the trial was provided to us by the government, as I just articulated. The evaluation covers the operational period from 4 April 2016 to 30 June 2017, but it doesn't cover the period of the final year of the trial. The evaluation itself acknowledges the program was difficult to evaluate. The evaluation used a mixed-method approach, using qualitative and quantitative analysis. In regard to the qualitative analysis, the Social Research Centre conducted qualitative research on the experiences of child participants and providers in eight of the 10 locations. They held 11 focus groups with participants, 13 in-depth interviews with providers and five interviews with DHS operational staff. We don't know how many participants were included in each focus group and therefore how representative the sample was in the context of the full number of participants at that time, bearing in mind that there were over 24,000. We also do not know what questions were asked or the statements that were put to them and how they selected the participants in the groups. We do not know how the 13 providers were chosen or what the questions and statements were. Lastly, we do not know what, if any, data was excluded from the analysis and the report. I make the specific point that we know from the ANAO report on the cashless welfare card that significant data was left out of the evaluation.


With regard to the quantitative analysis, administrative and survey data was used. We do not know what the survey questions were, whether they were in fact leading questions, or how they were framed or conducted. The main methodology for the measurement of program efficiency was cost per participant and the number of education or employment activities undertaken. The evaluation also explicitly states, 'quantifying the program effect of ParentsNext was difficult', and it acknowledges that this was more or less estimated. The evaluation indicates that only 53 per cent of surveyed participants thought the program had improved their chances of getting a job, and just over 25 per cent of participants did not indicate any specific assistance as being helpful. The evaluation says that many participants felt they did not have sufficient information about the program or what was required of them. This could cause some apprehension about the program when they were required to attend their first provider appointment, the report says.


Some participants were concerned about the compulsory participation requirements of the program, in principle, and for various reasons, including a lack of transport, some found it difficult to attend. The evaluation mentions that some providers and participants were of the view that parents should not be required to commence the program when their youngest child is six months of age, as this is too young. The evaluation says that some participants indicated that they were not actively considering or planning for future work at this stage of their child's life. A participant was quoted in the evaluation as saying, 'I think that 12 months would at least be the minimum, because it can take you that time to just get normal sleep patterns again. Depending on who your provider is, you can feel overwhelmed by what they're expecting you to do.'


The evaluation highlights that the willingness to engage in the program was affected by the compulsory nature of it and the threat of payment suspensions and penalties, particularly given that the lowest commencement rates were attributable to voluntary participants, at 74.3 per cent. The evaluation acknowledges that in some areas fewer jobs were available and that people in these areas may have to travel farther in order to find work. The evaluation makes a number of points that do not give me confidence in the way this program is being further rolled out and the nature of it—and I articulated when people were eligible.


We've reached out to a number of organisations to get their opinions on this particular program. We have also looked at other comments on this program. I'd just like to quote to you some of the feedback that some of the organisations paying attention to this have had from their members. One participant said, 'I told the ParentsNext provider I wanted to study nursing. She was pushing me to study a certificate in business.' Another said, 'I have gone to two appointments. A huge waste of time, after also studying at university full time. However, I am now exempt, after asking her if this was possible. But I didn't get exempt because of uni. I was exempted as I have four kids under 18 and at least one under six.' In other words, she was being asked to participate when she was actually doing something: she was studying. This is the problem with this. We've had other examples where people are working and/or studying, yet they still have to go through this program. People feel that they're compelled to do it and that they are being picked on because the government wants to control their lives. One said: 'I find the whole ParentsNext concept kind of insulting. Do they seriously feel that we can't manage our own lives, futures and careers without their mismanagement?' Another said, 'Not to mention the courses are EXPENSIVE.' That was in capitals. 'I am paying, not Centrelink, and I sure as hell'—excuse me; I'm quoting—'would like to do well and not have to repeat any classes.'


I'd like to table a letter that I've received from the minister, because we have been talking to the minister's office about this disallowance. Again, I acknowledge that I have received a letter from the Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations and the Minister for Women, the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer, and I've told her I will be tabling the letter, and I have checked with the whips. I seek leave to table that, because it explains some of the issues.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:56):  Labor opposes this motion to disallow the Social Security (Parenting payment participation requirements—classes of persons) Instrument 2018 (No. 1). This instrument underpins the expansion of the ParentsNext program, a pre-employment initiative which aims to help parents with children under the age of six to plan and prepare for future study or employment as their children approach school age.


From the outset, it's important to state that Labor understands and acknowledges the Greens' concerns and their motivation for bringing forward this disallowance motion. We also hold concerns about the expansion, but these concerns are outweighed by what we see as the potential benefits of the program for parents, predominantly young women, seeking to enter or re-enter the work force. If the regulation is disallowed and the preceding regulation is re-enlivened, many of the potential benefits of this program for participating families will be lost. These benefits include targeted and practical assistance to complete or add qualifications to become employment ready. Importantly, the program also includes early intervention assistance, such as identifying education and employment goals, developing pathways to achieve those goals and linking participants to activities and services in their local communities. For those parents in the intensive stream being delivered in 30 locations, including areas with a high proportion of Indigenous parents, there are additional supports through a participation fund, wage subsidies for potential employers and relocation assistance. The program is expected to cover around 68,000 people, of whom around 10,000 are Indigenous. More than 95 per cent of those helped are expected to be women.


The ParentsNext program has only been running in an expanded form since the beginning of July, and the rollout is happening over time. Labor are of the view that, while we cannot yet fully appraise the benefits that this program may be delivering, we are wary of taking away the support of pre-employment programs that seek to invest $263 million in parents, including Indigenous parents. The positive aspects of this program would be lost to the majority of those people if the expansion were to be shut down, with only the 10 original trial sites remaining. It would also be frustrating for those parents who have taken the step of getting involved to find that their time has been wasted and to have this program's supports taken away from them.


We oppose this motion today because it cannot, as a matter of practicality, completely resolve the concerns that are held in relation to compliance obligations. If the motion passes, there will still be many people, predominantly women, subject to the compliance obligations, and disallowing the regulation is likely to cause significant disruption, waste and job losses. The rollout has commenced on this $263 million program expansion. Fifty-eight providers have already been contracted, with contracts running from 2018 to 2021. Forty-seven of those providers are not-for-profits and five are Indigenous organisations. If the contracts are now torn up, it will likely involve payment of notice periods, payment of other costs and redundancies for providers' staff. Of course, the government should not have awarded contracts and started the rollout before this regulation had passed the disallowance period, but this failure of basic governance on behalf of the coalition should not be visited upon providers, their staff and, most importantly, the vulnerable people who are looking to enter or return to the workforce which this program is seeking to help. 


As I have previously stated, we have some concerns about the expansion as designed by the Liberal government. Labor have taken this opportunity to negotiate with the government to improve some of the early difficulties observed in relation to the program. Through our advocacy and discussions with crossbenchers and the government, we have identified key concerns and secured commitments for modifications. We acknowledge the government's willingness to negotiate on these matters. 


Some of the improvements that have been obtained through our negotiations include the government giving Labor an undertaking that they will update the ParentsNext program guidelines to ensure that parents who are engaging in study or appropriate training will be considered compliant with activity requirements. This improvement, secured by Labor, will make it clear that parents who engage in these activities will only need to participate in a quarterly catch-up with their provider to confirm their educational status and discuss whether they require any additional support. This assessment will also have added flexibility, including that it may be conducted by phone to minimise the impact on the participant. Likewise, the government have committed to investigate what can be done to assist parents who are at risk of having their payments suspended, including making sure that appointments aren't scheduled in close proximity to payment dates. The government have also given assurances that they will investigate the steps that the providers are taking to enter into cooperative partnerships with Indigenous organisations and to improve written communication in letters, emails and text messages. Communications will now reinforce to participants that they are able to bring their children to the appointments and that these environments are family-friendly. 


We believe these immediate improvements will make the program more focused on supporting parents and defray some of the problems which some parents have faced in relation to compliance. We are not saying that these changes will make the program or its expansion perfect or without difficulty. Labor acknowledge the concern of stakeholders in relation to the compliance aspects of this expansion. Generally, stakeholders support the existence of a pre-employment program for parents seeking to enter or return to the workforce, but they hold concerns about the compliance aspects of this program as presently designed. We hear those concerns and we will continue to consult stakeholders, such as the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children, ACOSS and others, about this program. We look forward to receiving further feedback as to how this program might be improved, with a view to considering what further action we could take if we form government.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (16:04):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those members and senators who've contributed to the constructive discussion on this instrument. ParentsNext is a pre-employment program that assists parents of young children to plan and prepare for employment by the time their children start school. The program supports parents of children aged under six who are in receipt of parenting payment, particularly those at risk of long-term welfare dependency. By expanding ParentsNext, the government is seeking to support more eligible parents with young children to plan and prepare for employment, to break the cycle of intergenerational welfare dependency, to increase female labour force participation and to help close the gap in Indigenous employment. As one of the participants said about the program: 'It's having someone in your corner. If you have 10 friends who are all stay-at-home mums who don't want to work, then it won't create a culture of desire for change.'


If we do not provide strong outcomes for disadvantaged parents, the cycle of welfare dependency will continue. Eighty per cent of young mothers on parenting payment had a parent or a guardian who was also on welfare during their upbringing. Providing tailored and flexible support to help parents increase confidence and wellbeing and achieve educational employment goals is a vital step in breaking that cycle. It's disappointing that the Greens would seek to disallow such an important instrument.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-09-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:06):  I thank people for participating in the discussion. I've got a little bit more information as final encouragement and to put on the record. The National Foundation for Australian Women report Gender lens on the budget2018-19 says:


It is unhelpful to view mothers of young children as 'unemployed workers' when they are in fact working longer hours than men in full-time positions, though largely without remuneration.


While the evaluation report that I was talking about earlier acknowledges that early intervention with parents of young children through the provision of outreach services could be an important strategy in engaging individuals in workplace participation—and it identifies ParentsNext as an example of this—we would argue that a more useful intervention would be one that was voluntary, was not punitive and had a broader scope of support to be offered to adequately address the multiple barriers to employment that jobseekers more broadly face, including safe and stable accommodation and access to transport.


Many of the people who will be on the much-expanded ParentsNext program face many levels of disadvantage. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that people who are forced to undertake activities don't have as good outcomes as those who are provided with choice. There's also a lot of evidence to show that early intervention and prevention and continued support for young families produces extremely good outcomes. Across the forward estimates, this program is going to cost $351 million. That is a lot of money that we think could be better invested. We have no argument with the government, or with Labor, that we need to be supporting young families, young mothers—people who have multiple layers of disadvantage. But we think we need to be investing it in a different way, a way that is not compliance focused. When you look at who's now eligible under this program, basically where we end up is that, under the targeted program and through the intensive program, anybody who supposedly has not worked in the last six months, who has a child over the age of five and who is on parenting payment is now subjected to ParentsNext. That's what it effectively means.


I have a number of examples where people have been caught up in this. It is just so frustrating that the government isn't acknowledging that those who are undertaking full-time study or significant study can be exempt from this program. I got rather a long email from a mother who is caught up in this process. We received correspondence from this constituent, who was sent a letter by the Department of Human Services stating she must participate in the program in August. She has a three-year-old child. She's a full-time university student and a single parent. She said:


I was assessed by the Department of Social Services last week and attended the first appointment. This took some three hours out of my day.


She then explained that she has been assessed to receive very little child support from her son's father. She said:


Often I do not receive any child support, and what I do receive does not even cover the cost of nappies. Any cut to parenting payment will have a catastrophic impact on my ability to support our family.


She went on to say:


During the assessment process I have already missed a number of phone calls from the Department of Human Services due to study and parenting responsibilities. If this was the ParentsNext contractor calling then I would likely have had my parenting payment cut. It is often difficult with small children to answer the phone or be places at a particular time. The compliance requirements of this program are unrealistic for parents of small children. Further, the reference to parents of small children as 'jobseekers' by the Department of Jobs and Small Business and the ParentsNext contractors is insulting. I note that I am not a jobseeker. I am a full-time mother and student.


Further, she said:


After the Department of Human Services assessed my eligibility for the program, they gave me two business days to attend a meeting with a ParentsNext contractor.


She had two options. She was very concerned about one particular provider, so she chose one that was farther away, but she said:


All up, I spent three hours attending the mandatory interview, or I was threatened by the department with my payment being cut. This is time I could have been devoting to my university studies and was also time I was paying for child care so I could study.


She raised issues around privacy and she argued that the program is discriminatory, saying:


The fact that I am a woman and have certain family responsibilities is being used to discriminate against me.


I've already articulated that the vast majority of participants are women. She concluded by saying:


The implementation of this program feels like a further blow, as I have less time to devote to my studies, which I ultimately hope will result in a stable, well-paid job to facilitate my son's future education.


I have other examples:


It used to be okay before when I started. I think baby before one year old.


This is obviously from an email that was done very quickly. It goes on:


You only go there every six months face to face and phone calls every two months or three. Now for a single mum on low income it's an activity that you need to attend, otherwise provide valid reason if you can't or pay is suspended. If you use all of your demerit points by not abiding with the plan then there's a pay cut and it will take three weeks to have it back.


Another person wrote:


Agreed, I am working and still have to attend simply because I am not doing 15 hours consistently per week, even though I'm not required to work yet. Multiple texts saying 'payment's been cut for not attending', even though I'm in—


expletive—


work and have told them so.


This is the issue for people who are working. They are clearly engaged; they are clearly trying to find work. The department claims they're not stable, so they're caught up in this. You have to ask why. Why do people who are studying have to participate in this program that, it's been clearly demonstrated, people feel is not appropriate?


I note that Labor claim it is all their work, although it's the Greens who were paying attention to this program, but I do thank both sides of the parliament for engaging very meaningfully in this debate. As Senator Cameron articulated, there's been a commitment that there will be more attempts to enable people who are studying to be contacted by phone to provide further guidance to the providers—or it will be in the guidelines to the provider. But a lot of these decisions are provider dependent. It's not just the fact that people have to report; it's also the fact that they feel demeaned by being on this program because they are actually already actively engaged and participating. I'd say anybody who's undertaking full-time university is actually making a very big effort to make sure that they are able to find work and engage. So I think the program is misguided. As I said, we very strongly support this level of investment. We disagree with the way the government is doing it. 


I am also very concerned about the impact this will have on First Nations peoples, particularly young women who have to engage when their child turns six months old. Many people have multiple areas of disadvantage. I'm deeply concerned that this funding should be invested much more up-front in different ways to enable people to address barriers not just to employment but to other areas of their lives. 


We support this investment. We disagree that this is the way to go. We think some of the issues about the way that this money is being invested and the approach that the program is taking are more about controlling, in a compulsory manner, people who are accessing parenting payment. That, combined with the new compliance framework, could very well have a significantly detrimental impact on women—this is largely focused on women, particularly single parents. It will have a detrimental impact on them as this program rolls out. This new program started in July, just as the new compliance framework started, so we haven't yet seen the significant impact this program could have in terms of people ending up not just having their payments suspended but with demerit points and significant penalties. 


We do acknowledge the commitments the government has made in providing clarification, in education and training, around approved activities, the pensioner education supplement and childcare provider choice. I am deeply concerned about the lack of significant numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander providers. I appreciate the commitment the government has made to pursue that. The minister says she's asked the department to provide her with further details regarding partner arrangements with ParentsNext providers who have entered into arrangements with Indigenous organisations and will forward this information separately as it becomes available. I appreciate the commitment to follow that up. We appreciate the commitment to expand the communication with participants. I think that is all significant progress, and I am glad that this process of disallowance has enabled those discussions. But we are still deeply concerned that this program is misdirected and that we could spend this $350 million in a way that better supports families and women, because this is really about women. We need to make sure that we're investing that money in the most meaningful way. We don't think this is the way to go. We will continue to review and monitor this program. I'm heartened to hear the opposition say that they are going to engage with the program more and continue to review it too, because I think it needs very close scrutiny.


And just to address the issue around the providers that have already been contracted, my concern is about the way the contracts were put in place before the disallowance period on this expired, which undermines our ability to disallow it. My response would be that these contractors could be providing very valuable services to community members and to the people who are identified as needing that level of support—doing outreach support programs. So it's not so much that I'm worried about that. I think we could still spend the money the government's allocated in a very meaningful way. But I think there's a problem with going into contracting on matters that are subject to disallowance—they're using that as an excuse to not change a program—particularly if the will of the Senate was to in fact disallow this or change a particular program. I commend the disallowance to the chamber.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:21):  At the request of Senator Collins, I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes:


(i) the Morrison Government's complete capitulation to the hard right of the Liberal and National Parties by abandoning emission reduction as a goal of energy policy, and its refusal to legislate the Paris Climate Change Agreement Targets,


(ii) comments by former Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, who stated at his final press conference 'in terms of energy policy and climate policy, I think the truth is that the Coalition finds it very hard to get agreement on anything to do with emissions. That's the truth', and


(iii) that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Government policy inaction is driving up electricity prices, and that solutions, including an Emissions Intensity Scheme, a Clean Energy Target and a National Energy Guarantee, have given way to crippling policy paralysis;


(b) observes that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Government refuses to act, citing any and all excuses to delay, when everyone knows it is internal Coalition division and weakness of leadership that are really to blame;


(c) agrees Australia must cut carbon pollution by 45% on 2005 levels by 2030, and reach net zero emissions by 2050, consistent with Climate Change Authority recommendations regarding our obligations under the Paris Accords of keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels; and


(d) recognises, that in order to drive down prices and pollution, Australians need and deserve real leadership on energy and it is clearer every day that they will not get it from the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Government.


This motion very clearly outlines and recognises that this coalition government has given up and that this new Prime Minister doesn't care when we talk about energy policy and climate policy. Over the last fortnight a number of Morrison government ministers have repeated the lie that Australia is supposedly 'on track' to meet its international climate commitments. The truth is that the Liberals have no climate policy and no way to contain let alone reduce Australia's rising carbon pollution levels. They have a target of a five per cent cut in emissions by 2020. They have committed to the Paris climate agreement, with a 26 to 28 per cent reduction by 2030 on 2005 levels. But the coalition government's own data—snuck out just days before Christmas—showed that there would be a zero per cent cut in pollution by 2020. The same government data showed that there would be only a slim four per cent cut in pollution by 2030, missing our international obligations by a whopping 24 per cent.


And of course this was all before the Liberals completely junked the emissions reduction component of their National Energy Guarantee—the thing that now is dead—walking away from any plan to cut pollution in the electricity sector, which is responsible for one-third of all of Australia's emissions and has the lowest cost of cutting pollution. I really can't put it any better, though, than the way it has been set out in this motion: that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government's policy in action is driving up electricity prices and that its failed solutions, including an emissions intensity scheme, a clean energy target and the National Energy Guarantee, never came to fruition but have all given way to this crippling policy paralysis.


At every step of the way, throughout all of the different versions of an energy policy that the government has put forward, Labor have been willing to work with the government for a genuine solution to the energy crisis. We were willing to negotiate on an emissions intensity scheme, but Tony Abbott vetoed that one. We were willing to work with the Chief Scientist's, Dr Alan Finkel's, clean energy target, but Tony Abbott vetoed that one. We were willing to work with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on the National Energy Guarantee, but, under pressure from anti-renewable members of the coalition party room and without even talking to Labor, he decided to abandon that policy—the one that he had recently said was 'essential' to solving the energy crisis.


Businesses, industry and all the experts have been clear that renewable energy is the only way forward for Australia's energy system. Renewable energy is the cheapest way forward—the cheapest form of new energy. It will create thousands of jobs. It will drive down pollution. But it has been year upon year upon year of a different version, of a different policy, being put forward by this government, all of which have failed, and it has led us to this point of complete policy paralysis, where we don't have any energy or climate policy at all.


If we look at the NEG, the National Energy Guarantee, and its 26 per cent emissions target, it was already inadequate to fix this energy crises. But now, with the government having nothing—no policy, no ideas, no leadership and no hope—what can the Australian people and what can Australian businesses and industry really have to guide them forward? The international community is becoming increasingly alarmed at Australia's complete lack of responsibility and, indeed, of credibility, particularly when the European Union and our neighbours in the Pacific, as we recently heard at the Pacific Islands Forum, are demanding that this government take action to reduce pollution and not just repeat the empty promises that we have heard.


What has been clear over the last fortnight is that this new Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has the same position as Peter Dutton when it comes to action on climate change. Prime Minister Morrison saying that Australia is committed to our Paris target is worthless. He is merely paying lip-service, given that he has no policy to actually back that up. Australia and the world's need for comprehensive mitigation of the effects of climate change has never been greater. On current trends, the UN estimates that climate change will displace up to 200 million people by 2050, creating an unprecedented refuge crisis. The government have committed Australia to some of the weakest emissions reduction targets in the developed world. They have tried to de-list part of Tasmania's World Heritage area. Carbon emissions have been increasing the whole time they have been in power, and they are still putting those who have an ideological bent against the climate science into federal parliament.


I remember way back when Senator Duniam was about to start his term in this place and he told The Examiner newspaper that he was yet to be convinced that climate change is man-made. He is not alone in his thinking within the Liberal Party. So many of them still deny the science. It is something that former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was only too well aware of—so well aware that, even after all the compromises the former Prime Minister made, they still rolled him. They still couldn't bring themselves to agree to a policy on energy that included emissions reduction. And the NEG died. I share with you the former Prime Minister's own words on that—indeed, words that have been written into this motion—where he said:


In terms of energy policy and climate policy, I think the truth is that the Coalition finds it very hard to get agreement on anything to do with emissions. That's the truth.


That is what the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said at his final press conference as Prime Minister. Yes, that is the truth, Malcolm Turnbull, and that is why I think between now and the next election we will see the absolute continuation of policy paralysis when it comes to emissions reduction, strong investment in renewable energy and Australia's commitment to our Paris climate agreement targets. All of us in this parliament must realise that we have to step up and take serious action to deal with this deep energy crisis gripping this nation.


Labor is ready to do that. We have been ready to do that for a very long time. We want to do that. Our households and our businesses know only too well that wholesale power prices have doubled in the four years of this government, primarily because of the policy paralysis and uncertainty that has gripped this nation. Labor has tried again and again to work with this government, but it's now clear that it will not provide the leadership needed to solve this energy crisis. Fortunately for Australia, the choice is clear going forward: Labor is for renewables and for lower prices; the Liberals are for more coal and for higher prices.


During the last Labor government carbon pollution decreased by 11 per cent, but carbon pollution has indeed increased by six per cent under this changing Liberal coalition government. That gives you the stark difference between Labor's commitment on energy policy and emissions reductions, and this shambles of a government. We have real policies with real outcomes for Australians. We are committed to cutting our carbon pollution by 45 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 and to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 as is consistent with our obligations, under the Paris accord, of keeping global warming well below two degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our position is to transition Australia's energy system, with 50 per cent renewable energy by 2050 at its core. We know what that will do; it will drive investment in renewable energy. Coming from Tasmania I know that very clearly, because of Tasmania's expanding wind farms. In fact 30 sites in Tasmania could potentially have more wind farms if we had an energy policy with the right parameters in place to allow that investment in renewables.


Labor has that policy. We want to drive that investment in renewable energy. That isn't only good for our carbon emissions and a reduction in energy prices; it is good for jobs and investment. I don't think anyone in this place can say they do not support that. Whatever the other side's ideological bent against renewable energy is, how can they deny the jobs and investment that will come with the creation of more renewable energy and the various technologies that keep coming forward? Labor will also implement sector-specific policies for energy, transport and agriculture to ensure we deliver on our pollution reduction obligations in a way that maximises our economic and job opportunities. We remain convinced that if we can cut our pollution, as we were doing when in government, and transition to a clean energy economy, then it can only be good for our country and what we have signed up to.


We have only to look at our neighbouring countries in the Pacific, which are crying out for us to make this happen, and also other countries further afield. I saw just the other day that California is going to use 100 per cent clean energy by 2045. I was recently in Europe, and I passed so many wind farms. In such a small land mass—that is, when Europe is compared to Australia—they are maximising that opportunity for renewables in every part of Europe as it stands. Yet here we are still having those same old, tired debates on whether the Liberals can believe the science and whether or not they have to continue to roll another Prime Minister because he is just a little bit too pro-renewables and just that little bit too pro the Paris agreement.


We then have the dumping of the Paris agreement. How far did the former Prime Minister go only a few weeks ago—with the killing off of the NEG, the National Energy Guarantee, and the dumping of the Paris climate targets—for those ideological right-wingers within the Liberal Party to be happy? Well, they still weren't happy, and the former Prime Minister is now gone. We are now all the worse for it because we now don't have anything. We don't have a NEG. Even though it wasn't good enough, it gave us something to start with and to build from after the policy paralysis of so many years. Even though the government's own projections have shown pollution will keep rising all the way to 2030, they have no policy to even meet the weak 26 to 28 per cent target that they held. What this means is we will have pollution going up in every sector.


We need to take stock here of where we find ourselves as a country and how far backwards we've gone. I remember my time in this place when Labor was in government and the day we introduced the carbon pollution architecture, those clean energy bills that gave us that road map forward and that road map to be part of transitioning our economy into a clean energy economy. It was a momentous day. I remember it was a momentous day for then Minister Greg Combet as well and for all of those Labor colleagues. Yet look how far backwards we've gone. With the change of government in 2013 and all of the various leaders that they've had since, we have gone so far backwards not just on our rising pollution and not just on the rising energy prices but on the fact that we as a country stand for nothing now when it comes to energy, when it comes to our commitment to emissions reduction and when it comes to the future for our children and playing our part in reducing our emissions on this planet. That is shameful; it is incredibly shameful. It is shameful because we will have long been gone from this place. We know from the science that if we do not reduce our emissions and if temperatures continue to rise, we are going to be in real trouble as a planet. How can we deny that? How can we just turn our backs and do nothing?


Look at the way Australia, even domestically at the moment, is suffering. Look not just at those households that obviously have rising energy prices, which is bad enough, but at our farmers who are suffering the drought. Listen to our farmers. Listen to those Pacific islanders who are trying to mitigate rising sea levels. The climate is changing. There is global warming happening. At this present time, as we speak, I think there is a typhoon that's about to be experienced over the Philippines. We've also got hurricanes and weather in the southern states of America. All of this is continuing to happen and all of it is a contribution of the changing climate that we live in.


We need to act and ensure we are doing as much as we can to contribute to the reduction in warming—that is, the reduction of two per cent. We are not on track to do that in this country, and we have every single means to do it. We've got more sun here, I think, than nearly any country in the world. We've got such a huge land mass. We have such an opportunity and there are such opportunities to create future jobs from it. Yet, here we are in this place, and in the other place, stuck in a policy paralysis because of a few hard-right-wingers within the government who just want to put their heads in the sand and hope it all goes away. Every time we bring a policy idea forward—our opportunity to contribute in a sensible, negotiable way with the government—they don't want a bar of it, because they simply do not believe in it.


This complete capitulation by the Morrison government to the hard Right of the Liberals and the Nationals by abandoning emissions reduction as a goal of energy policy and its refusal to legislate the Paris climate change agreement targets means only one thing. It means that the sooner we have an election the better. The sooner that this lot are voted out of office the better so that we can move forward and ensure that we do have the right energy policy for this country and that we do indeed start to get back on track in reducing our emissions. The sooner that day comes the better for all Australians.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2018-09-13,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:41):  I can see the fight now between the Labor Party and the hard Left of the Greens, especially the one coming up in Tasmania. Who is going to go the furthest to the left to see what they can do to win a vote or two? It is about time some facts, some realistic points of view, were put forward in this chamber on this whole energy and carbon emissions reduction scheme. Let's go back and look at 2010. Remember the promise by the then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'? Of course, in that election the coalition won 73 seats and Labor won 72 seats. But along came Independents Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor. What did they demand—especially Tony Windsor? He demanded the cross-party, multiparty climate change committee, or whatever you want to call it, and out of it, driven by Tony Windsor, came the carbon tax we were never going to have. What did it do? It did absolutely nothing except put costs up for the Australian people to the tune of $9 billion in a year—and growing. It was going to go up every year.


Here we have a situation where we put the price of electricity up—and that's going to save the planet? That is absolute rot. Dr Finkel told us at Senate estimates what would happen if Australia reduced all of its emissions—the whole lot. What effect would it have on the planet? Basically nothing at all. Months ago, I brought to the attention of Senate, and so did my colleague Senator Macdonald, details of the new coal-fired power generation being constructed around the world—I know them off by heart. A unit is one generator and plants like Bayswater and Liddell in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales are four-unit generating plants. They have four generators, four cooling towers and so on. Eight months ago, China was constructing an extra 299 units of coal-fired generation to add to their 2,107 units already in production. Those 299 units will produce 670 million tonnes of CO2 a year—that's just the extra 299 that are under construction. Australia produces 550 million tonnes of CO2, so the extra coal-fired generators being built in China will produce more CO2 than the whole of Australia, through everything. There were 621 units under construction at the time: 299 in China, about 132 in India, 34 in Vietnam, 32 in Indonesia, some in South Africa, 10 in Japan and even some in Germany. In Australia we have a total of 73 units of coal-fired generation—just 73. Around the world, 621 units are being constructed, and somehow we're going to change the planet! It is ludicrous. All we do is shut ours down and put the cost up.


I will give you an example, Madam Acting Deputy President Kitching. When Hazelwood's coal-fired generator closed in Victoria, the electricity prices in Victoria went up 176 per cent, and they went up 102 per cent in New South Wales and 86 per cent in South Australia. We talk about renewable energy, and I have no problem with renewable energy. Renewable energy is a very good thing. However, it's got to stand on its own feet. Let me give you the examples. Senator Singh was talking about all these wind towers that we can build in Tasmania. Say that you construct one wind tower, just one—a three-megawatt-per-hour generator—and that that wind tower spins for eight hours a day, 365 days a year. Surprise, surprise—the owners of that wind tower get a $700,000 subsidy in renewable energy certificates before they sell one watt of electricity. They get $700,000 just because it's standing there and spinning for eight hours a day—not selling electricity.


What did they do in South Australia? They constructed these wind towers everywhere. I grew up down in Jamestown and I know that they're all around the hills there. Because of those huge subsidies, they can sell electricity cheaply into the grid. And what happened? The coal-fired power station at Port Augusta went broke and, along with that, the coalmine at Leigh Creek was shut down. I was at Leigh Creek in early June, and that town is on the slide, big time.




Senator Brockman:
  Jobs for workers gone!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Yes, jobs for workers. I can't believe how the CFMMEU can ever support the Greens party or the Labor Party. They're the people who are against everything the CFMMEU believes in when it comes to mining, coalmining and coal-fired generation. So let's shut it all down! Then we know what happened next in South Australia: the lights went out.




Senator Brockman:
  The lights went out!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  But it gets worse, Senator Brockman. Who pays for these renewable energy certificates of $700,000 paid for each wind tower every year? Of course, under the Renewable Energy Target of 20 per cent by 2020, or 33,000 gigs—we reduced it to that, thank goodness; it should have been reduced more—the law is that everyone who is hooked into an electricity grid pays for it, from a food-processing abattoir at Inverell, Bindaree Beef, to the poor old widowed pensioner who can't afford to turn the heater on in the middle of winter because she can't afford to pay the electricity bill, and every business and every household in between. That's who pays for it. For what? It's for the owners of those wind towers, mainly foreign companies, to take the money back overseas to increase their living standards and to reduce ours.


And what do they do in the face of emissions reductions? Virtually nothing! I was amazed when I visited a wind farm a few months ago—just one wind tower standing there. There are many, of course, but I'm just referring to one now. The tonnes and tonnes of cement that go into cementing that tower into the ground are unbelievable. And, of course, cement is a big emitter. Then there is the steel, the copper and all the metals in it. Some say the life of a wind tower is 25 years. Some say it takes 15 years of generating electricity before it even becomes carbon neutral—15 years! That wouldn't surprise me at all, given the steel and the cement that goes into it.


I remember when the carbon tax came in that, even though the cement industry received a 95 per cent discount, we were going to bill the cement industry an enormous amount of cost because they produced cement in Australia. We produce about 10 million tonnes of cement in Australia. When we do, we produce 0.8 of a tonne of CO2 per tonne of cement. In China, they produce one billion-plus tonnes of cement a year. When they produce one tonne of cement they produce 1.1 tonnes of CO2. So let's shut down the cement industry in Australia, have it all processed and produced in China, where they produce more tonnes of CO2 per tonne of cement than in Australia, and somehow that's going to save the planet. No, that simply puts workers out of the jobs and shuts businesses down. This is the whole crazy thing.


I will ask a simple question here about new coal-fired generation. What do you think they are going to burn in those new coal-fired generators around the world? You've got it, Madam Acting Deputy President—they're going to burn coal! You guessed it! Spot on! Go to the top of the class! They can burn coal from Indonesia or from China—brown coal, high-ash, poor-quality coal—and put out a lot more CO2 emissions. Or they can actually buy coal from Australia—the older black coal that's far more efficient. But no, the green religion, the green movement, linked with the Greens and the Labor Party, doesn't want to see any coalmines expand in Australia. They want to see the coal-fired generators around the world use poor-quality coal from China, Indonesia and other countries that will put more emissions into the planet's atmosphere than using Australian coal. How stupid is that?


It annoys me immensely that here we are in a country—I will give an analogy, Mr Acting Deputy President Leyonhjelm. Welcome aboard. Mr Acting Deputy President, go and check out the price of diesel around the world. If you go to Iran, diesel is 7c a litre. It's about $1.55 in Australia today, with the low dollar and higher world price of oil. Go to Saudi Arabia and the price of diesel is 13c a litre. Ask why. I will tell you why: because those countries are wallowing in oil. Wherever you dig—well, not quite—you strike oil. They've got big supplies of oil; hence, their fuel is so cheap. Compare that to Australia. What are we wallowing in? We're wallowing in energy: gas, coal, uranium—you name it. We'd have more energy per capita than any other country in the world. But what are our electricity prices? They are exorbitant. This is brought on by the renewable energy target, forcing coal-fired generation out of production, reducing supply, forcing prices up and many other things, like some of the things the state government have done.


Back in 2011, the crazy Labor government in New South Wales brought in the gross feed-in tariff, paying 60 cents per kilowatt hour to generate, while the bill was only about 22 cents per kilowatt hour. What a way to cream the system and make money. Wealthy people could put photovoltaic solar panels on their homes and get paid a fortune while the poor people paid for it. This is the Labor Party policy. You've got the gold plating of poles and wires, and the return is ridiculous on that. You can blame every state and every federal government of all political persuasions of the last 10 to 15 years for the price of electricity in Australia. Here we are now making an absolute effort to bring the prices down.


One thing has to happen for sure: the supply of electricity has to increase. We need baseload reliable supply. But, no, the green religion, as I call it—the Greens extreme-left socialists, fighting for that green space with the Labor Party—has a simple theme: 'Come follow me and I'll lead you to the land of poverty.' It's all about shutting down our businesses and reducing our living standards. As far as emissions around the world go, it makes no difference at all. If you were concerned about emissions, we'd be selling good-quality coal out of Australia to these new coal-fired generators being built, many of them in Asia, which would put less emissions into the atmosphere. But, no: talk about a coalmine being opened, and the green movement and the environmentalists will be going through the courts and so on. GetUp!, the lefty socialists, are pouring their money in and promoting the green religion so that we can't help the planet when it comes to emissions by giving them good quality coal.


It's amazing how living standards are under threat because of the price of electricity in this country. I know an abattoir very close to us where we live at Inverell that is now paying $70,000 a week on its electricity bill. It was $80,000, but they got a better deal. Luckily, the prices have been coming down a little bit. What are their competitors in Brazil and America paying? Nothing near that. But they have to compete on the world stage, with the costs going up all the time. I won't even get into the payroll tax. As for those over there—the fight for the green religion between the Labor Party and the Greens—they are going to go to a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030 and reduce our emissions by 45 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030. It's not going to do a thing except help send the country broke, make us less competitive on the world stage, put people out of work and shut businesses down.


There are some amazing quotes on this proposal by those opposite—the green army, we can call them, over there fighting the Labor Party—especially by the extreme left and the Greens. In May 2015, CFMEU president, Tony Maher, said:


… an increased Renewable Energy Target of 50 percent by 2030 will increase the cost of electricity for manufacturing and ordinary households while being a poor tool to reduce Australia's overall warming emissions.


How true. In January 2017, Ben Davis, secretary of Bill Shorten's branch of the AWU, said:


… the rush away from coal and gas-fired electricity power stations … is a little unseemly in its haste because we are potentially crucifying hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers.


How true that is. Putting the price of energy up in a country that's wallowing in energy, sending businesses broke and having people lose their jobs—that's a great way to go! While coal-fired generation is being built all around the world in most countries, we have stuck to our 73 units, and of course the green religious movement is trying to shut them down. On 25 June 2018, the Business Council of Australia said:


The emissions target of 26% is appropriate and achievable. 45% is an economy-wrecking target.


How true it is. On 27 November 2015, the National Farmers' Federation said the ALP's proposed target of 45 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 would hinder agricultural competitiveness and economic growth. The Minerals Council of Australia said:


The minerals sector is concerned at the Federal Opposition's proposal for a 45 per cent reduction in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.


The target is not based on detailed economic analysis of its impact on growth, living standards and energy costs.


The proposed target has the look and feel of an ambit claim.


That is the point. Over there in the Labor Party and the Greens, you don't care about growth, you don't care about jobs, and you don't care about the cost of living and living standards. You've done it before. In 2010, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard said, ' There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' and what came about? 


On 27 November 2015, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: 'Labor's newly announced proposal to double cuts to emissions to 45 per cent by 2030 with a long-term target of net zero emissions by 2050 was not backed by a credible plan that protects economic growth.' This is the thing: you are going down a path of saying: 'Let's all go back to the Stone Age and live in the caves. We'll give you three sticks a week to cook your food and keep yourself warm.' Then you'll wonder what's going on with living standards. That's what you're doing—you're taking living standards and reducing them in Australia. If it were going to achieve something, you'd understand it. But, as Chief Scientist Dr Finkel said, it's going to achieve nothing. It is amazing: three human beings, simply breathing for a year, produce one tonne of CO2. China, with about 1.4 or 1.5 billion people, produce almost as much CO2 as the whole country of Australia, including our industry, just through the population breathing—not doing anything else. 


It will get worse. The green religion will attack agriculture and they'll attack transport, nothing surer. It will be interesting to see what senators Gallacher and Sterle have to say when they say, 'Let's go after the transport industry.' A big country like ours has to transport so much agricultural produce and everything else, and they say, 'Let's hit that up big time with taxes and costs and shut it down. There is talk about winding back our sheep numbers and cattle numbers to save the planet. This is outrageous. People have to eat, you know. The first rule is: if you don't eat, you die, with other things in between. 


Dr Finkel said that, at 1.3 to 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions, we're not going to change the planet. This is simply a political game being played by the left-wing green movement. There is a fight for the green vote between the Greens and the Labor Party—the Greens so-called partners in crime when it comes to this. As I've said before, the CFMEU have donated money to the Greens. The CFMEU stands for the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. What do the Greens say? They hate construction—we all know that. We can go and live in the caves. Forestry—they hate forestry. They don't want timber jobs. They want to see every tree stand. They want to shut them up in national parks and let the bushfires burn them, killing the animals as well. Mining: well, as I always say, the only people the Greens hate more than the farmers are the miners. They hate mining. And then there is energy. 


The CFMEU has donated money to the Greens party of New South Wales. That is unbelievable. That a union would donate money to a political party that opposes everything that union believes in is just incredible. When it comes to the CFMEU—or the WMEU, with the maritimes now tied up with them as well—where do you stand on coal-fired generation? Where do you stand on coalmining over there? No, you are silent; you are mute. In Victorian by-elections, 'No, there'll be no coalmines there.' When we get to Queensland, the opposition leader and others will say, 'Yes, we're big supporters of coal.' It depends where they're speaking. Who do you believe? What is the truth? What are the facts? This whole energy argument has been an absolute farce.



As I said—and I agree with what Dr Finkel said at Senate estimates—if we think that we are going to change the planet we are very, very wrong. While others are producing more CO2, building more coal-fired power generation and putting more vehicles—what is it, five million extra vehicles go on the road in China a year, as they raise living standards?—we're going to change everything. No, we are not. What we are going to do is reduce our living standards here, make us less competitive around the world, wind up businesses and cause unemployment and the effect on the climate will be absolutely zilch— (Time expired)
