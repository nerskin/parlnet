"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-12-03,"—My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan. In light of the Prime Minister's statement yesterday that the Assistant Treasurer would be making a full explanation of her position to the Senate, and given that the minister has now had time to consider whether she witnessed her husband's change of enrolment, can she today inform the Senate what the facts are in relation to her husband's change of enrolment to Clareville? Minister, did you or did you not witness the form and thereby attest to the accuracy of the statements he made in that form?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-12-03,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister now confirm when she first became aware of the details of this enrolment, whether the purpose of this change of enrolment did in fact relate to taxation arrangements and what action the minister took when she became aware of the enrolment?
Government senators interjecting—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order.
—Senator Abetz, I did not hear the last part of that question. If you are taking a point of order on what Senator Conroy said, I cannot answer it because I did not hear it for the noise on my right.
—My point of order relates to relevance to the minister's portfolio responsibilities. What was in the mind of a certain person when they filled out a form is clearly not within the minister's capacity to answer and should be ruled out of order. It has no bearing on her ministerial responsibilities. Above all, it would fall under the standing order of not allowing hypothetical questions, because she could not know what was going on in that person's mind at the time he filled out the form.
—Mr President, on the point of order: among other things, above the din caused by the government trying to cover up and make a lot of noise while Senator Conroy asked his question, he was asking when Senator Coonan was aware of these matters relating to Mr Rogers's enrolment. That surely is in order, and I ask you to direct the minister to answer the question.
—As you would know, I cannot ask the minister to answer a question in a particular way, but I did hear that first part. Minister, would you answer the first part of the question? I did not hear the second part.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2002-12-03,"—I thank Senator Conroy for his supplementary question. Senator Conroy, you are in the very unfortunate position of having made an allegation against me that you cannot make stick. You clearly tried to set up an inference yesterday that I had witnessed an enrolment form, and you made allegations that the enrolment was false—which you could not know. You have now come an absolute cropper, because I had nothing to do with that enrolment. What I can do, because I think it is appropriate, is table a statement from my husband that he put out yesterday. I think it should be part of the record of the Senate and I table the document.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-12-03,"—I think in court you would probably say, `The defence rests.' He is a beauty, isn't he! The struggle that the Leader of the Opposition has had today is one he has quite often, although on this occasion he has been assisted by Senators Ludwig, Wong and Cook, who should probably just give up and go home really: he has run out of steam, hasn't he! The trouble that the opposition have had today is that they have no additional evidence—no new ammunition, as I guess we call it in politics—to sustain an attack on Senator Coonan. We found out yesterday that Senator Coonan was not being attacked personally. She was being attacked via her spouse. Because the Sydney Morning Herald and the Fairfax press have an interest in this, we saw Mr Secombe come into the gallery today. He was obviously worded up by the opposition— `Come in! We're going to continue the attack. Listen to me. We are going to get a scalp here. We can smell blood!' The poor old opposition—they cannot come up with a policy, they cannot come up with a new idea. Poor old Mr Crean—it must be very embarrassing for you, Mr Deputy President, being a member of this party—had to go out with Julia Gillard today and say, `This isn't a policy. It's not a policy. We've nearly got a policy. It's not even a discussion paper. It is sort of an idea, but it is not a policy yet.' It is a little bit sad. Labor have just got to try to find some relevance. They cannot hurt Senator Coonan, so they find that they have to attack her through her spouse.
As the Prime Minister described in the other place today, you have got these raving feminists on the other side of the place who you think would stick up for the fact that you can have a successful woman go into politics and who is married to a successful man who is running an internationally successful practice in mediation and dispute resolution. It would be absolutely outrageous if we on this side sought to attack someone on the basis of what their spouse did. But, of course, these upholders of morals and ethics on the other side would seek to do that.
—You have.
—Who was the big misleader in the Senate yesterday? In a gutless and spineless attempt, Senator Conroy was waving around a piece of paper and pretending he had an enrolment form. Using innuendo, he would have had the Senate— and in fact anyone who looked at the Senate yesterday—believe that that is what he had.
—Order! Senator Ian Campbell, I advise you to withdraw the statement in respect of Senator Conroy.
—I withdraw unreservedly, Mr Deputy President. Who misled the Senate in relation to the innuendo and the assertion that Senator Coonan had made some breach in relation to Justice Rogers's enrolment? There is a difference in ethics between this side and the other side— and I do not say that just because Bob Brown is over here at the moment. The difference here is that Senator Coonan was alerted to an error in her statement of senators' interests yesterday. The first minute she was allowed, she rose to correct the record and has since put it in writing. She has corrected the record and has apologised. The difference between Senator Coonan and the Leader of the Opposition is that he will never correct the record and he will never apologise. He is the serial offender in attacking people who do not have the protection of parliamentary privilege, and when he has been proven wrong—as he has comprehensively in relation to at least two people that I can recall at the moment—he has not apologised and he has not forgiven. He wears it as some sort of mark of honour. 
We on this side do not regard it as a mark of honour; we regard it as typical of his performance and typical of his reputation as someone who is prepared to get into the gutter, throw mud around and attack people. He attacked members of the Baillieu family who had in fact passed away. He actually accused them of breaching the law, many years after they died. He has yet to apologise to the Baillieu family. More recently than that, he attacked members of Senator Winston Crane's family in relation to some matters, and they were unable to defend themselves. The allegations were comprehensively proved to be entirely inaccurate, and he has yet to apologise to former Senator Winston Crane's sister or to former Senator Crane himself—two people who were not able to defend themselves. At least, where Senator Coonan has made honest mistakes, she has actually corrected the record in this place. We will not hold our breath waiting for Senator Faulkner to apologise for what he has done to innocent people outside this place in abusing parliamentary privilege, but we expect that tomorrow we will have to struggle through yet another hour of question time.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I have read the statement by Mr Andrew Rogers, which Minister Coonan tabled in the Senate today, in which he gives reasons for his changed enrolment circumstances. I must say that a more unconvincing rationale have I never read. It is just gobbledegook. It was only a few months ago that in a puff piece about the Coonans—and we have all been subject to those—they were quoted as lamenting that the weekender at Clareville `has not been visited this year'. In other words, neither Minister Coonan nor Mr Rogers had been to Clareville this year. How can you be on the electoral roll for a property you have not visited once in 2002? It is just a nonsense.
Mr Rogers was registered at the Woollahra address from 5 January 1998 to 14 March 2001, and that is consistent with everything else. He then moved his registration to Avalon from 14 March until just a week or two ago. But, of course, he did not change his address for Endispute. That is curious in itself. But, as with the Dr Dean case, it is the neighbours who tell you the story about Mr Rogers. One who lived next door said, `It's very rare to see him down here.' Another one, two doors away, said, `No-one lives here permanently; it's a weekender. We rarely see anyone there.' When confronted with these contradictions, what did Mr Rogers do? He said, `I moved up there whilst renovating.' Anyone who has ever been through renovating immediately is sympathetic, because of course you have to get out when you are being renovated. But then Minister Coonan corrected the record herself and informed the newspapers that the renovations had been complete for 11 months— before he changed his registration.
—Haven't you read his statement?
—Yes, I have read it, and it is gobbledegook. I am not today going to go to the motives of all this. Rogers was not entitled to be on the roll at Clareville. That is absolutely clear from his own statement, clear from the neighbours' statements and clear from the fact that he initially misled the newspapers as to his motive for making the change. Like all other electoral fraud here when it comes to registration, it is not actually to try to change votes at the other end. The point was made time and time again when everyone in this chamber, including some present, condemned electoral fraud in Queensland, it was not to affect the end result; it was for sordid internal party reasons. In Dr Dean's case, just two weeks ago, Dr Dean falsely enrolled not to get an extra vote in his electorate but to deceive the preselectors into thinking that he was a local and that he was not living 20 kilometres away in the leafy suburbs of Melbourne. In fact, he rented this particular property and then never lived there; he was not entitled to be on the roll. The Queenslanders were not entitled to be at the wrong address, Dr Dean was not entitled to be at the wrong address and neither was Mr Rogers. He did not live at Clareville. No evidence has been produced.
—There is evidence.
—I wonder if Justice Rogers—as he then was—would have believed this sort of hearsay evidence of residence himself when he was presiding over a case. Of course, he wouldn't; he would have dismissed it as absolute nonsense. His reasons have been given—no explanation, of course—as to why he basically lied to the Sydney Morning Herald when first confronted. He said that he moved out because they were renovating. His own spouse had to correct the record and say, `Hold on.' He transferred his enrolment basically 11 months after the renovation was completed. 
I do not know what his motive was. Some people allege that it was to dodge land tax; I do not know. I find it curious that he would put out a second statement. When these issues were raised in the Senate, all of a sudden he ran to the land tax office and said, `I really shouldn't be registered at Clareville; you should really bill me.' They billed him and he paid it straight away, so there has been no tax dodged at this stage. But why go to Clareville initially? Why put up the false reasons? We want to know why. We know it is not for reasons of direct electoral fraud— none of these cases ever are; there is always some other motive—but where are the witch-hunters on electoral enrolment now? Where is Mr Christopher Pyne, who likes running on these issues? He is dead silent.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2002-12-03,"—Poor old Senator Ray—I really thought he could do better than that. The display we have seen in this chamber today has been a fine example of the three golden rules by which the Labor Party conducts its federal political affairs. Rule No. 1: never talk about policy. Not a word about policy have we heard today, as Senator Ian Campbell pointed out. Rule No. 2: don't be too bothered about how free you are with the truth. The number of lies, half-truths and innuendos that have been sprayed across the chamber this afternoon has been quite shocking.
—Order! Senator Brandis, you cannot accuse senators of lying. I ask you to withdraw.
—I withdraw. Rule No. 3: never climb out of the sewer. I dwell for a moment on the word `innuendo', because that is what it is. Senator Ray used the word himself. Innuendo is being piled upon innuendo, because there is no factual basis for the allegations that are being made.
The Clareville property has been the subject of a series of mischievous and quite false allegations. First of all, we had Senator Conroy in question time yesterday waving a document around and alleging—his question is recorded in Hansard—that Senator Coonan had falsely witnessed an electoral enrolment form. We now know that he had no such document—that the document he was waving around was not an electoral enrolment form at all but a theatrical prop. When asked, `Did you witness this document?' Senator Coonan, very truthfully and frankly, simply said, `I don't know, Senator Conroy; I'd have to have a look.' Nevertheless, in all the newspapers—in all the media—this morning the allegation is articulated as if it were true. That part of the case fell flat on its face with the first word of the first answer in question time today, after Senator Conroy rose to his feet and directly asked Senator Coonan whether she had signed Mr Rogers's electoral enrolment form at the Clareville property and her simple answer was no. All of that innuendo, all of the implications and all of the insinuations piled one upon another and then published through the national media today to smear Senator Coonan's reputation amount to nothing more than a falsehood—the sort of disgraceful innuendo which Senator Conroy has made his trademark.
The second allegation about the Clareville property, which we just heard from Senator Ray, was another cowardly attack on someone, not directly but through their family. The suggestion is that Senator Coonan's husband, former Supreme Court judge Justice Andrew Rogers, was practising electoral fraud. It is preposterous to suggest so. As anybody who knows the impeccable reputation of Mr Justice Rogers, as he then was, as a senior judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, as for many years the chief judge in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and as a patron and benefactor of many charities in Sydney, he is a great Australian. He is an eminent and distinguished Australian and it is pitiful—it is pathetic—that this Senate should be used by Labor Party politicians who are bereft of an issue to attack a man who has done more for this country than Senator Conroy, Senator Faulkner or Senator Ray will do in their entire public lives. 
Nevertheless, Mr Rogers's statement published today does have a complete answer. Mr Rogers and Senator Coonan moved to Clareville during the renovations of Senator Coonan's house in Woollahra. Then, as Mr Rogers said in the bits of the statement that Senator Ray did not read, because of his extensive overseas commitments he continued to use Clareville as a residence. He said:
In this context I decided that I would stay at Woollahra when Helen was in Sydney and able to spend time with me but otherwise use the Clareville residence.
Because I regarded Clareville as my principal place of residence I transferred my electoral enrolment to there in 2001.
As you know, Mr Deputy President, that is the requirement, that enrolment be at the principal place of residence. Mr Rogers decided that that was where at that time he was spending most of his time and so, quite properly, he chose to enrol there. That very honest act has been sordidly distorted.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-12-03,"—Senators in this place should operate on a basic political principle: if there is nothing to hide, hide nothing. When answers are given that obscure the facts, when answers are given that do not reveal all of the facts and when answers are given that refuse to answer the question put, a reasonable issue arises as to why there is an effort not to tell all the truth. We are dealing with a minister, with a code of ministerial conduct and with a principle that justice must be done and that justice must equally be seen to be done. And the only way in which it can be seen to be done is for everything to be put on the record openly and without bias so that the record can speak for itself. On this occasion, that has not been done. Things have been prised out. The memory of a key minister has been found lacking on issues of their own personal management and repeatedly, in answers to questions from the opposition, the minister has suddenly recalled things. That is just not good enough for a person in public office.
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. That statement entirely misrepresents what the minister said. What the minister in fact very truthfully said was, `I do not recall, but I will check.' Having checked, she came back to question time today and gave accurate answers that totally destroyed the allegations made against her yesterday.
—Mr Deputy President, there is no point of order. It was an attempt, under the guise of a point of order, to have a further say in the debate that was closed for this senator a few moments ago. Of course, if the senator curbed his zealotry on this matter and got some balance into his conduct, he would wait and see what other things I was going to say, because that will establish beyond any doubt that my headline remarks are entirely justified.
—There is no point of order. Senator Brandis was on a debating point rather than a point of order. Senator Cook, I ask you to resume your contribution.
—We have now seen Senator Coonan engage in the White Rhinos loophole. Senators in this place all know about White Rhinos trust—it was former Senator Parer's trust. We know that Senator Parer was in breach of the ministerial code of conduct, and we know that the Prime Minister changed the ministerial code of conduct to bring it into conformity with Senator Parer's financial arrangements through the White Rhinos trust. The facts of the trust were that, under the ministerial code of conduct, you could not hand over your benefits to a family member. What did the Prime Minister do? He changed that to a spouse or a dependent family member, thus allowing Senator Parer's adult children to take over his trust. In the case of Endispute, that is exactly what Senator Coonan has done. She has used the White Rhinos loophole to hand over her beneficial interest in Endispute to her 25-year-old son—a principle that of course was first illegal under the ministerial code of conduct, was then made legal to allow Senator Parer off the hook and is now being benefited from by other ministers. 
We know as well, by the conduct of the key players in this issue, that there is something to hide. We know that Rogers himself lodged an ASIC report and paid his taxes on 15 November, after this matter became publicly notorious. We are left with the hanging question: if it were not publicly notorious, would he have done that? The fact that he only did it after the event and not before it is a matter of considerable interest. We know that Endispute is not a shelf company—it is an active trading operation—and we know in all probability that it would be pretty hard to disguise that from Senator Coonan, because it trades out of the property that she owns in Woollahra, in Sydney. It would be pretty hard for her not to know that a company operating from her private home was in fact an active company. We know that Senator Coonan could not remember, when she spoke yesterday, that she actually owned a house in Manuka, when she said the only house she owned was the house in Woollahra. This is from a minister who is in charge of taxation and insurance in this government, and we know that Endispute provides services to the insurance industry.
There is a further question that ought to be answered, and it ought to be answered forthrightly, straightforwardly and without any qualifications—just tell it as it is up-front and do not duck and weave and hide. It is about the active trading company Endispute, which is not a shelf company but an active business whose business premises is the Woollahra home entirely owned by Senator Coonan—we know that those two things are facts. Does this company pay any rent to Senator Coonan for the use of her private premises? That is a question that ought to be answered.
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. This is the oldest trick in the book, and Senator Cook is a serial offender. There is, once again, an innuendo in that question—by the use of the device of a rhetorical question—to suggest a conflict of interest by the minister. That is in violation of standing order 193(3). The allegation does not have to be made as a statement; it can be concealed in a rhetorical question, but the allegation still lingers in the air. It is a very intellectually dishonest thing to do. In this case, it is also in breach of standing order 193(3).
—Mr Deputy President, this is quite an outrageous point of order. There is nothing in what I have said that is in the slightest bit out of order in this chamber. The intellectual dishonesty of Senator Brandis is quite staggering. He is a serial offender in terms of intellectual dishonesty in this place, and has been intellectually dishonest on major questions on many occasions. That having been said, it is quite appropriate—
—You should withdraw that immediately, before you are told to.
—I beg your pardon?
—I think you should withdraw unparliamentary language, Senator Cook.
—I withdraw unparliamentary language, but in doing so I merely say that I was repeating exactly the phrases used by Senator Brandis when he spoke of me. If it is unparliamentary language for me to use those phrases in speaking of Senator Brandis, it must equally be unparliamentary of Senator Brandis to use those phrases when speaking of me. In which case, Mr Deputy President, surely you should now invite Senator Brandis to do the honourable thing—something that he is not keen to do, because he remains seated—and withdraw those reflections.
—Mr Deputy President, if you have ruled the expression unparliamentary in relation to Senator Cook, as I understand you have, then the ruling would apply equally to me.
—Senator Brandis, without getting into a lengthy debate, are you withdrawing?
—Yes.
—Senator Cook, there is no point of order. I ask you to continue your remarks. 
—The point I was making was that the owner of this property is Senator Coonan. A business is conducted from this property. It is worthwhile to know whether Senator Coonan charges that business a fee for the purpose of the use of her property or not. If she does, then surely she knows it is an active business. If she does not, she is providing an in-kind, free good to that business. I would like to know if that is then set out in their profit and loss accounts and in their records of transactions, because the use of the property is a key input in the ability to conduct a business of this nature. Since it is entirely conducted from the premises owned by Senator Coonan—(Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today relating to her pecuniary interests.
Through newspaper reports and Mr Rogers's own statement, which was of course released last night in the dead of night, we do have the undignified situation where Mr Rogers has been scurrying around, trying to organise his and Senator Coonan's affairs into some semblance of legitimacy. This is a very sorry episode. We do know that Mr Rogers had to hightail the company secretary of Endispute to ASIC to lodge the late company report of Endispute on Friday, 15 November—two days after Senator Coonan's status as director was exposed in the Senate. But of course the plot thickens. On Monday, 18 November, Mr Rogers contacted the Office of State Revenue and told them that Clareville was no longer his primary place of residence and asked for a land tax bill. November 18—as you would recall, Mr Deputy President—was the Monday after the opposition started asking detailed questions about Endispute and was the same day that Senator Coonan made a statement to the Senate in relation to her involvement with the company.
Mr Rogers wrote to the AEC at the same time and he re-enrolled at his Woollahra address. He is now officially on the roll back where he lives. Mr Rogers received the land tax assessment for Clareville on Friday last week and paid it yesterday. In relation to that, I say: score one up for Senate accountability. On the other hand, Senator Coonan has a real problem. She has been proven to be a comprehensive and serial misleader of the Senate. Endispute, it turns out—
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order: that is an attribution against Senator Coonan which is in violation of standing order 193(3). It is an allegation of dishonesty. 
—Senator Faulkner, on the point of order, I would ask you to withdraw `serial misleader'.
—I withdraw the words `serial misleader'. If that is unparliamentary, let us examine the record. As it turns out, Endispute is not a shelf company, although that is what Senator Coonan claimed in the parliament. She said it was; it is not. It is an active, trading family company. We know that Endispute provides alternative dispute resolution and mediation services to, I think, the top end of town. It is not an inactive shelf company at all. I believe that Senator Coonan has misled the parliament in that regard and has almost certainly contravened the code of ministerial conduct. And, of course, she is still to explain a conflict of interest.
Senator Coonan misled the parliament over her property in Manuka, having stated yesterday that the only property she owns is in Woollahra. Senator Coonan misled the parliament with her declaration of pecuniary interests, stating that the Woollahra address was an investment property. She blamed her staff. She signed the form. She has now corrected the record, having had the discrepancy pointed out again by the opposition in the Senate. We do not know the details of the status of Mr Rogers's electoral enrolment. Senator Coonan may be the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Revenue, but she clearly does not have a head for detail. This is a person who claimed triumphantly before the Senate that she is meticulous.
Worst of all, Senator Coonan has ministerial responsibility for insurance matters, yet apparently this family company has been involved in providing services to the insurance industry through dispute resolution. Minister Coonan's policy recommendations for the reform of the insurance industry in Australia included, for example, her statement to the Senate on 17 October when she said that she was looking at:
... how one can better do further work to encourage mediation and pre-trial dispute resolution.
The truth is that heads in this place have rolled for less than this. It is about time that Senator Coonan faced the music on these issues and explained this serial misleading of the parliament. I believe that Mr Howard should act.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Faulkner repeated his unparliamentary words `serial misleader', and he should once again be asked to withdraw.
—Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: when you called on me to withdraw those words, which I am not certain are unparliamentary—
—You should withdraw them again!
—No, no. I am speaking to the point of order.
—Senator Faulkner, I may be able to assist you. The advice from the Clerk is that the offending word is `serial'. The two words together are offensive, but in particular `serial'.
—I thought I made a very strong case that she is a serial misleader; so no, I will not withdraw those words. I will withdraw the word `serial'.
—Mr Deputy President, I would ask you to direct the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw the unparliamentary words `serial misleader'. You have told him that twice now. He is not prepared to accept it. I ask that he be asked to withdraw those words immediately without qualification and then to sit down.
—As you know, Senator Ian Campbell, I cannot instruct anyone. I can rule on the point of order and I will do that. My previous ruling on the point of order was that the words `serial misleader' are unparliamentary because the phrase implies deliberate misleading. That is unparliamentary, and I asked the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw. I repeat the request for the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw the unparliamentary comments.
—Mr Deputy President, you asked me to withdraw the words `serial misleader' earlier in my contribution. I doubted that they were unparliamentary but I withdrew them in deference to your ruling. Towards the end of my contribution, you explained further that it was the use of the word `serial' that made the term `serial misleader' unparliamentary, and I have withdrawn the word `serial'. 
—The point that I was making in my ruling was that the words `serial misleader' together are unparliamentary. The word `serial' implies deliberateness, so I ask you to withdraw the whole phrase `serial misleader', please.
—I withdraw the whole phrase `serial misleader' and just replace it with `misleader'.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-12-03,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill 2002,
Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Special Benefit Activity Test) Bill 2002,
International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002,

Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 2002.
I table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—
CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill will amend section 22 of the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 to:
·	clarify the section to ensure that the Minister would have authority to issue a permit under section 22 regardless of whether he has received an application for permission, as originally intended;
·	provide for holders of freezable assets to apply to the Minister for a notice permitting the dealing in that asset; and 
·	provide for holders of assets to apply to the Minister for a notice permitting the giving of that asset to a proscribed person.
Section 22 was inserted into the Act by the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002.
Reasons for Urgency
If the amendments are not made by 6 January 2003, section 22 of the Act will commence with the effect of removing the existing ability of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (under the Charter of the UN (Anti-terrorism Measures) Regulations to issue permits relating to dealings with freezable assets or proscribed persons; and key procedures relating to holders of freezable assets that cannot be included in regulations will not be able to be implemented. This could have adverse impacts on cooperation between a significant class of asset holders (the financial sector) and the Australian Federal Police in the investigation of the existence of terrorist assets in Australia.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Foreign Affairs)
—————
FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SPECIAL BENEFIT ACTIVITY TEST) BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill
This Bill will give effect to the measure agreed to as part of the 2000-2001 Budget to introduce activity testing arrangements for special benefit recipients who hold a temporary protection visa and who are of work-force age.
Reasons for urgency
The initiative contained in this Bill is to commence on 1 January 2003. It is critical that the Bill is passed in the 2002 Spring Sittings ahead of the commencement date so as to have sufficient time to finalise supporting administration.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Family and Community Services)

INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2002
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will give effect to Protocols amending the 1980 Double Tax Convention between Australia and Canada and the 1980 Double Tax Agreement between Australia and Malaysia; and make certain minor technical amendments to the International Tax Agreements Act 1953.
Reasons for Urgency
It is desirable that the Protocols take effect from the earliest possible date (witholding taxes must take effect from 1 January) to ensure that taxpayers obtain certainty and the benefit of lower withholding taxes. In the case of the Canadian Protocol, Canada has already taken steps to implement the agreement. It is desirable that we follow suit without delay. In the case of the Second Malaysian Protocol, it is desirable that the tax sparing provisions (which have retrospective application) take effect as soon as possible.
Early consideration of the technical amendments in this bill is desirable as the amendments are consequential upon the passage of the legislation containing the US Protocol (the International Tax Agreements Act (No. 1) 2002) and it should take effect at the same time as that Protocol.

MEDICAL INDEMNITY BILL 2002
MEDICAL INDEMNITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2002
MEDICAL INDEMNITY (ENHANCED UMP GUARANTEE) CONTRIBUTION BILL 2002
MEDICAL INDEMNITY (IBNR INDEMNITY) CONTRIBUTION BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bills 
These bills cover a package of measures which are designed to address medical indemnity issues. The main features of the package are:
·	assumption by the Commonwealth of the liability for incurred but not reported liabilities (IBNRs) for those medical defence organisations (MDOs) which have not fully funded them;
·	assumption by the Commonwealth of the liability for a portion of high cost claims of $2 million or above; and
·	imposition of levies on members of those MDOs with unfunded IBNRs to recoup the liability of the IBNRs; on doctors benefiting from the extension of the guarantee to the provisional liquidator of United Medical Protection/Australian Medical Indemnity Limited to recoup costs arising from the extension; and on doctors to recoup future costs of the high cost claims scheme, once the IBNR levy has ceased to operate. 
Reasons for Urgency
The reasons for urgency are:
·	to honour public commitments that a comprehensive framework of measures to resolve medical indemnity issues would be in place by 31 December 2002;
·	to provide certainty to the medical defence industry, and to potential new entrants to the medical indemnity insurance market; and 
·	to meet the expectations of the medical profession that the Commonwealth will respond quickly to medical indemnity issues and provide a stable insurance environment, so that doctors are reassured that they can continue to practise with adequate medical indemnity cover.

NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS—BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [No. 2]
Purpose of the Bill 
The purpose of this Bill is to effect savings in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by increasing the general and concessional copayments, and general and concessional safety nets.
Reasons for Urgency
If the Bill is not introduced and passed in the 2002 Spring sittings, projected savings to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will not be achieved.

TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2002
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will correct a significant drafting oversight in a recent amendment Bill and improve the Trade Practices Act 1974 to facilitate its use as a model for national consumer protection laws.
Reasons for Urgency
Imprisonment as a penalty for a contravention of section 155 was inadvertently removed in redrafting the provision and its reinsertion is desirable as a matter of urgency.
(Circulated by authority of the Treasurer)
—————
TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS PROTECTION) BILL 2002 [No. 2]
Purpose of the Bill
The proposed Bill will amend the secondary boycott provisions (sections 45D and E) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to take representative action and intervene in proceedings in matters of restrictive trade practice.
Reasons for Urgency
The Government has on several occasions sought the introduction of protections for business, and particularly small businesses, against secondary boycott actions. Most recently, the proposed amendment was rejected by the Senate on 19 August 2002.
Industry views the introduction of adequate protections for businesses against secondary boycott action as an important matter. Businesses, and particularly small businesses, continue to be effectively denied adequate protection from costs and damages produced by unlawful conduct.

WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill 
To make a range of mostly minor and technical amendments to a variety of acts administered by the Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio, including (relevant to this context):
·	an amendment to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001 to rectify a drafting error that had the unintended effect of possibly decriminalising three offences in the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989; and
·	an amendment to the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Registration and Accountability of Organisations) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2002 to ensure that section 317 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 correctly identifies offences relating to secret ballots. 
Reasons for Urgency
The reasons for requesting that this Bill be introduced and passed in the current Sittings revolves around the two amendments outlined above.
Regarding the change to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001, there is currently a possible (and unintended) gap in the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 (the ICNA Act) which means that prosecutions in relation to contraventions of three provisions of the ICNA Act may not be able to be brought. The amendments proposed in the Bill to remedy this are to commence retrospectively, that is from immediately before the relevant amendments to the Criminal Code Application Act commenced on 2 October 2001. Although there appears to have been no contraventions of these provisions in the intervening period in respect of which prosecutions are contemplated, it is highly desirable that the amendment be passed and take effect as soon as possible. This will reduce, as far as possible, the extent of the proposed retrospectivity and return certainty to the operation of the provisions in the event that any breaches necessitating criminal prosecution occur. 
The second reason in relation to the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Registration and Accountability of Organisations) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2002 is to avert the need for the amendment to have retrospective effect. The 2002 Act will commence on 12 May 2003 and it is preferred that the amendment—proposed to commence immediately before relevant provisions in the 2002 Act—take effect before that date.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-12-03,"—I thank my colleagues. I move:
That, on Tuesday, 3 December 2002—
	(a)	the hours of meeting shall be 2 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., and 7.30 p.m. to midnight;
	(b)	the routine of business from 7.30 p.m. shall be consideration of the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002; and
	(c)	the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be proposed at 11.20 p.m.
To pre-empt Senator Harradine's concerns, I will make a few comments. I did hold discussions with a number of people late last night when it became clear that the debate on the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 would not conclude last night. We had hoped that with a lot of goodwill and discussion between the office of the Minister for Health and Ageing and participants in the debate it would be possible to finish it tonight. But I had clearly indicated to the world at large that if it was not then we would have to look at when hours could be extended to do it. We indicated to anyone who asked that we would obviously have to look at Tuesday night, but I did not want to flag that too much because I was hoping that it would be finished last night.
I did hold discussions late last night with Senator Ludwig, and other people who were around, and suggested that we sit late tonight. We did not get that agreement until, I think, about half past 12 today. I immediately prepared a draft motion, which is now before the Senate, and asked the Parliamentary Liaison Officer to hand it around, as is normal practice, to all whips and leaders and minority parties and private senators. The Parliamentary Liaison Officer asked that if anyone had any concerns with the proposal they contact us as soon as possible. 
The proposal is basically to sit the same hours as we did last night and hopefully make progress with the bill. So that Senator Harradine and others know what is in my mind and, I think, in the mind of the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, I will say that if we can get the bill finished that will be very desirable. We have now debated the bill for 32 hours or thereabouts, and we will have many more hours tonight, obviously. If it is not possible to complete it tonight then we will seek to continue with it tomorrow. I can assure the Senate that, for a number of reasons, we will not seek changes to sitting hours tomorrow. We will deal with what happens after Wednesday if we are still going.
I am trying to ensure that we deal with the bill before the Senate in a sensible, sound and diligent way to ensure that it is debated fully and that ultimately democracy prevails and a bill that represents the will of the Senate emerges. All honourable senators would recognise that I in particular—although also with the assistance of other leaders and whips and the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate—have a responsibility to ensure that between now and the Christmas break, and hopefully by the end of next week, which is what we are aiming for, the Senate considers the remainder of the government's program. So we need to juggle both of those things.
We only have limited hours between now and the end of next week. It is my hope that we will finish all of the business, including the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002, by the end of next week, so the Senate will not need to come back for extra sittings either the following week or on the Friday and Saturday as has happened in the past. It is our aim to try and get all the bills finished in a reasonable time and to ensure that senators can operate in an effective manner during that time.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—I was around last night. In fact, I did not leave until 12.45 this morning and, indeed, I was back here at 7.30 a.m. I would have been grateful to have been consulted. I have been asking, `Why don't we sit on Friday if you need extra time?' I would be very happy to do it and I think I mentioned that at the whips'—
—We may have to sit on Friday.
—What I have been attempting to do in this—
—It is just that some people have families and live on the other side of the country; some people live in Queensland and some people have to make arrangements. We are trying to basically facilitate everyone's lives.
—I understand that, through you, Mr Deputy President.
—It is hard to get flights to the other side of the country; there is only one airline in some parts of the country.
—I understand that.
—Senator Harradine, I think you should proceed with your comments and others should desist.
—I am only trying to be reasonable and some people are not.
—Was the Manager of Government Business in the Senate saying something about being unreasonable?
—I said I am trying to be reasonable.
—I would have been grateful if you had consulted. I would have put the view strongly that we sit on Friday, because this is a very major bill. It is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has come before this chamber in all of the 28 years that I have been in this chamber. I recall very well the concern that was expressed by Julius Stone, that great international jurist, when I first proposed the ban on experiments on human embryos in 1984. Professor Julius Stone said that this is the area that will `pose grave problems for the whole of humankind', and he compared it to the Manhattan project. That came from an international jurist and in fact the person who was responsible for the Moscow-Washington hotline during the Cold War.
I asked the minister to explain a few things in relation to a number of amendments and I withdrew some amendments after her explanations. I was proposing to hasten things, as far as that was possible, but we have to give the major issues full consideration. I acknowledge what Senator Ian Campbell has said in that regard. But I saw what happened last night. I have also been told by others that from about half past nine until about a quarter to 10 things got really touchy around the joint. People were getting very tired, and it was observable last night. What we want in this particular debate is calm presentation of arguments and the ability of people to listen to the arguments, because of the importance of the issue. 
I appeal to the Senate that we should not go to midnight tonight, as we did last night, for the very reason that I mentioned. I would hope, and I make this appeal to the chamber, that we go until 11 p.m.—and I think that is pretty well stretching it. I am glad to see the minister, Senator Patterson, in the chamber; of anybody she had the most difficult job last night. I really am appealing to the chamber that we do not go until midnight but that we go until 11 o'clock and that we have the question for the adjournment proposed at 10.20 p.m.
I am quite amenable to sit further hours, if that is necessary. I cannot guess what the end result will be—whether we will finish tonight or whether we will not—but I know that it will be far easier and far more conducive to getting through the program if the chamber is not forced to sit until midnight. In that event, I move:
Omit “midnight”, substitute “11 pm”; and omit “11.20 pm”, substitute “10.20 pm”.
I make this appeal; we will all be better off doing it that way.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-03,"—I support Senator Harradine's amendment. I would make a constructive suggestion to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that maybe, for a number of people who are really concentrating hard on the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002, it would be a help if we just reordered the program if we have to sit so long, so that speeches in the second reading debates on other legislation are brought on at nine or 10 o'clock to give some respite to those, including the minister, who have such a big burden, and also to prepare for the rest of the debate if it does not get that far. I think it would expedite the program overall if we were to look at that option.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-12-03,"—Having listened to the debate in relation to this issue, it is worth putting the position of the Labor Party. The Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 is important. It has attracted considerable attention from all parties. The consideration of the bill does require, and has required, a significant number of hours, both during the second reading debate and in the committee stage.
To date, as I understand it, there have been some 32 hours set aside for this bill. I think it is worth mentioning that, of those 32 hours, the opposition has by and large conceded a significant amount of time to the government to allow the debate to be progressed—not only in the last period but also in other periods such as that relating to the understanding that we would not during estimates week, and particularly the Monday or the Tuesday, deal with the Research Involving Embryos Bill and that we would go on to other business. The opposition were required to concede a significant amount of time to allow for that to occur and also additional time to allow for second readings of other legislation of the government to be debated.
Wherever possible and wherever it has been able to, the opposition has met the requirements of this bill to allow significant time for it to be debated and thereby a considered approach to be taken. As it turns out, the opposition has allowed the debate to stretch over some time and not be compacted. The chamber has not been put in a position where it has had to run the debate over a very short timetable over a very long number of hours. In fact, this debate has gone on for some weeks. An intervening break was called for, as I recall, to allow parties to discuss amendments with the government and to come to positions on them. So there has been an intervening period of a week to allow parties to understand the amendments, for people to become familiar with the amendments and for discussions about those amendments to take place. 
An additional three hours and 50 minutes was put forward for Monday, 2 December. We have already had a Friday where an additional six hours and 15 minutes was put forward. On Thursday, 14 November, the opposition agreed to an additional three hours and 13 minutes; on Wednesday, 13 November, an extra two hours and 46 minutes. So the opposition have allowed two things to occur: significant hours to be put forward for this bill to be debated fully and for the committee stage to be progressed, and sufficient time for the general business of this government to be dealt with—either with it or in addition to it—to allow those matters to be progressed.
The opposition have taken the view that this bill does need time to be debated. My understanding—and I am open to correction on this—is that we had agreed that if the committee stage of the bill was not completed on the Monday then Tuesday night would be needed. The opposition expressed the view that Wednesday night would not be granted but that certainly—at least to my mind—additional hours up to at least Monday and Tuesday, possibly more, might be requested to ensure that the debate on the bill has sufficient time, that no-one feels constrained, that we do not go beyond ordinary hours into what we would regard as excessive hours. The government's motion is still within those parameters, given that we have only had one late night in a fresh week. We are now looking for a second late night. To that extent, the opposition will oppose the amendment moved by Senator Harradine but will agree to the motion moved by the government.
It is also worth commenting that Senator Harradine did refer to Friday. That was an issue that the opposition had also considered. The last time we were here, it considered early in the week whether or not Friday of this week would be required. Because of airfares and a whole range of arrangements that people make, the opposition said, `If you are going to utilise Friday then let us know with sufficient time for people to make arrangements.' That was on the basis that Friday could be made available if the government so requested it to be utilised. The government made no request to the opposition for the use of Friday. The opposition, I suspect, was in a position, if the request was made last week or with sufficient time to allow people to make arrangements for that day, to consider that favourably. But no request was made by the government, and still no request has been made. However, today I heard Senator Ian Campbell say that Friday might be needed. I will consider that, depending on the progression of this debate. However, we would expect that, with the additional time given to the committee stage on Monday and Tuesday and all parties cooperating, the committee stage might be concluded tomorrow.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-12-03,"—I will try to be brief, because I am sure that Senator Ian Campbell does not want us to chew up all the extra time he is trying to get us for the debate on the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 on debating whether or not to sit. However, I do think these are important issues, even if they seem a bit arcane and administrative, and it is appropriate for the Democrat position to be put on the record. I do not envy Senator Ian Campbell his job, particularly in trying to negotiate this bill through the Senate and the timings in relation to that. The pressures from his own people, let alone everybody else in the chamber, would make it more difficult than usual.
I would note, though, that my colleague Senator Allison, the Democrat whip and deputy leader, has been involved in a number of meetings and discussions about potential sitting times. It has been a bit of a movable feast. I understand why that happens but it does make it more difficult for all of us to plan. I would make a special note of the difficulty for those of us on the crossbenches— independent senators and senators from parties with small numbers. From the Democrats' point of view, whilst we are a party with larger numbers than others on the crossbench, this bill has been handled in effect by just the one senator. The load on that senator—Senator Stott Despoja—is the same as that for independent senators in terms of needing to spend all of the time in the chamber. There is that extra burden on people. We all know that this is just the start of a sitting fortnight that history tells us is likely to be quite an arduous one. So to wipe ourselves out with late sittings right at the start of that fortnight is probably not the brightest idea. That the Senate should have midnight sittings for the first two days of a fortnight when there is a real prospect of late sittings next week, as well as Friday sittings and the like, is less than ideal. For that reason, the Democrats are very supportive of the suggestion put forward by Senator Harradine, who is one of the people who has obviously participated deeply in this debate. 
Government senators interjecting—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Could the private meetings on my right keep the noise level down to below 100 decibels.
—I think suggestions that have been put forward, that if we are sitting late we could possibly have a bit of a respite from this one particular bill and fit in some of the others that have been sitting around on the Notice Paper,are also good ones. I would urge the Manager of Government Business to consider them when we revisit the issue of sitting hours, as I am sure we will over the next week or two. It can be a useful way to get some bills out of the way whilst giving those involved in the major one a bit of a break. In recognition of the extra strains put on the crossbenches in particular, the Democrats are supportive of Senator Harradine's amendment. We recognise that it will not be successful and that the need to enable adequate debate on the stem cell bill is obviously very real. As Senator Ludwig pointed out with his extensive outlining of statistics on the hours and minutes spent on the debate, there has been a lot of time spent on the debate already. The need to actually conclude the debate at some stage obviously has to be acknowledged.
I also take the opportunity to point out once again, as I have a number of times in the past, the Democrats' view that part of the problem is the very limited number of sitting days that the government puts forward in this chamber. We now see the sitting program for next year, which also has, by historical standards, quite a low number of sitting days. If next year is going to continue the trend we have seen in recent times, there will be an ever-increasing amount of legislation to be dealt with in that smaller number of sitting days. In a sense, the problem gets worse each year, with less time spent debating legislation and more legislation that we have to debate. The Democrats once again make the point that we believe that one solution to slightly lessen the difficulties that we face at this time of year with these types of bills would be to recognise that, given the way the Senate's role has developed, we need to spend more time debating legislation in the chamber.
In conclusion, we are supportive of Senator Harradine's amendment but we do recognise the difficulty of Senator Ian Campbell in trying to get the government's legislative program concluded. Obviously, his motion will go through, but we suggest that some of the things that have been put forward in good faith by the ever-constructive crossbench be considered for future purposes.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-12-03,"—On behalf of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, I table a statement entitled Managing Migration, together with Migration Series Instructions Nos 370 and 371.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Managing Migration</title>,Ministerial Statements,14,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-03,"—I certainly do agree with the amendment as it is an extremely important amendment. I will not fully canvass once again the reasons for the amendment but I will refresh the memories of senators regarding the amendment. The Greens are moving to establish a national stem cell bank which would effectively hold as property stem cells and would ensure that they are available on an equal basis to those entities who would put those cells to research and other use as laid down in this legislation. It would be a holding bank with guidelines and ethics that many people would want to see in place if embryonic stem cells or, indeed, adult stem cells were to be made available for research purposes.
Before consideration of the bill was adjourned last night, I said that some senators had got this matter back to front. We need to establish processes which will reassure the public that embryonic stem cells in particular are not going to be misused and are not going to be used for commercial advantage with that as the driving ethic rather than the humanitarian grounds that we hear propounded by supporters of embryonic stem cell and embryonic cell research. The best way of doing that is to establish institutions with guidelines and an overview to ensure that this research is kept within the bounds that society wishes it to be kept within; otherwise we will continue to build on the current situation in which there are largely no checks and balances.
I know some people will say, `There is cell research taking place at the moment; we don't want to stop that. What you're proposing here is that we wait until July next year to work out how to set up a national cell bank such as the one being set up in Britain.' I say, `Let us wait.' If somebody wants to move that the current slate of experiments be allowed to continue in the meantime, I would certainly entertain that. But what I do not entertain is the alternative proposal that is before us which effectively says, `Let us wait some years before establishing the organisational basis and the guidelines that go with it.' This amendment only puts into play what the majority of senators, I believe, would want to see happen—that is, we know what the boundaries are; we know who is writing those boundaries and we know that stem cells from any source are not going to be inappropriately used. So you set up a national bank for these cells first. You do not pass this legislation and then say, `Further down the line, we will move to the appropriate mechanism, which is the bank.'  
This is a very important amendment, as far as I am concerned. I have great difficulty with this legislation. A while ago Senator Harradine mentioned the Manhattan project—I do not know whether it was in this context or not. I do not think that science was adequately regulated when the explosion of nuclear potential and power into the living fabric of the planet occurred much less than a century ago. I am very concerned that there are laboratories at the moment in the United States and elsewhere fabricating viruses for no other purpose than to allow scientists to see if they can do it. Quite recently, one laboratory in the United States announced that they had fabricated the polio virus from building block proteins—a virus which a good many of us had thought had been effectively eliminated from human society. When the head of that laboratory was asked, `Why did you do that?' from behind his white coat he said, `To show that terrorists could do it.' That is an appalling failure on the part of scientists to regulate themselves, to have an ethic which is appropriate and which puts at the forefront the security of life, in both the short and long term, on this planet.
We are dealing with legislation to regulate the use of embryonic stem cells which are a by-product of the IVF process. One of the strongest arguments put forward in this chamber is, `These cells will be disposed of anyway and effectively killed.' But it seems to me that the legislative process is not tight at all; we have open doors everywhere. Senator Nettle and I are proposing that we establish a national public human stem cell bank. It is an idea which is new, just as research involving these cells is new. But it is an idea which is commensurate with the public concern about these cells. It is an idea which suggests: `Let us have a central holding authority so that we can assure the public that there is clear and transparent use of these cells and ethical guidelines at a one-stop shop,' a one-stop bank on this occasion, `which is under scrutiny by the parliament— that is, by the people.'
This is a simple reassurance mechanism but a vitally important one. I commend every senator to look at this stem cell bank proposal. I also ask every senator to make sure that we put it in place. The amendment that we have is worded to say, `No, don't put it off. Don't separate it out from this legislation. Make it part of it; put it in the schedule.' Let us have the investigation that is required and make sure that it is done properly. It is a learning process but not so much as the experimentation taking place with embryonic stem cells at the moment. It is much easier to set up an institution than it is to work out the processes that should be divined, what the ethics are or how we as a human community draw the line on stem cell research. Let us do it, and let us assure ourselves that a transparent, publicly backed authority is in charge.
One of the concerns that would allay things, as far as I am concerned, is the recognition that we are being driven by a profit motive—the corporate sector sees huge returns coming out of stem cell research—and that the foot is on the accelerator because there is a race to get there first. That is very different from the humanitarian motive and the possibility that there might be a breakthrough which would help human beings with disabilities or those who are suffering in one way or another. If we are going to make sure that it is for the humanitarian motive and not for the profit motive then we have to legislate for that. It is a complex matter but this proposal makes it as simple as possible. It comes out of the findings of a committee in the House of Lords. The United Kingdom is moving to set up a stem cell bank. We should do so too. I ask senators not to allow this to be put on the shelf for future investigation without a time line being set for implementation down the line after this legislation has been brought in. That is a prescription for ensuring that it does not happen. It is much better for the bank to be set up—and then we can change the laws, adjusting them to help the bank to work fully and in the best interests of the people—than for the bank not to be set up because we think we are unprepared. I think we are unprepared for stem cell research, frankly, in many ways. 
It would help me greatly in determining how I should vote on this legislation if I knew that there was an authority in place whose full-time, whole and sole concentration was to ensure that stem cell research was for the wider public good and for humanitarian purposes. It would have its eye on the pitfalls and the things that could go wrong and it would ensure that stem cell research was absolutely not driven by the market, which is a great place for making money but a very poor place for manufacturing ethics. I commend very strongly the amendment by Senator Nettle for the establishment of a national public human stem cell bank and believe that we should await the establishment of that bank rather than give licences out first.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-12-03,"—Like Senator Brown, I will reiterate my comments from last night, with a few additional comments inspired by Senator Brown's contribution. For the benefit of the chamber and the community, I have indicated that the preference of the Australian Democrats is for the stem cell bank amendment, standing in my name and that of Senator McLucas—the same amendment that was successfully passed when we debated the legislation in relation to the prohibition of human cloning.
There are a couple of issues that I want to put on the record in addition to those that were raised last night. There has been a suggestion—and I hope that Senator Brown does not mean this as a reflection—that moving this amendment is in some way a recipe for ensuring that it will not happen. When I move or support amendments in this place, I do so believing that they will happen, specifically in relation to science; I take that area particularly seriously. With regard to the amendments that I have moved in relation to law, including private member's bills over the last seven years as science spokesperson for the Democrats, I have moved them with the belief that they should happen. I am not quite sure why there is a sense among some senators in the chamber that an inquiry will not necessarily result in a recommendation and an outcome.
Certainly I would not be very happy, and I do not think many other senators who supported the amendment moved in my name and that of Senator McLucas would be very happy, if the inquiry amendment was not acted upon. It will depend on the recommendations of the inquiry as to whether it is a stem cell bank or another mechanism. That is the point that I have made before. The previous speaker is right in saying that this is complex. Scientific debates in this place and in the community generally are complex. The nature of legislation is, of course, often reactive. The nature of science is, by definition, innovative. It is very hard for us to keep up with some of the changes that take place, especially when it comes to research and invention.
I am not suggesting that there is no role for parliament—quite the opposite. I am a strong believer in regulation of these areas but I also want to make sure we get it right. I think it is really important to remember that the legislation that we are debating is different from that of the UK and other parts of the world. We have seen other examples from Singapore, Taiwan, Israel et cetera. We have a different legislative mechanism, a uniquely Australian one, which we are debating at the moment. It is much more conservative than the UK legislation and I think that is a really important point to remember too. 
I have a question for Senator Nettle, who has moved this amendment in good faith—I recognise that and I recognise the idea behind that. I am just wondering about the funding of the stem cell bank proposal. Senator Nettle, I presume you recognise that the funding arrangement in the UK is 2.6 million, as I understand it. That is not `easy'.
—That is difficult.
—I am not suggesting that we should not find the money to come up with an appropriate regulatory mechanism—because we should do that and we have to do that—but is an institution comparable to the one in the UK what we want in Australia? We may want that, and that is why Senator McLucas and I have put forward an amendment to ensure an inquiry into just that issue.
I think senators have touched on broader issues here. I will not go into the debate concerning the intellectual property environment again, but there is clearly a need for broader investigation of the issue of intellectual property patents in relation to this current and emerging technology—hence the successful second reading amendment moved in my name on behalf of Democrats in relation to these broader matters. I am not suggesting we duck this issue; I am not suggesting that we postpone it. What I am suggesting is that we do it correctly, and I think there is majority support for that. I really do not want this to be misrepresented as an unwillingness to either debate or safeguard intellectual property. Of course we should be guarding against misuse by multinationals, greedy pharmaceutical companies or whatever the stereotypes may be. I actually think the issues are a little more diverse than that.
Before we just pick up something from the UK, we should remember that their legislation and their debates on these issues pre-empted ours by many years, in much the same way that other jurisdictions in the world were on top of some of these issues long before we were. But now we have a piece of legislation. I do not want supporters of the legislation to be described simply as unqualified supporters. I am a qualified supporter of this legislation. I think the COAG agreement and the Prime Minister, on behalf of the government, have got it just about right. If I could, I would tweak a few things here and I would radically change a few things there, but I recognise that that is not going to be within the scope of this debate.
I also recognise that changes in relation to science and science law happen slowly— sometimes too slowly. Last night I used the genetic privacy example as one where, yes, there had been an inquiry. I think that was appropriate, because it has highlighted the fact that maybe you do not simply amend the Privacy Act in relation to that issue. Maybe you look at disability discrimination law. Maybe you look at human rights and equal opportunity law. I think this is another example where we are going to be looking at patents, at this legislation and of course at the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002.
Once again, on behalf of my party, I reiterate our support for the notion of and the investigation into the applicability of a stem cell bank. As I say, I do not want this to be misconstrued as a lack of support for the protection of the rights of the community as well as the rights of scientists and researchers, who, as I think we all would recognise, in the majority of cases do work that is not just for a personal or `financial pecuniary interest', to utilise the terminology of last night. This is a common good debate. To ensure that the common good is protected, let us investigate these issues. Just because we have seen the example of a stem cell bank from one jurisdiction that has very different legislation from the bill that we are debating—
—It's not a federation either.
—It is not a federation. I recognise that state and territory jurisdictional issues have to be investigated. So I think that is why Senator McLucas has got it right, certainly in our committee report and in our amendment. Time lines are important, and ascribing time lines to the government is important. Indeed, as I said last night to Senator Brown, if this debate is about postponing the issuing of licences or if it is about the time line—because that would be a consequence of this issue, and I understand that it might have broad-ranging consequences not simply in relation to stem lines but also in relation to ART—then let us talk about the time line. 
In terms of the UK model of the stem cell bank, I would like to see whether there is an Australian equivalent or an even better solution. I would like to see that take place in a broader debate about the intellectual property framework that guards scientific invention and in particular scientific research in what is a fascinating, interesting and undoubtedly controversial area, as we have seen during the debate on this legislation over the last couple of weeks. So our preference is not for a quick fix, ad hoc solution that we believe has not been investigated thoroughly. It certainly has not been investigated in the same way as in the House of Lords inquiry, which had comprehensive investigations and thus comprehensive recommendations into these issues.
It is certainly a very different scientific environment and economy here. In respect of the idea of 2.6 million, the other thing is the overseeing role, which in the UK is the responsibility of the MRC, the Medical Research Council. I do not think these issues have been fully explored. We touched on some of these ideas in the report of the Senate committee inquiry—certainly Senator McLucas and I did that in the committee inquiry. I suggest that the other people who were involved in that committee inquiry are aware of these issues as well, regardless of differing views. It is an idea that warrants investigation, but I do not think a couple of hours of debate in the Senate is sufficient to set up this overarching institution. I think there are other ways of going about this— thus the suggested inquiry into the applicability of a stem cell bank.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I agree with Senator Stott Despoja that at this stage we should be looking at the time frame. Whilst I indicated in the debate on the cloning bill that I supported the Stott Despoja and McLucas amendment, I think I indicated quite strong reservations at the time that I preferred a stronger regime but, at that point in time, that was not available in the form of amendments to that bill. I now have the opportunity to reflect on a number of issues, and I agree with Senator Stott Despoja that the time frame issue is quite critical. She and others from the debate will recall that Senator Patterson made the point that already the review would look at some of the commercial interest issues and that what was being proposed in relation to the Stott Despoja and McLucas amendment in part fitted into the process that was already in train. But my critical concern here—and this is why I pick up Senator Stott Despoja's comment in relation to time lines—is that, unless we do something now, we cannot stop the horse from bolting.
As I understand it, we are dealing with Nettle amendment (R1). So what we are actually dealing with is a Green proposal on how to stop the horse from bolting. I would be quite happy to support, for instance, an alternative version of the rest of the Green proposal, which is the stem cell bank, if we were to amend it to refer to a commercial interests regulator—the point being, though, that we do not issue the licences until we have the regulation in place. I am also flexible on other ways of trying to prevent the horse from bolting. 
As did other senators on the inquiry—and I certainly acknowledge Senator Stott Despoja's longstanding interest in this area, which has been much deeper than mine—I found very illuminating the contribution of Mr Ilyine from Stem Cell Sciences during the committee inquiry, because he addressed one of my most critical issues in this bill, which was that the bill was not really picking up the strict regulatory regime that COAG had promised us. The Senate will recall that the first issue that arose in this debate in a sense developed from issues raised in the inquiry, which was an objective to limit the number of embryos that would be utilised in this endeavour. Mr Ilyine reminded us that the European and British model of establishing a stem cell bank was done precisely for that purpose. It was part of meeting the objective of limiting the number of embryos that might need to be utilised in this endeavour.
I have already raised in the committee stage that, whilst my own ethical position does not quite equate to what has been described as the third way—which is that whilst we might find this issue ethically contentious there are humanitarian grounds for accepting it, so let us go down that path—I have tried to grapple with the best way of achieving that ambition, given that it was obvious, at least from the second reading vote, that that was the dominant ambition. In my view, if you do hold the view that human embryos have some level of value, that we should respect that value by ensuring that they are not experimented on willy-nilly, that we do not use excessive numbers in experimentation and that experimentation is only done for humanitarian purposes and not done just for commercial interests, and considering all those factors, then that is what this bill should be addressing. If at this point we are not doing something about introducing a means of regulating or containing those for-profit or commercial interests then I think Senator Brown is right: we are basically saying, `We'll look at it,' but in reality we are really saying that we probably will not get around to it, that we will not get around to it adequately or that we are not very concerned if the horse bolts in a variety of areas that we do not even fully comprehend at this stage. 
I was very pleased to hear Senator Stott Despoja say, `Let's have that discussion about the time frame,' because I think that is the most critical issue. Senator Nettle's amendment is not the only way to achieve that. You can look at implementing alternative models to the stem cell bank immediately, you can look at implementing alternative models to the stem cell bank on an interim basis or, as Senator Brown has already foreshadowed, you can look at implementing the stem cell bank and modifying it as we learn from international experience. But none of the arguments so far rationalise doing nothing, because the point is that we were assured by COAG that, if we went down this path, we would have a strict regulatory regime—and no strict regulatory regime that I know of says: `Leave the blank sheet now and we'll sort it out later on.' I think this is one of the most critical issues in relation to ensuring that strict regulatory regime.
I notice that Senator Murphy has just circulated an amendment in relation to patents. Of course patents, as Senator Stott Despoja has gone into quite a great deal of detail on, are one of the alternative ways of seeking to regulate commercial interests—as in the European model, which denies patents in relation to `the unmodified human stem cell line', to use the words Mr Ilyine gave us. He gave a very interesting description of why that was the case. He said:
The unmodified human stem cell line in Europe, it would be argued, comes from nature and therefore should never be patented because a patent granted in this domain would be so broad as to be hugely inhibiting to discovery, because any discovery made on the back of that would have to relate to the original patent holder. So the European position is to say that discoveries made when using such cell lines are indeed patentable when they have novelty and all of the factors that go into making a patent. However, the unique biological material itself should not be patented because it is of human nature.
That argument is, in a sense, twofold. Firstly, there is a public interest argument, which is that discovery would be limited unless we provide some containment of this patenting process. Secondly, there is an intrinsic argument about human nature, which is that these are the types of things that we should not patent. It is a bit like the argument about why we do not accept commercial interests in the trade of blood. The argument is that public interest and humanitarian issues outweigh the argument that this should be an area that attracts commercial interests. 
In Australia, I think many people would baulk at the notion that commercial interests would solve our blood bank supply problems. The regulation of the supply of blood has quite a long and detailed sociological history in relation to some of the dangers that might occur were blood regulated in other ways. In a sense this also relates to earlier amendments which asked why it is that we have accepted willy-nilly that commercial interests would apply in respect of stem cells when that has never been the response in Australia in relation to any other human tissue.
I conclude my remarks by recommending we display an enormous amount of caution in what we allow to occur here. I agree with Senator Brown that we are looking at new and evolving interests, which we can barely comprehend at this point. There is an argument for moving away from our current ways of regulating this type of material. Senator Stott Despoja will probably say in a moment that we have allowed that in some other areas, but I would agree with her that we should have been far more cautious in those other areas. I do not think it is beyond us to come up with a way of stopping the horse from bolting. I will support the proposal that Senator Nettle has moved. If there is not adequate Senate support for her proposal, I will be circulating an alternative proposal once the draft has been finalised. I will be looking at expanding on the European experience rather than the UK experience in relation to patents. To ensure that the horse does not bolt—and on an interim basis whilst we wait for the review and the recommendations of the review and for parliament to enact an appropriate regulatory regime in relation to these commercial interests—this bill should make it a condition of licensing that people not seek patents. There are some difficulties with this amendment that I am trying to work through in terms of how we can relate it to the Australian legislation. But we need to explore issues associated with international law as well.  
Despite some of those concerns, I think that at this point it is better than nothing and I know of no argument that justifies doing nothing. I know that some will argue that, unless we allow carte blanche, commercial interests will go offshore. With respect, we have had that offshore argument on every single issue that we have dealt with so far. COAG assured us we would have a strict regulatory regime. I think Senator Brown is correct in that implicit in what has been said in the public debate to date is that humanitarian interests would be paramount over commercial interests. If, on a limited basis, we can do that through limiting access to patents, then that is one way. 
I should also mention that, in one sense, Senator Murphy's amendment also seeks to do that but at this stage his proposal would be on a permanent basis. I am suggesting that we allow the benefit of the review that Senator Stott Despoja and Senator McLucas are suggesting but that in the interim we have some arrangement that limits carte blanche commercial interests until the result of that review. When the result of that review sets up an appropriate regime then, if it is appropriate, the restriction on patents will not apply.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I rise to speak briefly against the amendments moved by Senator Nettle. I wish to confine my remarks to the amendment that we are dealing with now, which is about delaying the licences, and also to a subsequent amendment on the running sheet that Senator Nettle will move later. I think it is true that almost all senators here think that there is a possibility that the establishment of a national stem cell bank may be a useful mechanism to do two things: to limit the number of embryos that are required for research purposes and to allow access to embryonic stem cell lines for all scientists who have the approvals to do so. The difference is only in how we achieve such a bank that could deliver those desirable outcomes.
I think it is important that we recognise the context in which we are having this discussion. There has been limited community discussion about the establishment of a national stem cell bank. In fact only one witness raised the issue during the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry into these bills. That witness was Mr Ilyine and he raised the issue only briefly. It is very hard for us to make decisions about the form and style of a national stem cell bank, having received evidence from one witness at the inquiry and without broad community discussion about the appropriateness, applicability or suitableness of the UK model to Australia. 
The other reality that we have to remember is that the UK bank has only been in operation since 9 September this year. It is too early for us to make an assessment of how it has worked in the UK. The UK bank operates in a completely different legislative regime in terms of the operation of their licensing requirements and in terms of their intellectual property environment.  
I also note that the amendment from Senator Nettle suggests that the bank be a repository for human stem cells, which would include adult stem cells. The committee had no evidence—none at all—from adult stem cell researchers which suggested that that would be an appropriate mechanism, so I have no evidence to inform a decision about whether or not a bank would be a useful mechanism as a repository of adult stem cells. I suggest that a more prudent approach would be to allow for a period of time in which to see how the act is operating so that we can make a sensible assessment of the need for and the potential scope of a national stem cell bank. I think it would also be prudent for us to allow time so that we can learn from the UK experience—so that we can learn the lessons from its operation, so that we can find the pitfalls before we have to go through those events.
With respect, I suggest that it is not back to front; it is in fact the right way forward. Let us get it right. Let us make it work. It is not possible now to completely know what operations the bank would have or what guidelines we would have to put in place for it to operate. I commend to senators the way forward, recommended by Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Webber and me in our report following the inquiry and put into effect through our amendment, which we have already successfully moved to the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 and which we propose to move later in this committee stage. I suggest that it is a prudent, sensible and thoughtful approach that will deliver the best possible outcome—that is, to limit the number of embryos that will be required and to allow access to a broader range of scientists in a more equitable way. Our amendment is not a do-nothing option. The level of support which is evident in the Senate—and which will be in the community, I believe— will ensure that analysis is undertaken of the UK model's applicability. From that, we will have some valid information which will inform the development of an appropriate model, an Australian model, for an Australian national stem cell bank.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-03,"—Very briefly, may I say that I support the comments made by Senator Collins. The real concern I have about the proposition that is being put forward by Senator Stott Despoja and Senator McLucas is simply that, from the assent to this bill, licences will be issued. It would seem to me that, for all the value that one might get out of a review and the establishment of a stem cell bank further down the track, one is going to be faced with this problem: how does one make the licences that have already been approved, and the work that comes out of those licences, subject to or part of that stem cell bank? People will argue about retrospectivity, and I cannot see anyone agreeing to anything being retrospective. Whilst Senator Nettle's proposal does not necessarily encompass everything that I would like to see in this area, it would make sense that any licences issued were subject to the establishment of the stem cell bank. That is not going to be achieved by the proposal in the amendment of Senator Stott Despoja and Senator McLucas. So, at this stage, with no other options being before the Senate, it seems to me that the only reasonable option is the amendment being put forward by Senator Nettle, which I support.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-12-03,"—I would like to take this opportunity to clarify for the Senate what is being proposed not only in this amendment but also in the subsequent amendment that Senator McLucas referred to. So that there is no confusion, I reiterate that our proposal is not simply to take the UK model for a national stem cell bank and inject that into the Australian legislative framework and into this bill in particular; rather, our substantive amendment regarding the establishment of a stem cell bank seeks to give the AHEC an opportunity to investigate the establishment of a national stem cell bank. Rather than saying, `Here is the model existing in the UK; let's transfer it into the Australian context,' what we are doing is providing a framework through which an investigation can occur about the sort of national stem cell bank we want to see. That allows, as Senator McLucas referred to, for there to be more community discussion and more public involvement in generating the appropriate model for Australia. 
The substantive amendment, which is our subsequent amendment, highlights the framework, the context and the areas in which we need to look at all of the issues that make up a decision about what form the national stem cell bank will take. It is not a simple transferral of the model; rather, it is allowing for a mechanism for the community and public to be involved in shaping an appropriate national stem cell bank for Australia. It also goes further than just stipulating what areas we need to look into and how that review should take place, and I think others have acknowledged that AHEC would be the appropriate forum in which to do that. It achieves a vitally important step that other people have talked about, which is to set in place a time line in which this should occur. The time line that is proposed in our substantive motion on this is for a report to be brought back to both houses of the parliament no later than 1 July 2003. At that time, the stem cell bank in the UK, as an example of something we can look at, will have been running for almost 12 months. Over the next six months, from now until the date we propose it comes back to the parliament, there is an opportunity for a whole range of stakeholders on this issue to have input into the form the stem cell bank should take. 
The motion we are debating at the moment is our amendment to link the establishment of the stem cell bank to the provision of licences. We have heard from others about the importance of doing this, and we have heard from Senator Brown the rationale of why we believe this is important. Everyone here is aware of how much concern there is about this area, so we are putting in place an opportunity for public accountability, transparency and public ownership of the research that is occurring, an opportunity which will take place through a national stem cell bank that allows public involvement in deciding the exact format that it should take.
This model we are proposing allows for extensive public and community consultation so that we can develop an appropriate model. The amendment we are discussing is about ensuring that licences are not provided so that we do not run into the sorts of difficulties that Senator Hogg was talking about, whereby people proceed with research and then another mechanism will need to be developed to bring them into line with a national stem cell bank that will have been established subsequent to their research being carried out and their licence being provided for. So we are putting forward a whole package which involves community consultation, developing an Australian model and putting in place a time line to ensure that this takes place. It allows parliamentary accountability in terms of coming back to the parliament where the decision can be made. I cannot do more to commend this model to the chamber as a thorough way to go forward on a stem cell bank that, as indicated in the previous bill, senators in this place support being put into this legislation. We are providing that framework: it is thorough and it is inclusive. It ensures that we can then move forward in a framework which the community and stakeholders are prepared for and are happy with. I commend this amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-03,"—I endorse what Senator Nettle has just had to say. It comes down to two matters. First of all, there is the desirability of having a national authority in place before the licensing system gets under way, and that is what the current amendment is about. The next amendment on this matter from Senator Nettle would establish an inquiry process, to be determined by July next year, as to how a national stem cell bank would be established—and it can draw on the British experience—and would report back to parliament. It would then be up to us, because licences would be awaiting, to get on with the job of bringing that bank into being. But even for those who do not want to have the licences held up, the idea of the bank should be canvassed. It has inherent and enormous merit when we are looking over a landscape with so many imponderables, unanswered questions, pitfalls and unknowables. It needs a structure like this to bring some order into that landscape.
I admire greatly both Senator Stott Despoja and Senator McLucas, but the option is not a good one, because what they are saying is, `Let's not have an inquiry of that sort at all, except that the people who are appointed by the National Health and Medical Research Council will have to consult the Commonwealth and the states and a broad range of other persons.' That is far short of the inquiry that Senator Nettle is recommending. But if we take Senator Stott Despoja's and Senator McLucas's option, it really comes to this: 
... as soon as possible after the second anniversary of the day on which this Act received the Royal Assent—
so that is more than two years down the line—
(4) The persons—
appointed by the National Health and Medical Research Council—
undertaking the review must consider and report on the scope and operation of this Act taking into account the following:
(a) 	developments in technology in relation to assisted reproductive technology;
(b)	developments in medical research and scientific research and the potential therapeutic applications of such research;
(c)	community standards—
and then the new proposal—
(d)	the applicability of establishing a National Stem Cell Bank.
It is not even the establishment of a national stem cell bank; it is the applicability of it. So 2½ years from now, four people that we do not know and do not appoint are going to look at the applicability of whether establishing a stem cell bank should be a matter for the review. It has no foundation of strength and direction.
—No teeth!
—Yes, it just does not make it. It is not going to lead to the creation of a stem cell research bank and it is certainly not going to do what the British have already established. I do not know whether that bank is functioning, by the way, but it has been established. I will reiterate what we are after. I will quote from an announcement by the Medical Research Council in the United Kingdom on Monday, 9 September. They stated:
The Medical Research Council ... today ... announced that the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control ... has been appointed to set up the UK Stem Cell Bank ...
Yes, it did cost £2.6 million. That is a very small amount when you consider the massive ramifications we are looking at and the sort of money that private enterprise is pouring into this particular area. That press release says that the establishment of the UK Stem Cell Bank at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control:
... will ensure that there is a single national independent institute responsible for managing and supplying ethically approved, quality controlled stem cell `lines' for research. The cell lines are derived from stem cells which continue to multiply and reproduce themselves and can survive indefinitely. The bank will hold existing and new adult, fetal and embryonic stem cell lines.
Yes, adult stem cells are there, but that is very much within the bailiwick of the inquiry that Senator Nettle is proposing. The press release goes on to say:
A new high level Steering Committee will be put in place to oversee the activities of the bank.
That is standard stuff; it is not difficult. It is certainly no more difficult than asking the National Health and Medical Research Council appointed people to investigate the same matter two years down the line but with their investigation only looking at applicability. I think these are very important amendments from Senator Nettle, and I ask senators to think very carefully about the safeguards that we need to be giving to the community over the matter of stem cell research. I will be supporting this amendment and I will certainly be speaking again to seek the support of senators for Senator Nettle's substantive amendment, which will come right at the end of this discussion, to have that review, on the establishment of such a bank in Australia, report back to the Senate by 1 July next year. I think it is a very important idea to assuage the concerns that so many people, not just in this Senate but in the Australian populace, have about this new science.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—I thought that the minister might have responded to—
—I gave a long speech last night on it, Senator Harradine. 
—I am well aware of what you did last night, Minister, but I thought that you might have responded to what has been said today. There are a number of things that have been said in this committee, and I was looking forward to a response from you about this proposed amendment.
Firstly, I oppose the legislation. However, I will support whatever is necessary to ameliorate this situation. For example, there should be something which establishes that embryonic stem cells will not be sold commercially to the highest bidder. That possibility is promoted in this proposed legislation. However, it is contrary to the intentions expressed in the COAG agreement and by COAG itself. Is the Minister or the NHMRC saying that the state premiers and others will support human embryonic stem cells being sold to the highest bidder? Clearly, the committee inquiry found that there had been no cures or treatments discovered by the use of embryonic stem cells but, if there had been, those cures or treatments would be reserved only for those who could pay the huge amounts of money involved. This is what Senator Nettle's amendments attempt to address. The concept of a bank is a matter of concern but, if that bank had some control over the uses of stem cells and some consideration of the ethical questions regarding those uses—we are talking mainly about human embryonic stem cells here—then it may be the way to go.
I was going to ask about adult stem cells. I support the use of adult stem cells and I am a great supporter of stem cell therapy, provided that you get the stem cells from an ethical source. There are plenty of ethical sources and useful sources as well. However, embryonic stem cells from excess ART embryos will be absolutely no use at all for therapy. No use at all, and do you know why? One of the reasons is that they are histo-incompatible. Absolutely! So, they are not going to be of any use at all. There are no examples of the usefulness of such stem cells. On the other hand, stem cells derived from ethical sources, such as from the patient, are in fact being utilised for a number of therapies which have proven to be successful. That was the advice given to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. Normally speaking, stem cells from the patient would not be subject to commercialisation other than through the reasonable expertise and expenses that are involved in obtaining the stem cells from the patient.
Under these circumstances, I agree with Senator Collins that it is necessary to do something about this matter. However, I do not agree with Senator Stott Despoja that we should leave it until the hand-picked review in three years time. As Senator Collins said, the horse will have bolted by then. Senator Collins mentioned patents as well. Senator Nettle's amendment does put a brake on that and, in doing that, it deserves favourable consideration.
I know we cannot debate it now, but I cannot help discussing this matter without referring to a forthcoming amendment by Senator Nettle which provides for the AHEC, the Australian Health Ethics Committee, to commence the investigation, to do the consultation and to provide a report to parliament on 1 July 2003 in respect of this matter. I do not know whether that can stand alone. The mover may be able to tell me whether that amendment could stand alone if there were a provision which required that no licences be granted for the use of human embryos from whom the stem cells will be extracted. That is the sort of thing I would be hoping and looking for. There have been suggestions in this debate, including by Senator Collins, that there should be a report and that, until that report is made, there should be a provision requiring that there is no licensing until that has occurred and parliament has dealt with it. I do not know whether that is possible. If proposed new clause 19A is defeated, is it possible for proposed new clause 47A to be amended so as to essentially require that no applications receive a licence until that time?

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—If the major concern is regarding patents of human biological materials, it is like last night. I want to reiterate: those of us who are not supporting the amendments do not disagree with the intent of the amendments but believe it can be done in other ways. We have to get that clear. It was like the issue of conscientious objection—people have very strong views that it can be done one way and others feel that it can be done in other ways. 
If it is about patenting of processes related to, or therapies derived from, embryonic stem cells then I believe that if people have a concern about that, there is a similar concern regarding the patenting of adult stem cells or any other human tissue. Throughout this debate people have held up the advances made in relation to therapies available today as a result of research on adult stem cells but one of the things we have to understand is that some of those advances have been made because people have been prepared to invest in the research, and companies have invested money and secured intellectual property protection and developed the products or processes and brought them to market. We have to make sure we separate out the intellectual property of the discovery versus the ownership of the stem cell lines. A number of people in this chamber share similar views about the former. Some people think that nobody should make any profit out of it. In that case, people will not invest.
There is the issue of the patenting of the stem cell line—not just embryonic stem cells but adult stem cells and other human tissue. As I have stated previously, the issue of patents and IP applies to all human biological materials, not just to embryonic stem cells, and I therefore oppose an approach whereby we adopt a knee-jerk and ad hoc response to embryonic stem cell research in the absence of the consideration of broader issues. If we want to ban embryonic stem cell research until this issue is resolved then maybe one should think about what is happening with adult stem cell research. People do not seem to have an objection to that or say that we should have a bank for that. I think it is a position that few of us would support. I do not think it would be received all that well by the Australian public. 
As I stated previously, all of these issues would be more appropriately dealt with through a review, the details of which the government is currently considering, to be conducted by the Australian Law Reform Commission. I mentioned this in the debate on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002. This will be a broadly based review covering intellectual property issues relating to human genes and genetic technologies, including stem cells. That is a more appropriate way to deal with it. It is a holistic way, and a more appropriate way. That is one of the reasons I will not be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-12-03,"—I agree with the minister's last statement about a holistic approach. I want to take a holistic approach that puts the horse before the cart, not the cart before the horse, which is exactly what the minister has proposed when she said, `Let's charge off down the research racetrack and do whatever we can and patent whatever we can patent and then we will have a review in two years time and see whether we need to have any laws with regard to patents and intellectual property.' Minister, I do not agree with that approach. I would like to ask you this question: if you, as the minister, believed that there were things that could be patented but which you thought ought not be patented, under the current acts how would you go about stopping that?",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—I would like to refer to the act that covers intellectual property, which has an express exclusion concerning the patenting of human beings. Section 18(2) of the Patents Act prohibits the patenting of `human beings and the biological processes for their generation'. In their submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into the scientific, ethical and regulatory aspects of human cloning, IP Australia stated:
Consistent with the provisions of subsection 18(2) of the Act, IP Australia will not grant patents for the following:
·	human beings, foetuses, embryos or fertilised ova; or
·	wholly biological processes that begin with fertilisation and end with birth of a human being. 
The practice of IP Australia is to grant patents on applications in respect of inventions involving human genes, tissues and cell lines, and non-human clones and cloning procedures, providing such inventions meet the statutory patentability requirements such as novelty, inventive merit, industrial application and adequate disclosure of the invention in the patent specification. (A human cell line is different from naturally occurring cells in the human body. It is capable of continuous propagation in an artificial environment by continual division of the cells, unlike naturally occurring cells which die after a limited number of divisions.)
A mere discovery of a gene implicated in a condition such as multiple sclerosis would not be granted a patent, unless that gene had been isolated and purified, and a full description of an actual use of that gene was included.
It is the understanding of IP Australia that its practice in granting patents for inventions involving human genes, cell lines and tissue is consistent with the provisions of subsection 18(2) of the Act. This is premised on a widely accepted view that human genes, cell lines and tissues are not regarded as human beings, as distinct from foetuses and embryos which are regarded as human beings and hence are not patentable.
However, while the applicability or otherwise of section 18(2) is reasonably straightforward, there is a grey area and the potential for ambiguity, and I believe that this is one of the reasons why we need this review. If you are going to stop research going ahead you should actually also stop research on adult stem cells, as I have argued. If you do not believe that there is an argument that the patent issue should be addressed before anything goes any further then I think the argument holds for adult stem cells. I do not believe that that is necessary and I will not be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I would just like to respond to a couple of things that Senator Patterson has said in this debate, because I think they deserve some level of challenge. Firstly, I will comment on the point that if you deal with embryonic stem cells in this way the same should apply to adult stem cells. I think the point I made earlier clarifies that distinction very well, as does the evidence that we had from Mr Ilyine from Stem Cell Sciences, which advocates quite strongly that there should be a stem cell bank. This is one of the operators in the industry saying that it thinks that there should be a stem cell bank. The point is that, in the experience of regulation in Europe and Britain, such means were used to eliminate competition and to allow more embryos than might otherwise be required to be used in these humanitarian concerns.
As I said before, that is not my particular ethical position, but I would recommend to Senator Patterson that she take a more careful look at the report that came from the committee. The report fairly clearly did not say that we are not talking about human beings. The report had a more implicit assessment of this position, which was that we are really talking about a third way ethical position—that is to say, most people think that human embryos have some level of moral status. It might be, in the view of some, less than, for want of a better word, a full human being or an adult human being, but part of that status should be that we restrict or limit the usage of human embryos as far as possible. That is the point of regulating commercial interests out of this equation. Again, as I have said before, this is not an ethical or moral position to which I ascribe but it is in the debate that has occurred and it is in the ethical position implicit in that. I would suggest most strongly that Senator Patterson have another look at the report if she thinks that the debate here is not about human beings, because it is very clear in the report that most people viewed stem cells derived from embryos as relating to human beings. To try and make a distinction in that area is quite wrong. It is wrong in the cross-perspective or cross-conscience sense, as was fairly clear in Senator Knowles's report.
Let us look at the vote that occurred in relation to a stem cell bank. I cannot recall the precise numbers but I think around eight to 12 senators supported Senator Patterson on the perspective that we should do nothing. The point is that a very significant majority of senators think that something should be done to regulate commercial interests with respect to human life, and that is what stem cells derived from embryos are regarded as. They do not all join me in my position, which is that the respect given to embryos should be equivalent to that given to a full adult—to take the full extent comparison— but the clear perspective of the Senate is that we should do something to restrict the way in which commercial interests operate with stem cells from human embryos. I do not know where Senator Patterson's advice is coming from when she says that we are not dealing with human beings. It is the clear view of the Senate that we are, and I can only reiterate that the important issue here is that we should not let the horse bolt before we have a strict regulatory regime with respect to the commercial interests in this area. 
We only need to analyse what has happened to date. In one of my earlier speeches—I think it was in my speech on the second reading—I reminded the Senate that, from our experience in Victoria, the likes of Dr Trounson have form. He has disregarded the regulatory regime in Victoria in what he has been prepared to do. That does not encourage us to allow for a later day in relation to commercial interests now. It is no encouragement at all. In fact, even though people, sifting through the facts in many areas, might argue that inappropriate allegations have been made in relation to some of the scientists who are active, I do not think that anyone would cast that assertion in my direction. I have been very careful about matters that I raise or claims that I make. I think that it is fairly clear, though, that Dr Trounson has been prepared to be loose with the truth. There are certainly many allegations about people loose about their financial interests, and the commercial interests in this area need tight regulation. I have yet to hear any alternative to the views that have been canvassed by me and Senator Murphy that would prevent the horse from bolting. I cannot accept the perspectives put by Senator Patterson just now. They reflect the vote that we have already had in this chamber, where the government was able to hold, I think, somewhere between eight and 12 votes.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-12-03,"—I would like to ask the minister a further question. Before I do, in the response that the minister gave me to my last question about how she would block patentability or a patent claim, the minister referred to a section of the Patents Act—I think it was section 18.
—It was section 18(2).
—Can I say two things about that response. There is a significant difference between the reference to adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells. We know what the clear difference is between extracting stem cells from an adult versus extracting them from an embryo: in the latter, you kill the embryo. I suppose that is why I have drawn a focus in the amendment that I have proposed. But, in terms of the question that I put before, from a public health interest point of view with regard to therapies or surgical methods that have arisen that you would not want a patent to be granted over, how would you stop that, Minister? I would suggest to you that section 18 of the Patents Act does not provide you with that capacity. It simply does not do that. So I will ask you the question again in that context and in the context of the research in this technology that might deliver some very substantial therapeutic or surgical treatments: in the public health interest and in the affordability health interest of this country, if the patent claim were made, how would you stop that patent being granted?",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"— This will be my last contribution on this amendment because I feel that we have discussed this for long enough. We have a licensing committee which will be involved. We will have much clearer disclosure about the sort of research that is being undertaken. I think, Senator Murphy, that there are sufficient safeguards. I have a very strong interest in biological research and in the need to make it transparent and clear within a certain framework, in the sense of people not being able to be gazumped by another research group—and that is always one of the difficulties—but I believe that there are sufficient safeguards. I do not think that I will be able to contribute much more to this debate. I have indicated a number of reasons why I will not be supporting the amendment, and I think that it would be appropriate if the question on the amendment were to be put. We need to move on because we are going to be here for another three weeks if we continue in this vein. I have no more to add. I will not be supporting the amendment. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-12-03,"—I know that this is a difficult task. We are dealing with fairly difficult legislation. But, at the end of the day, there are important issues here and they have to be debated. It might help expedite this process if we were able to get some answers. I accept that the minister might believe that there are sufficient processes and protection measures in place, but I would appreciate it if I could be informed of them so that I could consider them in my somewhat probably naive way. Nevertheless, I will do my best. I take account of what the NHMRC says. It recognises that further consideration needs to be given to intellectual property issues in health and medical research involving Indigenous people and communities and where research has the potential to benefit public health in an international context. Look at what the federal government itself has said:
... that, consistent with safeguarding human health and ensuring environmental protection, Australia captures the benefits of biotechnology for the Australian community, industry and the environment.
All I am asking is a question about how we guarantee the public interest factors here, particularly to affordable therapeutic and surgical methods that might arise from this type of research. I do not think that that is an unreasonable question. The reason I ask the question is that right now I do not believe that those things exist, and your answers give me no comfort. You say, `Tough. This has been a long debate.' I am sorry about that, but realistically it ought to be a process where answers are given. If the answers are there and I have not seen them or cannot find them then I would appreciate that they be given to me. Then I will take account of those answers and will not ask more questions. Your advisers might have that information. It would be useful if they could give it to me or to the Senate so that we can be aware of it.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—I would like to respond—and I know that people may be getting a little indignant in this debate. In 1989 a family law bill took four days to pass through the Senate. Senator Durack was taking it through on behalf of the opposition and Senator Tate was taking it through on behalf of the government. This is a bit of a history lesson for people who have not been here as long as I have. It took a very long time for that bill to go through and, as a result, in a spirit of cooperation we set up the Senate committee system which then transmogrified into Senate legislation committees. They were joint committees in the beginning, I think, and then they split—somebody is frowning. I cannot remember the exact details, but we ended up with Senate legislation committees.
The purpose of those committees was that people who had a keen interest in a bill could go to the hearings, put questions on notice to the various groups and encourage other groups to come. The Senate used to sit on a Friday, and we changed so that we could have these committees. Then they grew and people travelled around the countryside. But the purpose of them was to have in-depth debates where technical questions could be asked of ministers with time for officers to get detailed answers. I have just checked with the chairman of that committee, and there are some senators here who have asked an inordinate number of questions who did not put questions on notice for that committee and who did not appear at committee hearings. They now come into this chamber and prolong the debate. 
I want to put it on the public record that we had five committee hearings and there are some senators who are getting indignant now who failed to take the opportunity, which those committees were set up for, to go through issues in detail and to get considered responses. We did not necessarily have all the officers available, but questions could have been put on notice at the committee hearings and could have been answered. That is the proper way to approach a bill—to participate in the whole process, not the end stage of it. I just remind senators who are prolonging this debate that there was an opportunity to have these very detailed technical questions answered then. I have made my comments. They may not satisfy Senator Murphy, but I will be voting against his amendment. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-12-03,"—In response to questions put forward by Senator Murphy, I think from a process perspective we are going to have a broader debate by virtue of the fact that there is at least one amendment put forward by Senator Murphy in relation to the Patents Act. I understand from Senator Collins that she is contemplating amendments as well in relation to patents, and there may be others in the chamber. I think that debate is going to happen, so let us have that debate later. I think we can facilitate this debate now. I am not suggesting that the issue of patents and common good and patentability is not related to this amendment, but I do think the specifics of legislative changes to the patents law are to be dealt with later on.
When the minister popped up and mentioned 1989, I was going to say that was the answer we were looking for. In 1989 there was a Patents Amendment Bill and my predecessor Senator John Coulter, who before me was the science spokesperson for the Democrats, said that the Democrats did not object to the patents bill in principle but there was one area that was not covered— and that was in relation to biological materials.
—This is a speech bringing us back to the debate, is it?
—That is a good point, Senator Evans. But in answer to Senator Murphy's question, my understanding is that in relation to the patents law there are not specific provisions that deal with the issues that you raised and that the issue in relation to genes, gene sequences, a genome or either one that has had genetic material added or deleted, an altered organism—basically human biological materials—can be patented. I think you know that. And while I appreciate what you were doing, I think that if we get that on record we can move on. We are going to have this debate, I can tell, at some scary hour tonight.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I indicate on behalf of the Labor opposition that we oppose Senator Nettle's amendment. As I said previously, Labor senators have a conscience vote on this issue, but I think it is important, as Senator Stott Despoja just tried to do, to bring us back to the debate. I think it has been a fairly wide-ranging debate. 
The amendment moved by Senator Nettle effectively seeks to ensure that no licences will be issued until a stem cell bank is established. This amendment will effectively delay this legislation at least a year—I think more likely two or three. That is the impact of her amendment, if carried. So senators, when voting on this amendment, have to be very clear about that. This amendment, if carried, will effectively scuttle this legislation and the implementation of this legislation, because no licences will be issued until the stem cell bank has been established. 
The stem cell bank is an idea that was floated in the committee report by a couple of the participating senators and it has received some widespread interest in the Senate. There is support for investigating the possible operation of a stem cell bank. But there are a range of outstanding issues that we have not dealt with that are not widely understood among senators that would impact on whether or not at the end of the day we supported that proposition.
The Greens, quite rightly, have tried to push that suggestion further. Fine, that is their decision. But senators should not be in any doubt about this amendment: if carried, it will effectively scuttle the legislation and scuttle the COAG process. It says that there will be no licences issued until a stem cell bank is established. This germ of an idea will have to be investigated, reported upon, established and brought into force before any licence is issued. If we pass this bill with this amendment, then all research will end after six months in the absence of a licence. Because of the provisions for offences under this bill, people conducting research six months after assent will have to have a licence or what they do will be illegal. We will have an amendment carried that effectively says that no licences will be granted for a minimum of 12 months—under the later amendment—or realistically for two to three years, and we will have a situation where any activity in relation to research will be illegal after six months. 
Effectively, you will end research in this country arising from this bill. All ART related research will be effectively ended and none of those activities that are currently allowed and envisaged under this bill will be able to continue. That is the effect of the amendment. The idea of investigating the stem cell bank is interesting and it is one that I am attracted to. I am one of those 60-odd that Senator Collins spoke of who voted for investigating the idea in the previous debate. The effect of the Green amendment is to scuttle the bill and rule out any research. It effectively means that implementation of the bill and the COAG agreement is totally undermined. That is the real impact. I am not sure whether that was the intention but that is the impact. That is why I will be voting against it. That is why the official Labor view is to vote against it. I would urge senators to vote against it because, without putting too fine a point on it, some of the support for this amendment comes from an understanding of the impact of the amendment on the bill.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-12-03,"—Some of Senator Evans's comments need some response. The aspersion that this has been put forward by the Greens to scuttle the bill is—
—I did not say that.
—That is the effect of it, and some of the support might be related to that. I do not believe it is a reasonable characterisation of the situation. The argument that has been put forward is that this was something that was just flagged in the report by some participating senators. I would like to take the Senate back to what actually occurred. Stem Cell Sciences' submission to the Senate inquiry and then the appearance by Mr Ilyine were used by the committee—and principally by myself, I should say, Senator Evans—to flesh out this issue of the role of a stem cell bank. It was following through the theme that I had explored in other areas about how, if it is the intention of COAG that we restrict the number of embryos that might be available for these purposes, that could be achieved.
One area where that has been discussed in this debate is the suggestion that we should reinsert into clause 21 the words used by COAG and the words used in the current guidelines that have been in place since 1996. I think that some fruitful discussions have occurred and we may well be able to resolve that aspect. But the other element of how we achieve the intention of COAG, which was that we have a strict regulatory regime that will restrict the number of embryos that are utilised in this endeavour, was, in the discussion with Mr Ilyine, related to using a stem cell bank or restrictions on intellectual property to remove the commercial interests as a means of using more embryos than might be required for the humanitarian interests that many parties have canvassed in this area.
I am sorry, Senator Evans, I do not mean to imply that I took this as a personal insult, but I think that it is important that I use this opportunity to clarify very clearly what my intentions are with this amendment, given that that broad characterisation was made. My intention here is to implement the objective of the COAG agreement, which is that we have a strict regulatory regime. The point of that is that in Europe, where it happens, they have restrictions on patents. In the UK, where it happens, they have a stem cell bank. In Australia, what are we going to say—that we will think about it? That is not a strict regulatory regime. It is nowhere near a strict regulatory regime. I do not agree that it can take two to three years to establish an appropriate means of regulating the commercial interests involved in this endeavour. Anyone who argues that it could take two or three years—
—They do not report back until July next year and we do not sit until August. When is it all going to happen?
—Senator Evans, it is within our scope to deal with those issues. If we believe that the review time frame is inappropriate in relation to establishing a strict regulatory regime, and starting a system as a strict regulatory regime, that is within our hands. COAG did not specify the full detail of exactly what time frame should be utilised to establish this. These are all things within our scope. I know that the NHMRC has a particular perspective here but it is not the only relevant perspective. With respect, as we have already dealt with in relation to the advice that we have received on other issues from the Australian Health Ethics Committee, the relevant ethics committee does at times have views contrary to those of the NHMRC. If the advice that has been given is that to establish an appropriate way of regulating commercial interests could take two to three years, I have very strong concerns with the quality of that advice.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"— There are a large number of amendments and senators are proposing new amendments. To do that, I think we should follow the procedure; senators cannot just wander in here hoping that we can deal with a new amendment. I told Senator Boswell that if he had an amendment he should take it to the Deputy Clerk and have it put on the running sheet. If it comes up now, that is fine. But I do not think there should be any special reason why a new amendment should come in in any other way than in the natural order of what is occuring in the chamber. I think that it would be unfair if that were to occur. If other people came to me, I would say to them, `No, I think we should just deal with it in the normal order in which additional amendments are dealt with.' If that comes up now, that is fine. If it were on the running sheet to come up now, then leave would not be required. But we do require leave for it to come up now because it is not on the running sheet. The discussion I had with Senator Boswell was that it was not a recommittal; the last discussion I had was that it was a new amendment.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I do not know what arrangements Senator Boswell has with the minister and that is a matter for them. But this is a chamber that is concerned with more than just Senator Boswell and the minister. Quite frankly, if Senator Boswell is seeking recommittal of an amendment that was lost yesterday, given the progress we are making on this bill, I am disinclined to support that. Firstly, I would expect other groups around the chamber to be consulted before we recommit. Secondly, I would have thought at the very least that we ought to deal with the amendments we have not reached yet before people have a second go. In any event, I think some wider consultation in the chamber is required before these things suddenly get dropped on us. 
It has appeared on the running sheet. I am told it is a recommittal—Senator Boswell seems a little unclear on that. But if it is a recommittal then I think he should have spoken more broadly to people around the chamber. Given the very slow progress that we are making—we have dealt with one amendment so far today in 1¾ hours—he is going to have to have a good story to convince me why we ought to go back and debate ones we knocked off yesterday. If we start doing that, I will be a very old man before we finish this debate. 
I suggest to Senator Boswell that he speak to a few parties during the dinner break and make it clear what he is doing. When he does next get to his feet to try and advance this issue, at least we will all understand exactly what he is doing rather than spending 20 minutes in confusion working out exactly what we are dealing with.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—By way of clarification, Senator Evans said he did not know what sort of deal was done. I said to Senator Boswell—as I would say to any other senator who comes to me and says they have another amendment—`If you have another amendment or a new amendment, you should go to the Deputy Clerk and have it put on the running sheet.' That is exactly what I said to Senator Boswell. No arrangements were made. I feel exactly the same way as Senator Evans does; we have been here a very long while. His and my patience are being tested sorely. I think it is appropriate that we have a long debate on this bill. I think we should have an arrangement. I did actually say to Senator Boswell, `You need to talk to other people.' So Senator Evans needs to know that I said to Senator Boswell exactly what I would have said to anybody else who came to me: there is a process, go and follow the process.
— Senator Boswell, amendment (1) on sheet 2702 has been lost because leave was not granted.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-12-03,"—I accept that, but I do think that I should state my position as I put it to the minister. I said to the minister that I wanted to recommit an amendment. She was not inclined to do so. I said, `If you do not do it, I will just circulate another amendment.' I understood that she said by way of response: `If you are going to do that, just go ahead and put up your original amendment. If you are going to do that, let us do it the best way.' Senator Patterson then told me to go and put it on the running sheet. I went and did exactly what she said, which was to put it on the running sheet.
It has come out on the running sheet now. Senator Patterson has refused leave with respect to what I understood she had already clearly given me leave to do. It is true that I did not talk to other people, including the Labor Party spokesman—and I plead guilty to that. But I was under the impression that if the minister gave me leave that would be acceptable. The minister now says that she did not. I have now circulated another amendment which I suppose will take up more time. But if that is the way the minister wants to do it, that is fair enough: we will go through the procedure. It could have been dealt with in about 30 seconds. To accommodate the minister, in an absolute act of goodwill and good faith on my part, I did give her some information that she wanted. She took that information and now that she has declined to give me the opportunity to present that amendment, I circulate another amendment and it will come up at some later time. 
—It will come up at a later stage, Senator Boswell. We now move to Senator Harradine's amendment (4) on sheet 2696. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—I think this committee stage would be assisted if the spokespersons from the government, the minister and Senator Evans, were a little prepared to listen to the argument. For example, it has been said that there may be other ways to deal with the matter— for example, as with the conscientious objection matter. As I pointed out last night, we are given a conscience vote on this bill, but the bill approves of a program which will violate the consciences of a number of other people—not only researchers but also students and others. That is a real problem. I proposed a conscience vote to protect those persons with conscientious objections, as there are moral and psychological distresses involved, and yet that was voted down— closely, by six votes, but nevertheless it was voted down. That was partly due to what the minister said—presumably speaking on behalf of the government—and what Senator Evans said from his notes. The minister was saying that they agree, but that there are some other ways. My question was: what ways? The guidelines of the NHMRC were trotted out. Those guidelines are totally unenforceable, apart from when an organisation or institution is receiving government money. It is a disgrace for that to have occurred. Senator Stott Despoja opposed the motion to protect the consciences of persons affected by this legislation. No suggestion has been made as to how those workers or others, including students, will be protected. You have asked me to move the proposal in clause 20. Isn't it a fact that on sheet 2713 revised there is an amendment to be moved by Senator Nettle?
— That has been moved and dispensed with. We are now considering your amendment, Senator Harradine.
—I thought that (R1) on sheet 2713 amended 19A. Were (R1) and (R2) taken together?
—No, Senator Harradine. (R1) was taken singularly and that has been disposed of. We are now considering your amendment to clause 20, which is amendment (4) on sheet 2696.
—As usual, you are correct.
— Thank you, Senator Harradine. You are very kind. I wish every senator showed me that same cooperation.
—I hope this does not take long. If the minister might explain—
— Senator Harradine, perhaps you could cooperate just a little bit more and formally move that amendment.
—I move amendment (4) on sheet 2696:
(4)	Clause 20, page 15 (line 7), omit “(if any)”.
By omitting the words `if any' the clause reads: `An application under subsection (1) must be made in accordance with the requirements specified.' That ensures that the NHMRC must specify the requirements for a licence application. If the Committee of the Whole does not mind, I might hurry things up. I see that Senator Campbell is here—he will be pleased with that. I seek leave to move amendment (5) as well.
Leave granted.
—I move amendment (5) on sheet 2696:
(5)	Clause 21, page 16 (after line 2), after paragraph (c), insert:
	(d)	that the applicant has the expertise and capacity to carry out the functions authorised under the licence. 
These amendments deal with licence conditions. In effect, I ask that the NHMRC should specify the conditions that must govern an application for a licence. I ask the minister whether that is already catered for. If it is, I would be happy to withdraw that amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"— With regard to Senator Harradine's amendment (4) on sheet 2696, clause 20(2)(a) of the bill provides that an application made to the NHMRC Licensing Committee:
(a) must be made in accordance with the requirements (if any) specified in writing by the NHMRC Licensing Committee ...
The intent of the clause is to enable the NHMRC Licensing Committee to issue application forms or other information about the way that it expects applications to be presented to the committee and examples of the types of information that the applications are expected to include. The words `if any' were included as a drafting safeguard so that if the NHMRC Licensing Committee did not issue guidance initially then applications could still be made to the NHMRC Licensing Committee.
It is important to note that this would not affect the detail of the information that is provided to the NHMRC Licensing Committee or the matters that must be taken into account by the NHMRC Licensing Committee in making a decision. The NHMRC Licensing Committee must still be satisfied of all the matters detailed in the legislation, and it is still up to the applicant to satisfy the committee of such matters. If at any stage the licensing committee consider that they do not have enough information before them in order to make a proper decision, they can go back to the applicant and request additional information.
This is in no way affected by the drafting of clause 22. For that reason, I do not consider that Senator Harradine's amendment is necessary and I will not support it. With regard to his amendment (5) on sheet 2696, this amendment adds an additional factor that the NHMRC Licensing Committee must consider and be satisfied of before issuing a licence. The additional factor is:
(d) that the applicant has the expertise and capacity to carry out the functions authorised under the licence.
I will be opposing the amendment since this is already covered by the legislation through the matters that the NHMRC Licensing Committee is required to take into account when considering an application. For this reason, I do not consider the amendment to be necessary. Firstly, or first—whichever is more correct as far as Fowler is concerned, and just as a sideline, if anybody wants a bit of light entertainment, they should read the entry entitled `Formal enumerations' in Fowler—
—You're doing very well. Just keep going, Minister.
—Before an application can be made to the NHMRC Licensing Committee, it must first be evaluated and approved by an institutional human research ethics committee that is constituted and operating in accordance with the NHMRC National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Research Involving Humans. The ability, expertise and experience of the applicant to carry out the intended project are the key considerations of the human research ethics committee, as required by the national statement. The national statement says:
Research must be conducted or supervised only by persons or teams with experience, qualifications and competence appropriate to the research. Research must only be conducted using facilities appropriate for the research and where there are appropriate skills and resources for dealing with any contingencies that may affect participants.
Secondly, if an application is approved by an appropriately constituted human research ethics committee, the applicant is required to submit the human research ethics committee's evaluation proposal and the NHMRC Licensing Committee is required to include this evaluation in its own considerations. Thirdly, clause 21(4)(b) states:
... the NHMRC Licensing Committee must have regard to
...	...	...
(b)	the likelihood of significant advance in knowledge, or improvement in technologies for treatment, as a result of the use of excess ART embryos proposed in the application, which could not reasonably be achieved by other means ... 
I think that is very important. The skills and expertise of the applicant are critical in determining whether there is likely to be a significant advance in knowledge or an improvement in technology as a result of the proposed use of the excess ART embryo.
Fourthly, the NHMRC Licensing Committee must be satisfied that the protocols are in place to enable proper consent to be obtained before an excess ART embryo is used, and any restrictions on consent are to be complied with. I have just paused—I always look for and see grammatical errors in my notes. I would not actually end a sentence with the word `with', but that is beside the point. A key part of this provision is ensuring that the applicant and the organisation have the capacity and competence to ensure that the requirements are met. It is for these reasons I will not be supporting Senator Harradine's amendments (4) or (5). Senator Harradine, I hope that that has given you sufficient information so that you may be of a mind to withdraw the amendments.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—The Minister for Health and Ageing referred to a human research ethics committee evaluation. Is that evaluation available for public inspection? In other words, is it available to the public to see what the evaluation of the human research ethics committee is?",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"— Senator Harradine, I think I actually answered that question. If an application is approved by an appropriately constituted human research ethics committee, the applicant is required to submit that committee's evaluation of the proposal and the NHMRC Licensing Committee is required to include this evaluation in its own considerations. I will seek advice on whether that information then gets to the public.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—That may be able to be dealt with under another provision. Therefore I seek leave to withdraw the amendments—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Are you referring to amendments (4) and (5)?
—Yes, amendments (4) and (5). Before leave is granted, perhaps the minister could answer that.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"— The answer is that the licensing committee receives that information, but it is not necessarily available to the public. I will try to give you an example. If you go to a university and the ethics committee looks at a proposal, that is one process and that then goes to the licensing committee. I am advised that the actual ethics committee advice is not, under the legislation, necessarily publicly available.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—I thank the minister for her comments. I was going to withdraw amendments (4) and (5) and I think I still might withdraw them. But I think that, in the matter that we are talking about, transparency is needed when it comes to the human research ethics committee.
Sitting suspended from 6.31 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—Before the dinner break the minister, Senator Patterson, responded to my question, which was: is the ethical evaluation which was conducted by the human research ethics committee public? I am not sure what the response was; I will leave it to the minister to remind me whether or not that is the situation. If that is the situation, that raises a very serious question indeed as to transparency as part of the COAG agreement. This may not be the place to deal with this matter, because the amendments that I have moved deal with an additional requirement that the applicant have the expertise and capacity to carry out the functions authorised under the licence. The minister's response to me satisfied that particular matter. The minister's response satisfied me in regard to amendment (4). That is why I will seek leave to withdraw the amendments.
But I need to raise the question again, so that I am clear on it, of whether or not the decisions of the human research ethics committee are available to the public and whether the evaluation by the human research ethics committee is available to the public. The reason I am saying this is that so much has been made of the fact that licences will not be given unless approval for the program has been given by the human research ethics committee. Bear in mind that members of that human research ethics committee, previously called the institutional ethics committee, are appointees of the applicants. That is, they are appointed by the institution that is going to make the application.  
There are certain persons who are required to be appointed to the human research ethics committee, as laid down by the NHMRC. But the fact of the matter is that they are appointed by the institution, and it is just not appropriate for their evaluation, upon which everything hangs, not to be transparent or for it to be kept secret when we are talking about other matters. If the evaluation of the committee is to be kept secret then I think that requires a further amendment; it is not covered by this particular amendment. I ask the minister for an answer—yes or no. This is just a factual question: are those evaluations available to the public? Obviously they will be transmitted to the licensing committee, but are they available to the public?
 (Senator Bolkus)—Senator Harradine, before I call the minister, are you seeking leave to withdraw amendments (4) and (5)?
—I have already moved the amendments and I seek leave to withdraw them.
Leave granted.
—I indicate that I am not pursuing my amendment (6), so we are making progress.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—I tried to answer Senator Harradine before dinner, but my answer was a bit compressed. Under the bill, as I mentioned before, the Human Research Ethics Committee evaluation will be one of the things considered by the NHMRC. While the evaluation will not be public, the NHMRC committee's decision will be and it will be on the public database. I know that will not satisfy Senator Harradine's concerns, but I appreciate that he has withdrawn amendments (4), (5) and (6) and I hope we can now move on.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-03,"—by leave—I move, on behalf of Senator Nettle, amendment (3) on sheet 2705:
(3)	Clause 20, page 15 (line 11), at the end of subclause (2), add:
	; and (c)	if made by an applicant who receives Federal, State or Territory government funding—must include information on all commercial interests related to the activities for which the licence is sought, or related activities.
This is an amendment to require the disclosure of commercial interests in division 4 of the bill, the licensing system. Clause 20(2) now reads, in part:
(2) An application under subsection (1)—
that is, for a licence authorising the use of excess embryos—
... who receives Federal, State or Territory government funding—must include information on all commercial interests related to the activities for which the licence is sought, or related activities.
The amendment does just what it says. It requires people who are in receipt of public funding to disclose any commercial interests they have in related ventures. The amendment by Senator Nettle is designed to ensure disclosure of any potential conflict between the roles that an applicant may have as part of a public institution engaged in research and as a shareholder or office holder in a private company, for example, negotiating for public funding. 
During the course of the public debate and the Senate inquiry into the bill the question of potential conflict of interest became an issue because of the different roles that some people have been playing in the private and public sectors. Questions were raised about relationships and their influence on grant application outcomes. We are not suggesting that researchers operating with the support of public funding who have a commercial interest in other companies—that is, in companies outside the public arena—should be prevented from applying for a licence, but this amendment gives import to our belief that any commercial interest should be disclosed. 
The amendment is particularly necessary given the trend of public researchers in the stem cell field to become involved as directors of private or joint venture spin-off ventures. Perhaps the most notable contemporary case is that of the National Stem Cell Centre, which received a federal government grant of $43.5 million. As we all know, that is a big sum to come from the public purse. This amendment is also important because the bill excludes the disclosure of information on the grounds of its being commercial-in-confidence, although Senator Nettle notes that Senator Harradine has an amendment to remove that clause. The agreement of the Council of Australian Governments—state and national governments—from which this bill evolved is very clear about the importance of transparency and public accountability. Here we have an amendment which aims to fulfil the desire that in these matters public accountability should be to the fore.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—This amendment, which has been moved by Senator Brown on behalf of Senator Nettle, is dead in line with what COAG obviously wanted in terms of a requirement for transparency. If we cannot have transparency in institutions which receive federal, state or territory government funding, what institutions can we get that information from? Surely we are entitled to that. We need to know the commercial interests of those persons who make the applications. I cannot see why the minister would not accept this if the name of the game were to implement the intentions of COAG as outlined in the COAG agreement and the appendices thereto.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-12-03,"—I would like to ask the minister a question with regard to what Senator Nettle's amendment proposes. I asked a question of Senator Minchin, representing the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, about the National Stem Cell Centre. The answer with respect to the National Stem Cell Centre and the issue of conflict of interest states:
The Centre must warrant that at the signing of the Deed, no conflict or risk of conflict of interest is likely to arise in the performance of its obligations.
The Centre must disclose in writing prior to the signing of the deed if any conflict of interest exists.
Thereafter, the Centre must notify the Commonwealth if any conflict of interest arises during the term of the contract. 
The Commonwealth is entitled to ask the Centre to resolve any such conflict of interest. 
If the Centre does not notify the Commonwealth on any conflict of interest or it fails to resolve the conflict of interest, as required by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth may terminate the Deed.
That itself poses a lot of questions. If you terminated the deed, what would happen to things like intellectual property et cetera? Who would they belong to? Does anything in the bill actually deal with the issue of conflict of interest?",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—I will not be supporting Senator Nettle's amendment. The licensing committee will be responsible for assessing applications and establishing that there has been proper consent and consideration by the Human Research Ethics Committee, and establishing the other criteria—for example, that there is likely to be a significant advance in knowledge et cetera. The licensing committee will not be reviewing the funding arrangements of universities and other researchers. There are other avenues by which senators can gain access to information on government expenditure and where it goes, and I do not think it is appropriate to do that through the licensing committee. Under the licensing scheme, all applicants will be subject to the same requirements for disclosure of information, which will be included in the public database maintained by the NHMRC.  
The comment has been made that this does not fit with the COAG agreement. I remind honourable senators that the legislation that has come before the House of Representatives and the Senate was sent to the states for comment. I am sure that if they had felt it was significantly out of line with the COAG agreement we would have been advised and would have changed the legislation to ensure that we had uniform legislation across the country. I think it is a bit rich to come in here and to say over and over that this does not fit with the COAG agreement. It is an argument that has been used fairly frequently in this debate. COAG made a decision, COAG set out the communique and then the states were sent the legislation. I presume that if they had had violent disagreement with the legislation they would have advised us. I am not of a mind to support the amendment, and I am not sure that we can progress it much further than that. I again suggest that we put the amendment to the vote.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-03,"—I would agree with that. I think, though, that if we had a little bit of extra time and this amendment went out to the states they too would be in agreement with it. It is an excellent amendment and it actually is totally in spirit with the COAG agreement, underlining the importance of transparency and public accountability. I think COAG would give a big tick to this amendment, and I think we should too.
Question negatived. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-03,"—My amendment (7) seeks to put in at clause 20 an additional subclause, subclause (3), which basically strengthens, in my view, the requirements on the application under subclause (1)—that is, an application where a person is applying to the NHMRC Licensing Committee for a licence authorising the use of excess embryos. I think the addition of subparagraphs (a) and (b) in subclause (3) strengthen the onus upon the applicant to take into consideration when they are putting their application together that, as my subparagraph (a) implies, there should be a `likelihood of significant advance in knowledge, or improvement in technologies for treatment, as a result of the use of excess ART embryos proposed in the application'. 
In subparagraph (b), I say that the person must demonstrate `that the significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technologies could not reasonably be achieved by other means'. There is nothing extraordinary in those words, because those words are lifted straight out of the actual COAG agreement. I believe that, whilst people may allude to those words appearing elsewhere, this ties those words in directly with the person who is making the application themselves, and it is another condition that they must meet in the application.
In clause 21, which covers the determination of the application by the committee, there are certain criteria that need to be taken into consideration. Significantly, my subclause (b) does not appear there, but it is not necessarily appropriate to amend clause 21. The effect of that clause is to place the onus on the committee in terms of the determination of the application, whereas my amendments purely and simply refer to conditions that must apply to the applicant themselves. For the sake of the record, I quote from appendix 1 to the COAG agreement, which states:
A licence would only be issued where that project has the approval of an ethics committee established, composed and conducted in accordance with NHMRC guidelines, and that the approval is given on a case by case basis that:
·	there is a likelihood of significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technologies for treatment as a result of the proposed procedure;
·	the significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technologies could not reasonably be achieved by other means ...
There are other dot points there, but I chose not to include them because they are not necessarily appropriate to the applicant as opposed to the application. I am seeking to put a rigorous condition on the applicant, the person making the application, to ensure that, in accordance with the provisions of the COAG agreement, they are not making a frivolous claim. I think that would be sorted out under (b) anyway, but it would be clear to applicants up front that there are stringent conditions to be met in putting forward applications to the NHMRC Licensing Committee for their consideration. I commend to the Senate amendment (7) on sheet 2720 revised, which I now move: 
(7)	Clause 20, page 15 (after line 11), at the end of the clause, add:
	(3)	For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), it is a requirement that a person must demonstrate:
	(a)	the likelihood of significant advance in knowledge, or improvement in technologies for treatment, as a result of the use of excess ART embryos proposed in the application; and
	(b)	that the significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technologies could not reasonably be achieved by other means.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—This is again indicative of how some of us are trying to actually put into effect the COAG agreement. This is word for word what is in the COAG agreement. The minister says the draft legislation has gone to the states. I do not really want to say in this public arena that there have been mistakes made by the National Health and Medical Research Council in letters to the state ministers. That matter was corrected. These sorts of things happen, despite people attempting to do their job with the best will in the world, and I make no reflection upon the persons involved. It is really not appropriate for the minister to come in here and say that it has gone to the state governments. We know what has happened with that: it has been done over by the bureaucracies, and I would guarantee that few premiers have taken a word-for-word interest in the drafts. I think it is important for us to do what Senator Hogg is suggesting. It is obvious that the licensing committee must have regard to X, Y and Z, but it is for an applicant to include in the application those tests which COAG considers are important and vital. I support the amendment in the name of Senator Hogg.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—I indicate that I will not be supporting Senator Hogg's amendment to clause 20. The amendment requires applicants to demonstrate the likelihood of a significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technologies as a result of the use of the excess ART embryos proposed in the application and that such an advance could not reasonably be achieved by other means. It might be worth while clarifying the intent of existing clause 20(2)(a), which states:
(2) An application under subsection (1):
(a) must be made in accordance with the requirements (if any) specified in writing by the NHMRC Licensing Committee ...
The purpose of clause 20(2)(a) is to enable the licensing committee to document any administrative or procedural requirements for applications. Where the clause states an application must be made in accordance with requirements `specified in writing' by the committee, this is intended to enable the licensing committee to specify in writing that, for example, they wish all applications to be made on a certain application form et cetera. It is not intended that this clause simply repeat all of the matters on which the National Health and Medical Research Council Licensing Committee must be satisfied.
There is a range of matters that applicants are required to demonstrate to the NHMRC Licensing Committee in order to obtain a licence. For example—and we have been over this before—applicants must satisfy the licensing committee that appropriate protocols are in place to enable proper consent to be obtained; that there are protocols in place to establish that the embryo was created before 5 April, in the case of a use of the embryo that may damage or destroy the embryo; and that the project has been assessed and approved by the properly constituted human research ethics committee. In other words, there is a range of matters that applicants must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the licensing committee in addition to whether the project is likely to lead to significant advances and whether the outcome could not reasonably be achieved by other means. Therefore, I do not consider that it is appropriate to draw out only two requirements and put them in the provision relating to a person applying for a licence. That may suggest that another of these requirements— for example, the one demonstrating that there is proper consent—is a lesser requirement, which it is certainly not. For the reasons I have detailed in my explanation, I do not propose to support Senator Hogg's amendment to clause 20. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I am not going to take up a great deal of time on this, but I believe that it certainly does not make any other requirement a lesser requirement. The reason for the inclusion of those two specific parts applying to the applicant is that they really lead to the quintessential reason why one would be making an application. If one is not going to see the likelihood of a significant advance in knowledge and an improvement in technologies for treatments, or if the significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technologies could be reasonably achieved by other means, the application is really a wasteful one indeed. So, whilst I hear and understand what the minister says, I do not believe the inclusion of those additional qualifications is limiting in any way.
As I said—and I pointed this out to the committee—the qualifications were directly lifted out of appendix 1 of the COAG agreement. The amendment is seeking not to selectively quote from the COAG agreement but to put stringent and tight requirements into the legislation to ensure that applicants clearly understand that, if an application is to be made to the NHMRC Licensing Committee, the person making the application must be able to demonstrate that the matters envisaged in amendment (7) are of importance in making that application. I recommend the amendment to the Senate.

I understand that the minister has written to the committee, which should be addressing that issue and reporting on it at some stage tomorrow. I will wait for the result of that advice before we take the Senate into the detail of these issues so that hopefully we will not be duplicating any discussion.

12B  Offence—use of human embryos or human embryonic stem cells in or in testing any pharmaceutical or cosmetic product
		A person commits an offence if the person intentionally uses:
	(a)	a human embryo (including an excess ART embryo); or
	(b)	human embryonic stem cells;
in, or in the testing, creation or manufacture of, any pharmaceutical or cosmetic product.
Maximum penalty:  Imprisonment for 5 years.
The amendment has been circulated, or I hope it has, with further details. If it has not been circulated, I can add—
— Senator Harradine, my understanding is that you are seeking leave to move amendments (3), (6) and (12) on sheet 2751 together. Would you like to seek leave now?
—I will have another look at what amendment (6) is. I will just move amendment (3). This is a question of pharmaceutical testing on embryos. This amendment will prohibit the use of human embryos or human embryonic stem cells in the testing, creation or manufacture of pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. It is not enough to prohibit the use of human embryos and these activities; it is also important to prohibit the use of embryonic stem cells in this work. A prohibition restricted to human embryos would encourage the destruction of human embryos for their stem cells so that these stem cells could be used for much the same work. I believe the public have been denied information about this matter. Very rarely, if at all, has the question arisen: what will happen to those human embryos? What will happen to those embryonic stem cells? Those who are in favour of this legislation—I am referring not necessarily to people here but to people outside this place—and the scientists concerned have not raised this question. One of the major areas will be the use of embryos, and embryonic stem cells in particular, for the testing of drugs. I believe the public would be appalled if they knew that. 
The broader range of destructive human embryo research received less attention than embryonic stem cell research, but this broader use of human embryos includes for examining the effectiveness of new culture media used in assisted reproductive technology, ART, practice; for assisting in understanding embryonic development and fertilisation; for training clinicians in microsurgical ART techniques; for transportation, observation and storage of embryos; for micromanipulation, lasering, cutting and dissecting; for studies in genetic make-up and expression; for quality assurance testing to ensure that pre-implantation diagnostic tests give accurate results; and for drug testing, including toxicology studies on human embryos, as well as for the destructive extraction of embryonic stem cells. Research involving pharmaceuticals and cosmetics is the most likely use of the human embryos and human embryonic stem cells, due to the potential financial returns.
An article in the Australian of 1 April this year reported that Dr Peter Mountford, Chief Executive of Stem Cell Sciences:
... has never produced a human embryo, but holds a patent on technology he believes will achieve this result by the end of 2002. He plans to commercialise the process within two years by supplying disease-carrying embryonic stem cells to pharmaceutical companies for drug screening. 
The Centre for Stem Cells and Tissue Repair, which received $46.5 million from the Commonwealth government early this year, states in its application:
A number of companies throughout the world have identified that ES cells in their differentiated or undifferentiated state can be used to develop screening assays to identify new chemical agents for their therapeutic capability or to screen new or existing agents for toxicity in their profile. 
Toxicology testing on animals is a costly but essential step in the development of new healthcare products and cosmetics. There is a global trend to move away from the use of live animals for these testing programs, however, there are not yet effective alternative tests developed and approved for use by the relevant regulatory authorities.
Later, that same organisation that the government is providing $46.5 million to, said:
Additionally a number of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies have in-house screening using certain types of cells to discover new drug candidates. This will provide the Centre with the opportunity to generate short-term revenue through the licensing of specific cell lines, and longer-term revenues through participation in Australian based drug discovery programs. 
For drug development companies, access to pure populations of differentiated adult stem cells and/or embryonic stem cells of different genetic backgrounds in quantity is keenly sought but currently unavailable.
This legislation will make it available.
The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources happens to agree that there is a potential in this area. In correspondence with me, he agreed: 
Human ES cell lines for drug screening ... could be a major advantage, and is well appreciated by many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide.
Minister Macfarlane then went on to say:
... in vitro drug candidate screening—
and the testing of— 
new drug candidates for toxicity and deficiency.
The industry minister also said:
Biotech company BresaGen is interested in distributing these embryonic stem cells to potential new drug developers.
We all thought it was about cures, didn't we?—about the use of embryonic stem cells to apply to sick people.
Senator Patterson has suggested in discussion that it is inappropriate to list unacceptable uses of embryos in legislation, because that might suggest that all other uses are acceptable. But there is nothing in my amendment that would give that impression, and my clarifying comments today make it more than clear that that is not the intention of this amendment. The minister has also suggested that we might also wish to consider restrictions on food allergy testing, air toxin testing and industrial chemical testing. I am more than happy to add these to my amendment.
It is appropriate that we as senators set some limits on the uses of human embryos, not hand over that responsibility to a committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. We are accountable to the people of Australia; the NHMRC is not. I have heard claims that the NHMRC Licensing Committee will be subject to public accountability and will act in accordance with so-called strict criteria. But, clearly, in this area there is limited accountability. Firstly, the criteria are not strict and the NHMRC is, apparently, in advice to the minister, objecting to the Senate having the temerity to consider making it just a little more accountable with these modest safeguards. Secondly, if there are any complaints about a decision made by the committee the minister will say that the decision was made by an independent body, that it was out of her hands and that the licensing committee is appointed, not elected. Both of them will probably point to the COAG communique as justification anyhow. COAG is not accountable to the people. We cannot see the papers they used to form their decisions, although we have requested those papers. The process is a closed and secretive one. There is no real public accountability. In a climate where we are moving away from the testing of drugs and cosmetics on live animals because of ethical concerns about this practice, it would be disturbing indeed if today we decided to substitute live human embryos as the preferred laboratory animal for drug and cosmetic testing.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-12-03,"—There are four amendments here—one in the name of Senator Harradine, two in the name of Senator Barnett and one in my name—and they are all very similar in design.
 (Senator Bolkus)—But they are not the same.
—No, they are not the same. I will speak in support of Senator Harradine's amendment. I listened very closely to what Senator Harradine said and he made the point that we were told that if we supported this legislation we would be able to cure people, that we would turn up with some wondrous cures. Those who had the patience to sit through the five or six sittings of the Senate committee heard the most prominent scientists say that there was a huge hurdle to jump, and that was that the stem cells would not be compatible to transfer and, therefore, there were two ways that you could get cures. One was to have a stem cell bank of something like 10 million Caucasians, 10 million Asians and 10 million of the various races, and that would be the only way that you could make stem cells compatible. We listened with great interest to that. What we did find out from our patient listening throughout the Senate inquiry was that there were people who were very interested in commercialising stem cells. Even in Alan Trounson's submission for the $46.5 million, he said:
The Centre will be developing pure populations of cells from its internal and external R&D activities and plans to be primarily a supplier to screening companies on a non-exclusive basis for drug screening of selected cell types on a fee for service or a licence basis.
I am sure that the Australian population does not want to underwrite the profits of pharmaceutical companies out there that want to test drugs. Yes, there are a great number of people that would back the stem cell bill because they believe it will give cures. I would say that the majority of scientists, the ones who are prepared to stick their heads up over the parapet, say that it cannot be done. We now have the export of stem cells, the commercialisation of stem cells and drug testing. That is what we are left with. 
I am sure that if people were asked they would say, `Hang on a moment. This isn't what we thought this bill was all about. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, didn't tell us this. He promised us that people would get up and walk from their wheelchairs and he promised us cures.' Now what are we left with? We are left with the commercialisation of stem cells where pharmaceutical companies will breed stem cells up to test them on various pharmaceutical products. I am sure that this is not what the people wanted and I am sure that it is very far from what is required by the population. These four amendments, whether they be from Senators Harradine, Barnett or Boswell, are in effect restricting the use of stem cells in drug testing, and I think the Greens may have an amendment in there somewhere too.
All I can say is that it is not what people were promised. I am sure that if we went out there and ran a poll asking, `Would you support this legislation if it could guarantee cures or even give us a reasonable chance of cures?' There would be a lot of people— some would not—who would say yes. But if you ran the same poll and said, `Do you want to support stem cells being used for drug testing? Would you back the pharmaceutical companies or stem cell centres, to which the government has given $49 million, to breed up stem cells so drugs can be tested?' I think that you would get a resounding no. You would also get a resounding no on the export question. So I certainly can wholeheartedly support Senator Harradine's amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-12-03,"—Very quickly and very generally, no-one—certainly not to my face—has promised me that there will be miracles. No-one has promised me that there will be cures. I certainly do not know of any premiers who are silly enough to have absolutely misplaced, ridiculous faith in science to the degree that they would promise anything—certainly not to the degree of people walking after being in a wheelchair. However, I do have hope in science and I am inspired by the vision that some of the scientists have provided us with. I am often scared by some of the images and ideas that scientists and researchers have. Obviously, that is why we discuss regulatory frameworks for scientific research and discovery. Personally, I oppose the idea of embryos being used for testing cosmetics. I am not aware of any proposals to do that. I am not aware of any Australian scientists who have said that that is their intention. I am sure that if there are any examples, they will be provided to the chamber. I would like to think that the licensing committee, in its even-handed or case-by-case approach to licensing, would not allow such frivolous and unethical research.
I am not willing to rule out the issue of pharmaceutical testing—not for frivolous reasons. Perhaps Senator Boswell, or other senators such as Senator Barnett and Senator Harradine who have identical amendments, may be able to provide some responses to my queries and explain to the chamber and give us examples of areas that may be quarantined. What is the impact of writing pharmaceutical testing into this legislation? What are the implications for IVF? Are there any? Is that something that the minister or her advisers are aware of? It may have implications, particularly in relation to people applying for a licence to test a culture medium. Is that a pharmaceutical? Perhaps one of the senators behind the amendment could provide that information.
Not everyone has agreed on the idea of a strong regulatory framework. Obviously, we cannot all agree on exactly how that is framed or constituted. I guess that the key issue is that it boils down to whether we believe that the licensing committee, obviously in conjunction with the guidelines, will include the requirement of the likelihood of a significant advance in knowledge. And, of course, there is the filtering mechanism of the Human Research Ethics Committee. I guess it comes down to whether we believe that that combination is— 
—Order, Senator Harradine!
—I am too tired to even respond to interjections at the moment.
—Nor should you.
—I would like to say that it is intellectual tiredness, but it is angst. Obviously, we have to decide whether we leave the combination of those sufficiently robust as to ensure that the kind of frivolous, trivial and unethical research practices and procedures to which some have referred are not allowed. People may dispute some of those ethics committees, and that is reasonable. People are entitled to their opinion, and I think there are amendments that we will deal with later, as well as the one before us, that go to the issue of whether the combination of those groups are sufficiently strong. The amendments throw up a number of questions in relation to the banning of the use of embryos and embryonic stem cell lines and their products in the testing or manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The implications or questions surrounding these include: should there be different requirements for embryos and embryonic stem cells or their products? Should there be a difference between pharmaceutical and cosmetic testing? Should either embryos or ES cells and their derivatives be used for testing with either pharmaceuticals or cosmetics? I believe that the key feature of the licensing system is that it treats all possible uses of embryos even-handedly and allows the committee to determine if a particular case is reasonable and legitimate.
If there is an argument emanating from anyone in the chamber, including one or all of the three senators behind the amendment, that suggests that the factors in place are not strong enough to rule out that kind of vexatious or inappropriate research, I am happy to hear it. But I am also happy to hear how they define pharmaceutical and what implications there are in relation to IVF and the issue of a culture medium, to which I referred—for example, whether that would be a pharmaceutical. 
There are a few broad-ranging implications in these amendments that have not been worked out. I do not want for a minute for it to be interpreted that there are senators in this place who necessarily support cosmetic testing, because I do not get the impression that there are. I did not hear much evidence in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee of examples of where that is taking place or, indeed, where there was an intention. I am not saying that there are not some scientists who might have completely inappropriate and wacky ideas—and Antinori springs to mind as one example of a scientist to whom the world looks with grave concern, for understandable reasons—but I am certainly not willing to ban pharmaceutical testing until I hear stronger evidence from those senators who are behind the amendment before us.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-03,"—I support Senator Harradine's amendment and, indeed, the other amendments standing in my name. I have three in fact relating to drug testing. They have different levels of significance and impact, and I would just like to draw the Senate's attention to those. The first amendment specifically says: 
The NHMRC Licensing Committee must not issue the licence if the use of human embryos, human embryonic stem cells or any product derived from human embryos or human embryonic stem cells, proposed in the application involves:
(a) the testing, creation or manufacture of any pharmaceutical or cosmetic product; or
(b) the manufacture of any pharmaceutical or cosmetic product.
The second amendment is worded quite differently. It says:
The NHMRC Licensing Committee may only issue the licence to authorise the extraction from human embryos of human embryonic stem cells and for no other purpose.
The third amendment is a worse case scenario, which I would hope would have the support of absolutely all members of the Senate in the sense that it is a less strict amendment. That amendment on sheet 2757 revised says: 
The NHMRC Licensing Committee must not issue the licence if the use of an excess ART embryo proposed in the application involves the testing, creation or manufacture of any pharmaceutical or cosmetic product.
So there are three different levels and, for the sake of brevity, I just wanted to speak to all of them rather than standing up to speak on each one. 
I do support Senator Harradine's amendment. We want to uphold the spirit and the wording of the COAG agreement. That agreement makes it quite clear that we should be implementing a strict regulatory regime. I have been through a good number of the speeches in the House of Representatives and in the Senate in support of the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002, and I cannot find any that actually support drug testing on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells. I was a member of the Senate committee, along with other senators, and we have presented a report. During the hearings many witnesses made submissions and, indeed, of all the submissions, none were actually calling for drug testing to be used on human embryos. I think we need to take note of that. This evidence has been put forward to our committee. 
The whole purpose of this legislation is based on the ethical foundation that this parliament should cautiously proceed with the deliberate destruction of the so-called excess IVF embryos for the extraction of stem cells from embryos that would have otherwise succumbed. No-one is speaking passionately for the testing or the manufacture of embryos for pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. The promise of embryonic stem cells to effectively treat debilitating diseases and injuries has been the whole impetus of this debate. That has been the purpose according to the proponents of the bill and, indeed, others. So why would we not want to support a prohibition on the testing of drugs? Surely, we would. 
We need to take account of the fact that in three years time this bill will be reviewed under the current legislation. If the parliament believes that the deliberate destruction of embryos should be employed for pharmaceutical testing or for any other purpose, then this should be considered during the review process. There is an opportunity for a review and that is the time when such a new and tragic form of procedure could be considered. So I am just putting the message out that we are trying to create a strict regulatory regime. We are trying to proceed cautiously in a very controversial area. There is nobody in this parliament actually out there supporting drug testing on human embryos, as far as I can tell. The COAG sentiment is for a strict regulatory regime. So the Senate committee report has all that evidence and all the submissions before it.
Let us just look at some of the arguments against the amendments that have been put by Senator Harradine and me. One argument is that the licensing committee can deal with it and that it can be set out in the licensing conditions that it is simply not an appropriate procedure to allow drug testing. I accept that. For goodness sake, you would hope that the licensing committee would take such a position. But I say you are leaving the door open for that committee if they believe there is a significant advance in knowledge by using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells for drug testing. Is that what we want? Do we want the door left open to drug testing? It is for this parliament to create the strict regulatory regime as requested by COAG. It is for this parliament to create the rules under which this controversial research would then be undertaken. As I said, nobody is out there actually supporting drug testing that I know of.
—Trounson is!
—There may be one or two who are in a very controversial area, indeed, if they do. Why wouldn't we want to close this loophole? Why wouldn't we tie it down and make that happen and cover off this possibility? Then, if you want to, look at it over that three-year period and when the whole regime will be reviewed at the end of that period. I think they are very powerful arguments. 
Senator Stott Despoja has asked about the implications for IVF. I cannot see implications for IVF programs, but I stand to be corrected and I seek advice from the minister or anybody else on that. For goodness sake, again, would they want to test drugs on a human embryo in an IVF clinic? Is that appropriate for an IVF clinic? I do not think so. We need to carefully review our thoughts on this. I acknowledge, although I do not accept it, that some people see a difference between testing drugs on human embryonic stem cells and testing drugs on human embryos. I do not support either, but I know that there are senators in this place who have a different opinion from mine on that. You have a number of amendments before you and I draw your attention to them. There are the Harradine amendments, which are tight and strong and which rule out such testing altogether; my three amendments; and the version on sheet 2757, which is the lesser one. I prefer the Harradine amendments. I bring the amendments to your attention so that we can debate them and, hopefully, hear advice from the minister as to her position on them. 
To sum up, we are trying to create a strict regulatory regime. We need to proceed cautiously. There is an opportunity for a review. Nobody—certainly nobody in this parliament—wants to test drugs on a human embryo. Certainly there are those who want to test drugs on human embryonic stem cells or on stem cell lines—indeed there are some financial benefits for that—but I do not know of anybody in this place who supports it. So why not close off this loophole in the bill and remove it altogether? Those are powerful arguments and I hope that senators listening elsewhere can consider them. We might have another opportunity to speak on these matters once the minister has responded and once Senator Harradine has had the opportunity to put his view forward again.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"— This is quite a long answer because the issue is obviously of great concern to a large number of people. I have listened with interest to the discussion in the chamber regarding whether or not the bill before us should restrict the types of research that may be carried out on excess ART embryos. I consider that there are four main reasons why we should not include in the bill restrictions relating to the types of work that may or may not be approved by the NHMRC Licensing Committee.
Three main reasons relate to the intent of the COAG decision. Firstly, there is the establishment of an expert licensing committee that must apply very strict legislative criteria. Secondly, there is the role of the people for whom the embryo was created and their ability to provide consent to what uses their embryos may be put, including any restrictions related to such uses. Thirdly, there is a concern that by excluding types of research we are suggesting that other types of research are, by comparison, acceptable. I want to go through each of these in turn.
Firstly, the COAG decision made no distinction between different types of research on excess ART embryos, nor did it place restrictions on the types of research for which a licence may be sought. However, while COAG did not limit the types of research for which a licence may be sought, it did specify that certain safeguards should be included in the legislation to ensure that trivial or inappropriate research involving embryos does not occur. Any application to undertake research involving excess ART embryos must first be considered and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee according to a range of criteria as set out in the NHMRC guidelines. 
Only if the Human Research Ethics Committee approves an application will the application then be considered by the licensing committee. In assessing the application the licensing committee will apply the stringent criteria detailed in the legislation. These criteria include that there be a likelihood of a significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technologies for treatment which could not be achieved by other means. The system described in the legislation ensures that all research projects carried out under this regulatory system will be ethically and scientifically appropriate.
Secondly, the licensing committee has deliberately been established as a body with expertise drawn from a range of relevant fields. Members will have expertise in research ethics, research, ART, law, and consumer issues relating to both disability and ART. There will also be a member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee on the licensing committee. The licensing committee will, as a group, have extraordinary combined expertise and be accountable to the public and to parliament for their decisions. I am of the opinion that the committee will make appropriate decisions based on the merits of each particular case and the openness of the system with significant public disclosure. It will also ameliorate any risk of trivial or inappropriate research proposals being approved.  
Thirdly, COAG also acknowledged that couples donating their excess ART embryos to research should be able to approve the nature of the research for which their embryos would be used and specify restrictions on the types of research. This decision clearly anticipated a range of research projects to which couples may wish to donate their excess ART embryos.
Finally, I think it is inappropriate to start trying to list in legislation the uses of embryos that are not acceptable. The presence of a positive list tends to suggest that other uses are acceptable. For example, if pharmaceutical and cosmetic testing is listed then why not food or allergy testing, air toxin testing or industrial chemical testing? Do we want to test the safety of insecticides, paints et cetera? This is particularly so, recognising that many active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics are also present in industrial chemicals. As I said earlier, I think the decision must be left in the hands of a licensing committee who will make decisions in accordance with the strict criteria in the legislation. I think that most people agree that there are certain uses of embryos that we would not like to see occur. Direct toxicology testing may be one such use.
There are many more examples, such as testing ingredients of a range of other products. There are probably many examples that will emerge over the next few years with new scientific discoveries that we will not want to see occurring. However, to our knowledge no such research has been approved in Australia and nobody is doing any of these things now. I will be opposing Senator Harradine's amendment to restrict the types of research for which a licence may be sought. The legislation as currently drafted is entirely consistent with the COAG decision. It ensures that no pre-emptive decisions are made about the relative merits of various types of research and it ensures that all users of excess ART embryos are treated equally and are assessed by a range of experts in accordance with strict criteria. 
Amendment (12) provides for regulation to be made requiring all pharmaceutical and cosmetic products that have not been tested on human embryos or embryonic stem cells to carry a label. This is plainly impossible to implement and I think it is totally impractical. That would apply even more with respect to Senator Harradine's other amendment requiring labelling of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics that are tested on embryos or embryonic stem cells. I believe that we are scheduled to discuss that amendment relating to labelling later. I am sorry it has taken a while but I needed to explain the position as fully as possible and to indicate why I will be opposing the nomination of those particular items of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-12-03,"—I want to make the record very clear, because I think Senator Barnett misunderstood my reference to culture medium. I was not suggesting that there would be willy-nilly drug testing by IVF clinics on embryos. What I was asking for related to the definition of `pharmaceutical testing'and whether or not that would prevent culture medium testing, given that that involves chemicals and given that culture media testing is allowed under the explanatory memorandum. So it was not a suggestion that IVF clinics would be doing that but there may be some practices which are explicitly allowed for that may involve chemicals, for example, that may be prohibited as a consequence of these amendments.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-03,"—While I also have some difficulty with amendment (12) because it would mean that every pharmaceutical product would have to be so labelled, I am also aware that there is an alternative amendment to the same effect coming down the line from Senator Boswell. I think the issue is enormously important and I support the sentiment that Senator Harradine has in that amendment. We have talked a lot in this committee about our free vote—our right to have a conscience vote on the clauses and the bill. There has been debate about whether people should not be penalised in the workplace if they choose not to work with embryonic stem cells, although Senator Harradine's amendments in that regard have failed to get through the committee stage.  
Now we get to the question of whether, if there is pharmaceutical testing which involves embryonic stem cells, people who buy those pharmaceutical products ought to know about it. Of course they should as a basic consumer right. In a matter as sensitive as this, I would be horrified if this parliament were to say that consumers out there did not have a right to conscience shop, when we have given ourselves the right to have a conscience vote. Many products are labelled these days, but I cannot think why you would not want to label products that had been tested on embryonic stem cells. In fact, I think we must do it. However, that debate is coming on a little further down the line.
Senator Patterson, on behalf of the government, said that we ought not be restrictive in stating what testing can occur with embryonic stem cells. Why not? I have looked through the index to the bill and I cannot find any reference to pharmaceutical testing. We ought to be debating the matter. Why not have a positive list in the legislation? The alternative is to have no precaution and to simply say that anything applies and, when something goes wrong, bring it back to the parliament and we will try and fix it. That is not the right way of doing things. If you have an intent to allow pharmaceutical testing, then have the gumption to say so. Put forward an argument as to why that should be so, and we will then vote on the matter. I do not accept Senator Patterson's repeated assertion that these matters should be left to some other appointed people. 
Whether we like it or not, ultimately we are charged with the responsibility of making decisions on difficult and critical matters like this on behalf of the Australian people. We are the ultimate ethical committee, if you like. We might not have the so-called expertise or whatever it is that allows people to be appointed to boards and committees. But we are elected by the people whether we like it or not and have to make decisions on these matters. Yet I hear Senator Patterson saying, `Let us not debate whether there should be pharmaceutical testing or not'—and she named a number of other matters—`let us leave all that to somebody else to decide.' No, thank you, as far as I am concerned. I find it difficult territory but what I want to hear tonight—and what I want to hear from the minister in charge of this bill—is why we should be supporting pharmaceutical testing on embryonic stem cells. Please give me that argument; otherwise, I am left to support Senator Harradine in the absence of an argument. That is not the way the presenter of this bill should present evidence and argument to this chamber on a matter as critical as this. I am not in the business of passing this off to unnamed people somewhere else, hoping they will fix it. That responsibility is fairly and squarely on my shoulders and, I submit, on the shoulders of every other senator. That is why this is such an important matter. I ask the government to please tell us in this chamber here and now—because this is the opportunity—why we should support pharmaceutical testing on embryonic stem cells.
Let me move to another part of this amendment. Has the government no concern about cosmetic testing on embryonic stem cells? Is that a use of these cells which the government promotes? If it does not, it should say so. Finally, the minister said that the woman and the man who are involved in the production of these cells will have the opportunity to make a decision. Are they really going to be told, `With your stem cells you have a choice of uses to which they will be put'? Are they really going to know that their embryonic cells are going to be used in the testing of lipstick, skin cream or shaving cream for that matter? I think not. If the minister is going to reassure us about that, let us hear what the genitors of these cells are really going to be told and how the options are going to be put to them. Let us have some assurance about that.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—At about the same time last night—and it has now been another 24 hours and a significant amount of that time has been spent in this chamber doing this—I objected to an impugnation by a senator on my motives or on the motives of other people in not supporting amendments. Any indication that, because of the argument I put forward, I had a particular view or that I was supporting pharmaceutical testing I find offensive, and I do not think it is appropriate. 
I actually have reasonable trust in a system, with a range of people from a range of areas, as outlined in the bill, to be able to make judgments. I would have thought that honourable senators—with the sort of experience that one or two on the other side have, particularly the senator who just gave his contribution, having a medical background— would know that there is a possibility that a pharmacological study might be used to find a better medium in which an embryo could be stored or frozen or a better way in which it could be maintained to be viable. Obviously, that would be tested on animal models right up to the point where it was thought to be appropriate and could provide a better outcome, meaning that more embryos would be taken and women would not have to go through the very difficult procedure of egg extraction. There is a possibility. It may be appropriate to test in that way. I do not know whether the honourable senator opposite is indicating that we should not do any further experiments in preserving those embryos in a better way.
—But where do you draw your line?
—The senator asks where I draw the line. That is exactly what I just pointed out. Once you go through each item and you admit something, you are indicating then that that might be okay. We have very strict criteria.
—There is no line.
—We will disagree most probably forever. But I do find it galling that the people who are supporting some of these amendments impugn those who do not with motives other than honourable motives. I find that totally unacceptable and I will not tolerate it. Whenever it happens, I will get very stroppy and quite strong about it, because I think that it is inappropriate. I have not questioned the motives of anybody else putting amendments forward. I do not like my motives or the motives of people who will support the amendment being impugned. You might think the argument is not good enough. Let us put it to the vote. I believe the system is sufficient for reasonable testing—for example, if it were required to find a better way to store an embryo—and it is appropriate. That is the sort of judgment that I would expect people of integrity and honour to make. You might mistrust people; I actually have a little more faith. I think you would have to outline every detail and explain in what circumstances you could test, for example, a medium in which it was better to freeze an embryo or some procedure by which to freeze an embryo.
Let me just say that I will not be supporting the amendment. I will not tolerate people coming in here and impugning my motives or the motives of anybody else who is voting against the amendments. It has to be fair in here. A couple of times I could have said things that I might have regretted or I had thought in my head about what people have said in here, but I have not said those things, because I think it is fair for people to have their judgment and their view and to be treated with fairness and honour in this place. But I find it offensive when people come in here and say that I am not standing up to this and I must therefore accept pharmaceutical testing. I ask people to bring a little bit more calm back into this. I am feeling a bit agitated now, because last night the same thing happened. I will not tolerate it and I will get up every time. I have been calm in the discussions. I have sometimes disagreed with people, but I have not impugned or questioned their motives.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Before I call Senator Brown, I would like to say that, in my careful listening to Senator Brown, I do not believe he impugned any motives at all.
—It's not up to you to make a judgment. 
—I am not making a judgment. You have suggested that he has impugned motives and I do not believe, from my position, that he has.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-03,"—That has very much shortened my next contribution to the Senate—
—That was very unbiased and observant!
—I am unbiased and observant.
—You are correct, Mr Temporary Chairman. I am sorry that Senator Patterson feels that way. Senator Patterson, the most important part of my question was a request for information. What is the basis for opening up pharmaceutical testing on embryonic stem cells? I also ask whether the minister could outline why testing on stem cells for cosmetics ought not to be a matter for us to debate and decide on, yea or nay. That is what I really want to know. In the absence of a good argument from the government or the minister as to why we should be endorsing pharmaceutical testing or cosmetic testing on embryonic stem cells, I am left to make up my mind on the matter no better informed than when I first got to my feet—and I will do so. I am sorry if the senator feels she is impugned; I had no intention of doing that.
—Well, you did.
—People who introduce bills in here have to expect they will be questioned at length and in full, and I will not desist from that in any measure.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—I want to reply and will now deal with the issues that were stated by the minister. Firstly, the example that was given was an exempt use. Secondly, the minister says, `We'll leave it to the system.' There is no real accountability; we are just told, `Leave it to the system; they're an expert panel.' We have also heard, `The matter has gone through a human research ethics committee.' Again, let me remind the Senate that a human research ethics committee is appointed by the institution that is making that application.
I ask the chamber and the minister to please have regard to what is being said. Much weight has been put on the application being evaluated and approved by a human research ethics committee, as though that were the end of the story and we do not need to open our mouths. But in this particular case it is the drug company that will be appointing the human research ethics committee, which was once called the institutional ethics committee. I have the provisions here as to who will be appointed. Obviously, the applicants for the licence are not going to appoint a human research ethics committee that is going to cause them trouble.
To cap it all off, the minister says that the decisions and the evaluation of that committee are not going to be made public. There is no transparency in that at all. This was in the statement by the minister that this is all subject to public scrutiny; it is not. I am preparing an amendment, which I hope will be supported, along the lines that at least the decisions of the human research ethics committee should be made public.
The minister talks about the role of donors. I ask the minister: is it not a fact that donors will not be able to know where their human embryonic stem cells will end up? Once the embryonic stem cells are extracted, is it not a fact that the donors will no longer have any control over the use of those embryonic stem cells? Is that a fact or not? Or is it a fact that, because of the structure that has been placed in this legislation, the donors will not know about their embryonic stem cells because the cells are no longer identified with the donors. Is that a fact or not?
I am making something of this because much has been made of it by the minister, on advice. The advisers know what I am talking about. I do hope the minister will see the importance of my forthcoming amendment and will seek some advice from those from whom she receives advice—and I do not mean her advisers in the chamber; I mean elsewhere. I am asking the minister: what are the stringent requirements in respect of this whole question of the testing of pharmaceutical products? The minister appears to be opposed to the testing of pharmaceutical products. If that is the case, how can we best cater for that view? 
Senator Stott Despoja said, `Give us some examples of what is meant.' Is Senator Stott Despoja in favour of the testing of drugs and toxicology testing by using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells? I gave certain examples of what is being proposed, and I quoted the chief executive of Stem Cell Sciences, Dr Peter Mountford. Senator Stott Despoja may not have been here when I was making my introductory comments, so I will repeat that the report in the Australian says:
Dr Mountford has never produced a human embryo, but holds a patent on technology he believes will achieve this result by the end of 2002. He plans to commercialise the process within two years by supplying disease-carrying embryonic stem cells to pharmaceutical companies for drug screening.
Dr Peter Mountford is the chief executive of Stem Cell Sciences and an Australian. The Centre for Stem Cells and Tissue Repair, the Trounson outfit, in its application for the money that it received, stated:
A number of companies throughout the world have identified that ES cells in their differentiated or undifferentiated state can be used to develop screening assays to identify new chemical agents for their therapeutic capability or to screen new or existing agents for toxicity in their profile.
Those are two examples, and there are a number of others. I referred to the letter that I received from the industry minister about these matters. I have given those examples, and I certainly trust that they will be taken on board. I simply put it to the committee that this measure deserves full support, and I request the minister to respond to the questions that I have raised with her.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-12-03,"—I would like to ask the minister a question. If a couple have excess embryos, what procedure would they go through to sign the embryos into drug testing or, for that matter, for export? Do they get a choice? Is there a paper on which they can say that they wish to use their excess embryos for a cure, to test drugs, or to be exported overseas to a place that has no rules or standards? What choice do the man and woman, the producers of these excess embryos, have? How do they make that choice? How is that choice given to them? I think that is a reasonable question. Can you tick box A to say that, yes, you can send them overseas? Can you tick box B for drug testing, or tick box C for a cure? How do these people make a decision?
I have an aversion to passing off the duties of this parliament to someone else. We have a democracy in this country. We all run for parliament. Senator Harradine gets up and pushes an agenda, and everyone knows where he is. They know that if they vote for Senator Harradine then they are going to get certain actions in the Senate. They know about Ron Boswell when they vote for him. We go out and we sell our product. We get out there and say, `Ron Boswell does this, this and this.' People judge whether they want to vote for Ron Boswell, Senator Harradine, Senator Murphy, the Labor Party or the Liberal Party. We all stamp our product. We say to people, `Vote for me, because I am a conservative and I will represent you in this way.' Then when we come in here, we say, `I don't want to represent you at all; I'll flick that over to some committee.'
I have been in this place for 20 years. I have been through native title debates—I have been through many debates. Some just pass through; some are very important. But I cannot think of any debate that will affect Australia and the long-term future of Australia more than this debate. When I go out and ask people to vote for me, they expect me to react. They do not expect me to flick a decision across to someone else who is unelected. They know what I stand for. I run that up the mast and say, `Ron Boswell stands for this.' When I come back here I do not have the choice to make a decision in line with what the people who voted for me want, because it gets flicked away to someone else. I have an aversion to that.
Even if the minister were to say, `Let's make it a regulation, and if you are not happy then the parliament has 15 days to disallow it'—and I think about three disallowances go through a year—I could live with that. Let the so-called experts make the decision and, if the parliament is not happy, someone who represents the values that are opposed to that particular decision can move a disallowance that will be tested by the numbers in the parliament. I feel pretty strongly about this: we are elected to make the decisions; it is not the NMHRC or any other unelected body. I want to put that to you very strongly, Minister. I do not expect you to answer that, but I wanted to put it on the record. I would like you to tell me how people with excess embryos will decide where those embryos will go. Is it by a declaration? By what particular means do they do that? How does it happen? ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I indicate on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that will be opposing Senator Harradine's amendment. Basically, we think that this bill seeks to set up a system which allows for a rigorous and effective means of monitoring what types of research are approved and it sets up a system of safeguards. Senator Boswell said that we cannot pass these decisions onto others. We do in every other piece of legislation we pass in this place. In terms of pharmaceuticals, we set up a system and we let the PBS decide which drugs go on the market and which drugs are subsidised and how they are subsidised et cetera. We do not make each decision in the parliament. We set up a system and we set a process. We make judgments about whether the safeguards are built into that process. 
In this legislation we are putting in place a two-stage process. The Human Research Ethics Committee have to give their approval and then an application will go to the licensing committee. So there is a two-stage process to monitor applications for a licence and for research. That is the architecture which is established in the bill, which Labor believe will provide the sorts of safeguards we want. We do not intend to put ourselves in a position of deciding on each application in the parliament or to canvass all the issues that might be raised by various applications for research. Quite frankly, my imagination probably would not be wide enough to canvass all those issues, and I think that would be true of the parliament as a whole. We are setting up a system to allow those applications to be processed on their merits with the appropriate safeguards. If people have concerns about the safeguards, they can move amendments to those. In the debate we have voted for some and opposed others. 
Some of the debate today seemed to go to making decisions on issues which someone has got a particular bee in their bonnet about and which they want to make a judgment on. We are saying that we support the architecture which allows for those decisions to be made and we are not going to pull out the two or three issues that are concerning a particular senator at a particular time, because we do not think that will give you the result you are after anyway. We are not in a position to make those decisions. So I will be opposing Senator Harradine's amendment and amendments similar to that.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-03,"—I support Senator Harradine's amendment. I would like to quote from a research paper produced by the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute. They stated:
In May 2001, Professor Trounson gave a good description of the range of research interests he sees as important. These include infertility research into fertilisation, intra-cytoplasmic sperm transfer and embryo development, as well as research on chromosomal abnormalities, gene expression, artificial eggs and sperm, gene development, cancer (including testing cytotoxic drugs), energy metabolism and therapeutic cloning. 
They went on further to state:
All of the studies on which we have reported in this paper come from peer-reviewed journals. In the rapidly advancing and increasingly private biotechnology research sector, it is more than likely that there is another body of research that has not reached these journals and may never do so. Much of this research may not have been published at all, either because it was not undertaken with sufficient scientific rigor or simply did not produce a reportable result. It may also be that the results it yielded, in the view of the companies involved, needed to be kept secret for commercial reasons. Alternatively, even though the work is legal, it may be viewed by the researchers to be outside of publicly acceptable ethical norms, and hence best kept from public view. This may have been the motive behind the secrecy surrounding cloning experiments conducted in Victoria in which a human nucleus was placed into the enucleated egg of a pig and developed to the 32-cell stage.  
Secrecy has accompanied the development of ART from the beginning. Professor Carl Wood made the startling admission in 1983 that he and other IVF scientists had secretly experimented with the conception of a human being in a sheep. 
These are the reasons I believe that Senator Harradine's amendment is so important. We need to set out very clearly and explictly in this legislation what may be carried out but, even more importantly, what may not be carried out. Senator Harradine's amendment will stop the research that the scientists themselves believe is not publicly acceptable.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—I am still awaiting the responses from the minister. I raised what I thought were perfectly legitimate questions, and now Senator Boswell has raised questions which are perfectly legitimate. They are following the minister's statement as to why she is opposing, presumably on advice—just as she opposed the conscientious objection clause, presumably on advice—
—I make the decisions; it is not about advice.
—I am trying to protect the minister. The minister has a difficult job, and she is being told, `Don't do this; don't do that,' and, `Do this; do that.' She has indicated—
—I have a mind of my own, as you saw in the cloning bill.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order! Senator Harradine has the call.
—I had and do have some sympathy for her. She has half-indicated her concerns about the principles, as she said at the beginning of this debate, and I acknowledge that. In the response that she gave, she said that this matter is handled by way of strict, stringent requirements. First up, she mentioned that it has to go through the Human Research Ethics Committee. Bear in mind that it is the applicant who appoints the Human Research Ethics Committee—in this case, it would be the drug company, or the institution governed by the drug company, that will be making the application for an excess ART embryo, or the stem cells derived from that excess ART embryo, to be used for drug testing. The question I am asking is: is that a stringent approach? Is it accountable to the public? Are the public made aware of the precise terms of the evaluation by the institutional ethics committee, now called the Human Research Ethics Committee or HREC? Are they to be made known to the public? If not, why not? 
Secondly, the minister referred to the role of the donors, which gave rise to the questions that Senator Boswell properly asked. What role have the donors got? Is it or is it not a fact that the donors do have a right to agree or not to agree to the use of an ART embryo? If they do agree to the use, then they have the right to say to what purpose those human embryos can be put. However, if the stem cells are then taken from the human embryo, do the donors have the right to know where the embryonic stem cells end up? They no longer become identified with the donor couple, and therefore the donor couple do not have control over where the embryonic stem cells end up. Those are three of the issues to which I am asking for a response.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-03,"—I am feeling very disturbed about this debate. I am not sure that I heard it correctly but I thought—Hansard will bear it out— that the minister, in her response to the arguments put by those supporting some sort of prohibition on drug testing on human embryos and human embryonic stem cells, advised this chamber that it may be appropriate to test on a human embryo or human embryonic stem cell into the future. That is how I heard it, and I stand to be corrected; I hope I am corrected. However, I now have to speak on the basis of how I heard the statement from the minister. With that statement, we are saying that the door is open. If that statement is correct, we are saying that the door is open to drug testing on human embryonic—
—That is not what we are saying. You know very well that that is not what we are saying.  
—Perhaps the minister can correct the statement.
—No, I just said it. You heard exactly what I said.
—Order! There will be an opportunity for the minister to respond, and I ask that Senator Barnett be heard in silence.
—I would appreciate a response. Before I continue, perhaps the minister will respond, because that is how I thought I heard it: that she said that, based on the advice she had been given, at some stage in the future it may be appropriate to do drug testing on a human embryo or human embryonic stem cells.
—I did not say that at all, and you know that. 
—That is how I heard you, Minister.
—Sit down and give me a chance to explain it, but I am not going to get up again.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order!",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—I did not say `open the door'. I was indicating that there are methods of storing embryos. It may be in animal research that it is found that there is a more appropriate medium for storing and freezing an embryo, for example. I presume that it would be tested on animal models. But at some point it would have to be demonstrated that it was more effective than a former method, and I think that there would be people involved in the ART project who would prefer to have a technique for storing embryos that reduces the risk of any changes in those embryos. That is the sort of example I was giving. I would have concern if there were frivolous testing, and I think the safeguards are there. That is why I have indicated that we have safeguards in place to ensure that there is not frivolous—I have forgotten the other word I used—research.
The other thing that I will repeat—and I am not going to get up again; we have gone over this and so much has been said which is relevant to this—is that people making a donation of an embryo will be counselled. If they are not from an English-speaking background, counselling will be given in their own language. They can put restrictions on the way in which that embryo is used—for example, that it is only used for ART and that it cannot be used for any experimentation. They can put very strict controls on the way that excess embryo is used, or they can decide not to use it at all. I keep going back to the point that, if people feel so strongly about it, there will not be an excess of embryos available for embryonic stem cell research. If what you are telling us is that, if the whole community do not want embryonic stem cell research, then there will not be any excess embryos, because people will not give permission. We must go back to the fact that people will have to give permission and will be counselled beforehand. Every attempt will be made to make sure that they understand it. They can put any restriction they like on the use of that embryo or, if it will be used for experimental research, on how it will be used. So I think we have to get that on the record.
This goes back to what I was saying before. I say one thing and it is interpreted another way. But I think it would be totally inappropriate to hinder the fact that we may be able to produce embryos that are less likely to have some sort of problem as a result of the freezing technique, because of the medium in which they are frozen. If it can be demonstrated in animal models that there is a better method for doing it, it would then have to be tested in the human model, with the results demonstrating that it is not detrimental to the embryo. But people can make that decision as to whether they would permit their embryo to be subjected to any form of research. They might say, `I only want it for ART and not for stem cell research.' So if people feel as strongly as people in this chamber indicate that they do, there will not be any embryos; there will be none. All the women who have had IVF will say, `I am not going to donate my embryos.' So if it is as serious and of such a great concern as the other side is indicating, then that is what will happen. I think that is probably most unrealistic. If people decide to donate their embryo, they will give consent—informed, counselled consent—about the extent of the use of their embryo. 
I have indicated before the reasons why I will not be supporting this amendment. I am not going to be subjected to this harassment that I have to answer every single question. When I am sitting here not answering, it is because I believe sometimes that I have answered it this morning, last night or yesterday morning or that it has been answered in the committee. I have been reasonable. When I have thought there was a reasonable point and I had not answered it in a previous part of this debate, I have got up and answered it. But I am not going to get up and keep repeating and repeating and repeating my arguments, nor am I going to be told that I do not really believe what I am saying. I am concerned that there not be frivolous testing, but I believe that we have sufficient safeguards in there. People will say, `You are not right.' That is their privilege and that is their right. But, I am sorry: I believe, as Senator Evans has indicated, that we cannot monitor and approve every experiment that is undertaken. We have put a structure in place— Senator Evans used a very good word: `architecture'—to ensure that that building is sound. I have just extended the analogy a little further. I am confident—and maybe you will say that is misguided confidence; so be it. I have said what I had to say about this amendment and I will not be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-03,"—Thank you, Minister, for that response. As I am standing here, I cannot rely on, nor do I think it is appropriate for the public of Australia to rely on, somebody simply saying they `think' and `hope' and express confidence that a certain outcome will take place. What we can do—now, here, today—is design a regime and say, `This is how it will be.' We can rule out drug testing on human embryos and human embryo stem cells. The minister made a number of other comments. I would like to address some of them. Firstly, with respect to consent and counselling, I think it is very good to have on the record, from the minister's perspective, that there will be adequate counselling, because that is another issue, as is appropriate consent of the donors of the human embryos. My point about that—and we will certainly be coming to this later in the debate—is that that is set out in the guidelines. It is not set out in any regulation; it is set out in this document entitled Ethical guidelines on assisted reproductive technology. This document is not a disallowable instrument. This is not a regulation and this is not law. This is a guideline, and a guideline is a guideline. That is why it should be embedded in the bill itself.
The minister's point about the donors is that they have to give consent—point taken. But we were all once a human embryo. Every person in this chamber and in this nation of Australia was once a human embryo, and we have rights too. Human embryos have rights too. That is why this is a controversial debate. That is why we are standing here expressing heartfelt concern from different perspectives. I respect the minister's perspective and I acknowledge her concern and care, which is expressed in a different way from the way I and perhaps others in the chamber express it. I respect all of that, but I say that those human embryos have rights. I say that the size and function of a human being should not determine the level of respect and honour that should be bestowed on that human being. 
We talk about drug testing. The whole purpose of this bill is meant to be designed for therapeutic purposes or for cures, and I have said many times that the end does not justify the means. But even if you do accept in this case that it does, surely drug testing on a human embryo is not appropriate. Surely the destruction of a human embryo for a cure is the only way that you would want it. That is why I have designed one of these amendments to see if I can get a sympathetic response.
One of the four points that the minister made was that if we just exclude those certain types of research, there is a danger, because the exclusion may not be comprehensive. Her concern is that if we list some, we may not list others. Let us focus on the intent of the bill—which you will remember was designed for cures, wasn't it?—which was to help people. That is the purpose according to the proponents of the bill. One of my proposed amendments is that the committee may only issue the licence to authorise the extraction from human embryos of human embryo stem cells and for no other purpose. Why would you not support that? What is wrong with that? Surely, that is consistent with the minister's view and the concern that it does not rule out other options. It is specifically for the extraction from a human embryo of human embryo stem cells and for no other purpose. Why can we not say that? If that is what this debate is about, why do we not go with it and take it on board? Let us say that it is for no purpose other than for trying to obtain a cure. I request those on the other side of this debate to think carefully about it and I say, `Why wouldn't you support this proposed amendment?' 
The minister is confident that the regime will rule out frivolous testing. That is heartening, but it is not heartening enough, because it is not law. It is not in this bill. Yes, there is a regime there, but the regime leaves the door open. That is what concerns me. I say that drug testing on a human embryo or embryo stem cell is an abhorrent act. I see it—and of course this is a personal view—as demeaning. I see it as the worst nightmare that has been foisted on the Australian public. This whole debate about drug testing concerns me greatly. The minister says that it should be ethically and scientifically appropriate. Well, ethically and scientifically appropriate to whom? Here we are in this chamber, designing a regime which COAG says should be a strict regime. They say we should proceed cautiously. We support that, so why do we not back it up by ensuring that we have tight guidelines and not allow this type of testing on a human embryo?
It is concerning and perhaps one does get a bit hot under the collar in these sorts of debates. I feel strongly about it, and that is why I am standing here. The minister talked about the criteria that would be set under this so-called regime in which the minister has confidence. The criteria talk about a significant advance in knowledge. If the committee then decides that drug testing on a human embryo or a human embryo stem cell is appropriate and does in their view provide for a significant advance in knowledge, well, bingo! You're on! It happens; the door is open and away you go. Down the track it is a possibility. Is that what we actually want? Is that appropriate for this great nation of Australia? There are a lot of individuals that fill up this nation and they all deserve respect. The human embryo, the smallest of human beings, deserves respect. This loophole in the proposed legislation should be ruled out. It should be eliminated. We should treat the human embryo with dignity and respect.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-03,"—I would like to further emphasise the importance of Senator Harradine's proposed amendments. To some extent they are supported by the President of the United States of America. On 9 August President Bush made a public statement:
As a result of private research, more than 60 genetically diverse stem cell lines already exist ... I have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines, where the life and death decision has already been made ... This allows us to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line, by providing taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potential for life.
We now have America accepting that it is no longer publicly acceptable to destroy embryos even for the purpose of future research. America has said very clearly that 60 genetically diverse stem cell lines already exist. If America has closed the door totally on the destruction of any further embryos or the production of any embryonic stem cells then I believe Senator Harradine's amendment really does not go far enough.
I have been very critical at times in this chamber and have said that we have blissfully followed the lead of the Americans. In this case I have to eat humble pie and say, `If it is good enough for the Americans then it should be good enough for Australians.' If the scientific ability of the nation of America recognises that they do not need to destroy any further embryos then how much more fitting is it for Australia to follow that lead of the President of the United States? I would be very interested to hear a comment from the minister on whether she would take back to the government on notice a request that no federal funding be used in any way in the further development of the extraction of embryonic stem cells or in the destruction of any embryos. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—It is obvious that Senator Harris is not going to get that guarantee, because the government has just given $46.5 million to an outfit that is going to use some of that money for purposes which will involve the destruction of human embryos. That is $46.5 million that could have been used elsewhere, plus $5.3 million, plus a lot of other money—amounting to about $112 million. Unfortunately, a significant amount of that will be spent in this particular area, and spent when there is absolutely no evidence at all from peer reviewed journals that there is anything in these particular proposals. Money comes cheap.
Apparently the minister will not answer questions I have asked her. I take it for granted that the minister is saying that the human research ethics committees are secretive. The minister is assuming that they are secretive operations and their evaluation of the applications will not be made public, that it is all secret and there is no way the public can raise questions about the matter. I take it that that is what she is saying about this particular matter when it comes to the testing of drugs on embryos or stem cells. 
I have specifically asked the minister whether the donors have control over the use of embryonic stem cells derived from the excess ART embryos for which they are the custodians. The minister has not confirmed that, and I assume that that is the situation. She made three points, the second of which related to the role of the donors. The role of the donors is very limited. They say what their embryos are to be used for, according to the legislation, but it does not go further. The donors could say, for example, `Yes, stem cells can be derived from the embryos,' but they will not be able to know, or keep control of, where those embryonic stem cells end up. Could they indeed end up in attempts in other countries to develop human embryos from embryonic stem cells? I said that last sentence deliberately, because there are people behind you who know that that is a fact, and that will come out later on in this debate. 
I will ask those questions with regard to donors at some other stage, but I am going to conclude by saying that this is a defining moment. Here we are agreeing to the use of human embryonic stem cells, to the destruction of the human embryo for the purposes of drug testing. We were all a human embryo at one stage, needing only what we need now to survive—that is, shelter and nourishment. No civilised society can remain civilised if the status of the human being, that human embryo, is to be reduced to that of an experimental tool or a laboratory rat. And that is precisely what we are proposing: drug testing on human embryos or on human embryonic stem cells to the destruction of the human embryo. It might have been any one of us used for that purpose and I, for one, certainly would not want to see that happen.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-12-03,"—I request that my amendment (1) on sheet 2718, which makes it an offence to fail to label products developed from human embryos, human embryonic stem cells and their derivatives, be circulated in the chamber.
 (Senator McLucas)—That has occurred, Senator Boswell. Are you suggesting that we deal with this now?
—No.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—by leave—I move amendments (6) and (12) on sheet 2751 revised:
(6)	Clause 21, page 16 (after line 2), after subclause (3), insert:
	(3A)	The NHMRC Licensing Committee must not issue the licence if the use of human embryos, human embryonic stem cells or any product derived from human embryos or human embryonic stem cells, proposed in the application involves:
	(a)	the testing, creation or manufacture of any pharmaceutical or cosmetic product; or
	(b)	the manufacture of any pharmaceutical or cosmetic product.
(12)	Clause 48, page 35 (after line 13), at the end of the clause, add:
	(3)	The regulations must include provision for labelling pharmaceutical and cosmetic products including the notification that human embryos or human embryonic stem cells have not been used in the testing, creation or manufacture of any pharmaceutical or cosmetic product.
I will be brief because the argument was made for the matter in principle just a moment ago. One of the reasons for this amendment to clause 21—and I hope it is supported—is that, rather than making it a straight-out offence, it does give authority and guidance to the NHMRC Licensing Committee. It really is an amendment to prohibit the NHMRC Licensing Committee from issuing a licence if the application involves the use of human embryos or human embryonic stem cells in the testing, creation or manufacture of pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. In the discussion that we had previously I gave the example of an institute bankrolled, if you like, by a drug company making an application to the licensing committee for the use of an ART embryo, or ART embryos. That drug company would then make the application and it would go through the institutional ethics committee of the drug company or its institute, and we have heard in the previous discussion that the information of its evaluation would not be publicly available.
Frankly, I believe that this is consistent with the COAG communique of 5 April 2002, which stated:
The Council agreed that research involving the destruction of existing excess ART embryos be permitted under a strict regulatory regime to enable Australia to remain at the forefront of research which may lead to medical breakthroughs in the treatment of disease. 
The communique did not allow a broader range of research. It is not enough to just prohibit the use of human embryos in these activities; it is also important to prohibit the use of embryonic stem cells in this research. A prohibition restricted to human embryos would encourage the destruction of human embryos for their stem cells so that these stem cells could be used for much the same research.
Debate on the bill has shown that whatever support there is for destructive experiments on human embryos it is restricted to the production of embryonic stem cells to produce possible theoretical therapies for particularly intractable diseases. There is a range of other potential research uses for human embryos. Those involving pharmaceuticals and cosmetics appear to be the most likely due to their potential financial returns. These amendments are slightly different from the matter we just dealt with because this then hands it over to the National Health and Medical Research Council Licensing Committee.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—I indicate that the amendments moved by Senator Harradine have the same effect as the amendment that was just defeated, and for the reason I opposed that amendment I will be opposing these amendments. 
Question negatived.
 (Senator McLucas)—Senator Barnett, your amendment (R6) on sheet 2694 is the same as amendment (6) that we have just defeated.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-03,"—Yes, that is fine. I accept that. I have two other amendments on this issue. I seek leave to move amendment (R5) on sheet 2694 revised, together with amendment (1) on sheet 2757 revised.
Leave granted.
—I move:
(R5)	Clause 21, page 16 (after line 2), after subclause (3), insert:
	(3B)	The NHMRC Licensing Committee may only issue the licence to authorise the extraction from human embryos of human embryonic stem cells and for no other purpose.
 (1)	Clause 21, page 16 (after line 2), after subclause (3), insert:
	(3C)	The NHMRC Licensing Committee must not issue the licence if the use of an excess ART embryo proposed in the application involves the testing, creation or manufacture of any pharmaceutical or cosmetic product.
I stand to support both amendments, but amendment (R5) makes the issue very clear. It states: 
The NHMRC Licensing Committee may only issue the licence to authorise the extraction from human embryos of human embryonic stem cells and for no other purpose.
I will be brief, because I have made these arguments before, but I will repeat them again. This whole debate is about cures—to do that, you extract the stem cells from a human embryo. If that is what the proponents and everyone else agrees is the main purpose of the bill, why don't we say it and advise the committee accordingly? We could authorise the committee to issue licences only for that purpose and for no other purpose. Surely that is an appropriate amendment. Then you can rule out all these other options in terms of drug testing on a human embryo or on a human embryonic stem cell.
I am moving these two amendments together because I can see the numbers—the support is not there—but I am still making the argument that I think they are valid. The second amendment is the weakest amendment that I could possibly envisage in regard to drug testing on human embryos or embryonic stem cells. It says:
The NHMRC Licensing Committee must not issue the licence if the use of an excess ART embryo proposed in the application involves the testing, creation or manufacture of any pharmaceutical or cosmetic product.
That, as I have said, is an amendment which I could live with. I hope that the minister can advise whether she is willing to live with that amendment or whether she does not wish to support it. It would be good for senators to get that on the record. That amendment is different to the other one because it specifies the testing, creation and manufacture of pharmaceutical or cosmetic product and it includes both the pharmaceutical—that is, the drug—and the cosmetic product. 
I seek the minister's response to those two amendments. The same arguments as those that were put by Senator Harradine apply. We want to close the door on drug testing on human embryos and the testing of cosmetics on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells. I do not believe that having confidence in a regime will do the trick. For the sake of brevity, I have been through those arguments before. If we can seek from the minister clarification of whether she supports that amendment, that would be good. If she does, so be it. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"— Senator Barnett's amendment (R5) on sheet 2694 revised seeks to confine permission to use excess ART embryos only for the derivation of stem cells. It would prevent all ART related research, training and quality assurance work. These practices have been occurring in Australia for 30-odd years. I was actually at the Queen Vic when they first started the IVF program, doing foetal movement research, so when I say that it is 30-odd years it makes me feel old. Some of you were not born then. 
These practices have been occurring in Australia for 30-odd years and have contributed significantly to the high standard of ART clinical practice available to Australian couples today. To ban such activities would severely impact on the ability of ART clinics to maintain and continue such treatment. This amendment would also prevent couples from donating their excess ART embryos to IVF related research. Many couples want to donate their excess ART embryos for this type of research in order to help other infertile couples to become pregnant.
As I noted previously, I will be opposing any amendment which seeks to restrict the types of research for which a licence may be sought. As I have said, the legislation is currently drafted in a way that is entirely consistent with the COAG decision. It ensures that no pre-emptive decisions are made about the relative merits of the various types of research and it ensures that all users of excess ART embryos are treated equally and are assessed by range of experts in accordance with strict criteria. 
My arguments opposing Senator Barnett's amendment (1) on sheet 2757 are the same as in relation to the previous amendments that were defeated and I do not propose detailing them again. I will not be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-03,"—I make a short response to that. The minister has put her position and I can see where the numbers lie. I would like to see that advice in terms of the ART procedures not being allowed to continue. Clause 10 sets out a number of offences in the use of an excess ART embryo. My understanding is that it is an exempt use and therefore would not be caught by that particular amendment and the ART programs could continue. Anyway, that is the advice that she has received; I will leave on the table whether or not it is correct. It is disappointing that I cannot gain support for my amendment (1) on sheet 2757. I will say no more.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—It is very important for the minister to respond to that. Senator Barnett has a point in respect of his amendment (R5) by reason of the operation of clause 10. It is an exempt use, is it not? I am asking for advice on whether that would come under the prohibition proposed in (R5).",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-03,"—I rise in support of Senator Barnett's amendment (R5). I believe that it might not attack the problem from Senator Harradine's point of view. It would be a clear restriction if it were passed in this legislation. If we look at the Annotated Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia—I believe it is on page 346—we see that it is set out very clearly that what is not granted to the parliament of the Commonwealth is denied to it. Therefore, Senator Barnett's amendment to this piece of legislation would very clearly set out that a licence could not be issued for any other reason than for the extraction of human embryonic stem cells. It is very clear; it adds clarity to the legislation. I believe that in doing so it makes the function of the licensing committee much easier for them to actually implement. For those reasons I believe that the Senate should consider the arguments that Senator Barnett has put forward and support this amendment. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-03,"—I have had a chance to review the bill. I appreciate the comments made by Senator Harris because I think that what he says is entirely correct. Clause 10 of the bill talks about the offence in the use of excess ART embryos. In subclause (2) it says:
A use of an excess ART embryo by a person is an exempt use for the purposes of subsection (1) if:
(a) the use consists only of:
(i) storage ...
(ii) removal ...
(iii) transport ...
Then it goes on to (b), (c), (d) and (e), and (f) is of course the catch-all clause. It says:
... the use is of a kind prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.
So it will not be a problem for the government to prescribe regulations under this. It is an exempt use, and an exempt use is not covered by my amendment, so I cannot see that it is caught. I would like to see some advice on that to be persuaded otherwise. I would like to hear the views of people on the other side about this. What are the Labor Party's arguments against (R5)? It specifically makes it clear that it is authorised only for the extraction of human embryonic stem cells and for no other purpose. That is what it says; it is pretty straight down the middle. Again, that is the whole purpose of this bill; that is what it is designed to do. It would be helpful to put on the record the views and the advice provided in response to that point. I appreciate the comments of Senator Harris, Senator Harradine and others in support of the amendment.

—Could I have the understanding of the Committee of the Whole that I will move that at a later stage, probably towards the end of the running sheet.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-12-03,"—I just wanted to put on record that, while this seems to be a somewhat small amendment that does not seem to influence the legislation in a big way, the Democrats did have a couple of pedantic concerns in relation to the emphasis on applied and basic research. Senator Collins says that this amendment makes it clearer that the purpose of knowledge sought by research on embryos is to improve medical treatment. However, I do not think this chamber should overlook the fact that there are crucial basic science questions that ES research has the potential to address—not just applications, although applications could subsequently flow from greater basic science knowledge. So there is an argument that the current wording perhaps better reflects scientific realities, because there are basic and applied science issues at hand, not just improving medical treatments and applications. We are conscious of that, but I can read the numbers in the chamber. I congratulate Senator Collins on being so pedantic. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I would like respond to that very quickly. I have never suggested that the distinction here is between basic and applied science, and I can quite easily accept that the type of research that might be utilised with the objective of enhancing medical treatment may well in fact be basic science as well. However, for the licensing committee, I think the connection of these clauses without these commas to medical treatment makes it clear that we are not talking about things such as cosmetic research. In the light of the earlier discussion, I think this, thankfully, is a way in which most of the committee can express a view fairly clearly to the licensing committee. Those involved in this debate never intended to talk about licensing related to the likes of cosmetic research.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I foreshadow that I will move my amendment (1) on sheet 2750. I understand the government is going to move a further amendment to insert two other words to this, subsequent to my amendment being carried. The committee might recall that this debate started right at the beginning of the committee stage, when there was extensive debate on the first evening on an amendment, which was later withdrawn in my name, to seek to restrict the number of embryos that might be used for the various purposes authorised under the bill and authorised by the NHMRC Licensing Committee. After some hours the point was made in a number of places that it was inappropriate to insert that provision in the objects of the act and, if my amendment was withdrawn at that time, it would be given fuller consideration if inserted into an appropriate place later in the bill.
I will not retread all of that ground. It is exactly the same discussion and the same debate, and the matter is fully on the record. Just very briefly, I would say the bill does not include any requirement for the NHMRC Licensing Committee to seek to minimise or restrict the number of human embryos that will be destroyed. The COAG decision, which this legislation is meant to reflect, stated that in the regulatory regime for the licensing of research involving the destruction of human embryos a licence would only be issued on a case-by-case basis, provided that the procedure involved a restricted number of embryos. That COAG decision had not been included in this bill prior to this amendment.
The amendment, when carried, will require the NHMRC Licensing Committee to go beyond simply having regard to the number of embryos that the research requires in deciding whether to issue a licence for destructive embryo research. Should this amendment be successful, the committee will instead be required to have regard to restricting the number of embryos that will be destroyed for the purposes of this licence. I understand there has been discussion on both sides of the chamber and that the amendment as circulated has been agreed to by both the parties.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-12-03,"—I indicate on behalf of the Labor opposition that, in accordance with past practice, senators will obviously have a conscience vote on the issue but that we are formally going to support Senator Bishop's amendment. As he said while he was speaking to his amendment, this was an issue that originally came up under the objects of the act clause. I expressed the view there that, while my instructions at that time were to oppose it, I had some personal sympathy with it, because its intention was to give force to a COAG agreement. I think the view around the Senate is that obviously as few embryos as possible ought to be involved in this research. We are looking to have the benefits of the research but obviously do not want to allow any sort of carte blanche. We share an interest in ensuring the numbers are restricted to the necessary and approved research. While that is generally within the framework of the bill anyway, I think it was an important addition. His adding the word `restriction' has given force to the argument he put there. We were not prepared to support it in the objects of the act, but we think it fits much better here. Therefore we will be supporting Senator Bishop's amendment as a useful addition to the bill.

(2)	Page 16 (after line 30), after clause 22, insert:
22A  Further notification of applications, decisions, and appeals
	(1)	Subject to subsection (2), any person may request information to be provided by the NHMRC Licensing Committee in relation to:
	(a)	the receipt of an application for a licence by the Committee;

This amendment is also self-explanatory. Instead of allowing a licence to be given according to the licensing committee for any period of time, the amendment effectively means that the licence remains in force for up to two years, unless it is suspended for some matter, and will then need renewal. It is actually putting a time limit on that licence.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—I move amendment (7) on sheet 2696:
(7)	Clause 24, page 17 (before line 7), before subsection (1), insert:
	(1A)	A licence is subject to the condition that before the use of an excess ART embryo may be authorised by the licence, the regulations must provide a mechanism for the proof of date of the creation of each embryo covered by the licence.
	(1B)	A licence may only be issued in respect of an excess ART embryo which has a proven date of creation.
This is a rather important matter. The amendment is self-explanatory. It seeks to add another subclause to clause 24. Clause 24, on page 17, deals with the matter of the licence being subject to certain conditions. I am proposing another condition, as outlined in my amendment. The background for this is, I think, unexceptionable. I ask the minister to consider this very seriously. The amendment specifies that there must be proof of the date of the creation of the embryo proposed to be used for research. This is a significant amendment that addresses a fundamental flaw or loophole in the bill.
Both clauses 21 and 24 of the bill refer to this particular date as a threshold issue which, in part, determines whether or not an embryo can be used for research. Lack of proof of this date is, I believe, a major oversight. The COAG communique also states, in paragraph 6.5:
... the system should enable appropriate monitoring of compliance with the national standards and provide legislated penalties for non-compliance.
One of the central responsibilities of a government in establishing a new regulatory regime like the one proposed in this bill is to create an effective environment to ensure that the objectives of the legislation are met. One of the key requirements of the COAG communique, detailed in appendix 1 of the communique, is that the embryos to be declared surplus `must have been created before 5 April 2002'. I quote their words. As I said, this date is mentioned in clauses 21 and 24 of the bill, but an important factor in establishing this regulatory regime is recognising that the decision on whether or not an embryo was created before this date is dependent on the accuracy of information from the ART centre concerned. As the ART centres are self-interested organisations—I use that term in the technical sense—there is an obvious need to have some proof that the claimed date of creation of embryos is correct.
This is a key risk factor that the intent of the legislation will not be achieved. It is a risk that should have been identified in a risk assessment of this bill. I am wondering what type of risk assessment was done. It is not unusual to have such requirements in legislation. For example, in the child support laws paternity is regarded as a threshold issue which requires proof. My amendment simply strengthens the audit controls of this regulatory regime to ensure that one of the key objectives of this legislation is achieved. The licensing committee will not be able to monitor compliance with this legislation without documentary proof of the date of creation of each and every human embryo. I hope, in the interests of a `strict regulatory regime'—to quote the words of the COAG agreement—this amendment will be adopted by the chamber.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"— The amendment proposed by Senator Harradine includes a new clause that appears to seek to make it a statutory condition of all licences that there must be proof of the date on which the embryo was created before the excess ART embryo can be used in accordance with the licence. I do not understand why it is thought that this amendment is necessary, because the legislation already does what the amendment appears to seek to do.
The legislation already requires that the NHMRC Licensing Committee must not issue a licence unless it is satisfied that there are protocols in place to ensure that any excess ART embryos proposed to be used for work that may damage or destroy the embryo were created before 5 April 2002. In addition, clause 24 makes it clear that it is a statutory condition of the licence that, before an excess ART embryo is used under a licence, the licence holder must write to the NHMRC Licensing Committee and confirm that the embryo to be used was created before 5 April 2002, as determined in accordance with protocols that were considered by the NHMRC Licensing Committee before the licence was issued.
The legislation already does what Senator Harradine is proposing. It already makes sure that if an application involves the use of an embryo which may damage or destroy the embryo there must be proof that the embryo was created before 5 April 2002, and the proof must be established in a manner that is satisfactory to the NHMRC Licensing Committee. Further, under the monitoring powers outlined in part 3 of the bill, the inspector will be able to inspect all relevant records to ensure that the conditions of the licence or licences in the legislation have been complied with. For this reason I will not support Senator Harradine's amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—Where does the bill already require this? I am deliberately asking this question of the minister. If she cannot give an answer, I will ask Senator Stott Despoja. Where in this legislation is this covered? The minister has been saying that the licensing committee can seek proof. What proof? Should they take the word of the ART centre? I am saying that, under those circumstances, that should be an essential provision built into the legislation.
As I said in my explanation, clauses 21 and 24 of the bill refer to the particular date as a threshold issue. Clause 21 states, `In deciding whether to issue the licence, the NHMRC Licensing Committee must have regard to the following,' the following being paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e). I am trying to ensure that the date of the formation of the embryo is properly able to be established. This is the way to establish it. I am asking the minister or Senator Stott Despoja: where in this legislation is this cut and dried—in other words, where is it proven?",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"— The amendment requires proof of the date of creation for all uses of embryos. As I said, for uses that damage or destroy the embryo, the committee must be satisfied that the embryo was created before 5 April. The committee has the powers to monitor, and any breach of a condition of the licence attracts a criminal penalty. I believe that that is more than enough. It is built into clauses 21 and 24 and the monitoring provisions to ensure that the embryo was created before 5 April 2002. As I said, I will not be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-03,"—I have a question for the minister. Minister, clause 24(1)(c), the section that you basically just read out, says:
... the licence holder must have reported in writing to the NHMRC Licensing Committee that the embryo was created before 5 April 2002. 
Can you give a categorical assurance to this chamber that, at this point in time, in the records of the NHMRC there are documents that show that the embryos were produced prior to 5 April 2002, and that those documents were provided to the NHMRC prior to 5 April 2002? I am specifically asking: is there a list held by the NHMRC of embryos that exist, and was that list in existence before 5 April? Or can the NHMRC merely say to the minister, `Here's a sheet of paper that says these were created before 5 April'?
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-03,"—I move amendment (6A) on sheet 2694 revised:
(6A)	Clause 24, page 17 (after line 21), after subclause (2), insert:
	(2A)	A licence is subject to the following specific conditions:
	(a)	a licence holder must provide a report to the NHMRC every 6 months itemising and describing each research project commenced or undertaken by the licence holder during the preceding 6 month period;
	(b)	a licence holder must include in each report required by paragraph (a) an analysis of whether or not the research project could have proceeded without the use of human embryos;
	(c)	a licence holder must report to the NHMRC any variation in the circumstances contained in the licence holder's application for a licence within 2 weeks of the occurrence of the variation;
	(d)	a licence holder must report every 6 months detailing the number of human embryos used by the licence holder during the preceding 6 month period.
This amendment sets out a range of reporting mechanisms for the licence holder. Paragraph (a) states that they must provide a report to the NHMRC every six months itemising and describing each research project concerned. This is consistent with the amendment that we moved and passed yesterday in terms of reporting procedures. However, that was reporting from the NHMRC and this is reporting from the licence holder, so there is that distinction; but it is still on a six-monthly basis. It would make it consistent with the amendment that was moved and passed yesterday. Paragraph (b) is again consistent with the amendment successfully moved by Senator Bishop earlier in terms of restricting the number of human embryos for research purposes. I think the amendment is supported by and consistent with the COAG statement, as clauses 6.4 and 6.5 of the COAG agreement of 5 April say:
6.4	the system should provide for public reporting of research involving embryos so as to improve transparency and accountability to the public; and
6.5	the system should enable appropriate monitoring of compliance with the national standards and provide legislated penalties for non-compliance. 
In my view, the amendment is consistent with the COAG agreement and with the reporting mechanisms that this bill now includes as a result of efforts yesterday. I seek any views from the minister in terms of arguments or positions that may not be consistent with my own. I foreshadow that there may be a view that a reporting mechanism is adequately covered in clause 29 of the bill, which talks about a database that should be maintained by the NHMRC Licensing Committee and about the types of things that should be included in that database. I simply make the point that, if we are going to make it a tight, strict regulatory regime, they need to have oversight of the licence holder, and the licence holder should be able to provide this information and advice through to the NHMRC Licensing Committee so that they can do their job adequately, as per clause 29. We are simply enabling them to do their job as they should, and we are enabling a more open and transparent process in terms of reporting.
It is important for the public and for the community in this country to know about the type of research that is being undertaken. Why shouldn't we know whether or not the research project could have proceeded without the use of human embryos? This is really the point: we should have the minimum number of embryos necessary in terms of the research and the work that is undertaken by the licence holders. I simply put this forward in supporting a more open and transparent process and a tighter regulatory regime. I will not go into further detail; I could but, in light of the time and the need for brevity, I will seek advice or a response from the minister to the points that I have made in respect of that amendment. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—I will not be supporting Senator Barnett's amendment. It would require the licence holder to report every six months, describing research undertaken including an analysis of whether the work could have been achieved by other means, variations in the licensing conditions and the number of embryos used. Clause 24 gives the licensing committee a wide power to determine conditions of licence and these conditions can include, but are not limited to, the number of embryos, reporting and monitoring. The licensing committee controls specific conditions included in individual licences and asks for monthly reporting, if it so determines.
Since there will be a range of different types of licences granted, it is up to the licensing committee to set the reporting requirements, depending on the nature of the work, so that the reporting periods can be varied from licence holder to licence holder as necessary. There needs to be flexibility in the legislation to allow this. I do not support Senator Barnett's amendment that a licence holder must report a variation in circumstances to the NHMRC Licensing Committee. The legislation already provides that a licence holder must comply with any condition of the licence. If licence holders vary their circumstances, this may place them in breach of their licence conditions. Therefore the legislation already provides that, if a person wishes to change their circumstances in a way which will affect the licence or the licence conditions, they must apply to the licensing committee for a variation of licence before they undertake the changes.
With regard to the fourth condition proposed by Senator Barnett, that a licence holder must report every six months detailing the number of embryos used, it is expected that conditions of licence set by the NHMRC Licensing Committee will deal with this. Members of the public will be able to check this on a publicly available database of licence applications, which will be updated regularly to reflect the actual number of embryos used as part of a project. For these reasons, I will not be supporting Senator Barnett's amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-12-03,"—For the same reasons that the minister has outlined, the Democrats will not be supporting the amendment. I think the minister made a particularly important point in relation to the fact that a licence holder must comply with any condition of the licence. If they vary their circumstances in any way, they may be in breach of their licence, so they should therefore seek a variation anyway in order to safeguard their own licence. The conditions outlined in this amendment are seemingly excessive. More to the point, each licence could have different conditions applied, depending on the nature of the work. Thus, as the minister outlined, the licence conditions need to be flexible, and certainly the licensing committee needs to have flexibility in order to set licence conditions that are relevant to the project. So I do not think this is a necessary amendment; in fact, it is potentially quite an onerous one.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-12-03,"—The bill contains reporting requirements. Minister, would it be envisaged by the NHMRC that they would report at least annually? Could it be longer than that?

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"—I stand to be corrected, but I think I covered that in the points I made. I said that there would be a range of different types of licences granted and that it is up to the licensing committee to set the reporting requirements, depending on the nature of the work, so that the reporting periods can be varied. As I said, they may want the report every month. If you stipulate that, that may actually limit what they can do. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-12-03,"—I understood that. My question was: despite those requirements—and I understand what you are saying in that they may set different times, and that is fair enough— will there be a maximum time of 12 months or greater?",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,—It depends on what the licensing committee sets and what the reporting requirements of that particular licence are.,SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-03,"—I indicate that One Nation will support Senator Barnett's amendment (6A) because it sets out quite a reasonable regime for the licence holder to come back to the NHMRC and report progress. I believe that this is appropriate because clause 25 sets out that the licensing committee can vary a licence by giving notice in writing. That is in clause 25(1). Clause 25(2) states: 
The NHMRC Licensing Committee may vary a licence under subsection (1) on its own initiative or on application by the licence holder.
So a licence can initially be granted to carry out a specific type of research, and the NHMRC then has the ability to vary that licence. The person who is doing the research may find that they want the licence to go in a different direction, and they can also apply to the NHMRC to vary that licence. To have an understanding of, and for the public to know, the direction of this research, we do need this consistent reporting. I do not believe that it would impose on any eminent scientific establishment in this country—establishments which have their own reporting programs—to have them referred back to the NHMRC on a six monthly basis. In response to Senator Harradine's amendment (3) on sheet 2751, moved earlier this evening, I gave a quote off the cuff from the Annotated Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. I would just like to clarify that the total quotation is from page 346 and is under heading 33 `And all Laws'. It states:
No difficulty is suggested by the words, “and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under the Constitution.” The words “under the Constitution” are words of limitation and qualification. ... A law in excess of the authority conferred by the Constitution is no law; it is wholly void and inoperative; it confers no right, it imposes no duty, it affords no protection ... To be valid and binding, they must be within the domain of jurisdiction mapped out and delimited in express terms, or by necessary implication, in the Constitution itself. What is not so granted to the Parliament of the Commonwealth is denied to it.
That was the point I was making earlier. If the power is not expressly set out in the Constitution, then the Commonwealth does not have the power to make those laws. Also, if it is in excess of the powers of the Commonwealth, it has no authority, confers no right, imposes no duty and, even more importantly, affords no protection. I wanted to clarify that for the record.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—I am surprised that the minister does not accept this. It is a perfectly reasonable approach. It is very good for the licence holders too. In any event, they will probably do this internally. This simply requires that the licence holder reports to the NHMRC on those matters that it should be aware of as a matter of course. I support the amendment moved by Senator Barnett.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-12-03,"—Clause 24(5) says:
The conditions specified in the licence may include, but are not limited to ...
It does not necessarily mean there has to be any reporting. If the NHMRC Licensing Committee deem that there has to be, they may include it or they may not. I would suggest that some consideration be given to those conditions. It should say that the conditions specified in the licence `will include, but are not limited to'. At least there would be a requirement to report some things.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-12-03,"—Is it a fact that the legislation now enables the NHMRC Licensing Committee to award a licence for the use of human embryos for, say, five years with no reporting? There is no requirement for the licence holder to report. Is that what we are faced with? If that is the case, it really is very disconcerting, given the fact that the NHMRC Licensing Committee, in any event, is heavily loaded with industry representatives. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-12-03,"— As I indicated before, there will be different types of licences granted and the NHMRC Licensing Committee will set the reporting requirements. It is unlikely to be five years, because there is going to be a review in three years. I would be very surprised if the licensing committee did not require a licence holder to report in a reasonable time. When the three-year review comes up, if it is found that the licensing committee is failing in its duty to get licence holders to report adequately, then that will be dealt with. But we may find that the licensing committee will put, as I said, a much more stringent reporting requirement on one over the other, because they want to watch it more closely or they want to have more information. By prescribing it we may limit the licensing committee in doing what they think is best under the circumstances. The public database will also list the conditions of the licence, and there will be public scrutiny straight away if there is not a reporting process. I can see Senator Murphy about to jump up. At the moment I would think that everybody involved in this is heinous and they are going to do terrible things. But the public will be able to observe this. As I said, there will be a review, and prescribing the reporting conditions may limit what the licensing committee can do.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-12-03,"—I do not have a view one way or the other on Senator Barnett's amendment for prescribing a time. At the moment it seems to me that the licensing committee may not require reporting or monitoring at all. It says here that the conditions specified in the licence `may' include, and it goes on to refer to reporting, monitoring and information. All I was suggesting was that the `may include' should be changed to `will include'. I am not arguing a case for specifying any time, but rather that there ought to be a requirement to report or to monitor. That is all I am suggesting. That might solve a lot of problems.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-12-03,"—I will respond to some of the comments that have been made. I appreciate the additions from Senator Murphy, Senator Harris and Senator Harradine. This is the whole point: if no time limit is specified, it is open-ended. That is what we have. It is an open-ended system that allows for who-knows-when for the reporting to come in. We recognise that clause 29 sets up a public database, but what about the conditions? Clause 24(5) says that they `may include'. That is not adequate. We are trying to build a system that will build public confidence in the regime that we have. That is where I am coming from. I have recommended six months. I think that is fair and reasonable. Senator Harradine made the point that they will probably be doing it anyway. It is not rocket science or a major transformation of their businesses to be reporting in that time frame. Surely the public has a right to know; that is the point that I would like to put forward. We need to proceed. This is controversial legislation and we should proceed cautiously. That is set out in the COAG agreement, so it is consistent with that. The arguments that have been made are quite strong, and I will leave it there.

The speech read as follows—
INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE DISABLED PERSON
TUESDAY, 3 DECEMBER 2002
In 1999, I was invited by the Developmental Disability Council to participate in the Politician Adoption Scheme. I was subsequently adopted by Stephen Franklin and his family and have found the experience to be both enlightening and rewarding.
Stephen is a young man with Prader-Willi Syndrome and, since my adoption, I have learnt a great deal about the difficulties faced by people with disabilities and their families. Today we recognise the contributions of people with disabilities and also their special requirements.
Through the Politician Adoption Scheme, I have also learnt of the incredible drive and dedication of the parents of people with disabilities as they guide and care for their children in what can sometimes be very difficult circumstances. In the case of Stephen, his mother, Carol, has worked tirelessly to promote awareness of disability issues. Carol co-founded CASA (Committed About Securing Accommodation) with Grace Parker, who is also the parent of a young man with disabilities, and together they have made incredible contributions to the lives of those living with a disability.
Over the weekend, I was fortunate to attend CASA's last meeting for this year and met a number of parents who were kind enough to tell their stories. For some, the most pressing issue was the unmet need in supported accommodation, for others it was respite and post-school options for their children when they finish full-time school. Another family had privately purchased a home for their disabled daughter to give her security and independence and in doing so, have made themselves ineligible for the Aged Pension.
The stories were all different yet the love and determination and commitment to their children and to disability issues was the common thread that bound them so tightly together. It is important that today we recognise the contributions made by people with disabilities and also by their families who provide such vital support.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>International Day of the Disabled Person</title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech

REGULATION IMPACT STATEMENT
PROHIBITION OF TRAWLING IN SHALLOW INSHORE WATERS OFF MISSION BEACH
PREPARED BY THE GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AUTHORITY 
Introduction
The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) is one of the world's largest marine protected areas, encompassing a complex array of diverse ecosystems. Because of its large size, diversity and uniqueness, the Great Barrier Reef is an internationally significant ecological resource. As a consequence, it has World Heritage status.
The management of fish stocks in the GBRMP and World Heritage Area (WHA) is the responsibility of Queensland. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), in keeping with its responsibility to protect the natural resources of the GBRMP whilst providing for reasonable use of the Great Barrier Reef Region, contributes to the management of fishing primarily through the use of management zones that restrict certain fishing activities in specific areas.
The East Coast Trawl Fishery is Queensland's largest commercial fishery in terms of number of operators, level and value of production, and area. The fishery targets prawns, scallops, bugs and squid, with a wide range of other species taken incidentally. Some 170,890 square kilometres of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (about 50%) is open to trawling and, historically, about 70% of the effort in the fishery has occurred in the Marine Park.
A recent major research program (1991-1996) on the impacts of trawling in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park commissioned by GBRMPA and undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Queensland Department of Primary Industries found that trawling has major impacts on the seabed. The study found that for every tonne of prawns taken by a trawler, 6-10 tonnes of bycatch is taken, most of which is discarded. Each pass of a trawl net along the seabed removes 5-25% of seabed life. The impact is cumulative, with 13 passes of a trawl net removing 70-90% of seabed life. The study clearly demonstrated that trawling has a significant adverse impact on marine, particularly seabed, ecosystems and is in line with the findings of similar studies on the impacts of bottom trawling undertaken in other parts of the world. 
Following extensive negotiations between the Commonwealth, Queensland and industry, Queensland recently introduced revised management arrangements for the East Coast Trawl Fishery, which made significant improvements to the management of the fishery. These changes included the capping of fishing effort; a reduction in effort of 10.86% via a structural adjustment scheme funded jointly by the Commonwealth and State governments; a further 5% across-the-board effort reduction by industry; the introduction of tradable effort units; effort unit penalties upon trading to compensate for increases in effort due to improvements in technology; the introduction of a satellite-based vessel monitoring system; the closure of areas of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park where trawling historically had not occurred in order to prevent expansion of the fishery; and the introduction of turtle excluder devices and bycatch reduction devices in trawl nets used in the Marine Park.
What is the problem being addressed?
The issue addressed by the proposed Regulation is the elimination of repeated and extensive fish kills in the Mission Beach area (northern Queensland) as a result of discarded bycatch from trawlers targeting banana prawns in shallow (up to 10m deep), inshore waters.
Such fish kills have occurred at regular intervals since trawling became common in the Mission Beach area in the 1970s. On one occasion in the 1980s, so many fish were washed up on local beaches that a local Shire grader was used to bury the discards. Residents have noticed changes in the abundance and variety of fish off Mission Beach since trawling began.
As a recent example, in May 2001, dead fish were found along a 10km-stretch of local beaches. In addition, a slick of dead fish 600m-1km wide and 3.5-4km long was recorded 2km offshore by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. The density of dead fish in the slick varied, but in some places was as high as 40-50 fish per square metre. The dead fish included dollarfish (Family Leiognathidae), trevally (Carangidae), grunter (Haemulidae), silver jewfish (Sciaenidae), stripies and fingermark bream (Lutjanidae). Such occurrences are unacceptable as part of any fishery that purports to be ecologically sustainable, all the more so if the fishery occurs in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and a World Heritage Area, in a prime tourism and recreational region.
Apart from the ecological impacts, such extensive fish kills caused by trawling have an impact on recreational amenity, tourism businesses and the Commonwealth's reputation as the guardian of a World Heritage Area. The value of tourism to the Queensland economy, in terms of jobs and income, is substantial. Most tourists who visit Queensland come to see one of the natural wonders of the world, the Great Barrier Reef. The occurrence of dead fish on beaches and floating on the water are not the images that domestic and international tourists expect to take home after visiting the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. 
What are the objectives of Government action?
To prevent the occurrence of extensive fish kills caused by trawlers operating in shallow, inshore waters off Mission Beach, which in turn will:
protect biodiversity and conserve the natural resources of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park as required under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975;
reduce the impact on the recreational amenity of a major tourism area; and
satisfy the Commonwealth's stewardship obligations for a World Heritage site.
Which options for dealing with the problem were considered?
Option 1 - The status quo
Recent changes in management arrangements for the East Coast Trawl Fishery under Queensland fisheries legislation have not addressed the issue of dead fish on beaches in the Mission Beach area caused by trawlers operating in shallow, inshore waters. The mandatory use of bycatch reduction devices in trawlers operating in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park has not solved the problem. Indeed, the on-going occurrence of extensive fish kills as a result of trawl discards in the Mission Beach area points to the inadequacy of such devices in significantly reducing fish bycatch in inshore trawl fisheries.
Option 2 - Industry Self Regulation
A voluntary code of conduct, introduced by local trawler operators in an attempt to address the problem, has proved ineffective. Any trawler operator with a T1 endorsement in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery can trawl in the area and can choose to adopt or ignore any local codes of conduct.
Option 3 - Proposed new Regulations
To prevent the occurrence of fish kills caused by trawlers targeting banana prawns in shallow, inshore waters off Mission Beach, it is proposed that a new Regulation be introduced to prohibit trawling in shallow, inshore waters in the area.
The proposed trawl closure (see map) covers an area of about 400 square kilometres. It incorporates some existing Great Barrier Reef Marine Park zones in which trawling is prohibited already; these zones collectively make up some 130 square kilometres. In addition, some 16 square kilometres in the proposed trawl closure are closed to trawling under Queensland fisheries legislation. Consequently, the area in the proposed closure that will be closed to trawling for the first time is 254 square kilometres or about a seventh of 1% of the 170,890 square kilometres of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park currently open to trawling. 
Although there is broad agreement on the need for a trawl closure, the extent of the closure was the subject of intense debate and involved consideration of closures proposed by the two community-based, local marine advisory committees (LMACs) at Mission Beach and Hinchinbrook, a proposal submitted by the Queensland Seafood Industry Association and the recommendation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA).
The Mission Beach LMAC proposal included all of Rockingham Bay, located immediately to the south of the proposed trawl closure. The Hinchinbrook LMAC supported the Mission Beach LMAC's proposed trawl closure north of Dunk Island, but proposed an alternative closure boundary running about 4km offshore in Rockingham Bay, immediately north of Hinchinbrook Island. The Hinchinbrook LMAC's rationale for its proposed closure boundary in Rockingham Bay was that trawling for banana prawns in inshore areas is the primary cause of the fish kills and that the Mission Beach LMAC's proposal would cause unnecessary hardship to trawler operators targeting tiger prawns in deeper, offshore waters. However, the Hinchinbrook LMAC's proposal does not include all the shallow areas in Rockingham Bay. Under its proposal, some areas of shallow water would still be open to trawling.
The Queensland Seafood Industry Association proposed a much smaller closure than those proposed by the LMACs.
The closure recommended by the GBRMPA was a compromise between the closures proposed by the two community-based LMACs at Mission Beach and Hinchinbrook. The GBRMPA proposal took into account the bathymetry of the area. Under this option, the area closed to trawling for the first time would have been some 610 square kilometres. It included all shallow inshore waters in Rockingham Bay, but excluded from the closure most of the deeper waters in which tiger prawns occur. Banana prawns typically are caught in shallow, inshore waters to a depth of about 10m, whereas tiger prawns typically are taken at depths of 10-25m. The GBRMPA recommendation was based on achieving the best environmental outcomes by protecting inshore habitat, particularly sea grass beds and dugong habitat, and minimising the potential for fish kills caused by trawlers targeting banana prawns in shallow inshore waters, while at the same time enabling trawlers to continue to target tiger prawns in deeper offshore waters. 
Who is likely to be affected?
The primary benefit of the proposed Regulation is greater protection of the natural resources and biodiversity of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area for the Australian and world community.
This has major flow-on benefits to recreational users of the area and the tourism industry, which is focused on providing visitors with an experience of the natural wonders of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area, and contributes substantially to the Queensland and Australian economies.
The value of tourism to the Queensland economy, in terms of jobs and income, is substantial. According to Tourism Queensland, tourism contributes over $6 billion annually to the Queensland economy, $2.4 billion of which is in export earnings, and employs almost 150,000 people.
A study of the economic and financial values of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park carried out by KPMG Consulting estimated that in recent years (1993/94-1997/98), the gross, annual, financial value of direct commercial tourism use of the Marine Park ranged from $411 million to $507 million. During the same period, the gross, annual, financial value of direct recreational fishing and boating use of the Marine Park was estimated to range from $108 million to $120 million. In comparison, during the same period, the gross, annual, financial value of direct commercial fishing in the Marine Park ranged from $121 million to $149 million. Thus, the combined gross, annual, financial values of direct tourism and recreational fishing and boating use of the Marine Park is more than four times the gross, annual, financial values of direct commercial fishing.
The above estimates of the financial values of the direct uses of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park do not include consideration of the flow-on impacts or the effects of linkages of these activities with other industries in the Queensland economy. KPMG Consulting extended the direct contribution analysis and considered the indirect or flow-on effects of these activities in terms of output and employment. For the 1994-95 financial year, the total output effects of tourism and recreational boating and fishing ($1,099,300 million) were 5.7 times greater than those for commercial fishing ($193,900 million). Similarly, for the 1994-95 financial year, the total employment effects of tourism and recreational boating and fishing ($14,896 million) were 5.5 times greater than those for commercial fishing ($2,720 million).
The KPMG study clearly demonstrates that tourism and recreational boating and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park are worth substantially more to the economy than commercial fishing in the Marine Park both in terms of direct financial value and flow-on effects. Furthermore, tourism and recreational boating and fishing have substantially less impact on the environment than bottom trawling. 
The Queensland East Coast Trawl fleet is characterised by a high degree of mobility. Most trawlers involved in the fishery operate in several areas and travel extensive distances while doing so. This characteristic is thought to be a response to the seasonal nature of the various species taken in the fishery. All trawler operators with a T1 endorsement can trawl throughout the Queensland East Coast from the tip of Cape York to the Queensland/New South Wales border. The proposed closure will impact on those trawler operators who target banana prawns in the shallow inshore waters off Mission Beach. However, the proposed closure is very small compared with the area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in which trawlers can operate.
The banana prawn catch in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery is extremely variable (depending on climatic conditions), varying between 300 and 1100 tonnes per year. Typically, banana prawns make up about 6% of the annual catch in the fishery, with 75% of the banana prawns taken south of Ingham, i.e. in areas south of the proposed closure. Tiger prawns are also taken in the Mission Beach area, usually in deeper offshore waters. The main season for banana prawns is March-May, whereas for tiger prawns it is March-August. Most banana prawns are sold on the domestic market, while most tiger prawns are exported. Current prices paid to fishers by a processor in Mackay, central Queensland, are $14-15 per kg for banana prawns and $19 per kg for tiger prawns. 
The proposed Mission Beach trawl closure extends across two 30-minute, logbook-recording grids (I18 and I19 of Queensland East Coast trawler operators' logbooks). The average recorded catch over the period 1995-2000 for these two grids was 51 tonnes of banana prawns and 108 tonnes of tiger prawns per year. Given existing trawl exclusion zones in these grids, there are about 4000 square kilometres available to trawling. The trawl grounds to be closed under the proposed Mission Beach closure make up about 10% of this area. Trawler operators will be prevented from taking prawns in the shallow water off Mission Beach. Some of the tiger prawn grounds off Mission Beach will be included in the proposed closure, but most of the tiger prawn grounds will remain outside the proposed closure. Since tiger prawns move between the two areas, trawler operators will still be able to access tiger prawns in the offshore grounds.
Under the GBRMPA recommendation, most of Rockingham Bay immediately to the south of the proposed Mission Beach trawl closure would also have been closed to trawling, thereby preventing access by trawler operators to the banana prawn grounds in the shallow, inshore waters of the Bay. Trawler operators would also have been prevented from accessing some of the tiger prawn grounds in the deeper waters of Rockingham Bay.
The average number of trawlers that reported operating in logbook grids I18 and I19 from 1995 to 2000 was 233. Some trawlers targeted banana prawns only, some targeted tiger prawns only, and others reported catching both tiger prawns and banana prawns:

The results of a recent study (entitled A Guide to the Fishers of Queensland - Town Resource Cluster Analysis and Social Profiles of Queensland's Commercial Fishing Industry) undertaken by the Cooperative Research Centre for the Sustainable Development of the Great Barrier Reef indicate the relative importance of the area to trawler operators who live in the area and those who come from outside the area. The study was undertaken between August 1999 and April 2000, so its findings can be related to the logbook data for 1999 and 2000.
The analysis was based on questionnaires filled in by 1008 commercial fishers, representing 41.2% of all commercial fishers. Of the respondents, 106 said that they fished in the area that is to be covered by the proposed Mission Beach closure/Rockingham Bay area. Of these, 88 were classified as 'roamers' (i.e. they did not live in the area, but fished in the area) and between 62 and 82 per month reported trawling in the area; the remaining 20 said they were 'localisers' (i.e. lived in the area and worked in the area) and between 3 and 6 per month reported trawling in the area.
Given that the study was based on 41.2% of commercial fishers, then multiplying by 2.4 would gives a rough estimate of the behaviour of all fishers. On this basis, only about 7 - 14 trawler operators, who live and work in the area, actually work the proposed Mission Beach closure/Rockingham Bay closure area each month. On the other hand, 149 - 197 trawler operators, who live outside the area but work part of the time in the area, work in the proposed Mission Beach closure/Rockingham Bay area each month. These figures appear close to the mark because the total number of trawlers that reported in their log books that they operated in grids I18 and I19 in 1999 and 2000 (the period covered by the study) was 222 and 206 respectively. Since this study was undertaken, some 240 vessels have been removed from Queensland East Coast trawl fleet (see below), so the number of trawler operators impacted by the closure will be correspondingly less.
Recent reform of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery has reduced effort in the fishery by some 15% (10% via a structural adjustment scheme, to which the Commonwealth and Queensland governments each contributed $10m). In 1999, there were 750 trawlers operating the East Coast Trawl Fishery. As a result of the government-funded licence buyback scheme and other mechanisms in the trawl fishery management plan, there are now some 240 trawlers less operating in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park than there were two years ago.  
In essence, today, there are fewer trawlers operating in the East Coast Trawl Fishery and fewer days spent trawling in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park than there were two years ago. Furthermore, to address the issue of effort creep due to improvements in technology and fishing practices (estimated to be about 3% per year), penalties on effort units are imposed on transfers of licences, transfers of effort units and replacement of fishing vessels. Given that the proposed closure is so small compared to the remaining trawl grounds and that effort in the fishery has been substantially reduced in the past two years, it is unlikely that the proposed closure will cause any significant increase in effort in other areas.
As far as the consumers of local seafood are concerned, any shortfall in the overall catch of banana prawns in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery can be more than made up by the production of banana prawns in aquaculture. Banana prawns are now well established in the Queensland aquaculture industry to the extent that aquaculture production of banana prawns in 2000-01 exceeded the wild catch of banana prawns in the East Coast Trawl Fishery for the same period. Aquaculture production is likely to increase substantially over the next decade. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations (Aquaculture) were introduced in February 2000 to ensure that aquaculture developments adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park are undertaken in an ecologically sustainable manner.
The inshore area off Mission Beach is a source of broodstock for the leader (black tiger) prawn aquaculture industry in Australia. Leader prawns are not common along the Queensland east coast, but are taken in banana prawn catches in shallow water close to shore. Each mature female leader prawn is capable of producing 250,000-400,000 offspring. Australian prawn hatcheries require 3000-5000 broodstock per year, with 1500 broodstock on average collected each year in the Mission Beach area. In general, trawl operators have not entered the leader prawn broodstock market because most prawns caught by trawling are dead by the time they are sorted from the catch. According to the Australian Prawn Farmers' Association, local prawn hatcheries are finding it difficult to obtain broodstock because most of the estimated 100,000 leader prawns caught each year in the Queensland trawl fishery are usually mixed with banana prawns and sold dead, either fresh or frozen. However, many broodstock leader prawns caught off the Queensland coast are sold overseas where they command a much higher price than locally. Some sources say that as much as 85% of the broodstock leader prawns taken along the Queensland coast is exported. The proposed regulation provides for the issuing of up to five permissions (from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority) for the collection of live leader prawns in the Mission Beach trawl closure for aquaculture broodstock so that the Australian aquaculture industry is not impacted by the proposed trawl closure.
Consultation
There has been extensive consultation on the proposed trawl closure at a local level.
A trawl closure was recommended by the two, local, community-based groups established by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to advise it on local marine issues. These LMACs are representative of their local communities and typically comprise commercial fishing interests, recreational fishing interests, charter boat/fishing guides, recreational boating/yachting interests, conservation interests, Aboriginal interests, tourism interests, local government authorities, progress associations, local user groups involved in the management of natural resources and others who can demonstrate a separate significant stakeholder interest in marine resource matters in the region. Representatives of the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency (including the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service) and Queensland Department of Primary Industries also attend meetings of these committees.
The proposed trawl closure was discussed at Queensland's Trawl Management Advisory Committee (established to provide advice to the Queensland Fisheries Service on the management of Queensland's trawl fisheries) and at the GBRMPA's Fisheries Reef Advisory Committee (established to provide advice to the Authority on fisheries issues, particularly in relation to auditing fisheries in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development).
The proposed trawl closure was discussed with local trawler operators at a meeting in Innisfail, at which fishing industry representatives from Cairns and Townsville also were present, and at a meeting between the GBRMPA, LMAC representatives, fishing industry representatives and the local State Member of Parliament.
Before the decision on the extent of the proposed trawl closure was finalised, extensive discussions were held between the GBRMPA, the Queensland Seafood Industry Association and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. 
In summary, the local communities in the Mission Beach area support a trawl closure, as do recreational fishers, the tourism industry and conservation groups. Commercial fishers are concerned about any loss of access to local trawl grounds.
Conclusion and adopted option
To help safeguard the natural resources of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area and, at the same time, reduce the adverse impacts on the recreational amenity in a prime tourism area, the on-going and extensive fish kills in the Mission Beach area caused by trawlers operating in shallow, inshore waters must be prevented.
It is recommended that trawling be prohibited in the shallow, inshore waters off Mission Beach.
Given the high mobility of the Queensland East Coast trawl fleet, those trawler operators who historically have targeted banana prawns in the shallow inshore waters off Mission Beach and who will be directly impacted by the adopted option will still be able to target banana prawns in most of Rockingham Bay immediately to the south of the proposed closure and continue to operate in other parts of the trawl fishery.
Implementation and review
The proposed Regulation will be introduced under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975.
Any fines imposed as a result of the proposed Regulations will be by a court of competent jurisdiction. A person against whom a fine is imposed will be able to appeal if the requirements of the relevant court are satisfied.
As agreed at the 28th Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority will audit the performance of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery on an annual basis to determine if it achieves its objective of ecological sustainability within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area. In carrying out the audit, the Authority will apply the National Fisheries Assessment Guidelines developed by Environment Australia. The proposed regulation will be reviewed as part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's audit of the trawl fishery.
The impact of the proposed trawl closure will be monitored closely. If extensions to the closure are needed to avoid on-going problems of fish kills, then extensions to the proposed closure will be considered.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Environment: Mission Beach</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,24,1,answer
