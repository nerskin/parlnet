"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—I wish to foreshadow that I have some further amendments to the consequential amendments bill that is in hand and will be circulating those during the morning. I just want to alert the chamber to that. I will explain the amendments when they come forward.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-09-17,"—This debate gives me a great opportunity to talk about superannuation. The involvement that I have had with superannuation goes back some time now. In fact, my involvement goes back to the time when we first introduced superannuation into the system. At that time I was an industrial advocate and I took great pleasure in being able to move many awards so that they included superannuation for the first time. This gives me a wonderful opportunity to be able to apprise the chamber of that and reflect upon where we now are in respect of superannuation. It is a position we have come an exceedingly long way on, mostly without the help of the coalition. In fact the coalition have had difficulty accepting superannuation and moving it forward; the Labor Party on the other hand have been able to be progressive and forward thinking in respect of superannuation. Not only that, the Labor Party have demonstrated their ability to move the debate forward—as I am sure Senator Sherry will be able to do shortly. The Greens have been able to assist where necessary and the Democrats have been tardy in some respects.
On a more serious note, superannuation has, since its inception by the Hawke-Keating government, been able to provide a change in circumstances. I can recall an arrangement in Mount Isa—and I suspect the coalition would have supported this type of arrangement—where the company had company schemes and they had gone on what was called a `contribution holiday'. They did this because the work force structure was such that workers went to Mount Isa for short to medium terms. They earned significant incomes during their early productive years but towards their later productive years they left Mount Isa, and the superannuation structure that was in place for many workers in that era meant that they did not accumulate any funds. They had to stay with the company for 20, 30 or 35 years and then their superannuation was calculated as multiples of their final retirement income—as was often the case with company schemes at the time. That meant that, although miners and the like might have earned significant incomes during their early productive years, later on in life when they were doing less physical tasks their incomes dropped and as a consequence their final average salaries were less and they received significantly less superannuation. In fact, they found that the payouts after 20 or 30 years of work were in the region of $30,000, which was not a significant amount of money even in those days. 
With industry funds, the Labor Party have been able to expand the horizon of many workers to ensure that they have accumulation funds. Many companies—and I am sure Senator Coonan would have been on our side in this fight—held on to company funds. They did not want to move to industry funds, they did not want to look at better ways to ensure that workers' superannuation entitlements were protected and they did not want to ensure that the issue was pursued in at least a progressive and fair way. We found that it took significant industrial pressure to move companies away from the industry funds. Why did they not want to move? It was because the payments made into the funds and the actuarial advice on what they had to pay out in the future meant that many of them had gone on what was called a `contribution holiday'—that is, they no longer had to pay any moneys into the superannuation fund during that period. That was because the actuarial advice had built the fund up to a level so that they could then sustain a payout—given the likelihood of an existing worker who had reached the age of 65 within 25 or 30 years in the work force retiring—of what was in those days the significantly low amount of $30,000. On today's advice, it probably would not have shifted much either.
It took a significant amount of pressure for those companies to come to grips with the fact that they had to change their ways and move forward. In fact, some of them did not really want to shift so they opened up separate accumulation accounts under the award for three per cent occupational super and continued with their company funds because of the savings that they had accumulated through not being able to pay a contribution.
What disturbed me most yesterday was that Senator Coonan talked consistently about union funds in her answers during question time. That is the difference: they are not union funds, they are industry funds. I have painted this little picture to explain what existed before. These company funds were usually only for the elite in management and they were significantly better than what the workers otherwise got. But where companies were pressured industrially to have superannuation funds, they did exactly that: they had small funds and payouts at the end, and they structured them so that they could have contribution holidays and did not have to pay into them. It was not until Labor moved the debate to ensure that we had industry and accumulation funds that we then had boards taking an interest in ensuring that there was growth, that there was a return and that the administration fees were lower. We were able to move the debate and allow workers to realise significant gains.
What we are dealing with here today are the amendments to the superannuation surcharge and the superannuation government co-contribution. You wonder whether the government have learnt anything during that whole period, whether they simply want to drag the debate back or whether they feel more comfortable giving big business those types of funds again. I will not take up too much of the chamber's time. Given that I have been able to make the point that I had wanted to make yesterday, I will leave it there.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-17,"—I rise to support the government's amendments and to acknowledge Senator Ludwig's contribution, which obviously filled a small bit of our time there for us. I want to note that these amendments being discussed with the Democrats do significantly expand the number of people who are eligible for the co-contribution. Under the government's original proposal, 1.7 million Australians were eligible for the full $1,000 co-contribution and up to 3.5 million Australians were eligible for a full or partial co-contribution. Under the amendments that we are now discussing, an extra one million people get access to the full contribution, taking it up to 2.7 million people; and 4.6 million people are now eligible for a full or part contribution. That is almost 60 per cent of the work force. 
I was surprised by the contributions from Senator Sherry and Senator Wong yesterday indicating that this is somehow inadequate because of the fact that it does not pick up all the other low- and middle-income earners. But I reiterate that, from the Democrats' point of view, when there are limited funds available, which is what we are dealing with in this situation, and you are trying to determine the best way of allocating those funds, I will always be unashamed in seeking to ensure that the benefit goes to the most deserving—that is, the lowest income people in Australia. I would much prefer, and I am quite happy to defend, that the 60 per cent of Australians who are in the lowest income brackets—up to $40,000—are the beneficiaries of the amendments that we are talking about today.
I was trying to work out in my head why the Labor Party has been so emphatic about defending the people earning more than $40,000 a year. To try to make sense of this, I pulled out from the library an interesting statistic on trade union membership by income level. It is worth noting for the chamber that, at the under $20,000 level, 12½ per cent of people are union members; at $20,000 to $40,000, that rises to 24 per cent; at $40,000 to $60,000, it rises to 35 per cent; and at $60,000 to $80,000 it is 33 per cent. Obviously the great mistake the Democrats have made with this agreement in dealing with and looking after low-income workers is that we have forgotten to look after union workers. That is probably the reason why the Labor Party has been so emphatic in saying that we have somehow let down workers by concentrating on low-income workers.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—At the present time, we are discussing in committee the proposal to deliver an exclusive tax cut to high-income earners. That is the issue we are discussing at the moment, albeit I accept that, because two bills have been packaged together by the government and there is to be a debate in committee on the low-income earners' co-contribution, it is fair enough for Senator Cherry to cross over, to draw a comparison between the two elements in the package.
I just want to make a fundamental point from the Labor Party's point of view. We have an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners, those earning more than approximately $94,000. The high-income earners earning more than that all get a tax cut. They are guaranteed a tax cut. They do not have to do anything. They do not have to put any extra money into super; they get the tax cut. They all get it. It is a guaranteed tax cut for high-income earners which logically leads to a higher retirement income—it must—for that group of people.
I contrast that with the other element of the package that Senator Cherry has just been referring to. He is right when he says that, although we do not have the numbers and the estimates from the government yet—and we will be testing that in more detail when we get to that point in the committee—2.7 million Australians get access to— 
—They are eligible for access.
—They are eligible for access, that is right. There is no guaranteed benefit for all of those 2.7 million people. The problem is that, of those 2.7 million people, we know, because the government has to provide costing estimates, that only a small proportion will actually be able to put the $1,000 in to obtain the maximum benefit. They have access to it but they have to have the income to obtain the access.
Of these 2.7 million low-income earners to which you refer, I suspect that about one in 10, if that, will put in a full $1,000. We know that there is not a significant proportion of those 2.7 million people who have a spare $1,000 to put into super. They do not have the money because their disposable income is so low and they are having to pay off a mortgage, pay the rent and pay increased education and health costs. In the considerable majority of cases, their household budgets are totally taken up with meeting day-to-day living expenses. They do not have a spare $1,000.
I am sure that the situation is much worse for joint income, low-income households. Let us look at a joint income, low-income household where both the male and female are working, one with an income of $20,000 and the other with an income of $30,000. They have a joint income of $50,000. I do not think there is a lot of spare income for those people to find $1,000 a year each to put into super to get the $1,000. Nevertheless, Labor supports that initiative because it is an advance. It is a help for some people. But let us not pretend or give the impression that, when the bill is passed and gazetted, 2.7 million Australians at this low-income level will all dash out, put $1,000 into super and get a $1,000 matching contribution. They are not going to do it because they do not have the income to do it.
Labor's concern with this so-called package from the deal the Democrats have struck with the government is that there is a guaranteed tax reduction for high-income earners. High-income earners are guaranteed the tax cut. Low-income earners get something, but only if they can find up to $1,000 to put into super. We know that it will not be a significant proportion of those people. The low-income earners' co-contribution is a pale imitation of Labor's proposal of seven years ago to have a three per cent government contribution for everyone. It was not dependent on capacity to pay. The Labor government funding in the forward estimates, which the Liberal government abandoned, allowed three per cent for everyone, paid by the government. That is the contrast in this package which concerns us.
The government, for obvious tactical reasons, have joined these two measures together. We know why they want to deliver an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners. A substantial number of high-income earners are Liberal Party members who have been complaining about the surcharge tax that the Liberal Party introduced back in 1996. We know that; I hear from them. The Liberal Party are delivering to their constituency of high-income earners who earn more than $94,000 a guaranteed benefit. That is what we are discussing in this committee stage. Low-income earners, if they can find $1,000, which we know many of them cannot, will get another $1,000. It is not a balanced package in that sense. There is a guaranteed tax cut for high-income earners earning more than $94,000 and a much more limited proposal, in the level of take-up, for low-income earners. And, as I have said, there is nothing for middle-income Australia—those earning between $40,000 and $94,000. There is not a cent for individuals in that income range. 
Labor have consistently argued—and we put forward this positive alternative—that all Australians require a tax reduction on both their compulsory and their voluntary superannuation. All Australians require it, not just some Australians—not just high-income earners. And more than 2½ million middle-income Australians miss out from this package. That is just another glaring example of government priority.
They are the sorts of contrasts I draw attention to in the committee stage of debate on this bill. I have concluded my remarks, subject to having to respond to others on the government's amendments in committee. However, I would like an update on the questions that I posed in the committee stage yesterday. I posed quite a range of questions about costing assumptions, take-up rates et cetera. If the minister has further information that has been obtained since that debate concluded, it would be useful if that could be added. Then Labor is happy to move on to its amendment in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—While the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer is getting that information for Senator Sherry, I ask: has the minister already given the committee the information on the average advantage of this package to people earning over $114,987 a year—and I think she told us there were some 315,000 of those—and to the 235,000 people earning more than $94,000 a year?",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-17,"—I want to first address some comments in response to Senator Sherry's remarks about the package. I think most of the issues raised have already been talked about at some length; however, I do think it is important to reiterate the objective of the package, because there appears to be some confusion and a very simplistic analysis of the impact of the package because it is being applied in the wrong way. First and foremost, the way in which the agreement between the Democrats and the government works is to provide benefits to those on low incomes. That is what the package is designed to do. It is not designed across the board; it is designed basically to replace a low-income rebate and to provide a much more generous package to a class of people at certain income levels who could be regarded and who are regarded as low-income earners. So the package is not being set up to do what Senator Sherry contended or criticised.
The package is designed to focus on low-income earners and to do so in a way where the benefits will flow to low-income earners, as opposed to their having to apply for the rebate; it is on a scale that is much more generous; and it is specifically targeted to help those who otherwise might not have any incentive to save at all to actually have an incentive to save. It is a tapered rate, and it is obviously acknowledged that there needs to be greater encouragement for those with lower incomes. As I said yesterday, it is patronising in the extreme to confine low-income earners to the scrapheap of the savings culture and to assume that they are not worth an incentive; that they are not going to take it up, that they are not interested in their future and that they should not be given any opportunity to make extra savings if they wish to and if they are able to. That is what the package is actually designed to do, and it muddies the waters completely if you try to make it do something that it is not designed to do.
The other part of the package is equally clear, and that is to remove some of the disincentives on those who are able to put away more for their retirement. This is acknowledged and superannuation works this way: the more money and disposable income you have, the more you may have to make voluntary contributions. That is hardly surprising. It is important that those who do have more disposable income to make voluntary savings do so. The reason it is important that they do so and that we remove some of the disincentives to them doing so—and we know that that has in fact operated over the last couple of years—is that it will take more pressure off the pension system for the very people who are unfortunately down the bottom of the income scale and are going to need to have their retirement supplemented by the pension, if not exclusively provided by the pension. So it makes a lot of sense to the government to remove some of the disincentives for those who do have more disposable income to make voluntary contributions because it helps the very people that the major part of this package is aimed at, without assuming that they should not have the sort of incentive that this package puts together. 
As Senator Cherry has said quite accurately, there are about half a million people who will receive the co-contribution—540,000 is the estimate—in the 2004-05 budget year. If you consider that it is not targeted at the whole population, it is a pretty significant figure of those in the low-income range who ought to be able to benefit from it. The important thing also to bear in mind, given that this package is not designed across the board but designed to help a specific income range, is that there are other elements of the government's superannuation package available to other people. I will provide a few examples, but I do not intend it to be an exclusive list. The measure for splitting superannuation contributions that is about to come into this place will assist people right across the superannuation spectrum. Other measures are the continuing superannuation contributions to age 75 and the increase in the fully deductible amount for self-employed. And, of course, choice of superannuation fund and portability will provide some real assistance to those who wish to move from a fund where they are trapped, perhaps a non-performing fund, to one where they can make some choice about where they want to put their money.
The thing that will most help the retirement system is to connect people to their money so that they have some control over it and some connection with it. The current system, where there is very little flexibility in choice of superannuation fund, has taken its toll over time. We have $7 billion of people's superannuation money washing around in the system, the owners of which cannot be located because they do not know that they own it; they do not know where their accounts are. That is an absolute disgrace. If people do not have any control over their money, if they do not know where it goes or where it is deposited—and they would have no control over it even if they did know where it was—they tend to lose connection with their money. That $7 billion is a stark figure. 
We need to move some of these superannuation issues along. It is a tired old argument to say that people cannot have choice or portability. In the year 2003 people want to have some control over where their savings go; they take an interest in their retirement savings. That is exactly what the government wants. There is a need for further education, and $14 million has been allocated to commence an education campaign to connect people with their money and inform them about the system. It is absolutely critical. I would not want to see this debate get sidetracked by trying to get this package of bills to do something it is not designed to do. The legislation is part of a whole package that this government has put forward to make superannuation more attractive and more available to a range of people.  
Yesterday I dealt with a number of questions, as the debate unfolded, that were asked by Senator Sherry—at least where information was available. I will return to Senator Brown's specific question, which concerned the average advantage to taxpayers earning over $114,981. The impact on individuals will vary according to their level of surchargable contributions, and not their income. When fully implemented, the benefit will be a reduction in the level of surcharge payable from a maximum of 15 per cent to 12.5 per cent. That way the benefit can be worked out, Senator Brown. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—What is the figure, Minister? 
—You can work it out. 
—No—you are here to give us the information. 
 (Senator Chapman)—Order! Senator Sherry, address your remarks through the chair. 
—Chair, we are here to seek information from the minister—which she knows she has—which is critical to the consideration of this legislation. I think even Senator Cherry would concede this point. Give us the information, Minister—through you, Chair. Give us the average benefit for high-income earners. In the committee stage of the legislation that we are discussing, give us the figure. You are obviously very embarrassed because you are hiding the figure. It is quite legitimate of Senator Brown and me to press this point. We want to know the figure. You have to know the figure because you have worked out estimates of the revenue cost of these provisions. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-17,"—Perhaps I can shed some light on this matter. It will depend on the individual circumstances of each particular surchargable taxpayer. As you know, Senator Sherry, the amount of surchargable income to which the surcharge applies is not just income; it includes fringe benefits tax and the termination benefits of those poor unfortunates who lose their jobs. So a lot of middle-income earners who have lost their jobs suddenly become subject to the surchargable arrangements.
Senator Sherry appears to be asking the impossible. How do we know how many middle-income earners are going to be subject to the surcharge simply because they have lost their jobs during the year? What I do know, Senator Sherry, is that the impact on the so-called high-income earners to whom you continually refer will be minimal. For example, a person on a $110,000 surchargable income—which is more than income, as I have explained—will get a benefit in the first year of about $150. What is becoming apparent, Senator Sherry, is that your mathematics are at fault. You have created a black hole by saying that you can substitute—
—Order! Senator Watson, could you address your remarks through the chair, please. 
—You are saying that you can reduce the benefit to all people who are subject to the up-front 15 per cent contributions tax as a result of a reduction in the surcharge. There is a big black hole there, Senator Sherry. I know from your laugh—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—that you recognise the error of your ways. As elementary mathematics, it just does not square up. I have given you the typical case of a wage earner on $110,000 because the figures will vary. You have put up an amendment in this place. You need to advise the Senate of the extent of the black hole. We all know you are wrong, so do not throw allegations at the minister, wanting information, where the information is going to be subject to individual circumstances and very difficult to quantify. The cap has to be put on your head because the black hole rests with you, not with the coalition.  ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—We are starting to open up this debate way beyond the immediate issues we are trying to consider here but, Chair, you have let the debate go, and I have to respond to the committee stage challenges posed by Senator Coonan and Senator Watson. As I have reiterated, the minister's advisers must know the average level of benefit as a result of the surcharge tax contribution over the four years for people earning $116,000 or more because they have provided a costing of this tax reduction. Within that costing, it is quite easy for the government advisers to work out the average benefit in money terms for these high-income earners. Give us the figure. The government want to hide the figure because they do not want it known just what level of benefit goes exclusively to high-income earners.
Senator Watson has challenged my and the Labor Party's position that we should be reducing the contributions tax for everyone. Our leader, Mr Crean, in his two previous budget replies has argued that the contributions tax should be reduced modestly from 15 per cent to 13 per cent. It is funded in two ways, Senator Watson. The first element of the funding is not to have an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners.
—So you are going to reverse this, are you? You are going to put up the surcharge. The Labor Party are going to put up taxes.
—No, we will not be doing that, Senator Coonan. It is only you who have increased the tax rates on superannuation. I draw this to the attention of the chamber: since the election of a Liberal government the revenue from the contributions taxes, both the surcharge and the 15 per cent contributions tax, has increased. In the 1996 financial year they collected approximately $1.56 billion. It is now well over $5 billion. It is the most significant increase in revenue for a Liberal government.
—That might have something to do with more jobs, mightn't it?
—It has nothing to do with that, Senator Coonan. To come back to the challenge posed by Senator Watson, the second element of Labor's position on the funding of the tax reduction, the 15 per cent to 13 per cent, is that we will not be scrapping public sector superannuation and adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the cash balance on the budget.
—Now you are going to hop into the public servants.
—You are hopping into the public servants; the Liberal Party is proposing to shut down the schemes in a very expensive way. We have not had that bill before the parliament yet. Senator Coonan has, in the committee stage, gone into so-called choice and portability. They are debates for another day, but I make the point for the record and for those people listening that the Labor Party support safe choice and safe portability. We want to see simple, clear, comparable disclosure of all fees, charges and commissions. We do not have that in Australia yet. I go even further: Labor intend to ban exit fees, which are barriers to choice and portability. The Liberal government says, `People can have choice and portability,' but we know there are significant exit fees of thousands of dollars on many superannuation funds that prevent people having that. So you have to ban exit fees.
Thirdly, Labor propose to go even further. We propose to ban commissions on compulsory superannuation nine per cent guarantee products. We have proposed that because commissions, which reward some planners, warp advice to products where commission is payable, which is not necessarily in the interests of the fund member. We will deal with the issue of portability in the consideration of the regulations coming up soon. 
Labor's proposal to resolve the problem of the 25 million scattered accounts—many of the nine million fund members not knowing how many accounts they have—is for automatic portability, automatic transfer using the tax file number. This is the Swiss system. Switzerland is not exactly known as the centre of the communist socialist states. In Switzerland there is compulsory rollover from one fund into your last active or inactive account. Labor propose that these moneys will be tracked down by the tax office and transferred over into a fund member's account automatically. And they will have the right to say, `No, I do not want the money transferred.' If they say, `I don't want the money transferred,' then it will not happen. 
—How will they know about it?
—They will be informed by the tax office, Senator Coonan. This government has no solutions. The number of accounts keeps growing and growing and growing. The government does not recognise the structural failure in the system and it says that individuals will do it. But they are not doing it at the present time and in most cases, as Senator Coonan is well aware, people could consolidate the millions of lost accounts. They could move them together into one account subject to exit fees.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order on relevance. It is interesting hearing about the ALP's policy but it is not really relevant to the bill we are dealing with. I would like to get on and actually debate the bill we are dealing with at this stage.
 (Senator Chapman)—I do believe the debate is straying from the subject matter of the bill itself and, more specifically, from the amendments that are under debate. I ask Senator Sherry to bring himself back to the matters under discussion rather than ranging far and wide on opposition policy.
—Yes, I respect your ruling, Chair. Senator Coonan opened up this area of debate.
—One line!
—Come off it; it was not one line. Senator Coonan started going into choice and portability. She raised the issues and it is quite legitimate of me to respond to her initiating that and opening up the debate. I have made the comments I wish to make on that area.
Senator Coonan has just disclosed to the committee that there will be 540,000—that is, the estimated take-up of the low-income earner co-contribution—out of 4.6 million low- to middle-income earners, depending on how you define low- to middle-income. What we now know is that four million low- to middle-income earners will get nothing—not a cent—and we know that 2½ million people whose incomes range between $40,000 and $95,000 will get nothing. So six million people will not get one cent from this package, compared with the issues we are debating in committee—an exclusive tax cut for all the high-income earners, all those earning more than $94,000.
—How many of them are there?
—Approximately 550,000. So half a million—550,000—high-income earners will get a tax cut. At the other end of the scale, at the low-income end of the scale, about the same number of people—540,000 low-income earners earning up to $40,000—will get $1,000 or part thereof, and six million people will get absolutely nothing from this package. That is this government's approach; it is not the Labor Party's approach. 
I am keen to conclude this debate on the costings, and I wonder whether the minister has any further information on the questions that I posed yesterday, particularly this very important issue that Senator Brown has raised this morning about the average level of benefit going to those high-income earners on the highest tax rate who are on incomes of more than $115,000. Labor would certainly strongly support Senator Brown in the request for that information.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-17,"—This has been a very interesting debate, but it has strayed a bit a times. But some things have emerged in this debate, particularly the dictatorial attitude of the ALP, and in particular Senator Sherry, in relation to superannuation. I think there will be a lot of horrified people out there if they have the opportunity of hearing some of the remarks that Senator Sherry has made here today.
—A tax cut.
—Absolutely. Banning exit fees—
—Yes, banning exit fees.
—Didn't you just sign on to a report which talked about administrative costs plus the costs of exiting? For example, if you have a property that has to be disposed of, isn't it reasonable that those costs be passed onto the person, if in a master trust, exiting that particular investment? Those sorts of costs of exit are not really regarded as exit fees, because they are the cost of getting out of a particular product that rightly belongs to particular individuals.
I thought the Labor Party stood for tax justice for everybody. Now here we have a situation where, on the basis of throughput analysis, people who are subject to the surcharge have a tax rate on superannuation savings in the order of 45 to 64 per cent. Given that these same taxpayers on ordinary income have a top tax rate of something like 48 per cent, it seems rather strange that we are allowing a situation to continue where we have these penal tax rates applying to superannuation savings in one sector of the public—high-income earners. I thought that in this country we are all about providing concessional treatment for people to encourage them to put money into retirement incomes, or their retirement savings plans. But we have to move away, albeit gradually, as the minister has put forward. What is surprising is that Senator Sherry said today, `We'll disagree with you this time but, when we believe the ALP has money available, we'll ban the whole lot.' So you are looking at eliminating the whole lot, which means getting rid of the surcharge that currently raises something like $900 million. Isn't it more responsible to progressively cut out the surcharge over time so that it can be accommodated within normal budget outlays and revenues et cetera rather than take it as a one-off amount?
We have now heard one U-turn in your attitude. You have indicated that your leader is in favour of getting rid of it. Is he going to do it in one go, which is the message you sent? I would be very pleased if you would deny that today, because in the heat of battle sometimes the truth comes out. There is a need for the Labor Party's position on the surcharge to be articulated very clearly before this debate proceeds further.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I have a couple of comments on the contribution just made by Senator Watson. He claimed that we have a dictatorial attitude because we want to ban exit fees. Senator Sherry has made it quite clear that the Labor Party's position, as we signed off on in the recent report, is that we should ban exit fees because they are a barrier to portability, but we say that they should be replaced with an administrative charge associated with a reasonable administrative and rollover cost of a transfer out. That is what the Labor Party set out in the report. We do want to ban exit fees, which is a grand sight better than the government's position. 
I note that the minister still has not indicated a clear policy in relation to exit fees other than that the market will sort it out. An example was put to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer in question time yesterday of fees of over $5,000 being levied against an account with a little over $5,000—in other words, almost all the funds transferred would be eaten up by exit fees. These are the sorts of examples that this government is failing to address in its policy. One wonders how many hard-earned savings of Australians will be eaten up through unreasonable exit fees, with the government waiting for the market to supposedly sort it out.
Senator Watson accuses us of not being interested in tax justice. I would have thought it was quite clear that we do not think a guaranteed income tax reduction for high-income earners, as opposed to a take-up by some 540,000 low-income earners, is a reasonable balance. We simply say that, if you are going to have a tax cut, it should be directed at low- and middle-income Australians rather than people earning over $114,000 a year. I am still waiting for the minister, if she is able to do so, to provide us with some indication of what sort of monetary value these tax cuts will have for high-income Australians.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—I am finding this debate very interesting because it means that there are major changes coming down the line. Whether there is a Howard government after the next election or a Crean government, there is an interesting divergence in points of view. The legislation before us, however, and the information that we have from the government point to the fact that there are 540,000 low-income earners, which is about one in nine, who might get an advantage from this government prescription. But there are 540,000 very wealthy people on over $94,000 a year who will all get an advantage unspecified by the minister.
—It is about $150.
—It is less than that.
—The figures vary there. The interesting thing about Senator Watson saying it is $150 per wealthy person and Senator Cherry saying that it is less than that is that the minister is not giving us the figure anyway. If it is such a small amount, one has to wonder how the government calculates it—$3 a week is going to make a big difference. I can tell you that it does at the other end of the scale; it makes a very big difference. That is the problem here. There is an enormous social inequity in this package.
—By giving it to low-income people?
—It is only one in nine low-income people. Senator Cherry says all low-income earners are eligible. That reminds me of a famous saying. I think it was the Mayor of Paris who said, `Everybody has a right to sleep under the bridges, but some take it up and some don't.' There is the view that it is there and if people do not take it up, it is their fault. But those with that view fail, Senator Cherry, to understand that poor people cannot just find $1,000 to take advantage of this prescription. If you extrapolate to the rich people who are advantaged, including every one of us in this place, then we would have to raise $10,000 to get some advantage here. That would make us think, wouldn't it? You would require $10,000 to get an advantage from this scheme. That is what you are saying to the people on low incomes on a pro rata basis. It is even more skewed than that because when you are on that low income it is all taken up through rent, housing costs, food costs, transport costs—the costs of simply raising families and living. To say, `If you can find $1,000, you will get the advantage,' is cruel to low-income earners. It means that those who cannot find it are being taunted by the $1,000 incentive through this government and Democrat package. Senator Cherry can laugh but eight out of nine people, on the government figures, will not be able to— 
—It is a patronising speech.
—It is a direct social analysis. You can get up and respond to it, but that is what it is. Eight out of nine people on low incomes will not be able to take advantage of this. That is cruel. It is winner takes all here. Either you sign up to the inducement from the government and the Democrats or you do not. Eight out of nine people, on the figures the minister has given us, simply will not be able to. That is what is unfair about it.
—How do you know?
—I am taking the figures from your minister; that is how I know. Senator Cherry does not think it is 540,000, so the government and the Democrats are now having a disagreement about the impact of this package. They should have sorted that out when they were coming to an agreement on it. It is inequitable and Labor is right: the package should have been spread across all the people who need it. Clearly, the government has been able to get the Democrats aboard by offering an advantage that may go to one in nine poor people, while giving all the rich, without exception—nine out of nine—the advantage coming out of this package. It is designed to be socially inequitable and when, or if, it goes through that social inequity will come into play. I think it is very tough on the poor people who are then going to have to decide whether—
—You would deny it to those 540,000 who do want to save then.
—Oh dear! Let me say everybody wants to save. You say I am patronising, Senator Cherry, but what about that comment as far as the eight out of nine who cannot get into this scheme are concerned? Are you saying that they do not want to save? Is that not patronising? Is that a failure to understand the circumstances that they are in? This is the problem with this package. That is why, when we get to it, I will be supporting the direction that Labor is taking on this over the direction that the government and the Democrats have put forward.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-17,"—I was hoping that the minister would speak before I did, because I am waiting for the figures, as everyone is, on how many people pay surcharge, but I do want to respond to a few things in the debate so far. I do believe that the contribution we have just heard from Senator Brown was very patronising to low-income people. The notion of this package is that, if people are prepared to save, the government will double the contribution if they are earning less than $27,500 and will provide them with incentives up to $40,000. That is 60 per cent of the work force. Someone on $35,000 will get $400 from the government and someone on $30,000 a year will get $800 from the government. I expect the pick-up rate will be higher in the $30,000 range and the higher $20,000 range. As I said in my speech earlier, the people I expect to pick up this particular incentive will be older workers who are starting to save for retirement—those over 40, when they have a bit of spare cash hanging around— 
—Do they?
—They do—once the kids have left and they have got them off their hands. The other group I expect to pick this up will be part-time workers who are returning to the work force after having children—people like that. They are the sorts of categories I expect will be actually targeting this measure. The government has estimated that 540,000 people will pick up this measure based on the current pick-up rate of the 10 per cent superannuation rebate for low-income people. The Senate committee received excellent evidence from Dr Vince FitzGerald from Allens Consulting, suggesting that the pick-up rate will be much higher. He suggested, based on some detailed survey work of people in this category, that the pick-up rate could be as much as 50 per cent higher than that estimated by the government. That is 800,000 people who will be picking it up on that basis.
I accept that the vast majority of low-income people will not pick it up, but I think you should encourage and reward thrift; you should encourage and promote a savings culture. This country has a zero per cent savings rate, according to the most recent OECD statistics. Why don't we encourage people to save? The ALP's alternative to encourage people to save is to give everybody a tax cut of two per cent, regardless of whether they are saving or not. The vast bulk of that would be a tax cut on the compulsory superannuation they are forced to save as a result of the SG. Will that actually increase national savings? I doubt it very much. The vast bulk of that will be dead weight loss to the economy, because you would reward savings people have to make anyway under current law.
I would also point out that this measure targets two groups: we are encouraging 60 per cent of workers to save more through their co-contribution and we are rewarding those prepared to save more. That will directly affect savings behaviour. We are actually encouraging high-income people to save more, too. As Senator Sherry pointed out yesterday, voluntary contributions of superannuation in this country fell by $3.8 billion last year. That was a response to two things: one was the low returns in super funds last year, the worst returns in 28 years; the other was the enormous returns to be gained out of the property market, which attracted money. If we can encourage high-income people to start putting money back into super, we would actually be doing the country a favour. That is something that is worth noting.
The other thing I note for the record, and just in case people have forgotten, is that in 1997, when the government introduced the surcharge, Labor opposed it. Labor voted against it and Senator Sherry was on this side voting against it. The Democrats were over there voting for it, because we thought it was an equity measure. We thought it was a fair and reasonable approach at the time. We had said to Labor for the last nine years they were in government that they needed to put increased taxes on high-income earners, but they never did. They actually ensured that high-income people had a 33 per cent tax break on their superannuation compared with a tax break of only about five per cent for people on lowest incomes. 
I will not accept any speeches from Senator Sherry today on the Labor Party's approach to equity for high-income people, because Labor's record is flawed. Not only did they oppose the surcharge in 1997 but they also introduced dividend imputation back in 1986—the biggest single tax cut high-income people in this country ever got out of the Hawke-Keating government. They also reintroduced negative gearing in 1991, the second biggest tax cut that high-income people ever got, and in this place in 1998 they supported a halving of the capital gains tax, an $800 million tax benefit to high-income earners. So I will not accept speeches from the Labor Party about how, all of a sudden, this particular measure is actually going to provide a benefit to high-income people when their record has been consistently to support very big tax cuts, inappropriate tax cuts, for high-income people over a long period of time. I would also point out that the Labor Party have consistently opposed the Democrats' view that the private health insurance rebate should be means tested, and I look forward to seeing their policy on that one. Again, it is a benefit of around $1 billion a year to high-income households. So I will not accept being lectured to. 
One thing I would like to point out with this particular measure is that the benefit to high-income people in this next financial year is $25 million, while the benefit to low-income people is $230 million. You would think from the speeches we have just heard that the benefit is going to go to high-income people by some enormous percentage, but 90 per cent of the benefit in the next year is going to go to low-income people. Over the next four years, 66 per cent of the benefit under this package will go to low-income people. More importantly, if the take-up rate ends up being higher—closer to the figures that Vince FitzGerald estimated rather than to the figures that Treasury estimated—that percentage will be even higher, probably around 75 per cent. You would think, having listened to Labor and the Greens, that we are providing some huge concession to high-income people. I would like to take the committee through a couple of very quick back-of-the-envelope calculations.
—They're dangerous.
—I love back-of-the-envelope calculations. This is an easy one—even Senator Sherry will understand this one, because it is an easy one. Assuming a high-income earner puts $10,000 into super a year—that is pretty reasonable; 10 per cent of their income of $100,000—the benefit they get from the surcharge cut this year will be $50.
—What is the full impact, though?
—I will get to that in a second. In the second year it is $150; in the third year it is $250. The benefit they will get under the Labor Party's two per cent cut to contributions tax this year would have been $200; next year $200; the year after $200. Let us not forget that Labor is coming here saying, `No tax cuts for high-income people.' They are offering them the same two per cent tax cut as they would offer anybody else. So, from that point of view, I am quite happy to say that, given the Democrats were responsible for the surcharge coming in in 1997 because Labor opposed it, at this point in time, reluctantly, I am prepared to accept a small cut in the surcharge to ensure that we get this package for low-income people and encourage a savings culture in this country. When you have a zero per cent savings rate and a record foreign debt, you have got to start encouraging a savings culture, and that is what this is about.
Before I conclude, I want to read an article out of this morning's Melbourne Age. It was very interesting. It has some figures and, again, I am looking forward to Senator Coonan's response, because I am sure it will be better than mine. In the Melbourne Age this morning there was a story by John Collett. It states, `Reducing the superannuation surcharge will have less impact than you might think,' and goes on to state: 
The research director with Rainmaker Information, Alex Dunnin, says for someone earning $100,000 a year with $50,000 in superannuation, over 10 years the new surcharge rate will increase their benefit by just $2386 ...
Anna Carrabs, a director of William Buck, is quoted as saying, `It is a tiny change that will really make no difference.' The article goes on to say:
Dunnin says the “real” costs of superannuation for high earners, especially as they are likely to have or will have big account balances, are the ongoing fees.
Dunnin says the fees paid inside superannuation, which are usually levied as a percentage of the account balance, will have a much bigger impact on the size of the eventual benefit than small reductions in the contributions tax.
Professor Ian Ramsay, director of the Centre for Corporate Law and Securities Regulation at the University of Melbourne, noted in his report ... that for each 1 per cent of annual fees, over 20 years the final benefit is reduced by 18 per cent.
When we are talking about the surcharge cut, let us remember that we are not talking about a big amount. For someone putting $10,000 a year into superannuation, even after three years when it is fully phased in, we are talking about $250. That is actually less than what someone earning $37,000 or less, who is entitled to the co-contribution, receives, if my maths is right. They are entitled to $250 or more from this package. That is well over half the work force. Certainly from this point of view the Democrats believe that, whilst this package is not perfect—nothing that we produce in this place ever is, because it is done by compromise—it makes a significant equity contribution to encouraging a savings culture, through encouraging people to save both at the bottom end and the top end.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2003-09-17,"—Having listened to the debate for the past hour in the chair, I really want to address some of the red herrings that the Labor senators and Senator Brown have drawn across this debate. The first of those is that low-income people will not benefit from this co-contribution initiative of the government because a lot of them will not be able to afford to put in $1,000 a year. The fact is that they do not have to put in $1,000 a year; they can put in $1 a year and they will get a $1 a year benefit from the government's co-contribution. They can put in $100 or $500. Whatever amount they can afford to put in will be doubled as a result of a contribution made by the government to match that dollar for dollar. That is the first point that needs to be made.
The other red herring that Labor are drawing across this is that this is an initiative that only benefits the rich—the high-income earners who are subject to the surcharge. Of course, the opposition are ignoring that in Australia we have a progressive tax system. Our income tax system is progressive and our system with regard to tax on superannuation contributions is progressive because we have a rate of 15 per cent that applies to most income earners—those earning a grossed up income of up to $94,000 a year, which includes fringe benefits and other income. Those who earn above $94,000 are subject to the surcharge and therefore have a rate in excess of 15 per cent on superannuation contributions—a rate of 30 per cent. So, both our income tax and superannuation contributions tax systems are progressive. Therefore, if you reduce the surcharge, obviously there will be a benefit to high-income earners because they are paying a higher rate of contributions tax.
I think it was Senator Sherry who said that there are 2½ million middle-income earners—those earning between $40,000 and $94,000 a year—who will not get a benefit from this initiative. But they are already getting the benefit of only paying a 15 per cent contributions tax, whereas those earning above $94,000 are paying a 30 per cent contributions tax. This initiative reduces that by 2½ per cent over three years, which, as Senator Cherry said, gives a benefit of some $250 in the third year. That is a very important point to remember—that the great bulk of the Australian community who are making contributions to superannuation are only paying a rate of 15 per cent, whereas there is a group that is paying double that. This particular initiative deals with that. It also deals with low-income earners also having the opportunity to make a contribution. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—To inform those in the gallery, who I hope are enthralled by this debate, and those listening to the broadcast, we are dealing here with a proposal for an exclusive tax cut on superannuation for high-income earners. Those earning more than $94,000 get a tax cut. The millions of Australians earning less than $94,000 get no tax cut—not a cent. That is the important point of principle that we are debating. I will illustrate this. As I consult with people in the superannuation industry about this surcharge tax cut—many of whom are friends of mine, and many of whom I have a good working relationship with—who are overwhelmingly high-income earners who benefit from this measure, they say to me, `Nick, we want this tax cut. We are high-income earners and we want the surcharge tax. Please reduce the rate for us.' I say, `No. That is not what the Labor Party stands for.'
I have gone back to Tasmania and spoken to people in the community who are low-income earners earning up to $40,000. I have said to them, `The Liberal Party is proposing to give you $1,000 if you can find $1,000 to put into super. That is if your income is $27,500 or less.' They have looked at me and said, `That sounds wonderful. There is just one problem, Nick: we don't have $1,000 to put into super because we're paying off the mortgage'—or they are renting—`we're paying increased health costs, paying increased education costs, putting food on the table and bringing up our families. We haven't got $1,000.' That is a contrast that shows the inequity in this proposal.
I want to make this point clear. The 540,000 persons who the government estimates will benefit from this measure, out of 4½ million approximately, are not all going to get $1,000. This is the 540,000 people who are estimated to put some additional money up to $1,000 into super. I do not want the impression abroad that the 540,000 are all going to put $1,000 into super; we know they will not. I will be asking for a breakdown of these estimates when we get to the next stage of the committee debate—when we get to deal with this issue in greater detail.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I want to make some brief comments about the contribution of Senator Cherry. It was an extraordinarily inconsistent contribution, if I may say so, on the one hand trying to have a go at the Labor Party about its previous position in relation to varied issues regarding dividend imputation and capital gains tax—and we can have an argument about the policy issues associated with those—in a vain attempt to try to establish progressive credentials for the Democrats in relation to this bill. From the party that gave us the GST we now have an extraordinary deal where the Democrats are trying to pretend that they have somehow extracted some fantastic concession from the government in relation to low-income earners in return for the guaranteed tax cut. The facts are very simple: if you earn over $94,000, you get a tax cut—without doing anything. If you are a low-income earner in the range of salaries that enables you to get the co-contribution, you might get a government contribution if you can save enough money to put more into your super. 
Senator Cherry says that we should reward thrift—it seems extraordinary to hear something quite so Thatcherite coming out of the Democrats. I think it is extraordinarily patronising to be telling families on $25,000 a year that we want them to save and we will reward their thrift. Thrift for people on those sorts of incomes, Senator Cherry, is a way of life. If they were not thrifty about how they spent their money, they would not be able to house themselves and their children; they would not be able to afford to send their children to school; they would not be able to go to doctors; they would not be able to clothe themselves and their children. We are not talking about people who are profligate in their spending; we are talking about low-income Australians. To try to paint your deal with the government as some victory for low-income Australians is really stretching credulity. What you are saying to the Australian people is: we will give a guaranteed tax cut to high-income earners with a maximum benefit cutting in for those people earning over $114,000 a year and, in return, if the poor people manage to scrimp and save, the government can make a co-contribution. If you were really serious about low-income earners in your negotiations with the government, you would have looked at something that was guaranteed in terms of either tax cuts or additional contributions for low-income Australians.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-17,"—I just want to respond very quickly, because I am a bit confused by Senator Wong's position now. I thought the Labor Party's position was that they wanted a two per cent tax cut to go to everybody—
—What about middle-income earners?
—Exactly. What about middle-income earners? The Labor Party want a two per cent tax cut to go to everybody. Therefore, of the tax cut that we are giving to high-income people for the surcharge, Labor would have given them 80 per cent, I think it is—my maths is failing me this morning; my brain is too tired. So that money goes to high-income people anyway. The Labor Party would transfer most of the money that we are allocating for low-income people to encourage them to save to middle-income people. So I am very confused now about the Labor Party's position, because it seems to be suggesting that they would take a little bit of money—20 per cent of the tax cut off high-income earners—and give it to middle-income earners, a perfectly fine and equitable position, but they would also take money from the low-income co-contribution and give it to middle-income earners. That confuses me from an equity point of view.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-17,"—The debate has ranged over a wide spectrum of issues and has strayed a bit off the point, so in my response I am going to confine myself to the issues that relate to the bills before us. I think it is very important, however, to state again—as I did earlier today—that what we are looking at with the design of this legislation is not to have the cuts across the board but to target low-income earners with a view to replacing an existing provision, the low-income rebate, with a much more generous and better targeted assistance for low-income earners. Taken as a package—and, indeed, I think these bills should always have been considered as part of a package—the money available is weighted significantly in favour of low-income earners. I will just put the figures on the record.
The co-contribution payments are now estimated to total $920 million over the four years from 2004-05 to 2007-08, and the surcharge rate reduction on the other hand is now estimated to cost a total of $475 million over the four years from 2004-05 to 2007-08. As Senator Cherry says—and he is absolutely correct about this—we are talking about a weighting significantly in favour of the co-contribution and the benefit going to low-income earners. That is a fact. They are the figures and I think they are absolutely irrefutable. 
There has been some confusion, I think, about the need to put in $1,000 in order to get any benefit at all. That is an erroneous concept and I need to correct that. We have already made it quite clear that the co-contribution is designed to replace a low-income rebate and that any contribution of any amount can attract a co-contribution. It is a bit disingenuous to say that people have to find $1,000 in order to get a contribution. In fact I think it is important that I also mention how advantageous $20 a week could be by providing a few estimates—and these are obviously pretty conservative estimates.
If somebody earning $20,000 this year were to put in $20 a week and receive the superannuation guarantee from an employer and also were to make an additional personal contribution of $20 a week during a 30-year working life, the contributions would be matched with the government co-contribution of $1,000 in each of those years of a person's working life. On retirement, they would have a superannuation account balance of $389,769. This is $89,561 more than that person would have had without the government co-contribution. That is an improvement of 30 per cent. Obviously, as people earn more in the low-income range, you can do the figures with equally significant improvements to people's nest eggs and their ability to save for their retirement. So this is not a cursory measure or even a cruel hoax on low-income earners—far from it. It is a very targeted and useful way to allow low-income earners to get a co-contribution to assist them with their savings.
I am assuming from this debate that there is no-one in the chamber who would not support the fact that it is good policy to encourage voluntary contributions from those who are able to and wish to make them in order to improve their retirement outcomes. I am assuming that, and that is why the Labor Party's proposal of a two per cent cut to contributions tax is not well-targeted policy, because it does not encourage savings. It just gives a cut and does not encourage anything at all. It would also apply to superannuation guarantee contributions. How silly is that if one is trying to encourage both a culture of saving and to improve the overall savings of Australians, particularly those on low incomes? It would simply discourage people from making increased voluntary contributions rather than providing any incentive for voluntary contributions to be made.
I want to talk about percentages and figures and see if we can draw this debate to a conclusion. I can now say that information about the average dollar reduction available to higher income earners is simply not available. I did say in response to a remark by Senator Sherry in the debate last night that estimates are based on data samples used by Treasury, so they are only samples. If any senator interested in this debate has specific examples in mind, it is open to him or her to apply the reduction to those examples. I have already given the percentage position. In 2007-08 when this measure is fully implemented, high-income surchargeable taxpayers would benefit by approximately $350 in that year. But all surchargeable taxpayers, not just those with a taxable income over the upper threshold, will benefit. The estimate is based on the total cost to revenue in 2007-08 divided by the number of surcharge payers. Last night we went into great detail about the fact that it is almost impossible to know the surcharge paid by all taxpayers because you simply do not know the individual circumstances of each taxpayer. I would have thought that that is pretty self-evident. We can only do things with samples. That is the information I can provide to the chamber.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—I thank Senator Coonan for those figures—they reveal quite a lot. She says that the surcharge reduction is $475 million over four years. If you look at the mathematics of that, it comes out at something more than $200 a year each for people in that high-income category. On the other hand, Senator Coonan has said that the deal for low-income earners will cost $920 million over four years. If you look at that, it averages out at $50 per person in that category, remembering that the advantages will be inequitable in that category because only one person in nine is going to get it. But on average—and you have to look at that if you are going to see the social impact of this package—a person in the income bracket over $90,000 is going to be four to five times more advantaged compared with a person in the income bracket below $40,000. Those are the figures the minister has given us. That is what is so unjust about this package.
There will be 4.6 million people sharing a benefit of $920 million as against 540,000 people in the upper income bracket sharing a benefit of $475 million, in each case over four years. It means the rich will be four to five times better off than the poor when you allocate and distribute that money, even though many of the poor people will get nothing at all. Most people will get nothing at all. That is what is so inequitable about this package. That is why the Greens will not be supporting it. The government needs to understand that we live in a society in which the gap between rich and poor is growing. That in itself is a recipe for social disruption and discontent. In a democratic system it is our job, while giving people the benefit of private enterprise and free enterprise, to bring some social equity into the matter.
This legislation is about social inequity. It increases the gap between rich and poor. It accelerates that process which opened up under serial Labor governments in the eighties and nineties with market fundamentalism, and is now increasing. This package simply puts the foot on the accelerator. That is why we will be opposing it. You will have noticed, Temporary Chairman, that the Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and the Australian Consumers Association point to the added problem—and it has been raised before and we will be raising again—that it will be people on lower incomes who have partnerships with people who are wealthy who will be able to take up the government offer of $1,000 if they put in $1,000. It is not the people who are struggling to make ends meet on low household incomes. It is a very socially unjust package.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I want to raise two matters. Firstly, Senator Brown in his comments made some criticisms of what he called `serial Labor governments', and market fundamentalism associated with those governments. I make the point very clearly: it was a Labor government which put in place and built this system of compulsory superannuation which primarily benefits low- and middle-income earners. Until the time of Labor's initiatives, superannuation was very much the preserve of high-income earners. The fact that ordinary working, low- and middle-income Australians have any superannuation at all is due to the reforms of a Labor government in bringing in compulsory superannuation.
Secondly, I have a question of the minister. I may have misheard her figures. Do I understand the minister to be saying that the $920 million is for low-income and middle-income earners up to $40,000 eligible for the co-contribution, and that that is predicated upon the take-up rate of around 540,000 persons? Was the $475 million the total benefit to people earning over $94,600-odd where the surcharge reduction cuts in? ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I have to respond to the Assistant Treasurer Senator Coonan's condemnation of Labor for proposing a contributions tax cut on the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee. Labor has proposed to reduce the contributions tax which applies to almost all superannuation—defined benefits is a different issue. Most Australians have accumulation funds. Money goes in from their employer—nine per cent compulsory contribution—and they pay a 15 per cent contributions tax. There are other taxes as well, but I will not go into those. People who have a high income pay up to another 15 per cent. The minister is arguing that, when the nine per cent is going in compulsorily from the employer, the 15 per cent should continue to apply.
—No I am not.
—That is exactly what you said, Minister.
—I am talking about encouraging voluntary savings.
—I will get to that point in a moment. My point about reducing the 15 per cent contributions tax on the compulsory contributions that go into superannuation is that that guarantees a tax cut and a benefit to all Australians. It would apply to voluntary contributions, which are not insignificant. I do not have the figures but Senator Cherry appeared to argue that SG nine per cent is the significant bulk of contributions. It is not. I was a bit surprised. Voluntary contributions, albeit they have declined significantly, are a very significant proportion of superannuation contributions. They are not a majority but they are still a very significant proportion over and above the nine per cent. Labor's proposal to cut the contributions tax would also apply to the non-compulsory superannuation contri-bution. That would improve the incentive to save. Labor makes no apologies for advocating a reduction in the contributions tax to both the compulsory nine per cent contribution and the voluntary contributions. I further ask the minister whether she has any more figures in response to the questions that were posed yesterday and this morning?",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-17,"—I have another back-of-the-envelope calculation. Senator Sherry will be pleased to know that my envelope is very busy over here. I am looking at ASFA's press release on the co-contribution. They make the point that someone earning $30,000 a year is entitled to a co-contribution of up to $800, which is still a significant co-contribution. A person on $30,000 who makes a voluntary co-contribution to superannuation of $800 per year would have this matched by the government, with a total of $1,600 being contributed to their super. This would be over and above the $2,300 contribution from the superannuation guarantee. Their retirement savings would be boosted by 70 per cent, assuming indexation of the scheme. 
It is worth noting—from my back-of-the-envelope calculation—that for a person earning $30,000, the two per cent cut in contributions tax would give them $54 a year. They have to save $1 a week under this co-contribution scheme to get the benefit that Labor is going to provide to them from a two per cent contributions tax. That is why I am saying that more benefit will go to low-income earners under our scheme than under Labor's scheme. Yes, we are only providing the incentive to those people prepared to save, but the point I want to make—a very important point made by the minister—is that you do not have to save the full $1,000 to get the co-contribution. If you put away $100 a year the government will double it, if you put away $200 a year the government will double it, if you put away $300 a year the government will double it and if you put away $500 a year the government will double it. That is how the scheme operates. For $1 a week someone earning $30,000 a year will get the equivalent benefit of your two per cent contributions tax, assuming nine per cent SG. That is the sort of benefit we are talking about with this scheme. I point out—because the Labor Party appears to have forgotten—that 90 per cent of the benefit of this scheme goes to low-income people in the first year and 66 per cent goes to low-income people over the next three years, assuming the fairly low take-up rate assumed by Treasury.  
I want to finish with the research that IFSA did—because it is worth quoting—through Eureka Strategic Research and Allens Consulting Group, which they gave to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. They actually tested the target population on how people would respond to dollar-for-dollar matching of superannuation co-contributions. Their estimate was that, of people earning between $20,000 and $30,000, 33 per cent would take up a co-contribution; and of those earning between $30,000 and $40,000, 41 per cent would take up a co-contribution. So the pick-up rates could be much higher and I expect they will be much higher than those estimated by government. Inevitably, Treasury are conservative about these matters. The only experience they have is the rebate introduced by Labor—a very inadequate measure—during the 1990s.
When you look at that IFSA market research from Eureka Strategic Research and Allens Consulting Group, it suggests the pick-up rates could be much higher. I confidently expect that the cost of this measure to government will be much higher as a result and that a 66 per cent benefit over the next four years will end up being much more weighted in favour of low-income people. Yes, this proposed measure is only targeted at those who are prepared to save, but, because they get a benefit for whatever amount they are prepared to save, overall it is a very positive package and it will do something about that zero per cent national savings rate that we have at the moment.
The other thing I point out is the high-income earners issue. It is worth noting that this measure is coming in in an environment in which there was a $3.8 billion fall in voluntary contributions last year to superannuation. That fall came predominantly from high-income people. Even at this stage, whilst I do not necessarily support cuts in taxes for high-income people, I would think that, given that cycle in the superannuation industry, there would actually be a positive flow-on economic benefit from encouraging high-income people to put more money back into super.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-17,"—I will make a couple of comments and see if we can bring this to a conclusion reasonably quickly. I will not go over all the arguments yet again. It has been a pretty long debate. However, I do want to make one comment about the proposal that there is some social inequity in this package, which I strenuously deny. I point out for the record that higher income earners will still be paying the 15 per cent contributions tax and up to a 12.5 per cent surcharge in addition to the contributions tax. This is not as if there is some magic wand being waved over those hit with the additional surcharge, relieving them of any liability to pay it. It is an extremely modest reduction. Indeed Senator Cherry has ensured that it is a modest reduction, but it is heading in the right direction because it is simply an inappropriate disincentive for those who can otherwise save and take the burden, in a policy sense, off lower income earners and those who are going to necessarily need to have their retirement income supplemented by the pension. 
We have to think of future generations; we have an ageing population. We have an intergenerational report that clearly means that we have to think in policy terms now about how we are going to afford a pension into the future. One of the ways we can afford a pension into the future is for those who can save to do so. To me it is a pretty logical argument. Trying to pull everybody down to the lowest common denominator never works well in social policy, particularly in a country like Australia where, if we can create wealth, we do better for people who are unfortunate enough not to have high-paying jobs and who will need the assistance of our pension system.
Before I make another comment about figures, I want to correct one thing that Senator Sherry said. That is in relation to the two per cent proposed reduction that Labor foreshadowed. Undeducted contributions are not subject to contributions tax. It is only when a tax deduction is claimed that a personal contribution would be subject to contributions tax. I think that is something that Senator Sherry does not seem to have appreciated in his remarks about that. In relation to the figures, over the course of last evening and today I have provided what figures I can. I have talked about samples and percentages and I have talked about the difficulty of being able to provide estimates of figures based on circumstances that vary from individual payers of the surcharge. I have provided what figures I can and there is nothing further in terms of any of the matters that have been raised that I think has not otherwise been dealt with or that I can take any further with any particularity on dollar amounts.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Before we move to the vote on these amendments, I just make the point that that was a very disappointing response from the minister about getting costings and estimates of figures in answer to quite specific and, I think, reasonable questions that were posed yesterday and again today. In fact, I have to congratulate Senator Cherry, not on the package but at least on his valiant attempts to come up with back-of-the-envelope figures. At least Senator Cherry, who has obviously got very limited resources, will have a go. The government, by contrast, has the tax office, the retirement income group, actuaries and Mr Gallagher, who I notice is not here. It has a whole raft of people who could provide answers to the questions we have asked but it simply refuses to do it. My one compliment in this debate so far is that Senator Cherry has at least given it a go and attempted to defend the indefensible—at least he tried. This is a minister who has the answers and will not give them to us. We know she has the answers. I do not want to hold up the committee stage on these amendments any further. There is a Labor amendment to this bill in the committee stage that I hope we can get to fairly soon.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 3103:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 11 (after line 37), at the end of Part 2, add:
Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993
31A Subsection 10(1)
Insert:
partner, in relation to a person, means a person who, whether or not of the same sex as the person, lives with the person on a genuine domestic basis as the partner of the person. 
31B Subsection 10(1) (definition of dependant)
Repeal the definition, substitute:
dependent, in relation to a person, includes the spouse, partner, and any child of the person or of the person's spouse or partner.
31C Subsection 10(1) (definition of spouse)
Repeal the definition, substitute:
spouse, in relation to a person, means another person who, at the relevant time, was legally married to that person.
31D At the end of subsection 52(2)
Add:
	; (i)	not to discriminate, in relation to a beneficiary, on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, transgender status, marital status, family responsibilities, religion, political opinion or social origin.
The amendment that has been circulated is in respect of same-sex couples. Labor is proposing to cross-amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to remove what it believes is the discrimination that applies in the existing superannuation system to same-sex couples. I know that there are further amendments on the next bill, one to be moved by Senator Brown and one to be moved by Senator Cherry. My understanding of the amendment to be moved by Senator Brown—and I believe there has been a further amendment to that this morning—is that it is not as broad in its application as either the Labor amendment I have just moved or the Democrat amendment to the next bill.
I will make a couple of comments about superannuation and its application to same-sex partners. Under section 62 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, commonly known as the SI(S) Act, a regulated superannuation fund is required to be maintained solely for specific purposes. One of those purposes is the benefit of death benefits in respect of each member of the fund. If the benefits are provided to the member's legal representative and/or member's dependants under section 62(1)(a)(iv) of that act, section 10 of the SI(S) Act defines a dependant as including a spouse or child of the member. Spouse is further defined to include a person living with the member on a genuine domestic basis as the husband or wife of the member.
The effect of these provisions and interpretations of SIS is that, in the first instance, the trustees of a superannuation fund are prohibited from paying death benefits directly to a surviving same-sex partner of a member unless it can be demonstrated that the surviving same-sex partner is financially dependent on the deceased member. Proving that a surviving same-sex partner is financially dependent can be difficult if a fund takes a strict approach to establishing financial dependence, particularly in cases where both partners were gainfully employed or maintained separate residences. There is evidence that many major superannuation funds take a pragmatic view and a flexible approach to establishing financial dependence in the case of same-sex partners, but there are funds that do not.
A surviving same-sex partner also may receive a death benefit indirectly if they are named as a beneficiary in a will and the death benefit is paid into the estate. While favoured by some trustees, payment to the estate can create delays, particularly where there is no will and intestacy laws are relied upon. Further complications could arise where a member dies without a will while in a same-sex relationship but with a surviving opposite-sex partner from a previous relationship and/or surviving children. A trustee may direct payment to a surviving same-sex partner who is not financially dependent, but only after the trustee has made reasonable inquiries and been unable to contact the deceased member's dependants or legal representative. 
In effect, SIS requires trustees to treat persons in opposite-sex and same-sex relationships differently. An opposite-sex partner is automatically deemed to be dependent and can be freely paid any superannuation death benefit. A surviving same-sex partner cannot be paid directly and can receive a death benefit only if (a) they demonstrate financial dependence upon the deceased, (b) the death benefit was paid to the deceased member's estate and the same-sex partner was named in the will as the beneficiary or (c) there were no dependants or legal representatives so the trustee pays the surviving same-sex partner directly. I wanted to highlight the circumstances in relation to death benefits to give a detailed example of the particular problems that same-sex couples face in respect of superannuation. This is the reason for Labor's intention to cross-amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act.
Why move this amendment to this package of bills? We have an opportunity today. We know that the government and the Democrats have a deal, a package, which will ensure the passing of these bills through the Senate. The bills will pass the Senate, and they will be returned to the House of Representatives. Today we have an opportunity to deal with the issue of what I describe as discrimination against same-sex partners in respect of superannuation. This is the debate we are having. We are not going to other issues; we are confining this to superannuation. Given that there is an agreement between the government and the Democrats to pass this package, we have an opportunity to successfully pass, I hope, an amendment in relation to removing the discrimination that applies to same-sex partners and superannuation.
Others in this debate will make a contribution from their particular perspectives on what they believe is a moral and ethical position in respect of same-sex partners and the way they should be treated in law and in legislation. But whatever an individual senator's particular moral and ethical views are about the way in which same-sex partners are treated, superannuation is the property of the individual. It is their property—that is the way the Labor Party see it—in a way not dissimilar to their house or their other possessions. It is their financial property. We fail to see why the state—that is, government—should be effectively interfering in the property rights of individuals, in this case same-sex couples. We fail to see why there should be government interference in the manner in which same-sex couples choose to treat their personal property, which in this case is superannuation.
We did debate a similar amendment—it might not have been identical, but it was very similar—on a previous occasion. I think the debate was held at about three o'clock in the morning and got somewhat heated, and I do not want to trawl over issues that unfortunately led to somewhat of a slanging match. But as I said on that occasion, when an amendment was moved on this issue to two other pieces of legislation, we knew at that time that there was no chance of them passing the Senate and the House of Representatives. We did not have an agreed position, as we do today, between the Democrats and the government on a package that will be transmitted, hopefully with this amendment, to the House of Representatives.
The Democrats are in a key position here. If this amendment or a similar amendment is passed in the chamber, the Democrats effectively can make the call on this issue, so we do have an ability to redress the issue of same-sex partners and the discrimination that occurs in respect of superannuation. I have outlined reasonably briefly but informatively Labor's reasons for moving this amendment to this bill. I think it will pass this chamber today. I hope that it passes the House of Representatives—if it does not, we will receive a message back—and that, within the package that the Democrats have negotiated with the government, we are able to finally deal with a same-sex couple amendment in respect of superannuation that removes the unfortunate discrimination they receive in this particular area.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—I thank Senator Sherry for his contribution. This is indeed a very critical moment in this matter, as Senator Sherry has said. The opposition, the Democrats and the Greens have all moved amendments that go towards removing the discrimination against not just same-sex couples but also people living in a domestic arrangement and depending on each other for a variety of reasons being able to have their superannuation passed to that partner in the domestic relationship in the same way as married couples can. The impost there is a 35 per cent tax on that superannuation going to that partner if and when they do receive it, and in the main the practice has been that they do.
This is a very discrimatory glitch in Commonwealth legislation. In all the states relevant similar discrimination of the past has been removed. I know that the Northern Territory was moving to do that this year. Whether or not that has been completed I am not sure, but I congratulate the Northern Territory government for moving in that direction. The extraordinary thing is that that discrimination has not been removed in the national parliament. The Democrats and my fellow Greens senators past and present are to be congratulated for having moved strongly on this matter since the 1990s, and the Labor Party are to be congratulated for the amendments that they have brought forward today.
There has been movement over the last 24 hours. I have now brought forward a Greens' set of amendments to remove the discrimination beyond the private sector—and, as I understand it, beyond where the Labor and the Democrat amendments would have it—to the public sector, to Commonwealth superannuation and, indeed, to military superannuation. The removal of discrimination in those areas will affect thousands of people. I therefore would recommend that, while I support the Labor proposal, the Greens' amendments be taken into consideration, because they do extend this removal of discrimination to the public sector.
I thank Ben Oquist, from my office, for the work he has done on this in the last little while so that I have been able to put before the Committee of the Whole amendments based on amending the consequential amendments legislation we have here. They go to the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 to carry into effect the reform that I have just outlined. This is no small matter. It affects thousands of Australians who are in a genuine relationship with another person and who have all the codependencies of partnerships and who pay into their superannuation funds with the expectation and the inherent right that they should be able to have that largesse go across to a partner in the event of their death.
I would think that this reform must appeal also to members of the government. There is not a wall of difference between this side and that side of the house on this matter. While the prevailing feeling in the Howard government may be that this discrimination should remain, that feeling is not universal, as indeed it is no longer universal—it is a minority opinion now—in the Australian public. The great majority of Australians want to see this reform. The fact that several state and territory administrations have made this reform points to that.  
—Labor governments. 
—Yes, Labor governments, and I congratulate them. Where it applies—in New South Wales, the ACT, Western Australia, South Australia and, more recently, Tasmania—it has been very strongly supported, and sometimes driven, by the Greens in those parliaments. So here is our opportunity in this chamber. It is important that we consider which set of amendments is the most appropriate. I submit very strongly that it is the Greens' amendments because they carry across into the public sector. It would be a pity if these amendments were confined to the private sector, because that is the narrow view of the legislation we are dealing with. 
It is a historic moment for same-sex couples but also for people who have a living arrangement, a sharing arrangement, in a domicile. They should not be penalised. The law currently excludes them because they are not married. So I recommend the Greens' amendments to the Labor Party, to the Democrats, to the government and to Independent senators because it is the most comprehensive approach that we have before us this morning. We should be careful to ensure that, if the Greens' amendments—which cover the public sector—are not to be encompassed, we get a clear indication of that from the Labor Party and/or the Democrats, so that we do not end up knocking each other out and therefore end up without the advance that is inherent in all the amendments before this committee this morning.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-09-17,"—Senator Sherry, in support of his amendment, suggested—and I think correctly—that superannuation is the financial property of the holder of the policy, and asked: why should governments interfere with that standard? In the circumstances of same-sex couples, if the superannuant or policyholder made a will in respect of death benefits, for example, which required the trustee to pay the amount to the person nominated, what is wrong with that? Why can't that be done in this case? But the proposal is not to go that way, which is a more definite way and would overcome the problem that has been envisaged. That has not been accepted. It is being suggested that there be a provision in the legislation which, in effect, does what could otherwise be done by the way that I suggested. What is being attempted here is to place same-sex couple situations on the same basis as marriage. 
Honourable senator—No; de facto.
—The proposal relating to de facto is to put it on the same basis as marriage—it is a marriage-like arrangement. This is what is being proposed, but it does not have to be proposed, because the persons concerned can become beneficiaries if the holder of the policy makes a will to that effect. What is being attempted here is discrimination against certain people. Take two women, for example, living in one household, where one is a dependant. Living in another household are two lesbians. What is being proposed by those who are putting this forward is to discriminate against the two women who are not lesbians. How do you get over that? This is very important. It is being proposed that we discriminate against the two women who are not lesbians—because they are not having sex. That is the long and the short of it.
It is disgraceful if we are going to be asked to do that. If we are dealing with this matter on the basis proposed by Senator Sherry—that this is a matter that the owner of the property should have the right to determine—then if they want to exercise that right they could do so by making a will to that effect which would have to be observed by the trustee. The alternative being proposed is to attempt to place same-sex arrangements on the same basis as a marriage or a marriage-like de facto situation and to discriminate against those two women—and there are a number like them—who, because they are not having sex together, would be denied that opportunity by this amendment—unless they make a will, of course—and would have that situation imposed upon them. The chamber ought to consider what it is doing. Are we discriminating against those people or are we not? We are not discriminating against persons who are in that situation if the owner of the policy has made a will. That is the way to go about it.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-09-17,"—Senator Harradine raises two points. I would describe one of them as being philosophical and the other one as being legal. I would like to address both of them. Firstly, on the philosophical argument: implied rather than stated in Senator Harradine's contribution is the notion and his clear strong belief that same-sex couples ought not to be regarded as married or being in a marriage-like relationship. Not everybody in the Australian community shares that view, and I am one of those who do not. I would argue that a long-term same-sex couple, particularly if they have children—and many do—is no different from a marriage, and there ought to be in this country the option for same-sex couples to marry, as has already happened in Canada, a comparable jurisdiction. That is a philosophical argument.
Secondly, to the legal argument: Senator Harradine says that the difficulties being experienced by same-sex couples and the discrimination being experienced within superannuation can be circumvented by leaving the super to the will. That is not the case for a number of reasons. There is the question of intestacy—that is, where a partner dies without having left a will. For married or de facto couples—that is, heterosexual, opposite-sex partners—intestacy is not a legal problem, because the law will recognise automatically the marriage or de facto relationship. For same-sex partners where there is no will intestacy is a real problem and it cannot be circumvented readily. A surviving same-sex partner from a long-term relationship, his partner having died in an intestate situation, is regarded as a legal stranger and not in any way related to the deceased.
Another point in relation to leaving super to a will is that it is contestable. Because same-sex partners are considered legal strangers the legal hierarchy allows for blood relatives to have a greater priority in the claim on the property, assets and superannuation. It is not unusual for estranged parents, distant relatives or estranged siblings to make a claim on the superannuation left by a partner to his or her lover. That presents a further problem.
Thirdly, and this is the most frequent discriminatory occurrence—I had another case of this brought to my attention just a matter of weeks ago by a woman in Melbourne—because a surviving same-sex partner is regarded as a legal stranger and not as being in a relationship with that person, they are hit with an extraordinary tax, sometimes up to 30 per cent, I understand, on the lump sum. As Kerryn Phelps, former President of the AMA, said recently, `It's a tax on being gay.' 
The alternative Senator Harradine proposes to deal with this difficulty, to pin it to the structure of a will, fails on three or four counts. It fails on the intestacy proposition. It fails on the tax proposal. It fails on contestability. But it also means that you are once again treating gay and lesbian people and their relationships differently from other people and their relationships. That principle is unacceptable to me and my party. It is not acceptable to say that heterosexual people ought to be dealt with this way under the law and that gay and lesbian people have to do something different—something more clumsy, something more administratively frustrating and something more expensive. That simply reinforces the notion that gay and lesbian people are inherently wrong, bad or different or, at the very least, that same-sex relationships must be treated differently for some kind of philosophical reason, which I reject. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Before I speak, would the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer be able to indicate the government's attitude to this amendment?
—I am not ready to speak yet.
—I assume from that that the government is opposing the amendment or abstaining, perhaps. I will make some brief comments about the amendment that has been moved by Senator Sherry on behalf of the opposition which seeks to amend the overarching regulatory legislation, being the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. It seeks to enable trustees of superannuation funds to pay various benefits—either the accumulated funds, the death benefit or whatever benefits flow under the trust fund—to the surviving same-sex partner of a member. It effectively tries to ensure that same-sex partners in codependent relationships have a similar legal right to access their partner's benefits—not the government's benefits—as people living in marriage or in a de facto relationship.
Senator Harradine made a contribution earlier on, and I respect the fact that he has very strongly held views. I disagree with a number of them, but I understand his position. What he says is that this discriminates against housemates, because two people who share a house would have to have different rules applying to them from two people in a gay or lesbian relationship. That is the case—and that is the case because they are very different sorts of relationships. You cannot say that simply because people live in the same house they are necessarily in the sort of relationship that should entitle one of those people to benefits if the other person dies. There is a very big difference between people who are housemates and people who are in a personal relationship with each other.
Senator Harradine also makes the point that this can be dealt with through a person leaving the superannuation benefit in their will to their partner. I think Senator Greig has indicated that there are two primary problems with that. The first is that a great many people die intestate—that is, without a will. In those circumstances, if that person has been living for 20 or 30 years with the same-sex partner but has not got around to making a will—and a lot of people do not—that same-sex partner will have significant difficulties and will often be prevented from accessing the benefits that would otherwise flow to them. In addition, even if there is a will, different taxation provisions apply to benefits which are received through an estate as a beneficiary of an estate, as opposed to receiving benefits as a partner.
Whilst I accept that there are people in this chamber who may have a particular moral or religious personal viewpoint in relation to same-sex partnerships, I make the point very clearly that this amendment is not about endorsing gay marriages, and it is not about some radical rewriting of legal rights. It is saying to Australians: `We are not going to interfere with what you do with your money; if you have a partner you are not married to'—that is, you are in a de facto relationship and under this legislation you would already be able to receive the benefit—`or, if you have a partner of the same sex, you should be allowed to give your benefits upon your death to that person.' 
Essentially this is an amendment that is about ensuring that Australians can do what they want with their own money. This is a government that talks a lot about personal choice. You almost never have a debate on superannuation in this chamber without the minister giving us a lecture about choice. Here is a choice, Minister. The choice here is giving people the right to choose whom they give their money to. If they happen to be in a relationship with someone of the same sex, the Labor Party's position—as this amendment clarifies—is that it is not for governments to say that they ought not be allowed to do that.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-17,"—I wish to advise that the Democrats will be supporting this amendment. It is worth noting for the record that this is the 12th occasion on which we have discussed the issue of equal recognition of same-sex rights in this place, and it is the first of those 12 occasions on which it does look as though we will actually get a majority vote on behalf of this position. On the previous 11 occasions the Labor Party opposed amendments moved by the Democrats to a whole range of different bills, saying that it was not the right time, not the right place, not the right issue or whatever.
—Had to do it all in one package.
—Yes. We have been waiting since 1995 to have our omnibus bill to remove discrimination on the basis of sexuality debated in this place. I might add that in 1995, under the previous government, we still could not get it debated in this place. But on this occasion we will have a Senate vote. A Senate view on these matters will be put to government, and we hope government will take that on board.
I want to note that Senator Sherry's amendment falls short in three respects. One is that it amends only the SI(S) Act. The SI(S) Act is very important because it is about the role and function of trustees and the determination of death benefits. It has been the Democrats' view for a very long time that people should have complete choice as to what happens with their benefits on death. It should not be determined by legislation or by social engineering in legislation. We should simply let people decide what to do with their money.
But there is a second piece of legislation which is equally important to the SI(S) Act, and that is the Income Tax Assessment Act, and the Labor Party has failed to amend that act. In the subsequent bill, the next bill we will be dealing with, I will move amendments to ensure that the same definition of `dependant' is consistent across both acts. I will revise those—I am hoping that this debate comes on after lunch—so that they are completely consistent. So we will be able to fix that. It is essential that we also amend the tax act at the same time as the SI(S) Act or else people may get the benefit but have it taxed at a non-concessional rate. The third area that we need to resolve in superannuation is Public Service superannuation, and I notice that Senator Brown has some amendments in that regard. At least we will cover the field.
I note that the opposition amendments are identical, word for word, to the amendments which the Democrats tabled several days ago to the superannuation government co-contribution bill. I can understand Senator Sherry's reasoning for moving those amendments to both bills—and good luck to him in that regard. But I do note that they are identical amendments to the ones which Labor has voted against in this place on superannuation legislation on at least four occasions that we can find, and I am very pleased that, today, Labor is moving them, as opposed to voting against Democrat amendments. 
Also, I am pleased that the Greens have moved amendments in this regard. As I have said, until now, on the 11 previous occasions that we have debated this issue, it has been on the basis of Democrat amendments moved in the chamber and it is good to see all the opposition parties getting involved. I want to respond briefly to some of the comments from Senator Harradine, because I think they are important. I refer to the notion of people controlling their own money. I was very bored one afternoon and I flicked through the 500 cases on death benefits considered by the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. What comes through when you read those cases is that the will is only one of the matters that trustees take into account. They are bound by the SI(S) Act, and that is what governs their decision. The will is one matter.
Superannuation funds have been given the ability by government to offer their fund members binding death nominations. Very few funds have taken up that option and it is not in their trust deeds. As a result, the vast bulk of regulation in this area is by the SI(S) Act rather than by wills or by binding death nominations. In its annual reports the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal has been very critical of the binding death nominations process. We need to look at this area. We have to concede, when you consider 500 cases about death benefits going to the SCT in the last four years, that this is an incredibly acrimonious area. In one case that I read there were 11 different claimants for the superannuation, ranging from the current wife, the former wife, the de facto and the 11 children to the brother and mother—all seeking to get the superannuation. It is a very acrimonious area and we need to ensure that trustees have guidance. As Senator Sherry said, trustees try to find a way to give some sort of scope to the views of the person involved. But the law is against them and, at some point, trustees will be pinged on this stuff, which is why we need to fix it.
Senator Harradine raised a very important point on the issue of other domestic relationships. It is a very good point. You will note for the first time that we have included in our amendments, which we will move later on, interdependent relationships, because those are the issues of sisters, and mothers and sons, living together and all those other different domestic relationships which are not picked up by the current SI(S) Act. It is essential that there be that recognition of those relationships, because they are important and significant. The issue of death benefits is a very difficult area of law but it is one in which it is time to recognise that the current law is problematic. There is an excellent discussion paper on these issues by the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal which suggests that we need to look at these areas again. It is time that the government took these matters on board.
I am hopeful that we will get a majority view in the chamber today. There are some conflicting ideas in the various amendments being moved, but the Democrats will be supporting all the amendments in this area so that a view can be put to the government that reform in this area is needed. It is up to government ultimately to take those matters on board, and we encourage the government to do so. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Senator Cherry was mildly critical of Labor's history on this matter. I do not want to go through some of the reasons that were articulated in the most recent debate on this issue as to why we did not then support certain amendments to an act. There were very clear strategic, tactical and policy reasons for that. I want to make this point: unless the minister jumps up after I have spoken and indicates that the government will be supporting it, it would seem clear that the Democrats have done a deal with the government in the area of super when they have not got agreement on this issue. Unless the government now says, `Yes, we will be supporting the amendments on allowing same-sex couples to leave their money to each other,' then it is clear that the Democrats have not got a deal on this issue.
I wonder if Senator Cherry even put it on the table. When he was in the box seat negotiating with the government on getting their legislation through, was this even on the table from the Democrats? I hope it was and maybe they made a decision that they would not proceed with it—because this was their opportunity, as a party that is on the crossbenches and does have some influence in terms of the balance of power in this chamber, to actually extract from the government something for their support for the superannuation surcharge reduction and the co-contributions bill. Was it on the table? Will the minister stand up and confirm the government's agreement to this or are the Democrats simply drafting amendments in this place while, behind closed doors, they are not negotiating with the government or using their position in this chamber to ensure that this can actually become legislation as opposed to simply a talkfest in this chamber?",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-17,"—In moving the opposition amendment today, Senator Sherry talked about an opportunity. There may well be an opportunity, but in the government's view it is certainly not opportune to deal with this issue as part of these bills and the government will be opposing the amendment. The amendment moved by the Labor Party is certainly not relevant to these measures. That is the reason why I do not propose to debate the arguments in any great detail.
The co-contribution and surcharge rate reduction measures both apply to the individual. The co-contribution is based on an eligible personal superannuation contribution from an individual. It does not distinguish between individuals, be they in same-sex households or in other households. It is available to any qualifying low-income earner. Similarly, the surcharge liability, which we are dealing with today, as well as the co-contribution bill, is based on an individual's adjusted taxable income and surchargeable contributions. So the rate reduction, once again, is based on the particular individual. Again, it does not distinguish between individuals on the basis of their relationships.
More broadly, superannuation fund trustees can and do take into account same-sex partners when distributing death benefits. There is nothing that I am aware of at all in the law to prevent a trustee paying death benefits to a same-sex partner who was financially dependent on the deceased. My understanding is that, as indeed with all contestable matters, that can be a matter of adducing the relevant evidence and proof—as, indeed, one does in many circumstances. Where cohabiting persons have joint financial commitments, it is possible to establish mutual dependency. Indeed, it is usually reasonably forthcoming if those indicia are there. Where financial dependency is shown, the death benefits paid to the partner of the deceased member are concessionally taxed. This is the same concessional tax treatment that is afforded to any dependant, whether they are husband or wife, same-sex partner, parent or child of the deceased. 
Senator Wong mentioned choice, and I would just like to take this opportunity to highlight that the government's choice of fund legislation would enable same-sex couples to choose a superannuation fund that best suits their needs. In addition, the government's portability policy will mean that, having chosen such a fund, the individuals will be able to transfer their existing benefits to that fund. So you begin to see the pattern of the government's suite of superannuation reforms designed to make superannuation more available, more attractive and more accessible to all Australians, irrespective of their circumstances.
In saying that the government will be opposing the amendment for the reasons I have given, I am also obliged to say that, if this amendment and the others were to be successful, the government would need to reconsider the compromise package agreement negotiated between itself and the Australian Democrats, and that is a matter of serious regret. The superannuation surcharge rate reduction and co-contribution measures are aimed at removing the disincentive facing those able to save for their retirement and boosting the superannuation savings of low-income earners, as we have heard yesterday and today. The failure of this package to achieve passage or further delays will significantly reduce the retirement benefits of low-income earners. It will also affect the retirement benefits of individuals who otherwise would have been able to save for their own retirement and reduce the pressure on the age pension system. 
Let me restate, in case there is a scintilla of doubt, that, consistent with previous statements by the government, these measures are a package and passage of one without the other is not acceptable. I want to finish my comments by making it very clear that the agreement negotiated between the government and the Australian Democrats did not extend to an agreement to deal with the subject matter of this amendment and the proposed amendments. As I have mentioned previously, if the amendments were to be successful, the government would need to reconsider its position.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—Of course the government would need to reconsider its position and it needs to come into the third millennium—it needs to come into the 21st century—and catch up with the position that is being expressed by the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats here. I notice there is a word of threat involved in what the minister has to say to the Democrats. The government is saying, `This package, which involves some $1½ billion over four years, is threatened by the Democrats if they join the Greens and the Labor Party to remove discrimination in superannuation law against same-sex couples.' What an extraordinary threat for the Howard government to put across the floor of the chamber. If there was ever anything that could and will measure this government's failure to keep up with the times in Australia, this will be the test. The test is not on the Democrats here; I cannot imagine any circumstance in which they will not stand on this long-held policy. As Senator Cherry has just told us, it has 12 times been brought in and thwarted, and here is the opportunity for it to pass through this chamber. I cannot imagine there can be any circumstances in which the Democrats are going to reverse from that position. The test here is not on the Democrats; it is very firmly on the government, and the government does have to reconsider. 
I do not think there is any negative here for the government. The government's own constituency will support the thrust of these amendments to get rid of discrimination. Senator Harradine has just been talking about the need for it to be extended to cover people who are not in a same-sex relationship but who are, nevertheless, cohabiting and codependent—and, from what I hear across the chamber, everybody would support those folk being included.
So there is a very enlightened feeling in this chamber today. Here is a great moment of change for the better, which we know from the polls has the support not just of the superannuation funds but of the Australian people, and the question is: is the government of Prime Minister Howard up to it? Has it got the commonsense, its finger on the pulse of this nation and, indeed, the sense of pure and simple justice not only to accept the amendments that have been put forward severally by the parties on this side of the house but to catch up with legislation at state and territory levels and, indeed, international legislation in comparable countries? The challenge is very much for the government here.
There are some small differences in the wording of the complementary amendments being brought forward by the Democrats, the Labor Party and the Greens and we will have no difficulty in mending any differences that there might be. It is a very important and exciting opportunity we have here, and I hope the government, when it does do the reconsideration that the minister is now flagging, has not just the magnanimity but the sense of timeliness of this and correctness of what this chamber is doing here in putting—and it is a compliment to this chamber if these votes go through—a challenge to the government.
The government says that this chamber is doing the blocking. The government says that we get in the way of changes it wants to make. Here is the government blocking. Here is the government standing against change—popular change, at that. Here is, if you like, the executive—because the House of Representatives would divide on obvious party lines on this matter—which has the ability to rubber-stamp these things through the House of Representatives, finding this chamber not in a mood to say, `We will vote on the merits of this legislation.' Clearly the government with the Democrats has the numbers, but this chamber is saying, `Here is an opportunity for the government to move forward.'
I hope, despite the Prime Minister's recent rhetoric, we will not find him saying, `No, I am negative. I am going to block this. I am going to stand in the way of progress,' and have a reversal where, effectively, this chamber is doing the innovating and the government is doing the blocking. Wouldn't that be an indictment of the Prime Minister's soon to be announced efforts to change the Constitution because, he says, this chamber is negative? Here is this chamber being very positive indeed. The Prime Minister's argument will be, I think, somewhat in tatters if, in the reconsideration that Minister Coonan is talking about, he does not say, `Yes, we should catch up with the Senate, the states and the Australian people on this and endorse these amendments.'",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—There are a couple of points I want to respond to, without overly extending the debate. The minister gave the impression, incorrectly and I think deliberately, that the government's proposals on choice and portability would somehow overcome the issues of discrimination against same-sex partners. That is not correct. I think anyone who has read the government's proposals on so-called portability and choice would know that the claim by the minister is simply not correct. Senator Harradine, Senator Greig and Senator Cherry have commented on the issue of superannuation in a will. I agree with their comments. The difficulties are not overcome in a will, because of those who die intestate. I do not know the proportion of the population who die without having a will. It would be interesting to know. 
There is the issue, as Senator Cherry correctly pointed out, of binding death nomination. But very few superannuation fund members actually enter into a binding death nomination. Again, I do not know the figures, but they would be very low—possibly five or 10 per cent, if that. It would be interesting to get the figures. Certainly almost every superannuation fund, on their admission form, has a section for a nominee in the event of death. One problem with that approach is that it is not binding on the trustees. The other problem with the nominee section on the form is that many people do not complete it. Again, I do not know the proportion of superannuation fund members who fail to nominate a beneficiary, but it is significant. That is a particular problem. Even where people do nominate one, there is the problem that I highlighted in my earlier comments about the difficulties that trustees can be placed in. As I said, some trustees take the issue of same-sex partners into account, but it is certainly bureaucratic, messy and time consuming, and not all trustees do.
I accept the changes that would be necessary that Senator Brown, and Senator Cherry on behalf of the Australian Democrats, have identified. I think Senator Brown has indicated that he is voting for ours and the Democrats' on his own. On behalf of the Labor Party I indicate that we will do the same so that we cover any identified gaps in the amendments that we are considering.
Senator Coonan has said, `This is not the time to consider this issue. We have an agreement with the Australian Democrats. We have a package deal. It is not appropriate to deal with the amendments that we will be voting on in this chamber on this package of measures.' We know that these measures will pass this chamber. I am a realist; I recognise that the Democrats have an agreement with the government. So we do have at least an improved opportunity to redress the issue of the same-sex couple discrimination. I pose the fundamental question to Senator Coonan: if this is not the opportunity, when will we see, from the Liberal-National Party government, the removal of discrimination against same-sex couples? When will we see that legislation? It is not unusual in this chamber to have omnibus bills. It is not unusual to have amendments that deal with arguably different issues tacked onto other bills. I think the focus is squarely on the government to indicate when the right time is to deal with this matter. I commend the amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-09-17,"—I think that Senator Wong said that my view on marriage was a strongly held view—it is. But it is not because I hold it; it is a view that has been essential for the continuation of the human race for many centuries. This is a very important situation. It is of great concern to me that all of the amendments attempt to place same-sex relationships on the same basis as marriage or a marriage-like relationship. That undermines the special status of marriage. Once society undermines the special status of marriage, the disintegration of society accelerates. During the debate I think it was acknowledged that by doing what is being proposed places same-sex relationships, and now other relationships, on the same basis as marriage for the purposes of superannuation. 
I acknowledge that it is the property of the holder of the superannuation policy and I question, as Senator Sherry did in the beginning, why the state should interfere with the rights of that property owner. Okay, then take action. A lot of people die intestate, but in respect of this matter, as I indicated, at least the property owner is entitled to make a will. There have been many cases involved in these sorts of situations but those contributing factors will be taken into account by the judge if the decision of the trustee is challenged. We should not, as is being proposed, use this debate to attempt to place that relationship on the same basis as marriage, because of the great importance of that institution to the future of this nation.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-09-17,"—I would like to comment on the contributions of both the minister and Senator Sherry. Senator Coonan argued that the laying aside of the choice bill—which has been laid aside on the basis that the chamber has indicated a strong desire to insist on same-sex couple amendments and the remedy within that bill—is regrettable and has stated specifically that this has happened because of the argument around same-sex couples. I would make two points there. 
Firstly, in the late 1970s and early 1980s prior to Senator Coonan being in this place, she was a public advocate for gay and lesbian rights and spoke at public fora in Sydney advocating same-sex partnership recognition, including in superannuation. This was detailed in Mr Graham Willett's book published last year and available in the Parliamentary Library, where there is a photo. It is most regrettable that a person who in the community argued in favour of this reform is now, ironically, the minister overseeing and blocking it. Secondly, the minister argued that it would be unfortunate—and I am perhaps paraphrasing here—if this were to become a battle between low-income earners and gay and lesbian people or same-sex couples, and it would be regrettable, the minister has suggested, if this legislation were to stumble or to be revisited on the basis of the insistence on same-sex couple amendments. I would make two points there.
Firstly, you cannot separate low-income earners from gay and lesbian people. You will find gay and lesbian people being low-income earners just as you will find gay and lesbian people throughout all sections of society. It is not an `us or them' situation; you cannot quarantine same-sex relationships or gay and lesbian people or the human rights that go with that from the rest of the legislation. It does worry me genuinely that if this legislation were to fail or to stumble—and I do not know where the numbers will fall ultimately on this—the gay and lesbian community would become the whipping post for the failure. I seek a promise from the minister that, if it were to be the case that this bill, as with super choice, stumbles or fails because of a human rights argument, gay and lesbian people will not be the target of that and that the government would honestly say that the real stumbling block here is in cabinet, not in the community or in this chamber.
Secondly, I would like to genuinely thank and compliment Senator Sherry and the Labor Party for finally agreeing to this, albeit the circumstances might be unusual. This is the first time ever that Labor has moved or spoken in favour of same-sex couple amendments in its entire parliamentary federal history. That is no small point, and I do not think—
—What about Albanese's speech in the other place? 
—With respect, Senator, that was not an amendment.
—It was a bill. 
—It was a private member's bill—granted—but it was never moved and debated. When I sought to do that some months ago, as you will recall during that feisty debate, I found that it was not on the Notice Paper.
—That is the government.
—With respect, Senator, that is where you are wrong. Remember that Labor laundered the Albanese bill into this chamber under the name of Senator Conroy, so it did for a period exist in this place under Senator Conroy's name. But Labor made no effort to bring it on for a debate. That brings me to my other point: Senator Sherry questioned and prodded Senator Coonan and asked, rightly: `If this is not the place or the bill to debate this particular issue, when is?' That is a proposition that I have put many times to Senator Sherry and his Labor colleagues when I have raised the same criticism. Of the many occasions—and Senator Cherry spoke to them earlier—when we Democrats have moved amendments relating to same-sex couples, the argument from Labor was always that it was not the right bill. Labor has argued for a policy position and administrative discussion and debate around a wholesale package, an omnibus bill. In response to that I have repeatedly said, `We Democrats have one.' The sexuality discrimination and gender identity bill has been around in one form or another since 1995. The opportunity is there. I believe that is one strong opportunity—perhaps not the best but we are working on it—to bring about at least a debate on omnibus wholesale reform.
So my question to Senator Sherry is: would you and your colleagues support a contingency motion at some point—certainly by the end of this year—so that we can bring the bill on for a full debate and full discussion and bring it to a vote? That, I think, would be the strongest indication from this chamber, and from Labor in particular, as to where they really do stand in a comprehensive way on this issue prior to the next election. I note that Labor—I do compliment them on moving the amendment that they have spoken to and will vote for—have, on every other occasion, said, `No, we will not do that just to a superannuation bill because we want omnibus reform.' That is curious and it raises the questions, rhetorical perhaps: does this mean there has been a shift in the way in which the opposition deals with same-sex issues? And, might we see some consistency in terms of same-sex partnership rights, not just in super but in all those other areas that include but are not limited to superannuation, immigration, social security, veterans' affairs, the Federal Police and the Public Service, and some other areas which escape my attention? But Labor acknowledge that it is not just super that is the problem, albeit the opportunities to reform the problem in super can only be brought about, in the absence of an omnibus bill, through legislation like this.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I will respond at least to some extent to Senator Greig's challenge and I will be interested to hear Senator Coonan's response. As I indicated in the debate some months ago, I am the Labor Party shadow minister for retirement incomes and savings and spokesperson on superannuation. They are my responsibilities.
—You have had them for a long time, Nick.
—No, for about 4½ years—with a three-year break, unfortunately. This is an issue that the Labor Party are committed to in respect of superannuation. I do not know whether we are going to succeed on this occasion, which I think is an appropriate occasion. Ultimately, in terms of superannuation, I think the only way we will progress this issue is by the election of a Labor government. I cannot give any indication or commitments on the other areas you have referred to, Senator Greig. I am not the shadow minister responsible for those areas. I clearly do not have responsibility for the wide range of areas you indicated. 
Superannuation is somewhat unusual because it is compulsory. I do not know the general proportion but certainly nine out of 10 Australian employees have superannuation. It is an increasing—subject to negative returns, of course—amount of money in a person's account in a superannuation fund. That is somewhat unusual. That is why we have so many people with superannuation—because it is compulsory. The issues of same-sex partners and discrimination in respect of a compulsory product are very immediate. We have gone into some detail about the difficulties trustees face, the processes et cetera, so we would hope that these bills will be passed. I think the proposed amendments will pass this chamber. That is good.
I hope that the government does not adopt a stubborn, obdurate approach on this matter. The minister seemed to indicate that there would be a message coming back from the House of Representatives. But I do hope the minister—and I did not know of her interest in this area, Senator Greig—is able to convince the Prime Minister and cabinet, given the obvious public advocacy that she adopted prior to coming into this chamber and her particular interest in this issue. That would be good if that could occur, but we will wait to see what happens when we get to that point.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-17,"—The first point I wish to make is that this government does not make threats and nor do I. It is implementing an announced policy position and an election promise. This government was elected on certain policy platforms and, in relation to superannuation, they are well known and they are progressively being implemented as, indeed, the government has an obligation to do so.
The government has a position in relation to the bills before the house and it has an agreement with the Democrats in relation to those bills. The government will adhere to its agreement and would expect that the Democrats would adhere to their agreement. The amendment has not formed any part of that agreement. It is not quite like an omnibus bill where you just tack something on. This has been the subject of a specific agreement and it should proceed in the way in which it has been negotiated, agreed and signed in writing.
The subject matters of the bills that we are dealing with are not at all impacted by the issues that are the subject of the amendment. No-one seems to be suggesting in this debate that any single person will have a problem with either the surcharge reduction or the co-contribution because they are in a same-sex or dependent relationship. In other words, it is utterly irrelevant to the bills currently being considered in the house. I will reiterate for the record, and so that everyone is perfectly clear, that if the amendment were to be successful the government would need to seriously reconsider the compromise package agreement negotiated between itself and the Australian Democrats. The government will honour its agreement and expects that the Democrats will honour theirs.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—That is very interesting. The government is laying down the gauntlet to the Democrats and I forecast that the Democrats, on a strongly held position like this, will take that gauntlet up. The question is: how is the government going to perform here? The minister says that this is implementing policy on which the government was elected. I think I can speak for this side of the house, but I will do so for the Greens anyway: this is very much policy on which we were elected to this place and the government has to recognise that. It is core policy, what is more, so it is very important that we stand by our electoral commitments in a matter like this. 
This is very much a test of the government as to whether it accepts that we are in a bicameral parliament with people elected on policies and that part of the business of getting measures through this chamber is for the government to accept that sometimes its legislation will be improved, as it is being improved here. Benefits which were not in the original package, but which flow on to other people in various ways, will be added. This chamber is making a positive change here—and I agree that it is a very major change.
—It is at no cost to government revenue.
—It is at no cost to government but there is a very large social cost advantage to the Australian people and I hope that it is accepted by the government. Written agreements behind closed doors are not what this chamber is about. That is a matter for a government which does too much behind closed doors. But we are now in the open light of debate and the debate here has been running very strongly in favour of the amendments that the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens are bringing forward. This is not new. As I think Senator Bartlett pointed out, debate has been initiated here 12 times by the Democrats, and many more times by the Greens. I congratulate the opposition in the move it has made here today on this legislation.
The real test is now on the government. The real test is whether this government accepts that there is a wider democratic principle involved here, which extends to everybody who is elected in this parliament, and moreover that there is a need for government to reflect the wisdom of the wider community. The government has a package that the Labor Party and the Greens oppose and it appears that on the numbers we would lose out, but we move on. On this occasion I do not think the government has the numbers to oppose the amendments that we are bringing forward. The government needs to accept that and move on. But the challenge is very much to a government that has been very negative on social reform and very negative towards the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who are in same-sex relationships in this country and their dependants. The government has been very negative about moving out of a 1950s view of the Australian social mix, milieu and mood of this nation. This is a great opportunity for the government to make a breakthrough. If the government changes its mind on this it will get the kudos for it. It is a win-win situation for the government if only the prime ministerial view of Australia would catch up and come out of the 1950s and into the new century and the new configuration of the more enlightened society we have in the year 2003.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I just have two brief points. When I spoke last time the government had not yet indicated its position on this. It has become very clear from the comments of the minister that there is a written agreement with the Democrats on this legislation which does not include this amendment. I note that Senator Cherry chose not to respond to my rhetorical question about whether or not this had even been put on the table when the Democrats were negotiating their agreement with the government. If it were not then perhaps Senator Greig should be accompanying Senator Cherry to future negotiations, because this was an occasion on which he could have used his influence in the context of negotiating passage of this legislation. We disagree with the package but, leaving that aside, Senator Greig could have used his position to negotiate an outcome on an issue which he has been quite vocal on. I would have hoped that Senator Cherry would have maintained the same position behind the closed doors in the negotiations with the government that he has maintained in the chamber. 
I return now to the government's position. This is a very simple matter on what one would have thought was a principle that small `l' liberals would adhere to—that is, equal treatment before the law. I am simply saying that people ought to be allowed to nominate whom they wish to receive their money. If that person happens to be a same-sex partner, the person should be able to nominate them, just as they can nominate a de facto partner or a marriage partner. I would have thought that equal treatment before the law was not something that any reasonable government would shy away from.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-09-17,"—I will be brief so that we can have a vote on this before we switch to matters of public importance. There are a couple of points I would like to emphasise. Firstly, regarding Senator Wong's attempt at point scoring in relation to what the Democrats are and are not able to get by way of negotiation, there are many bills that have opposition from the Democrats that pass through this chamber only because of the support of the Labor Party—for example, tax bills, immigration bills, defence bills and a range of others. If Labor has ever once sought to use those to change the definition of partners to enable the removal of discrimination against same-sex couples, I have not noticed it. So please do not even start down that path of finger pointing, because we have this government that has been in power now for 7½ years and Labor has never once sought to use its position on the many pieces of legislation that it is in on to implement reform in relation to the treatment of or discrimination against same-sex couples.
That is why this is actually such a historic moment. As Senator Greig pointed out, not only is it the first time that Labor are actually going to support a legislative amendment in this chamber to address the definition of partnership and discrimination in relation to same-sex couples; they are actually moving it, which is all the more significant again. I think that is why, at this period of the debate at least, we should be noting and welcoming that, assuming that it is now going to be a shift where the ALP will be supporting similar amendments to other legislation to try and remove this discrimination. At this stage of the debate, that really means that we should be focusing on the position of the government. As the minister did say in one of her responses, if these amendments get through, as they will in conjunction with the Democrats' and Greens' amendments, the government will have to reconsider its position. That is the whole point—the government should reconsider its position in the light of this significant and positive amendment and reform that this chamber is proposing. It is an area in which it would be the government who would be obstructing change, obstructing legislation and obstructing this chamber. It is an opportunity for the government to reconsider its position. I think that is where we should be putting the focus of the debate and the issue at the moment.
It should be pointed out that this is now a situation where, at the Commonwealth level, we are way behind every state and territory in Australia in relation to discrimination against gays, lesbians and transgender people. On occasions when reforms have been put through at the state level, in most cases it was by Labor governments; but in many cases of those legislative changes it was with the support of the Liberal Party members of parliament, at least in part. My understanding of the recent changes that went through in Tasmania, for example, was that the vast majority of those changes were supported by the Liberals. There was some opposition from upper house Independents. Certainly, some of the changes that went through in Queensland not too long ago had the support not just of the Liberals but also of the National Party MPs. So it is not exactly a situation where there is some consistent philosophical opposition on the part of Liberals or indeed the coalition more broadly. It is one where, at the state level, in most cases and certainly to the extent that these amendments go to, the Liberal MPs have, by and large, also supported changes along these lines. 
With those facts clearly in the public arena, it is an opportunity for the federal Liberals to reconsider their position and to look at whether they should take this opportunity to go down the path that many of their Liberal colleagues have at state level of supporting an advance like this and actually for once being seen to be part of enabling it to happen rather than reluctantly dragging along in the wake. It is an important opportunity and I certainly do urge the government to take this opportunity to reconsider their position when the amended bills, should they presumably pass, go to the House of Representatives.
Question put:

"Senator BRANDIS,",LP,2003-09-17,"—Last month, during its annual conference in Cairns, the Investment and Financial Services Association, IFSA, released an important report, Retirement incomes and long term savings: living well in an ageing society. As honourable senators will be aware, IFSA has been one of the key participants in the debate on reform to the Australian superannuation system, and the report is an important contribution to that debate. The release of the IFSA report came shortly after the publication by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, chaired by Senator John Watson, of two important reports directed to broadly the same subject: Superannuation and standards of living in retirement, tabled last December, and Planning for retirement, tabled in July. I acknowledge Senator Watson, who is in the chamber at the moment, and I place on record my appreciation of his pre-eminence in this field of policy as a leader in the debate—a pre-eminence which is recognised, I believe, in both chambers and on all sides of politics.
The publication of these important reports serves to focus attention on one of the most important policy debates taking place in Australia today: the debate on national savings and, in particular, the sufficiency of our provision for retirement incomes. The debate has come at a time of growing awareness of the policy challenges presented by the fact that, due to the combined effects of increased longevity and falling fertility, our population is ageing at an escalating rate.
Although that debate has been carried on in Australia for some years, it had largely been a dialogue within the universities and among industry specialists. The real landmark in terms of public awareness was the Intergenerational Report published by the Treasurer last year. In years past, the extent of forward planning evident in the budget process was the publication of forward estimates, projecting revenues and expenditures four years into the future. But last year, for the first time, with the Intergenerational Report, Peter Costello took the visionary step of assessing the needs of the Australian people 40—not four, but 40—years into the future and bringing that time horizon into the budget process. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has identified retirement incomes as one of the government's first policy priorities for the years ahead.
Statistics published in the Intergenerational Report revealed that within 40 years the number of Australians over the age of 65 will almost treble, from 2.5 million today to an estimated 6.2 million in 2042. The proportion of older Australians in the overall population is projected to increase from 12.8 per cent now to 24.5 per cent in 40 years time—to almost one in four. It is also projected that some 4.3 per cent of Australians will be over the age of 85. In other words, by 2042, one in 23 Australians is expected to be living for more than 20 years past the current retirement age.
As honourable senators know, there has been a great deal of debate lately about the additional costs to health care of an ageing population. That is not an issue which I want to address today, important though it is. What I want to address is the converse issue: the consequences of living well for longer. With increasing longevity comes an increasing capacity to enjoy a good and active quality of life for longer, emphasising the need for sustainable retirement incomes which will enable older Australians to enjoy that quality of life for longer without imposing even greater burdens on the shrinking proportion of the population which remains in the work force. There is nothing more important to the wellbeing of current and future generations than that we get national savings and retirement incomes policy right. 
In dealing with this important topic, I want to draw to the attention of the Senate a matter of particular concern which both the IFSA report and the two reports of Senator Watson's committee highlight—that is, the risk, at current savings levels and rates of superannuation provision, of the emergence of a savings gap. The savings gap may be defined as the shortfall between the projected pool of total retirement savings and the amount necessary to meet adequately, and without reliance on the age pension, the anticipated needs of the increasing number of older Australians in their retirement.
The IFSA report warns that, by its estimate, the savings gap will be some $600 billion. This figure was arrived at by assuming that the desirable income target for a retiree is a replacement rate in the range of 70 to 80 per cent of pre-retirement expenditure, which equates to a retirement income of about 62.5 per cent of pre-retirement earnings. The Chief Executive Officer of IFSA, Mr Richard Gilbert, said that although `the foundations of retirement incomes policy are sound', nevertheless `current policy will not deliver the retirement living standards expected by the next generation of Australians'. He said that the identification of the savings gap `is a call to action for policy makers and the superannuation community to make changes to boost retirement savings'. Although the Watson committee did not quantify the savings gap, and observed that `there is no funding crisis' in the present system, it nevertheless identified what it described as an `adequacy gap' which needs to be closed and warned that `the ageing of the population, together with the declining participation of mature age workers in the labour force, will place some strain on the superannuation system'.
That call has been heard by the Howard government. We recognise the necessity of encouraging greater superannuation contributions—in particular, through voluntary contributions. In particular, we recognise the need to encourage Australians to commence contributing to their superannuation earlier in their working lives. As well, we recognise the need to make superannuation products flexible and to enhance freedom of choice for policyholders, an issue which defines, about as clearly as any issue could, the philosophical differences between the government's approach and that of the Labor Party—a debate which Senator Sherry and I had at the IFSA conference in Cairns last month.
I want to place on the public record, so as more widely to publicise, the recommendations of the IFSA report. In doing so I do not necessarily endorse all of those recommendations. I know that the government and the highly competent Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, has them under active consideration. The recommendations made by the IFSA report, some of which mirror recommendations made by Senator Watson's committee, are designed to achieve three key policy outcomes: first, boosting voluntary superannuation; secondly, simplifying and easing the tax treatment of superannuation contributions; and, thirdly, maximising retirement income streams.
As to the first of those objectives—boosting voluntary contributions—the IFSA report recommends extending co-contributions on voluntary contributions to Australians earning up to average weekly earnings, removing the work test for all voluntary contributions and removing the annual contributions limits while retaining lifetime limits. The latter of those three proposals is, I believe, particularly important, for nothing will encourage a habit of lifetime savings more than enabling young people, in the early part of their working lives, to make greater voluntary superannuation contributions by removing the current unrealistically low limit at which such contributions cease to be tax effective. 
In relation to the tax treatment of superannuation, IFSA recommends the progressive removal of the superannuation contributions surcharge. As honourable senators know, legislation to give effect to the Howard government's commitment to reduce the surcharge is before this chamber this very day, and the Labor Party is determined to block it. The report also recommends moving taxes away from contributions and earnings and onto benefits. In order to maximise retirement income streams, the IFSA report recommends removing the distortions which hold back growth pensions, an issue which I know the government currently has under review; clarifying legislation so that non-super savings can access retirement income products; and improving the integration of superannuation, tax and age pension rules.
I know, in relation to some of these proposals, the objection will be raised of cost to the revenue. But greater cost to the revenue will have to be borne by future generations unless our policy and legislative framework provide sufficient encouragement and incentives for Australians to provide sufficiently for their own retirement.
My party's founder, Sir Robert Menzies, in a famous series of radio broadcasts in 1942 collectively entitled The Forgotten People, spoke with eloquence of the need for the state to care for those unable sufficiently to provide for themselves. But he also spoke of the central importance to public policy and to liberal philosophy of protecting the interests of the thrifty, of encouraging—not penalising—people who provide for themselves and their families rather than relying upon their neighbours and fellow citizens to do so.
Nowhere is that policy challenge more starkly presented than in the current debate on superannuation and national savings. Nowhere may the philosophical difference between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party be more starkly seen. And nowhere is it more important, for future generations, that we get the policy settings right.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Superannuation</title>,Matters of Public Interest,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-09-17,"—Yesterday Senator Lyn Allison asked me a question about the Australian government's Living Murray initiative. I was able to give her a comprehensive answer but I have some more information on some of the specific issues she raised. Senator Allison asked:
Why has the scientific report for the government's Living Murray initiative not been released by the government?
I can tell the Senate that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission decided not to release the report just at the moment. It apparently has 500 pages of text. They hope in the next 10 days to get some third party scientific audit of the report and they then hope to get an executive summary, which will be much easier for people to read, although the main report will also be available. Senator Allison then asked, `Was it due last month?' The answer to that is no, it was not due last month; there was not any due date for it, except that we wanted it before the next Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meeting. She then asked when the report would be released. My advice is that we hope it will be released in two weeks. The government has a very strong view, as both Mr Truss and I have, that it should be made public. It should be released as soon as it possibly can be because we want the information to be out there in the public arena so that everyone can have some input into it. 
Senator Allison further asked how much water it was necessary to return to the River Murray for various purposes. I can advise the Senate that the Living Murray process involves a comprehensive analysis of social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits and an assessment of the costs of returning water to the environment using three reference points: 350 gigalitres, 750 gigalitres and 1,500 gigalitres. The analysis will identify local as well as system-wide environmental problems and benefits surrounding such issues as—and I know that Senator Allison would be interested in this—the Murray mouth and the Coorong; the Chowilla flood plain; the Gunbower, Perricoota and Barmah-Milewa forests; and the Murray cod. It will also identify the costs of the various options and strategies to manage the social and economic impacts of the measures for improving the health of the River Murray.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Environment: Murray-Darling River System</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Vanstone) to a question without notice asked by Senator George Campbell today relating to Job Network and Centrelink.
I find it absolutely amazing that the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, is blissfully unaware that the Minister for Employment Services, Mr Brough, stated publicly in the Canberra Times of 23 August that Centrelink was preparing to suspend 60,000 people from income support. It beggars belief that the minister was unaware of this public statement. Maybe there is a reason for it. Maybe it occurred on the same day as the five-bottle lunch. I will go back and check the record and make sure that the two events did not coincide.
It is very clear from the minister's answer that there are massive problems with the Job Network system. It is equally clear that these problems are a direct result of the flawed design of the Job Network. That has been pointed out to this government time and time again in Senate estimates. The flaws in the network and the computer system and other issues that were raised by the opposition were simply ignored or not given due attention by the department.
This government designed the Job Network based on the fact that it thought that there were going to be 720,000 to 780,000 job seekers pushed through the doors of Job Network providers. The fact is that the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations got the modelling wrong. The department has now conceded that there are only between 480,000 and 500,000 job seekers. This huge drop in the number resulted in the loss of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of promised business—that is, income—to Job Network providers, who, as we know, get the payment as soon as a job seeker is sent to them by Centrelink. 
At the National Employment Services Conference in Melbourne on 21 August, Job Network providers threatened to start closing their doors and sacking staff if Minister Brough did not pay them the money that they were promised on the model of 720,000 job seekers. The government was faced with the situation where it would have to refer to the Job Network half the employees of the network providers. This is how farcical the actions of the government have been in this area. Minister Brough backed down in order to save himself the political embarrassment of Job Network offices closing their doors only eight weeks after the new Job Network had started.
On 22 August, in his keynote speech at the conference, Minister Brough promised to pay the Job Network providers a total of $670 million a year for the next three years regardless of whether they got job seekers through their doors or not. The government believes in mutual obligation for the unemployed, but not for the Job Network providers, who will get the money regardless of their results. The minister then went on the attack and blamed job seekers for the problem with Job Network. This is typical of the Howard government. Rather than solve the problem it attacks the victims of the problem. This is a government that is more interested in distracting people than in helping them. To try to show how it is the job seeker's fault, Minister Brough has talked up big, promising that 60,000 job seekers will be removed from income support. However, Centrelink have only agreed to remove 3,000.
The questions that need to be addressed by Minister Vanstone are whether she has gone out of her way to check the figures that Minister Brough has been peddling around the place and whether she has taken action to correct the incorrect information that he has been pushing. Minister Vanstone says that she knew nothing about it. It is incredible to suggest that when it is commonly known that Centrelink has advised the minister that there are 3,000 people likely to be put off benefits as a result of this fiasco with Job Network. Yet she says she does not know the figure. She says that she is unaware of the figure of 60,000. It seems to me that in a short time several ministers in this government may themselves become candidates for referral to Job Network in order to get employment. They have demonstrated very clearly their incapacity to handle their portfolios and understand the issues.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-09-17,"—The Campbells are coming today!
—Hurrah, hurrah!
—Well said, comrade! The true debate about the Job Network and the interaction with Centrelink is embarrassing for the Labor Party. Senator George Campbell, my lowland colleague, has said that there was a prediction that 780,000 people—or of that order; I do not want to misquote him—would be provided by the department in terms of the amount of traffic, if I can use that word, to go through the Job Network and that it had reduced to a figure in the realm of half a million. 
I do not want to fight over the numbers, although each and every single one of the people who go to the Job Network is obviously very important. I want to talk about the reality of what has occurred in the economy and in the employment market over recent years as a result of the sound economic policies of this government. There has been a combination of policies for driving a national economy that has given more and more people—in fact, a million people—opportunities to work and policies in the welfare area of government activity to ensure that welfare is targeted at those who need it, that those who are abusing the welfare system are taken off welfare and that, where possible, people who are receiving assistance—unemployment benefits, for example, or other benefits—are given assistance to go, to use the cliche, from welfare to work.
In other words, the government has put enormous policy resources under both Senator Vanstone's department and Mr Brough's department to ensure that those who are in need of work, those who are searching for jobs, get the very best resources they can. Under the Labor paradigm, you basically had one large Commonwealth department that did all of that work. The voters of Australia will recall that in the Hawke and Keating years—and, remember, there were one million people unemployed at the peak of that recession we were told we had to have—
—Eleven per cent unemployment.
—there was 11 per cent unemployment. This time last week, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a 5.8 per cent unemployment rate. That shows just how low unemployment has got, and we on this side of the chamber know that we can get it even lower. The reality of this is that, brought together, low interest rates, growing employment, an expanding economy, the provision of more employment opportunities and the creation of over one million new jobs almost entirely in the private sector have resulted in a flourishing and expanding free enterprise sector. The government has been very careful to manage its own resources—it is getting smaller as a proportion of the economy—resulting in an expanding free enterprise sector and a welfare sector that is assiduously targeting those in need and ensuring that those who are rorting the welfare system do not get access to the payments that were handed out like confetti by the previous Labor government.
Philosophically, Labor are committed to a large centralised government bureaucracy to run services for unemployed people who are seeking jobs. We contracted those services out to ensure that the people looking for work would get individual service, that they would have their individual needs catered to, and to provide incentives for private sector employment agencies to give them the attention they need. It has been a remarkable success. Today, all we can get from the Labor Party is no alternative policy, as usual, but a whinging, whining, carping oppositionist approach to picking on the administrative details.
Overwhelmingly, the figures—and last week's ABS figures and the figures out of Senator George Campbell's mouth showed this—show that our policies have been a great success. There are fewer people searching for work, fewer unemployed people and more people working, and as a result the Job Network administration has to be adjusted and is being adjusted by two very successful ministers in Mr Brough, who sits in the other place, and Senator Vanstone, who answered the question very eloquently today.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I rise to take note on the same matter. Senator Ian Campbell said that we should look at the true debate. To deal with the true debate, it would help if Senator Ian Campbell actually knew the name of the scheme we are debating today: it is `the Job Network', not `Jobs Network'. Anyone who has followed the history of what has gone on in this `radical market experiment'—to quote Dr Shergold, the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet—conducted by this government would say that it has been an absolute debacle. We know the problems that occurred in Job Network 1 and Job Network 2, and now there are ongoing problems occurring in Job Network 3. What we also know is that, despite this history, Senator Ian Campbell, who is here today to take the lead on the government's response on this issue, cannot even get the name of the program right. 
It is hard to know in this particular matter whether this is another example of incompetence or meanness. We have had from Senator Vanstone, so far, the family tax benefit and child-care benefit debt backdowns and the carers allowance backdowns, and this week we have had the pensioner education supplement backdowns. Outstanding now are problems in relation to an ongoing commitment to family day care and this issue today on breaching. How many unemployed people are we really talking about suspending? Are we talking about the figure that Senator Vanstone indicated would be an outcome of this policy—that is, 3,000—or should we rely on the junior minister, in his public statements, saying 60,000?
There have been ongoing problems with the Job Network applying the breaching regime. Senator Vanstone today was wrong when she said that the Job Network providers were satisfied with the breaching regime. There has been problem after problem with the way this policy has been applied, and the Job Network providers are feeling it as much as Centrelink. The minister refused to acknowledge this also and made the spurious claim that the Job Network providers thought that this breaching regime was working effectively. Could we have expected better from the minister? Probably not—because, as was highlighted, she will not even read her ministerial clips. I would have thought someone with Minister Vanstone's portfolio would notice the difference between 3,000, the figure presented through her, and 60,000, the figure coming from a junior minister.
Surely Senator Vanstone is able to follow a policy issue not far from her own area and identify such enormous discrepancies, particularly when you look at the likely impact of those discrepancies for the government. Even in a pure political sense, the Prime Minister has every right to expect that one of his senior cabinet ministers would notice the difference between there being 3,000 unemployed people suspended and the political consequences of a program that is going to put 60,000 unemployed people under pressure. Surely we can expect that much from the minister.
Perhaps the minister is not as familiar as she should be with what is going on in employment services. Perhaps this is a turf war between the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Employment Services, but the victims are clearly the unemployed. It is not being asserted that there was a target of 60,000, as Senator Vanstone suggested; what is being asserted is that the government, rampant on its radical market experiment, is not clearly understanding the consequences of its policies. It is not feeling the consequences of those policies on the day-to-day lives of the unemployed people that they impact upon. This has been one of the ongoing problems. This government is driven by ideology rather than by a sensible understanding of the impact of its policies. 
Dr Shergold, now head of the Prime Minister's department, admitted quite clearly at the time that this was a `radical market experiment'. It took him two to three years before he finally accepted that employment services is a managed market and that the government has to bear the responsibility for managing it. That responsibility was not obvious in the discussion that occurred in question time today. Senator Vanstone is not accepting that responsibility, nor is Minister Brough. It is just not good enough for unemployed people to be used as pawns in this radical market experiment that is known as `the Job Network'.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Employment: Job Network</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2003-09-17,"—I rise to speak on the same matter, in relation to the Job Network and breaching. Before I turn to the issue of breaching I want to address some of the questions raised by Senator Collins. Senator Collins seems to have a very short memory. I would like to remind her of the history of this matter, particularly as it relates to the failed ALP policies in this area. During the years of the Keating government, unemployment in this country was running at 11 per cent. The current figure is 5.8 per cent. This government has delivered the best improvement in job outcomes in the last 30 years. In my own area of the Hunter Valley the unemployment rate has halved since this government came to power. 
As well as improving economic conditions and increasing job opportunities, we have vastly improved the services for the unemployed. I remind Senator Collins of the system that existed when her party was in government, a system known as the Commonwealth Employment Service. Senator Collins says that the Job Network is a radical experiment. Let me tell her—in contrast to the CES it is a system that is delivering outcomes. Let us go back to the outcomes of the old CES system. People would go in and have a look at cards on the board and they would get very little assistance. An enormous amount of money was spent by the last government on special programs that did not deliver jobs. It was a totally failed system. 
—A churning process. 
—It was a churning process. People would come in and get a bit of training. They would go out and they could not get a job. So they would come in and get a bit more training and then they would go out again with the same result. They would go through the same churning process. One of those people said to me at that time in one of our Senate inquiries: `It would have been better if they had left me in the gutter than to pick me up and then drop me back in again.' 
—Rubbish!
—That is exactly what happened under your government. Your leader at that time, Kim Beazley, was in Wollongong, facing the unemployed and talking about the programs, and people were saying to him, `But where are the jobs?' We know where the jobs are now—they have been created by the policies of the Howard government. For those who cannot get a job we have a much better system. It is not a bureaucratically driven system like the CES. As well as government providers we have private providers, we have welfare people and we have people in business who are out there and who know how to develop systems so that people can get jobs. We have not left the system exactly as it was. Under Labor there was the old CES system, which never changed. The Job Network has evolved over time. It has been through a number of changes. It has been refined. We have made the system much more sophisticated. 
One of those changes, going back to the question asked of Senator Vanstone, relates to breaching. The answer provided by the minister shows that in the period from 14 April to 5 September—that is five months—only 286 breach penalties were imposed and there were 11,285 temporary suspensions of benefits. We have halved this problem in that six-month period by bringing in a number of measures that have reduced the problem of breaching. Customers who do not attend their first vocational profile interview are given every opportunity to comply before a breach is considered. These include two outbound phone calls to discuss the situation with the customer. Customers are allowed to miss two interviews. Customers can re-book an appointment twice. This has helped the level of attendance and focuses on getting the job seeker the first available employment. This is helping reconnect people to the job market.  
We do not have a tired old bureaucratic system. We have a dynamic system that involves charity, involves the private sector and involves the government. It is evolving over time and we are improving it. This is in great contrast to the last Labor government. People should remember that, particularly in the lead-up to the next election. This government delivers jobs and for those who miss out on jobs we deliver assistance that works—not the previous government's failed system.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-09-17,"—The answer from Senator Vanstone in question time today demonstrates what seems to be a conflict in knowledge about what is going on in this government between her, as Minister for Family and Community Services, and Minister Brough—the minister in charge of the most bungled and appallingly managed Job Network we have seen for a while. 
Senator Vanstone, in her answer, said she was not aware of what Minister Brough had said. She went on to say that she thought there was a long way between a Job Network provider making a recommendation and a breach being put in place by Centrelink. Those sentiments may well be true, but today there was no doubt that, under questioning in the Senate, the Minister for Family and Community Services, Amanda Vanstone, failed comprehensively to support the repeated assertions that have been made by Employment Services Minister Mal Brough about the number of job seekers who have failed to attend compulsory interviews with Job Network providers. Minister Brough has talked up a big promise that 60,000 job seekers are going to be removed from income support. However, Centrelink at this stage has agreed that the number is probably closer to 3,000—57,000 somewhere in the middle makes an awful lot of difference. It is a substantial number of people. On 23 August Minister Brough told the Canberra Times:
... we have about 60,000 people who are about to be suspended or are responding to letters on suspension from Centrelink ...
But over the past three months the minister has repeatedly claimed that the cash flow crisis that has brought the Job Network to the brink of financial collapse was caused by `the 60,000 greedy job seekers failing to attend compulsory interviews with their providers'. At that stage the government only paid providers once such interviews had been conducted. Of course, we now know and it is understood that only 3,000 job seekers have failed to attend their compulsory meeting without a valid reason and are likely to be breached by Centrelink, not the 60,000 figure Minister Brough has been dishonestly using. We know that he has been using that figure as a deliberate attempt to conceal his own gross mismanagement of the transition to Job Network 3. 
As Senator Collins said, Job Network 1 has been a disaster, Job Network 2 has been no better and now Job Network 3 has been the greatest disaster on record by this government. Just three months into the Job Network mark 3 and already two bailouts have been needed by this government. The first was for $30 million and the second totalled, and wait for it, $2.1 billion—not million, but billion. What does this government do? Even worse, what does Minister Brough do as the minister in charge of this debacle? He simply blames disadvantaged Australians. He blames job seekers for allegedly not turning up at interviews. He tries to point the finger at the very people in this country whom the government's own policy failings comprehensively do not support. Unfortunately, that is second nature to this government. Everyone just steps back from the line and says, `It is not us; it is not our fault.' It is the fault of the poor job seekers that on one hand there is 60,000 and on the other hand there is 3,000. The government say, `It is their fault, really. They are the ones to blame; not us, we are the ministers, we are right, we are perfect. We are handling this adequately.' 
Minister Brough grossly overestimated the number of job seekers—and he will not admit it, even though he ought to—and therefore the level of work ultimately available to providers who would be eligible for Job Network services. The figure initially started at 780,000 job seekers. Then this government revised that down to 630,000 job seekers. Now providers have been told that the real figure is no more than 500,000 job seekers. As a consequence, the cash flow to providers has been reduced by between 30 and 40 per cent. The government has simply got its numbers wrong. This government has botched up Job Network mark 3 just as it did Job Network mark 1 and mark 2. One Job Network provider told the Australian on 14 August that the government has totally stuffed up the modelling. And they were right. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—In view of that refusal of formality by the opposition and pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 604.
I do so because it is important that this matter is discussed. Let me reacquaint senators with the text of the motion. It reads:
That the Senate—
	(a)	notes reports in the British press that the United States of America and Britain have decided to delay indefinitely the publication of a full report into Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) because the efforts of the Iraq survey group, an Anglo-American team of 1 400 scientists, have so far failed in its task to locate WMDs; and
	(b)	calls on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to apologise to the Australian people for misleading them on the reasons for going to war with Iraq.
This motion says, in effect—based on the fact that there have been no weapons of mass destruction discovered, despite 1,400 scientists looking for them in Iraq—that the Prime Minister misled the country when he, as a central tenet of his reason for going to war, made statements inside and outside this parliament that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that, moreover, those weapons of mass destruction presented a threat to the rest of the world and, in particular, to countries in the region. 
We all know that the feeling at the time was of great and intense urgency because there were chemical, nuclear and biological weapons being stored by Saddam Hussein; these were potentially aboard rockets aimed at countries in the region; they could reach as far, potentially, as Turkey and beyond that to the nearer countries of Europe and this presented a menace to the world; and, moreover, the weapons could fall into the hands of the wrong people as Iraq may be treatying with terrorists.
What has happened has been a failure to find those weapons after the invasion and, moreover, an increased danger of terrorists getting hold of weapons of mass destruction and, indeed, being involved in terrorism because of the state of affairs that we now see in Iraq. So the Prime Minister, on the one hand, used weapons of mass destruction as a reason for going to war and, on the other hand, said we have found, because they were not there but because the war was prosecuted, that the risk of terrorism increases, and that includes increases in risk to Australians abroad as well as—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I have been listening carefully to Senator Brown and he needs to be making a case for the urgency of this motion and why the standing orders should be suspended. He has not addressed that by one iota. He is actually addressing the content of the motion that was before the Senate. If he wants to be within the standing orders, he needs to explain why we should be suspending all the other business of the Senate so that this can be discussed. Mr Deputy President, that is the issue before you at the moment. 
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I must say in relation to this point of order taken by Senator Campbell that I beg to differ with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. It has been an accepted procedure in this place by a number of presidents and those presiding in this chamber, in relation to a suspension of standing orders motion before the chair, that the President allows a wide-ranging debate that goes to the substance of the motion. This has become accepted because of the use of procedures in this place and we have to try to be consistent in the way that we approach the handling of these motions.
Strictly, of course, what the manager says is true. It is always true that a senator is required under the standing orders of this chamber to address the question before the chair. But it has been accepted on all sides of this chamber and by the President or person presiding in this chamber that latitude on suspension motions will be allowed. This is because the moving of a suspension motion saves time as quite often such motions are negatived. This is a matter of us being commonsensical and consistent and, with respect, on these occasions it is accepted that latitude be shown. With that, of course, there is a certain level of responsibility upon senators not to abuse the goodwill of the chair but this issue has developed in a way that most of us understand. For my part, in accordance with what has become an accepted approach in the chamber, I think it would be proper to find Senator Brown's comments in order and orderly.
—On the points of order, I find that Senator Brown should continue and that there is no point of order raised by Senator Ian Campbell. There are two minutes left of your speech, Senator Brown, and I am sure you will be relevant to the motion before the chair.
—Of course I will be and have been. One has to develop a case and then put it. The case is that, not only as stated in part (a) of this motion but in many other respects, the whole tenet of decreasing terrorism by getting rid of Saddam Hussein has now been found to be false and, in the main, the evidence for that being false was known before the war. This includes not least the recent revelation that the British joint chiefs of intelligence had drawn the conclusion before the Iraq war that there would be increased rather than decreased potential for terrorism after the war, and we know that the feelings of ASIO and the CIA on the matter—that it would increase the risk of terrorism around the world—have been publicly stated.
This is a matter about which the Prime Minister of Australia should apologise. The leadership of the Labor Party said only on the weekend, relating to the joint chiefs of British intelligence matter, that the Prime Minister has misled the country. I agree with that. I think the Prime Minister misled the country on the whole thrust of his statements to the country. He had access to the intelligence. He should have been balanced about it. In a matter of going to war, he should not ever mislead this country or have a tendency to do so. Never is truth more required. Never is being matter of fact and honest with the people of Australia more required than under those circumstances. This Prime Minister failed that test; therefore, he should apologise to the people of Australia. That is the minimum and that is what this motion is asking for. That is why I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>IRAQ</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-09-17,"—There has been a longstanding difficulty in the chamber in dealing with certain motions—many of which fall into the broad policy area of foreign affairs—a difficulty in determining how it is appropriate for the Senate to deal with those motions. I have said on many occasions that I am concerned about the fact that the distinction between the Senate passing a foreign policy motion and expressing a view and the executive government expressing a view is not well understood outside this building. I think all senators in the chamber know that after the change of government in 1996 the new opposition tried to institute—and instigate—a new way of dealing with foreign affairs policy motions, but I have also acknowledged that that has not proved successful, because at times it has been misunderstood and on other occasions it has been deliberately misrepresented. 
The difficulty—and I say this again in all seriousness to the Senate—with any of these motions before the chair put formally for a vote is that the choices are to vote in favour of such a motion or to vote against such a motion. There is no capacity to amend the motion, unless that has been done by agreement. It is a very blunt instrument indeed. I think any senator in this chamber and any party represented in this chamber—if we are to come to a formal position of this chamber, if there is concern—needs to have a capacity to ensure that those important differences or nuances are able to be expressed. They cannot be expressed through the mechanism of a formal notice where, if a matter is declared formal, a party or a senator has the choice of voting either for it or against it.
I have to say I agree with a great deal of what Senator Brown has said on this matter, but the problem is the actual substantive motion before the chair. And this particular motion says:
... notes reports in the British press that the United States of America and Britain have decided to delay indefinitely the publication of a full report into Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) because the efforts of the Iraq survey group, an Anglo-American team of 1 400 scientists, have so far failed in its task to locate WMDs ...
I do not think that addresses the complexity of the issue that we have before us. We do not conclusively know that the Iraq survey group is delaying the publication of its interim findings. We do not know that. I might have my suspicions—and obviously Senator Brown has his suspicions—but they have not been confirmed. It is very difficult, I think, to ask the chamber in this way to accept such an unestablished point as is claimed in the first paragraph of the motion.
We know from various other reports, including a statement made by Senator Hill as late as last night, which I suppose we can accept at face value as being accurate, that the Iraq survey group is still set to report and is in the process of reporting. That is what the Minister for Defence tells us. We obviously need to hold him accountable on that issue. We understand that the Iraq survey group is scheduled to provide an interim report in the near future, and of course we look forward to that report. But this is a substantive issue. Of course, this Senate has previously taken action against the Prime Minister. If it does so again, it should do so through the vehicle of a full debate, not just through a vote on a motion that is a very blunt instrument and that, on this occasion, I think does not achieve the objectives that are warranted. So for that reason we will not support the suspension of standing orders. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>IRAQ</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-09-17,"—On behalf of the Democrats, I will make a few points in relation to the suspension of standing orders. I think there is some substance to what Senator Faulkner has just said in terms of his concerns about process, although I would not overstate them. I do acknowledge there are some difficulties there in terms of such a motion being a blunt instrument. At the same time, given that we allow the vast preponderance of Senate time to be used to deal with either government business or business of the Senate, there are not many other avenues for the Senate to express views, other than through either formal motions or matters of urgency, which tend to take an hour. We are trying to find a way to express an opinion about a matter without necessarily taking up excessive amounts of time in the Senate, given the huge amount of business we have to get through. I am sure, generally speaking, the Manager of Government Business prefers that we just deal with motions through formal business rather than having these sorts of debates. Whilst there is some substance to Senator Faulkner's concerns, I think we do have to acknowledge the limitations there are on the Senate being able to express views on important matters. 
The question before the chamber at the moment is that the Senate should suspend standing orders to debate the substantive motion. This would hold up Senator Cook's very important matter of public importance debate and the reconsideration of other legislation. I would have to say that, whilst I think this is an extremely important matter, I do not think it is so urgent that it should displace all other business. I realise that Senator Brown has only gone down this path because he was denied formality and this is the only way he can try to bring the issue to a vote. That is just one of the procedural realities of this place. In that context, I indicate that the Democrats are supportive of the substantive motion. If we were simply suspending standing orders to then enable a vote to happen, we would support that.
In relation to the substantive motion, I take this opportunity to reinforce the concerns the Democrats have repeatedly expressed—as have many in the Australian community, I might say—about the lack of openness, the lack of honesty and the lack of transparency by this government in a lot of issues to do with the arguments put forward about Australia's participation in the war in Iraq. We had the continual pretence last year that predeployment of troops in no way meant that the government had already decided to support any request from the US to go to war. Everybody knew that that was just a facade, and that is how it played out and how it proved to be. We had—as this motion refers to, to some extent—a clear misstating of some of the intelligence and information surrounding the extent and the deployability of weapons of mass destruction. We have had further information in recent times that there was clear intelligence advice that an attack on Iraq was quite likely to increase the risk of terrorism and decrease the security of nations involved. That was kept from the Australian people, despite many of those with concerns about the proposed war making that very point—me included.
We have an inquiry which is a pale, pale shadow of the sort of inquiry that the UK had—and, indeed, the US is having—postwar into some of these issues. That is why it is appropriate to try to take opportunities to highlight the problems here. In the UK there were ministers, ministerial staffers, heads of departments and intelligence operatives appearing in public hearings—some of them more than once—giving evidence and taking questions. What have we got in Australia? No ministers, no witnesses from the government and no witnesses from intelligence agencies; any written submissions from any government department or intelligence agencies being vetted beforehand by the government; and a government controlled committee that can force all hearings to be held in secret. It is no wonder that there is no confidence in this government's honesty, particularly in relation to such an important matter as sending our troops to war. ",SENATE,<title>IRAQ</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-09-17,"—I think the trouble with what Senator Bartlett has just said is that it is actually a reflection on Australia's parliamentary democracy. We are not Westminster and we are not Washington. We do have a superb federal democracy here, with a House of Representatives and a Senate, and, in fact, our parliament decided to establish an inquiry into intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. That inquiry is currently being held by the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD.
I think, regardless of your views about the government's decision to either predeploy or join the coalition of the willing and enter Iraq, the one thing we can all agree on is that we do have a vigorous democracy here. We do have a very effective parliament, and we can agree to have vigorous debates about the government's decision and the basis of that decision. I think it is outrageous to condemn the processes of this parliament that are going through that in a diligent way. We are having questions in question time in this place and the other place about the intelligence, how it emerged, who received it and when, and we have got the committee that is currently inquiring into these very issues.
I fully concur with Senator John Faulkner, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, that to have a straight up-and-down vote on a motion such as this is absurd. We could amend so many areas of this motion or discuss the finer points of each point of the motion. It is absurd to have it brought to a vote by way of the formality process. I think to do so would reduce the credibility of any Senate vote on this sort of matter.
I will not say any more. Having seen the way that other leaders have indicated their parties are going to vote, clearly the Senate will not suspend standing orders, but I did want to make the point in relation to Senator Bartlett's comment that in fact this parliament is doing its democratic duty to test the government on these decisions and test the intelligence, and to say that the work of this parliament is any less or more vigorous and—let us judge it in the future—less effective than the parliament in England at Westminster or the congress in Washington I think is an insult to Australia.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I am indebted to Senator Cook, a most distinguished former trade minister, for allowing me to lead this debate regarding the failure of the meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Cancun this week, from which I and Senator Sandy Macdonald—who I have noticed in the chamber today—have returned this morning, which we attended as parliamentary observers.
I share—as do nearly all if not all Australians, the members of the delegation, observers and non-government organisation representatives—a particular disappointment at the failure of the Cancun talks. It is a failure on many fronts: firstly, a failure of the WTO and, unfortunately, a failure of the Cairns Group. It is a failure of the government's trade policy and a failure of Minister Vaile's chairmanship of the Cairns Group—a failure for which our export based rural industries will pay the price.
Australian farmers, indeed all Australians, stood to share in increased export revenues of around $4 billion had the Cancun talks been successful in resolving the issues around the so-called `three pillars' of effective world agricultural trade: improved market access, a reduction in domestic support and a reduction in—with a view to the elimination of—export subsidies. Australia's dairy, beef and mutton producers stood to have been the big winners from successful Cancun discussions on a protocol arising from the Doha Round. 
Another group who could have been winners, and for whom the failure of the Cancun talks is an especially bitter blow, is the Australian sugar industry. The sugar industry and the communities who rely on it have been buffeted for a number of years by the passing perils of drought and crop pests and the more perennial perils of corrupted world markets and low world prices. Unfortunately, they have all had to bear the blundering of the agriculture minister, Mr Warren Truss; that of the self-proclaimed helper to the Prime Minister on matters sugar, Senator Ian Macdonald; the ineffectual chair of the coalition's sugar industry task force, Mrs De-Anne Kelly—
—Have a swipe at everybody while you're at it.
—perhaps I will come to you later, but I will finish this at the moment—and now the failure of Mr Vaile at Cancun. In this place last week I believe—I was not here, but I was reliably informed—Senator Boswell made the startling allegation that the sugar industry did not want the federal government's assistance package to help it rebuild for the future. Senator Boswell's statement is further confirmation of how out of touch the once great National Party is with the plight of the sugar industry and regional Australia in general. Last week, Senator Boswell said of the federal government's $120 million sugar assistance package promised one year ago—this is from the Hansard:
I will tell you why the package never got up. It did not get up because the industry did not want it to get up.
During the debate in the Senate last week, Senator Boswell continually referred to the sugar reform package in the past tense, signalling the death -knell for the package and dashing any hopes sugar communities might have had that the Howard government would support them. The Howard government's sugar industry package appears now to have been nothing but an illusion—a phantom package—which, it appears, the Howard government never really intended to deliver. And worse, the Howard government's phantom sugar package has damaged the proud reputation of the sugar industry in the eyes of Australian families who have been slugged with a tax on food—a sugar tax—in order to fund it. 
Senator Boswell's view that sugar growers do not want the federal government's assistance package indicates that Senator Boswell is deluded—thinking all is now well within the industry—and demonstrates how out of touch he and the Nationals are. The sugar industry is one of the industries that stood to be critically affected—positively, I might say, with respect to growers in many countries, including Australia—by the removal ultimately of export subsidies and the substantial reductions in domestic support that were aims of this round, and two of the three pillars that I mentioned earlier. I suppose it is not surprising that Senator Boswell and the National Party take that point of view, as they are the party who sold out country Australians on the sale of Telstra—their form is consistent at least.
The failure of the meeting at Cancun and the loss of trade reforms, at least for some time, that could have been a lifeline to the sugar industry are just extra burdens for the sugar communities to bear as they come to grips with the fact that the Howard government and the National Party, in particular, have walked away from them. The National Party and the Howard government have again failed to keep a promise—this time to deliver the sugar reform package. The failure of the Cancun meeting in those circumstances must be particularly disappointing to those sugar -farming families who, due to current low world prices, are surviving on federal income support—income support that is due to finish in about a fortnight, on 1 October.
And why is that so important? Low world prices are, to a great extent, due to the fact that sugar industries, particularly in the EU and in the United States, receive a great deal of government support, allowing their producers to sell their product at less than their cost of production and thereby produce more and reduce the world price. Countries like Australia, and many other countries around the world which produce sugar, are paying an enormous price for the domestic support policies, and to an extent the export subsidy policies, of the European Union particularly but also the United States.
In the absence of any announcement to the contrary from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Warren Truss, those families receiving that support, which is due to finish on 1 October, must assume that the Howard government will walk away from income support—just as they have walked away from the sugar industry reform package. Labor knows the sugar industry deserves and needs help and Labor will pursue the Howard government to ensure they meet their promises to sugar farming families. And as such I now call on Mr Truss to immediately announce the Howard government's plans for income support for sugar farming and harvesting families. These families deserve some certainty.
The Cairns Group was established by a number of nations, but certainly by Australia under the guidance of Labor in August 1986. It is part of the great Labor legacy in delivering real trade liberalisation and the economic benefits that have come to the Australian economy as a result. The Cairns Group is committed to achieving a fair and market oriented agricultural trading system not only for the good of Australian farmers but also as a means of contributing to regional stability and wealth by allowing the farmers of developing nations to have a fair go in world trade and not have to compete to sell their own products in their own markets against subsidised products receiving the benefits of export subsidies from developed nations.
With Australia effectively permanently the chair of the Cairns Group, it has been an invaluable tool to assist us to meet our trade goals and, through its network of 17 developed and developing nations, to understand the objectives of our trading partners better. I cannot accept that we should find ourselves in a position to be taken by surprise when members of the group of 22 developing nations—initially 20—announced they would form an agricultural negotiating bloc, and to find that at least two of the key players in establishing that group were Cairns Group members. I think at least 10 Cairns Group members became members of the G20 as it started; the G22 as it is now. 
Clearly, as the negotiations at Cancun panned out, the developing nations found themselves pitted in particular against the EU, Japan and South Korea not on an agricultural issue but the so-called Singapore issues—not issues that greatly troubled or were key focuses for Australia in the round and not issues that fit with the theme of the round, which was to advance development in the world. As a result of the pursuit of these issues by the developed nations, and the placing of negotiations on the Singapore issues before agriculture, the talks at Cancun failed when, late in the process, after no progress had been made on the Singapore issues, the chair decided he would block the discussions at Cancun and indicated he would report to the plenary session. He effectively reported that the discussions be ended and all matters be referred to a meeting of officials in Geneva later. That was the decision that was ultimately taken, so there were effectively no substantial negotiations on the issues around which the discussions were commenced: those development issues which for most of the world revolve around the freeing up of the world trade environment and the advancements under the three pillars with regard to trade in agriculture.
Considering that one of the key drivers, if not the key driver, of the G22 as it has become, Brazil, has been a very important member of the Cairns Group for some time, it was incredible to arrive at Cancun and find that this group of nations, which involved so many Cairns Group members, had formed and yet the government and Minister Vaile did not know about it in its period of formation. What was the minister doing in the lead-up to those negotiations? What discussions were being held with those nations to ascertain what their views were and whether there were any developments which might be relevant to Australia's role as the chair of the Cairns Group, which was until now a very important negotiating group in agriculture? Might the resources that the government applied to the US FTA have been better used pursuing the issues around the Doha Round? Would we have been better informed if we had not been distracted by the—
—This is the best you have got out of a week or two in Mexico? Is this your best effort?
—I am very interested to hear the comments from one of the more irrelevant members of the National Party in this parliament. Certainly, I did not hear about the G22 until a short time after the minister heard about it but the minister, a member of Senator McGauran's party, had all of the bureaucracy working for him. The point I am making is: how many members of his department were concentrating on the FTA? What resources were applied to the preparations for Cancun? Why weren't we in a position to know that key members of the Cairns Group, Brazil and South Africa, were sitting and talking to India—not a member of the Cairns Group—in particular about forming a new group which would ultimately subsume the role of the Cairns Group with regard to agriculture, and arguably put the Cairns Group in a position—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>World Trade Organisation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2003-09-17,"—My contribution to Senator Cook's matter of public importance will not be as negative as that of my parliamentary observer colleague in Mexico last week. Australia is disappointed that the fifth ministerial conference of the WTO in Cancun last week did not take the next step in the important Doha Round of global trade negotiations to free up world trade and, in particular for Australia, to further agricultural trade. There are a lot of poor farmers in the developing world this day who will be hurt by the failure of the round, which occurred not on the agricultural reforms so important to them but on the so-called Singapore issues, which stalled the round before the agricultural issues were directly negotiated. 
What are these Singapore issues? They involve trade and investment rules, trade and competition rules, rules about transparency and government procurement and rules about trade facilitation. Whilst these are important, they are not the main game for the developing agricultural nations or for Australia. However, we do not control the agenda. As an observer of the round, it was clear that our Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, who is the Chair of the Cairns Group of agriculture producing nations, and all the officials served Australia particularly well. I would like to put on record that Mark Vaile did a great job for Australia in Mexico. That was recognised by his team there and all of us, with the exception perhaps of Senator O'Brien.
Ours is a conservative or defensive position with respect to the Doha Round. Like less developed nations we had much to gain from the round, but a stalemate result is much better than a bad result. Australia is making good headway in world trade for all the reasons that most of us understand: we have a good export culture, we have highly competitive farmers and we have low trade barriers to manufacturers and people who want to trade with Australia, including those who want to export agricultural products to this nation. We recognise that there is more that should be done for all trading nations, particularly poorer agriculture-producing nations. The Cancun result was an opportunity lost. This was an extremely bad call by the countries of the G22, particularly Brazil, which is the leader of this new group of poorer agriculture-producing nations.
Whilst it is clear from the mandate of the Doha development agenda, the freeing up of world trade comprises three pillars: firstly, the removal of domestic subsidies; secondly, the removal of export subsidies; and, thirdly, access to markets, particularly through mechanisms that allow incremental access to developing nations to protect them. It is all about giving them access to developed nations but, at the same time, putting some onus on them which requires their markets to be opened up in time as well. These objectives remain after this WTO, and the critical role for Australia remains as leader of the Cairns Group.
Senator O'Brien said in the media that we have lost more than we have gained. We have lost nothing. We would have lost much more if there had been a bad outcome. This organisation of 150-odd nations operates by consensus, with the result perhaps not as we would like it. We live, as all trading nations live, to fight another day. I can report to the Senate that not only does our minister have international credibility and an obvious leadership role within the 150-odd members of the WTO but so do the farm leaders and in particular Peter Corish, who is President of the NFF and who was with us in Cancun. He did sterling work in forging a relationship with his US counterpart, US Farm Bureau chief, Bob Stallman. These links will be absolutely vital to Mark Vaile and Australia as we move forward to negotiate the FTA, hopefully concluding it by Christmas. 
I think Mark Vaile would agree that the support from our farm lobby and all the members of Team Australia, including our industry reps and the NGOs, did a very constructive job for Australia. Having listened to Senator O'Brien today, I would say that clearly he was the odd man out. I find that very disappointing, because I did not feel that that was the feeling or response that we had whilst we were in Cancun. Like Senator O'Brien, I was given the opportunity on behalf of the government to make an intervention in connection with motions that were moved in the plenary session. That was an honour that was conferred on me, as it was conferred on Senator O'Brien, and I am sure he enjoyed it as much as I did.
This Cancun setback is also regrettable because Australia has worked very hard and constructively since Doha to find a way forward across a whole range of agricultural issues and was looking for major reforms, particularly on market access. The working text, which had been presented to the WTO heads of mission, fell well short of Australia's expectations. Nevertheless we believed that, with all the major players engaged through the Cairns Group, further improvements to achieve real market access increase in both agriculture and manufacture could have been the result. This was not to be the case, and all WTO members must consider the causes of this disappointing result. Minister Vaile made very clear at the end of the meeting the need to reaffirm the Doha undertakings and to recommit to achieving a conclusion through post Cancun negotiations which will start almost immediately in Geneva. Australia will certainly be making the strongest contribution it can to this process in the coming months.
Alan Mitchell, in today's Australian Financial Review, summed it up pretty well when he said:
If the collapse of the Cancun meeting dislodges further concessions from Europe, Japan and the US, well and good. But even if it doesn't, the Doha Round is still a better bet for the developing countries. And if that means the developing nations have to make concessions on their own restrictions on trade and investment, so much the better for them and everyone else.
I want to reaffirm the importance of the role of our minister, Mark Vaile, and to acknowledge the effort of Team Australia at the conference. There is a real professionalism about our trade negotiating team. I was very impressed with their credentials and how they went about their business. The role they play in the Cairns Group, which they have played for many years now, is a real credit to all Australians. I do not think that opportunities should be missed to build Australia's credentials in trade, and it has undertaken a responsible role. To be generous to our political opponents over the years, when Senator Cook had some responsibility for the Cairns Group was a time of constructive contribution as well.
I was very pleased, as I mentioned earlier, to make an intervention on behalf of Australia in the plenary session to support four very poor African cotton producers—Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali—by calling on developed countries to cease corrupting world markets through export subsidies on cotton, which is not grown as a commercial proposition without a range of export subsidies. Australia, a major producer and exporter of fibres including cotton and wool, knows from first-hand experience the disastrous impact that these export subsidies have on international trade. Australian cotton producers—some of whom attended the conference and supported me when I spoke and included, as I mentioned earlier, the NFF boss, Peter Corish—receive absolutely no subsidies from government. This message was extremely well received. It is a great shame that the agricultural text was not agreed to because I think that a date for the elimination of all forms of farm subsidies, including export subsidies, is well within our reach. 
This round was not a failure for us. It is ongoing. The meeting may not have been successful, but it is certainly not an end of the Doha Round. Ministers have failed to agree on a negotiating framework at this point, but they have set in train a continuing work program in Geneva which, as I said, will start almost immediately. They have emphasised that all negotiating done to date since Doha should be part of that program.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2003-09-17,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to speak to this matter of public importance and to express our views on this timely and significant topic. We agree that there has been a valuable opportunity lost with the collapse of the Cancun negotiations, both from the perspective of the Australian agricultural sector and the broader impacts the events of this week will have on the rest of the world. Multilateral reform of world agricultural trade is of huge importance to the Australian agricultural sector and primary producers. Australian farmers currently export over 80 per cent of their total production, worth billions of dollars to the Australian economy, and they do so in an environment of low general tariff levels and minimal government assistance. So achieving real progress on the Doha mandate of substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support—are, I believe, crucial to our agricultural sector, and it is very disappointing that the Cancun meeting of the WTO has failed to deliver a result in this regard.
The Australian Democrats are particularly concerned at reports this week that the Cancun outcome might damage our prospects for a good agricultural outcome in the proposed Australian-US free trade agreement. US farm support subsidies are a crucial issue for our agricultural sector in obtaining real benefits from any proposed free trade agreement. If this agreement is not about truly free agricultural trade, then I think we do legitimately have to ask the question: what does it stand for and what do we stand to gain? It is certain that we do stand to lose a great deal. The proposed FTA is likely to have far-reaching impacts on many sectors of our economy, as well as valuable aspects of Australian society and culture. It is also important to note that the further collapse of the WTO negotiations has an impact that goes far beyond Australia's interests. In fact, the result of the Cancun talks highlights the need for a change of approach to trade negotiations. These talks form an important part of the Doha development round of WTO negotiations and yet no agreement has been reached on the critical issue of agricultural trade reform.
The insistence of the larger nations that the deal be conditional upon the so-called Singapore issues—that is, investment and competition policy—in our view stalled the negotiations. Further liberalisation in these areas is likely to benefit already established industrialised economies, such as the European Union and the United States, yet the EU and the US continue to pay billions of dollars to subsidise their farmers. They grossly distort the world agricultural trade and make it very difficult for developing countries, whose economies depend on agriculture, to sell their products in world markets. If rich nations are serious about the development focus of this round, they need to make a real commitment to agricultural trade reform. Cancun demonstrates that you cannot have one thing and not the other. In that regard, the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, and certainly the Australian government, should be encouraged to retain their existing position in line with the Cairns Group countries to achieve meaningful reform in agriculture in line with the views expressed by developing countries. And there is a very good reason for this. As the Cairns Group itself emphasised, the Cairns Group alone represents some 300,000 million people, most of them living in rural areas. They live on less than $2 a day. Their capacity to be able to absorb shocks to their domestic market, when they live on the margins of existence, should be obvious to all. Their need for improved opportunities to export should be equally obvious. 
Developing nations for a long time have had to fall into line with a WTO ruled by rich countries and subject to their agenda. We are now seeing a group of developing countries coming together and demanding reform in areas that are important to them before they will submit to the broader objectives of the rich countries—and so it should be. At the same time, I think that we have to acknowledge and recognise that you cannot have one thing and trade off the other. You have to work both of those issues together in order to save face and also to come out with meaningful results.
This is an important development and, as British commentator George Manbiot recently wrote, the developing world is `beginning to shake itself awake' and `the proposals for global justice that relied on solidarity for their implementation can spring into life'. We may yet see democratic reform of the WTO to turn it into a properly representative and accountable world body, where the interests of all of the nations of the world must be considered for consensus to occur. The Australian Democrats believe that we do need some form of comprehensive rules based system for international trade: a world system with clearly established rules and processes and with all countries being able to negotiate in good faith and abide by the agreed terms.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>World Trade Organisation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I put this motion forward today because it is very important for this parliament and this chamber to recognise that the collapse at Cancun is a major catastrophe for the multilateral trading system and it has severe economic implications for Australia. In public debate in Australia it is very hard to relate what happens at Cancun or in the WTO to the hip-pocket nerve of ordinary Australian voters. But if we do not open markets and if we are not able to achieve the ability to trade on a fair playing field to enable our competitive advantage to flourish then the economic growth of this country will be stunted and the employment prospects of ordinary Australians and the ability to pay them better and fairer wages will also be limited. So this touches directly on the hip-pocket nerve of ordinary Australians and, while it might seem remote, it is immediate and the outlook is unfortunate.
Nobody has won because the Cancun ministerial meeting has collapsed—everybody loses. That has been said by a number of commentators, among them Patricia Hewitt, the British Labour Party Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, and Pascal Lamy, the negotiator on behalf of Europe. It is also stated in today's New York Times in a considered article. Of all the losers, though, the poor have lost most and that is the most regrettable feature of this. But, as well, we have to recognise that the survival of the multilateral trading system is at risk unless the world trading system is re-energised and unless the WTO is given the support to be able to focus on delivering what its core task is: trade liberalisation and growth for economies. 
The antiglobalisation movement should not celebrate this loss of momentum. If you believe its rhetoric then there is certainly no comfort for the poor nations of the world, which will now not be able to negotiate greater access to the dominant economies in Europe and the United States. I note that Senator Sandy Macdonald referred to cotton. It is most outrageous that the west African countries which are globally efficient in cotton cannot export because of subsidies that the Americans provide to their cotton producers and cannot realise their competitive advantage. There is a clear case here for change and reform.
A lot of the commentary has been: `In Australia, at least we have got the fall back for the failure of the round to this point with free trade agreements that have been put into negotiation.' I say absolutely and categorically that that is no fall back. There is no substitute for making the global trading system work. There is no substitute for pursuing global trade liberalisation through a rules based system like the WTO. The bilateral trade agreements are a very poor substitute indeed and do not, in fact, hold a candle to the main game. It is misguided to believe otherwise, and it is disappointing to see that the Prime Minister has said that he thinks that the US free trade agreement can somehow be a backstop for Australia.
But the proliferation of so-called free trade agreements—which are more properly described as bilateral trade agreements, preferential trade agreements or, on another view, discriminatory trade agreements—creates a patchwork quilt around the world which leaves out almost fully developed countries and developed countries to do trade deals with each other. A patchwork quilt of new regulations imposes transactional costs on business and creates a new province for lawyers and accountants to charge business a high fee for working out how you penetrate this maze of new regulation. That impacts on small exporters most of all and in this country, a country of small business, on small business most of all. I find it amazing that in this chamber a government spokesman can get up and talk about small business while the government's trade policy is about imposing more regulation, more transactional costs and more expenses to access international markets through a proliferation of free trade agreements.
It also has to be said that the failure at Cancun was partly delivered because of the proliferation of these bilateral agreements around the world. That is not me saying that, although I do believe that is the appropriate description of what has happened. The Economist last year devoted a front-page article and a considerable internal set of articles to why that is the case. The premier trade writer in the world, the writer for the Financial Times Guy de Jonquieres, has written that on many occasions. The directors-general of the WTO, including the past one and now Dr Supachai, have said it and have also sounded the warning that you cannot run parallel negotiations and expect that the momentum you need to achieve global change can be created while you are, in their terms, sucking the oxygen out of the global trading system and devoting your energies to bilateral trade agreements. And the pretty pass that this has got Australia into in agricultural trade negotiation, which is of course one of our key concerns and interests, is that now that Cancun has collapsed and put out further the prospect of there being a negotiated settlement to the Doha Round in a bilateral trade agreement with the United States, where we are trying to persuade the US to open their market to Australian exporters, the US know that we have no recourse at global level, so they will drive at bilateral level a tougher deal for our farmers, meaning that it will be harder for us to achieve any real gains in the FTA. 
The other thing that has to be said about the US-Australia FTA is that, if this were industrial relations, we would be talking about pattern bargaining by the United States. The US FTA started with negotiations first of all with some Middle Eastern countries, including Morocco, and established a set of standards. They continued that pattern in the negotiations they had with Chile and Singapore and now want to roll that pattern on with Australia. We are caught in the problem of the US Congress having established these principles with other negotiating partners and now wanting to establish them with us. The question for us in preserving our independence in these negotiations is: are those precedents appropriate for the Australia-US relationship? That is a matter for further discussion as well.
In saying how important—in fact, how nationally imperative—it is that this government now devote its primary energies to regaining the momentum, saving the multilateral system and trying to bring the Doha Round to a successful conclusion, I want to spend a few moments talking about what has happened at Cancun to the Cairns Group. I do so with a considerable degree of regret, because I can speak in this debate as a former chairman of the Cairns Group and, better still, as chairman of the Cairns Group and the Australian trade minister when we successfully negotiated the end of the Uruguay Round.
Australia in those negotiations sat at the top table. We were able to look the US and the Europeans in the eye on equal terms, because we chaired a group of 17 countries, most of whom were developing countries and all of whom were committed to liberalising agricultural trade. We had clout as the permanent chair of that group and we played a key role in those negotiations. At Cancun the Cairns Group has been bypassed. Two of the principal members of the Cairns Group, Brazil and South Africa, and a number of other Cairns Group countries, including Malaysia, have in effect defected from the Cairns Group to a new group, the G22—a group of developing countries who have taken over the running on agricultural trade negotiations.
Our pre-eminent position in the world to lead and be a significant player has now been relegated to that of a junior partner. Instead of sitting at the top of the room at the front table, we are at the back of the room with the rest of them. We do not any longer punch above our weight as we used to do. The people who will pay the penalty for that, most of all, are Australian farmers and the rest of the Australian economy. It is a very sad day for Australian primary producers that Australia has allowed this to happen. The weight of responsibility it has rests with the trade minister, Mark Vaile. To pretend that he did not know of these changes, that he could not have acted to prevent them and that he could not have forged a better relationship with developing countries is just, in a word, unbelievable.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>World Trade Organisation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2003-09-17,"—The content of Senator Cook's motion today is dead right. The fact that the negotiations broke down in Cancun does mean a significant opportunity was missed for Australian primary producers, for exporters and for the national economy. On that, Senator Cook and I agree. The developments in Cancun are clearly a disappointment that denies, for the moment, a real opportunity for our farmers, our manufacturers and our service providers to achieve significant gains through the Doha Round. But I would go further than that. I would say that a great opportunity has been missed for the whole world as a result of the collapse in the negotiations, because developed and developing countries alike would have benefited from a further liberalisation of international trade. Developing countries would have been the biggest winners, of course, and that is the greatest tragedy to come out of the collapse at Cancun. 
This government was determined to see gains for Australia's farmers, for our manufacturers and for our service providers to come out of the fifth WTO ministerial conference in Cancun. Before the conference, our trade minister, Mark Vaile, had identified agriculture as the key issue at Cancun. Before he left for Mexico, Mr Vaile highlighted the importance of the ambitious approach that was being taken to world trade reform set at Doha and the need for it to continue, despite the early indications that it was under great pressure.
Australia and the Cairns Group of agriculture exporting countries argued for a continued commitment to the Doha mandate for agricultural reform, which demanded substantial improvements in market access, reductions in barriers with a view to phasing out export subsidies, and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support measures. Australia went to Cancun with a belief and a hope that this could be achieved. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of Minister Vaile, negotiations broke down. But we will not be discouraged, Senator Cook. Multilateral trade rounds, as Senator Cook would recall, are long and can be very difficult affairs, especially with a growing developing country membership and an ever-widening political agenda. But they nevertheless do reward persistence and energy. These rounds are too important and come along too rarely for us to have anything but a full commitment from those countries participating.
Australia does continue to be a key player in the round, as shown by our strong role in the negotiating process across so many issues. Australia has been committed to agricultural trade liberalisation for a very long time. Despite being a relatively small voice in the global trading environment—we are a long way away and we have a small population—Australia was one of the first nations to recognise that a country gains most from reducing its trade barriers, irrespective of what other countries do. Both sides of this chamber have had the courage to do that and all Australians have been the beneficiaries.
For too long, agriculture was excluded from negotiations under GATT, the forerunner of the WTO. The Cairns Group was established in 1986 as a group of 12 `fair trading' agriculture exporting nations to address the lack of progress on agricultural trade liberalisation within the GATT. These countries, both developed and developing, were fed up with the high levels of protection in farming and a global system that had made agriculture one of the most distorted sectors in world trade. Today the Cairns Group has 18 members.
I am very proud to say that in 1986, when the Cairns Group was formed, one of the key players in its formation was the National Farmers Federation. At that time I was a very proud member of the staff of the NFF, and I know just how hard NFF staff and the President of NFF at the time, Mr Ian McLachlan, worked with the then trade minister, the Hon. John Dawkins, to ensure that the Cairns Group was launched. The Cairns Group has become a key player on the world stage as a result of that very courageous decision taken in Cairns back in 1986.
The Cairns Group has effectively put agriculture on the multilateral trade agenda; it has kept it there and it has grown. It has given Australia and the other member nations—some of them very small—a real voice on the international stage, where agriculture had been neglected for a long time. Ann Capling has described the Cairns Group as `the most unusual, cohesive and effective coalition of countries ever seen in multilateral trade negotiations'. 
There was a very strong resolution from both the membership of the Cairns Group and the United States farm leaders to see that the WTO meeting in Cancun took an aggressive approach to reforming world agricultural trade. In a joint press release on 14 September they called for a decision in Cancun that kept the Doha commitment to a substantial reduction in support and protection, and that maintained the momentum for change. They further called for both developed and developing countries to contribute to achieving a balanced outcome. Sadly, that was not to be.
However, the federal government remains fully committed to ensuring that WTO negotiations can be put back on track as soon as possible. Some progress was actually made at Cancun, and the agreement by ministers at the end of the meeting to recommit to implementing the ambitious mandates of the Doha declaration does in fact provide some hope. Of course, this is not the end of the Doha Round. Ministers have failed to agree on a negotiating framework at this point, but they have set in train a continuing work program in Geneva. They have emphasised that all the negotiating work done to date since Doha should be part of that program.
I am very pleased to say that Mark Vaile took an extremely courageous position in Cancun. He stood up for Australia. He stood up for the Cairns Group and he never lost sight of the fact that negotiating trade agreements can deliver substantial gains to Australia. Our pursuit of a successful outcome in the Doha Round will continue, and I have every confidence—and so do Australian farmers—that in the future the Doha Round will have successful outcomes. We know that negotiating these trade agreements is often difficult. Doha has been complex, but I have every confidence that Minister Vaile will continue to be at the table representing both Australia and the Cairns Group.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>World Trade Organisation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-09-17,"—The collapse of the WTO talks in Cancun, Mexico, has highlighted many issues and many strategies within international trade. One of the things that came out of Cancun, which others have talked about, was a historic alliance formed between developing countries, the G22, that stood up to the interests of primarily the United States and the European Union in trade talks. A somewhat similar situation, but less formalised, occurred in relation to the WTO talks in Seattle, where developing countries came together and, as a result, the international trade talks were stalled, trade talks that were being driven by the interests of the most developed countries and particularly the world's four largest trading countries.
There were two main issues discussed in Cancun in Mexico. One of those related to agricultural subsidies. The G22 in particular stood up to the European Union and the United States in relation to the agricultural subsidies paid by these developed countries to their farmers. The collapse of the WTO talks has also placed renewed focus on the free trade agreement negotiations taking place between Australia and the United States. The issue of agricultural subsidies in international trade can only be discussed in multilateral trade negotiations. The issue cannot be discussed in a bilateral negotiation like the free trade agreement between Australia and the United States.
The Greens believe that the government has misled Australian farmers to believe that there will be significant wins in agricultural exports to come from the free trade agreement negotiations with the United States. Even if the tariffs and the quotas that can be discussed in the FTA negotiations were to be reduced, which is unlikely given the US government's position in the recent Cancun talks, Australian farmers would still be up against continuing subsidies for US farmers. 
Developing countries have long pointed to the unfair processes of the WTO negotiations that disadvantage developing countries. Some of these processes are: meetings occurring simultaneously when developing countries have only a few people in their delegations and are therefore not able to attend all meetings; meetings being held without simultaneous translations; documents being available only in English or not being available at all; and the start and end times of meetings not being advertised to all interested parties and not being adhered to. On these issues, as well as on other content issues of the WTO talks, developing countries have been supported in their cause by a plethora of non-government organisations.
During recent WTO talks, the ire of developing countries has been raised partly because of the arrogant attitude towards trade negotiations taken by the quad countries. The developing countries have joined with many supporters of fair trade found around the world to advocate for changes in WTO processes. Some of these are about the issues I just spoke about and are very reasonable changes. Community groups continue to advocate for a world trading regime that is based on fair trade, that is transparent and that respects international labour standards, human rights standards and environmental standards. There continues to be a debate about whether there can be a reform of the WTO or whether in fact another trade body needs to be implemented that operates on the principles of ecological sustainability and social and economic justice and does so transparently and with a commitment to peace.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>World Trade Organisation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2003-09-17,"—The World Trade Organisation arose out of the Uruguay Round in 1994 from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A considerable amount of credit must be given to Senator Cook, who undertook the signing of those arrangements on behalf of the then Australian government. The WTO now monitors international trade. Its headquarters are in Geneva. Geneva, and Switzerland generally, is an excessively expensive place—not a place I would recommend anyone go to—and it does tend to lock out large delegations from developing countries because of its inordinate cost. The WTO meets every two years and has about 148 members, including, most recently, the People's Republic of China and Cambodia. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade—the forerunner to the WTO—was a United Nations body formulated in 1948.
Minister Mark Vaile recently chaired the Cairns Group in Cancun, and there was a failure to close. There is no doubt about that; it was something of a disaster for Australia. Few groups or coalitions have been as successful, though, as the Cairns Group. The collapse of the Cancun talks was bad for Australia but worse for the developing world. Australia has few, if any, agricultural subsidies, but has the most efficient producers in the world of wheat, wool and beef and also significant producers of sugar, rice, barley and—strangely—goats.
Australia is Chair of the Cairns Group of 17 agricultural producer countries. With respect to tariffs, Japan, for example, locks our rice out of Japan by imposing a 1,000 per cent tariff on imports of rice from Australia. Tariffs on beef going into Japan from Australia have recently increased to 50 per cent. Lifting tariffs would lift some 144 million people in the world out of poverty by the year 2015 and would increase world income by $500 billion. By comparison, almost the same amount is paid by way of subsidy by the United States and the European Union to their inefficient farmers. In other words, the United States and the European Union farmers wax fat at the expense of farmers in the developing world and Australia—Australian farmers being the most efficient in the world and Western Australian farmers, if I may say so, the most efficient in Australia. 
The Europeans have continued blatantly to flout requests to reform. They are the most inefficient on the globe. The United States, quite rightly, is reluctant to reform its farm sector until the worst offenders in the world—the European Union—reform. The Australian newspaper puts it this way: a European Union cow is subsidised daily at the rate of $US2.50, about $A3.80. An African worker will get less than that as a daily wage—$US2 or about $A3.50. Notwithstanding all this, developing countries could gain just as much, or more, by internal reforms. Australia, as an example, has brought about economic growth as a result of unilateral tariff cuts and competition.
It is not just the EU and the US in our trading bailiwick of East Asia. For instance, 37 per cent of tariffs are imposed by Asian countries. The industrialised countries impose about 40 per cent of tariffs, on average. Bilateral trade is important, but multilateral trade is more significant. It is important to remember that when Senator Cook said, by way of a question, that the Cairns Group had `gone down the gurgler', the talks concluded on the basis that negotiations would continue. It seems to me that putting 150 agricultural ministers together and expecting consensus—or even a majority decision—was irrational optimism. But the free trade negotiations between the United States and Australia will emulate the Cancun World Trade Organisation conclusion unless an unimpeded US market is allowed for Australian agricultural products. There is a supplementary prize of $4 billion extra to Australia within the next few years if we enter that market. Farmers within this decade will take advantage of that agreement when it is successful.
What we must do is go on with bilateral trade, regional trade talks and our unilateral trade talks. Senator Cook says—and he has some knowledge of this and I acknowledge that—the Cancun meeting is dead, but in this instance he is wrong; it is not. It is disappointing, but the government will obviously be proceeding. History is littered with abandoned meritorious negotiations that have eventually concluded in victory: the creation of the League of Nations, its transformation to the United Nations and the formation of this Commonwealth itself all failed at some stage or stages. Australia is still a formidable player in multilateral and regional trade talks. There will be continuing talks and renegotiations in Geneva. Work undertaken so far will be part of those new talks. There have been early and mid-term reviews that have been ultimately concluded successfully.
There are 148 members in the WTO, about the same as in the House of Representatives here—and I do not need to remind senators that there is hardly a majority agreement there, let alone a consensus. Most notable, though, was the Uruguay Round in Montreal that ended in disarray, but was ultimately concluded and gave an enormous boost to the world economy. There is almost invariably a reward for persistence, energy and full commitment, and this government, through its trade minister, has those three qualities.
 (Senator Kirk)—Order! The time for consideration of this matter of public importance has concluded. ",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>World Trade Organisation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-09-17,"—by leave—I present the election observation report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Cambodian National Assembly elections 2003, which took place from 24 to 29 July 2003. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report. 
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I take this opportunity to pass a few remarks about the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Cambodian National Assembly elections of this year. As the conduct of elections in Cambodia in late July of this year is a matter of continuing and critical interest to all persons interested in both the establishment and maintenance of democratic regimes in this part of the world, it is probably in the public interest for a few comments to be made by delegation participants.
Firstly, I propose to discuss a bit of historical detail concerning Cambodia whilst concentrating on the process of democratic elections in that country in the last 10 years or so. Secondly, I propose to make some observations about the conduct of the ballot in July of this year in the city of Phnom Penh and its immediate environs. Thirdly, I will address the findings of the delegation as contained in the report just tabled and, finally, I will make some comments on the background, briefings, assistance and cooperation provided by the Australian Ambassador to Cambodia and a number of her staff members who were assisting the delegation.
The Australian delegation comprised Mr Johnson, the member for Ryan; Mr Hartsuyker, the member for Cowper; Senator Stott Despoja and me. Following an invitation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Robert Ray asked if I would make myself available to observe the elections, firstly, presumably because of some continuing interest I have expressed over the years on Indochina and, secondly, because of some fine work done by former Senator Gareth Evans and Mr Michael Costello when the Labor Party was last in government.
Cambodia, as we all know, has been a much troubled country for over 40 years. War, civil war concluding in genocide, foreign invasion from nearby neighbours and puppet governments have all combined to prevent sustained and peaceful development over that period of time. Distrust of government, officials, bureaucrats and near neighbours has been endemic. Since 1993 the move to a democratic society has often been challenged, resisted by vested interests, subverted by opposing interests and corrupted by foreign interests who wish to exploit potentially rich endowments of natural resources that may be found over the length and breadth of that country. In that 10-year time frame, an emerging democracy has grown and the wider population has become and is becoming interested in the expression of a viewpoint without the threat of harm or the actuality of harm being visited upon them for that. Three elections since 1993—in 1993, 1998 and July 2003—have seen marked improvement in participation rates, campaign practices, balloting processes and general community interest. This trend obviously needs to continue. 
Turning now to the conduct of the ballot itself and the campaigning processes that all members of the delegation observed in the two or three days prior to the election, I make the following observations. Some hundreds of press persons from all around the world were in attendance and were fully able to observe the entire election process. Continuing reports were filed in the domestic print media, and detailed reports were carried via international TV on the likes of CNN, Fox and BBC. Detailed analysis of the election process and campaigns was reported in the quality international media: the Wall Street Journal, The Economist and reputable English, European and particularly French newspapers. In discussions I had with a number of journalists, their conclusion was that generally the campaigning activity and balloting process were conducted in a more liberal environment than previous elections. Generally, the process was considered by those journalists to have been largely, but not exclusively, uneventful.
The Australian delegation had unrestricted ability to observe and even participate in the pre-ballot day activity. Rallies of opposing political parties were common. The rallies varied in size but went from the low hundreds to many thousands of people. Those rallies were all conducted in a carnival like atmosphere accompanied by speeches, dancing, singing, and processions of hundreds of vehicles and thousands of individuals. All the usual paraphernalia of election campaigning was clearly visible—T-shirts, peaked caps, balloons and the like. No attempt was made to restrict Australian observers from freely moving in the rallies; indeed, large numbers of photographs were taken with rally participants.
Similarly, in the days prior to the ballot itself, delegation members attended around 10 to 12 separate briefings from a range of interested groups. In no particular order, those groups included various agencies of the Australian government, different political parties in Cambodia, ministers of the Cambodian government, the National Electoral Commission of Cambodia, various NGOs, different aid agencies, different human rights groups and various delegations from Europe and the USA. These foreign groups had particular concerns and points they raised with the Australian delegation. Finally, meetings were arranged with different individuals from labour unions, environmental groups and the legal fraternity who live and work in Cambodia.
Concerns that were raised at those briefings were as follows. Past elections had been accompanied by violence, death and intimidation, although the trend, scale and incidence of violence were clearly reducing. Unfair and discriminatory access to media and media outlets was the norm. Even though there was some access to state media by opposition parties, it was not regarded generally as anywhere near equal access. Government officials had been partisan in the past and were likely to be in 2003. At the village level there was significant and undue government influence which was both overt and direct and sometimes led to intimidation, and there were reports of violence. We were told that government spending on infrastructure followed a pattern of patronage and there was practical discrimination made against the resident Vietnamese population still in Cambodia. Indeed, on balloting day we also observed—and complaints were made to me and Senator Stott Despoja on this—discrimination against that resident Vietnamese population around Phnom Penh. The Australian Ambassador, Ms Louise Hand, her senior officer, Counsellor Karen Lanyon, and Mr Justin Whyatt, Third Secretary (Political-Economic) and Country Manager Australian Trade Commission, were particularly helpful in bringing this set of briefings together. 
Turning now to the conduct of the ballot itself, Senator Stott Despoja and I observed in and around numerous polling stations in Phnom Penh and rural areas across Kandal Province. Our colleagues from the House of Representatives observed in and around a number of polling stations in Kampong Cham Province. Generally, my observation was that the election balloting process was legitimate, above board and conducted within the spirit and intent of the election regulations.
The following was fairly typical. Voters waited in queues outside polling places from the early hours of the morning. Voters provided proof of their identity, were marked off the roll, voted privately in a secure place, inserted their ballot in the ballot box and had a finger dipped in dye as proof of voting and as a mechanism to prevent multiple voting. Ballot boxes were properly sealed and secured and in some instances hundreds of local voters slept around the sealed boxes until they were taken to a central location for counting. Agents from all major political parties clearly observed the entire balloting process. Minor or technical irregularities were observed from time to time, and reported irregularities were rectified, usually on the spot, by officials from the National Electoral Commission.
In summary, I thank all of my parliamentary colleagues who participated in the delegation. Finally, it would be most remiss not to put on the public record acknowledgment of the fine preparatory work undertaken by officers of the Australian embassy. Their planning and cooperation enabled delegation members to effectively carry out their duties, and it would be untoward not to recognise that.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the Cambodian National Assembly Elections 2003</title>,Delegation Reports,21,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-09-17,"—I think Senator Bishop has provided an excellent overview of the delegation's visit as part of monitoring the Cambodian elections in July of this year. I would like to add my thanks also to the Australian embassy officials who, as Senator Bishop has put on the record, worked so hard not only in the preparatory stage but indeed in their briefings with us. More than that, their friendship, their compassion, their intelligence and I think the most extraordinary teamwork were things we all observed. Speaking of teamwork, I think it was a pretty good group of politicians, and I also thank the colleagues who made up the delegation. The four of us travelled closely as a group but, and Senator Bishop has explained, the two of us went to a particular province for the monitoring of the actual election day.
I think many Australians and certainly parliamentarians would be aware of Australia's strong relationship with Cambodia, and that is something that we will continue to work to strengthen. Senator Bishop has provided a comprehensive view of the lead-up to, the conduct of and the analysis of those elections. I underscore what was commented on in the executive summary of the report, and that is that the administration of the elections was handled effectively and generally in accordance with the election law and procedures. There were minor irregularities to which Senator Bishop referred which will be dealt with according to the law and the processes that have been established.
We did observe minor irregularities at some polling stations, but the majority of incidents seemed to be as a consequence of inexperience rather than an intention to corrupt the process. We certainly noted a number of possibilities for improvement in the administration, including increased voter education in certain rural areas and more efficient—that is, faster—counting procedures and the administration of clearer voter registration protocols. Senator Bishop mentioned that we did hear of a couple of instances that were a little more serious in terms of potential irregularities, and we have some confidence that the grievance and complaints mechanism that is in place will deal with that. 
I take this opportunity to state on record what a wonderful place Cambodia is—certainly, from what we got to see of it in that very short time. I thank the people for a very warm reception. Being there at an election time, we were part of an international community. Obviously, there are observers that come from other countries—the EU, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia were the notable ones. I think that Australians were responded to with a degree of warmth, but also I do not think we got in the way. We did our job; we did not seek to intervene or interfere, but to monitor—that was the job, and I think and hope that we fulfilled that task.
In closing I would like to thank the embassy and pay particular tribute to the now former ambassador, Louise Hand, who had to be seen in action to be believed. She is an extraordinary woman who not only has been an effective person and clever liaison for Australia but also is possibly one of the most charming diplomats that Australia has been responsible for. I certainly wish her successor well. In closing I also thank Karen, Justin and many other embassy officials. Blair Exell and others from AusAID were quite extraordinary in the way that they dealt with us and, indeed, in the way that they portray and represent our country and our country's interests in Cambodia.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—We had some discussion of the detailed costings of this measure in our consideration of the previous bill. I think the minister gave a figure of 540,000 low-income earners. Is that correct, Minister?
—Yes.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—I would like to ask the minister about what information she has on the clear and well-founded assumption that those people on low incomes who are best going to be able to take up this offer from the government are those who are partnered with people on high incomes. They will be able to find the $1,000 to put in to receive the government matching grant, which tapers off at $40,000 to zero. That indicates that one in nine people earning less than $40,000 are going to be able to afford to take up the government's offer. I notice, by the way, that there was some talk earlier about people being motivated or taking the opportunity and so on. I want to again say that I think whether or not people will take up this co-payment will be simply a matter of economic possibilities. There is a good argument, which comes from ACOSS and other organisations, that those who will best be able to take it up are those with partners who have a much bigger income. The minister must have information on that, and I would like her to share that with the committee.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-17,"—I want to read into the record an extract from today's Courier-Mail on the question of the benefits of the co-contribution. The article quotes savings expert Dr Vince FitzGerald. He uses the example of a woman who returns to the work force at 45 and works until retirement at the age of 60, earns $30,000 a year and contributes an extra $1,000 a year to super. He says the government would co-contribute an extra $500. Dr FitzGerald says:
This could improve her retirement income from $15,681 a year to $17,371 a year.
The article goes on to quote ING Research and Technical Manager, Louise Biti:
The co-contribution plan is really valuable for low-income earners. It's even better than salary sacrificing for these people.
That evidence from Dr Vince FitzGerald shows that a very significant benefit would flow through to someone on $30,000. I thought I would read that into the record because Vince FitzGerald is probably the most eminent savings expert in Australia. He was commissioned by the Keating government in 1992—as Senator Sherry would recall—to do a major report on national savings, and that was part of the reason we went to a compulsory superannuation system in the first place.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I have considerable respect for Dr Vince FitzGerald; he is our foremost expert in this area. But I think even he made the point that this is voluntary and dependent on your capacity to find the $1,000, if your income is less than $27,500, to take advantage of the matching contribution of up to $1,000. We do know, from figures given to us by the minister, that the estimated take-up rate is no better than one in 10.
I concur with Senator Brown: I am interested to see the information that the minister is able to provide about those on a higher income level—certainly greater than $40,000—who will avail themselves indirectly by transferring part of their income to a spouse or a partner on a lower income. I have seen a figure which projects the benefit and the value of the $1,000 co-contribution over time. I recall a figure of $66,000—I think it was in Senator Cherry's press release, which I think was information provided to the minister. Could the minister outline the projected benefits over time that are being used as examples either by the minister or Senator Cherry—because I assume it is information provided by the minister to Senator Cherry—of the benefit of the co-contribution over time.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-17,"—First of all I will deal with Senator Brown's query: whether or not I have any figures in relation to his suggestion that only spouses of high-income earners will be able to contribute. I indicated that I had not seen any, but I will of course always ask what we have. There is no evidence to support this claim. The calculation of the number of people able to contribute $1,000 is based on surcharge data, and this data does not contain spouse income details.  
However, I can say that one of the amendments that I will be moving later on to the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill provides for a report to parliament on both a quarterly and an annual basis about various aspects of the co-contribution measure. Previously the reporting was done only annually, and the amendment will provide further detail about what can be covered, including details about the recipients of the co-contribution measure and the extent of the benefit received. While I am not in a position to do this now, I expect that more of that information will be available as part of the new regime for reporting.
In relation to Senator Sherry's question about the projection of the benefits of the $1,000 co-contribution over time, I am not aware that Senator Cherry's examples are ones that have been specifically run past me. However, we have made some projections. They will be given to me shortly so I can check them, and I will then inform the chamber.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—I thank the minister for that, but what the minister is telling the committee is that there is no information on the skewing of this package that will take place. That is commonsense. It is going to be skewed: the people on low incomes who take up the government incentive of up to $1,000 are going to be those in households which are bringing in much more money than that—where there is a sharing of incomes that allows it to be taken up. I will not be surprised if a great slab of the money—which will run into hundreds of millions of dollars over the next four years—that the government is putting in simply goes to low-income individuals in high-income households. That is what ACOSS and other organisations have predicted will happen.
—Dr Vince FitzGerald did not predict that.
—Dr Vince FitzGerald may have a different point of view, but that is the view of ACOSS and the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees.
—It is not the view of the Australian institute. You should check with them.
—I will read from last Tuesday's Age:
ACOSS, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, and the Australian Consumers Association said the only low income earners who could afford to direct $1000 a year into super to qualify for the Government's top up, were the spouses of high income earners.
ACOSS President Andrew McCallum said:
If you are the sole breadwinner on $27,000 a year, the last thing you are going to be thinking about is trying to quarantine $1000 so you can get $1000.
The Institute of Superannuation Trustees President, Susan Ryan, said the package had a `design fault' that filtered out genuine low-income households unable to make the $1,000 payment to be eligible for the contribution. She said:
The single income household earning less than $40,000 a year really is going to be struggling to have enough to retire on.
The Australian Consumers Association's finance policy officer, Catherine Wolthuizen, said that low-income earners were not in a position to save for retirement and higher income earners had other options. She said:
It's the middle group of people who may mix it up—some years self-funding, some years on the pension—that you really want to get making voluntary contributions now ... and they are not really provided for in these packages. 
So there is real concern out there, but it is logical and commonsense. If I heard the minister rightly, there is going to be provision in the follow-up response to parliament that will discover whether or not it is high-income households largely taking up this money which is meant to go to low-income earners. But it is a bit like closing the stable door after the horses have bolted. That factor should have been taken into account much more. It would be a very limited largesse to low-income earners to actually ensure that the money does go to low-income earners. Unlike the high-income earners who will get the refund under the Democrats-government deal, low-income earners will have to put money in to get money back. That is the problem. Logically, it is going to knock out the people who have the least amount of money. It is pure logic and that is what is wrong with the package and the philosophy behind it.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-09-17,"—I have to say I am a bit confused about the approach some senators are taking to the issue of the co-contribution. Until this debate started, my understanding was that the ALP, at least, were supportive of the co-contribution aspect of the legislation, yet if you were to listen to them throughout this debate you would say they are basically trying to devalue it as a worthless exercise that will be a waste of money and misdirected towards people in high-income households—but apparently they are still supporting it. I am not quite sure why they are going out of their way to try to attack the co-contribution component of this package when, quite clearly and unequivocally, it will provide assistance to a significant number of low-income earners. Nobody knows how many, and that is something we will obviously see over time. It may assist more people than have been estimated. If the number is lower, that will be reported and we will look at how else that income can be used. Obviously, nobody can be sure because the data is not available. The nature of superannuation is such that the data relates to the individual, not to household income. So no-one is going to know for sure until we start doing it. The fact that some people who are not the intended recipients may benefit is no reason to say, `We won't do it at all.' I would say the intended recipients will all get it, because they are low-income earners.
I understand the surface argument that we do not want people with rich spouses getting assistance. There is a significant problem, which has been noticed for some time, with the lack of independence of dependant spouses, particularly in relation to superannuation and to women. Personally, I do not see it as necessarily a significant problem for individuals to be able to build up and have incentives to build up their own independent superannuation. We all know that households and relationships break up, and there has been a significant problem of some of those spouses basically being left with far fewer resources, particularly in relation to ongoing security through things such as superannuation. I do not think it should be immediately dismissed as an automatically bad thing for low-income earners to get assistance to develop their own superannuation asset base just because they have a spouse who, at this point in time, may be earning what is seen as a high income.
It will almost certainly more easily and widely benefit women, who unfortunately are disproportionately represented in the low-income brackets. I do not think that should be discounted either. I do think that, as has been pointed out by others, it is somewhat offensive to suggest that nobody who is on a lowish income can somehow or other manage to save twenty bucks. It should be noted that twenty bucks is a lot of money for people on low incomes. I do not discount that. At the same time, I suggest that one of the reasons the level of saving at this spectrum of income recipients is low is that it is really not worth the bother for a lot of people. If you are putting a small amount of money into a super account, you have to go through all the hassle—the different administrative dramas, the fees and those sorts of things, some of which we still need to try to address through other legislation—and people think it is just not worth the bother. Nobody knows for sure, but this could well provide that extra incentive for people to think it is worth the bother because it will double the value of the money. 
People make their priorities and choices whether they earn $100,000 a year or $30,000 a year. You obviously have far fewer options if you are on a lower income, but this will provide people with assistance by doubling the value of the money they invest in it—and if super funds are doing their job you get the compound value after that. To continually belittle that, I find quite astonishing. I do not know what the attitude of the Australian Greens is to this co-contribution legislation, or whether they will support it, but they also seem to have gone out of their way to belittle the thing as possibly worse than a waste of time and a so-called subsidy for people who do not deserve it. I think that is a gross misunderstanding of what this measure is almost certainly going to achieve. As for how successful it is, we will have to wait and see. That is why it is important the reports are required to be provided every quarter: to give us an ongoing assessment of that. If it is not this government then I have no doubt, given that Labor does support this measure, a future government will find ways of improving its effectiveness should such a measure be needed. But to suggest that we should walk away from it now, particularly at a time when we have such a problem with savings in Australia, is very irresponsible. It is quaint and mildly nostalgic to hear Labor proudly quoting ACOSS and saying how sensible and wonderful they are, because usually when they mention ACOSS in this place—
—I haven't quoted ACOSS at all.
—You've never mentioned ACOSS?
—I haven't mentioned them once in this debate.
—The great unspoken, not to be mentioned: the dreaded ACOSS.
—No, you said that I have and I haven't.
—I have heard the word `ACOSS' a lot—
—Only Bob Brown has mentioned ACOSS.
—Only Bob? There you go. Senator John Cherry will detail what the apparent position is of the super trustees, but most of the time ACOSS say things—I certainly recall it a few times in other debates here—they are roundly criticised by Labor as having no idea what they are talking about and as being a bunch of idiots who really do not know their job. There may not have been mentions of them in a praiseworthy sense, but there certainly have not been any of those criticisms repeated on this occasion. I will refrain from making them myself on this occasion, but I think their view that only people with high-income spouses are going to manage to find the money to save is selling people short. Obviously, we shall see the proof of that down the track once this measure is in place. 
I understand the political reason why the Labor Party and the Greens are trying to devalue the significant benefit of the agreement that the Democrats have reached, but in doing so they are doing a bit of a disservice to a lot of people and underestimating the potential very significant value of the co-contribution measure. We shall see how valuable it is over time, but if super funds get behind it and promote it, as I am sure some of them will, it may well be that Treasury and others will not be so keen that this agreement has been reached, because down the track, once the measure becomes more known and is built into some of the packages and promotions that superannuation funds do, a lot more money than is anticipated may have to come out of Treasury coffers to provide the co-contribution.
It is a positive measure. We have had a fairly long debate already, and I have not contributed much, but from some of the previous contributions some of the values and benefits of this measure for a whole range of people have been misunderstood and have unnecessarily devalued the co-contribution. If you want to have the argument about the parts that you oppose such as the surcharge reduction, that is fine, but to unnecessarily devalue the co-contribution component is a bit unfortunate. It is a significant measure that has a lot of potential to do a lot of good. The Democrats can commit—and I am sure others in the chamber would not have a problem in committing likewise—to following up on how the scheme is operating and, if necessary, to looking at ways to make it work more effectively, because we all, or most of us here, want to see an increase in secure savings in Australia. This is one mechanism that will clearly provide incentives to do that. Belittling it excessively purely because you do not like other parts of the package is a bit unfortunate.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Senator Bartlett's description of `belittling' is certainly not Labor's approach. We are trying to obtain a realistic picture of exactly who benefits under this proposed low-income earners co-contribution. The press release that Senator Cherry put out said that up to 4½ million people could benefit. Those magic words `up to' are used very frequently in political debate by all political parties. But then we go to the reality: the estimated take-up is approximately one-tenth of that. It is therefore necessary to probe with detailed questions the likelihood of who will benefit from this particular measure.
The earlier debate focused primarily on the exclusive tax cut for high-income earners. It is necessary to draw a contrast between the exclusive and guaranteed benefit of the tax cut to high-income earners—they all get it; it is a tax cut—and the claimed benefits for low-income earners on less than $40,000, with the maximum $1,000 co-contribution being available at an income level of $27,500. We know that approximately one-tenth of low-income to middle-income workers will obtain a benefit—and then it is not the maximum $1,000—in contrast with the other end of the income scale where a guaranteed benefit is delivered to higher income earners via the tax cut. I think that is a legitimate contrast to draw to the attention of the chamber. It is legitimate to obtain a realistic picture of what is likely to emerge based on the government's costing estimates.
Senator Brown asked a question earlier about a high-income earner who diverts the $1,000 or less over to a lower income spouse. There is no doubt that that will happen, because it is not prevented. There is no provision in the low-income earner's co-contribution to prevent a high-income earner shifting $1,000 to a low-income spouse. So it will happen. Indeed, high-income earners who get the tax cut to the value of $1,000 get a double-whammy because they can take the $1,000 tax cut, give it to their low-income earning partner and, if they earn less than $27,500, pick up another $1,000. The tax cut will pay for the low-income earner's co-contribution. At least in some circumstances that will happen. It is logical. There is an incentive to do that, in the minister's own words. You cannot prevent people from doing that. I asked the minister about the projection of benefits over time. I wonder whether she has that information available.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-17,"—I would just like to refer to Senator Bartlett's contribution where he said that in his view, although he did not have a concluded view, this co-contribution really seemed to be worth the bother. I think it is more than worth the bother, as some of the projections that I will share with the chamber well and truly indicate. I will give a few cameos and alternatives, and then I will provide the assumptions. Someone earning $20,000 this year receives superannuation guarantee contributions from their employer, and they also make additional personal contributions of $1,000 each year during a 30-year working life. The personal contributions are matched with the government co-contribution of $1,000 in each of those years. That person would have, on retirement, a superannuation account balance of $389,769. This is $89,561 more than the person would have had without the government co-contribution—an improvement of 30 per cent.
In the second example, that person earns $20,000 this year and receives superannuation guarantee contributions, and they also make additional personal contributions of $1,000 each year during a 40-year working life. The personal contributions are matched with the government co-contribution of $1,000 in each of those years. The person, whom I am calling person 1, would have, on retirement, a superannuation account balance of $838,785. This is $183,217 more than the person would have had without the government co-contribution—an improvement of 28 per cent.
Person 2 earns $25,000 this year and receives superannuation guarantee contributions from their employer, and they also make additional personal contributions of $1,000 each year during a 30-year working life. The personal contributions are matched with the government co-contribution of somewhere between $862 and $1,000 in each of those years. Person 2 would have, on retirement, a superannuation account balance of $442,695. This is $84,398 more than they would have had without the government co-contribution—an improvement of 24 per cent.
Person 3, on an income of $30,000 this year, receives superannuation guarantee contributions from their employer and makes additional personal contributions of $1,000 each year during a 30-year working life. With personal contributions matched with the government co-contribution of anywhere between $27 and $800 in the years a co-contribution is received, that person—person 3—would have, on retirement, a superannuation account balance of $450,920. This is $34,534 more than the person would have had without that government co-contribution—an improvement of eight per cent.
Alternatively, person 2, who earns $25,000 this year, receives superannuation guarantee contributions and makes additional personal contributions of $1,000 each year during a 40-year working life. The personal contributions are matched with the government co-contribution of anywhere between $788 and $1,000 in each of those years. Person 2 would have, on retirement, a superannuation account balance of $956,101. This is $170,230 more than person 2 would have had without the government co-contribution—an improvement of 22 per cent.  
Person 3, on the alternate projection of a 40-year working life, earns $30,000 this year, receives superannuation guarantee contributions from his employer and makes additional personal contributions of $1,000 each year during a 40-year working life. With personal contributions matched with a government co-contribution of anywhere between $27 and $800 in the years a co-contribution is received, person 3 would have, on retirement, a superannuation account balance of $981,500. This is $65,326 more than person 3 would have had without the government co-contribution—an improvement of seven per cent.
The assumptions underlying these projections are: earnings growth of four per cent per annum equals assessable income and reportable fringe benefits; inflation at 2.5 per cent per annum; earnings by the fund, before fees and taxes are deducted, at seven per cent per annum; the co-contribution lower and upper income thresholds are $27,500 and $40,000, respectively; the co-contribution lower income threshold index, from 1 July 2007, is four per cent per annum; and retirement superannuation account balances and improvements are in nominal dollars.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-17,"—I thank the minister for those figures. I want to respond to Senator Bartlett by saying that the Greens recognise that there are people on low incomes who will benefit from this package, but it is poorly directed. On the figures the minister has given, it will get to one in nine people in that area. It means that eight out of nine are not going to get the benefits. I would very much stick to the logic that it is going to be people whose partners are on better incomes who are going to be better able to take up the government's offer. It is going to be those who are struggling, without that extra income coming into the household, who are not going to be able to take it up. Therefore, it is not just poorly targeted but very tough on low-income earners, because they are going to be sitting there with their pencils trying to work out whether they can do it or not. 
It would have been much better if there had been across-the-board support for people at income levels that low, as indeed the government in this legislation is giving across-the-board support to people on high-income levels who do have superannuation. The Democrats are, I think, pursuing the idea for low-income earners, and I congratulate them on that part of it, but I think it is poorly targeted and would have been much better targeted at people who are in need. Of course, it would have been better targeted so those who are most in need in those categories got it rather than those least in need, which is the way it is likely to go under this formula.
I want to ask the minister as well about the Parliamentary (Choice of Superannuation) Bill 2003, introduced into the House of Representatives by the Independent member for Calare, Mr Peter Andren. This legislation has been improved to meet some criticism which there was when the bill first came into the House in 2001. As Senator Coonan might remember, at that time I referred it to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and there were over 3,000 public submissions. The point about Mr Andren's legislation is that it aims to allow members of parliament who do not want to get the hand in the public purse top-ups—which make anything we are talking about here today pale into insignificance—to go to a superannuation scheme which is commensurate with what the rest of the public gets, where you can expect an eight per cent top-up from employers, not the 69 per cent notional top-up which is occurring with parliamentary superannuation schemes. 
I draw senators' attention to the fact that we are talking in the Senate tonight about very small contributions to low-income earners which pale into insignificance when compared to the amount of money that is being taken out of the public purse to top up and enrich the parliamentary superannuation scheme. It pales into insignificance compared to the thousands of dollars that go through that 69 per cent self-endowed scheme to members of parliament. I think it is a blight on us that that arrangement is there. I think we should deal with it. I think it is important for a whole range of reasons that we deal with that piece of legislation. As it is, in this legislation today we are looking at cutting the tax on high-income earner superannuation schemes, which we will benefit from anyway.
It is my intention to refer this bill to a Senate committee for a re-evaluation. I think it is very important and I think it is very ethical legislation that Mr Andren has come up with in the House of Representatives. But can the minister say whether there has been any movement in the government's attitude towards the Andren legislation, whether the government would entertain it being reviewed or whether the government is reviewing it with a view to seeing that it is brought on for debate in the House of Representatives? It warrants that, and it is voted on in the House of Representatives in the same way as this legislation—giving tax cuts to wealthy high-income earners and giving these comparatively modest supplements to low-income earners—which has gone through the House and is here today.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-17,"—I want to respond to some earlier comments from Senator Brown. I know that we are getting close to time and I will not speak for long because I know Minister Coonan wants to respond to the questions Senator Brown has asked. I thank Senator Brown for his comments that he does acknowledge that the co-contribution will provide benefits to some low-income people. The dispute in this debate is how many. The answer is we do not know, and we will never know until we see what the figures are that are collected, and the figures will be collected and reported to the parliament.
I want to correct the record with respect to two things: one relates to the comments that appeared in the Age, I think, from Susan Ryan from the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, entitled `A better attitude to the co-contribution'. My office rang Ms Ryan to ask her about those comments and she confirmed that she was misquoted and that her organisation actually supports the package and is urging the Senate to pass it. I note that for the record.
The second note for the record is that ACOSS's view on the co-contribution is not one of opposition but simply a view that it is inadequate and it does not go far enough. It is a pity in some respects that more senators and, in particular, Senator Brown were not at the inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation into these bills last September, because ACOSS put in a submission to the inquiry at that stage. I would like to read extracts from their submission to the inquiry:
ACOSS supports the principle of a co-contribution for low income-earners.
They go on to say:
If a co-contribution is to be introduced, it should extend higher up the income scale to somewhat less than average full-time earnings, and should preferably extend to Superannuation Guarantee contributions. It should be funded by reducing the existing tax concessions for high-income earners, as proposed in our previous submission. 
Therein lies ACOSS's position, and I thought that is what we did—we actually pushed the co-contribution up the scale to $40,000 and we funded it by paring back the government's proposed cut of the surcharge. We did exactly what ACOSS told us to do. I am used to getting belted over the head when I do what ACOSS tell me to do. They did it to us with the GST and they have done it to us with this, but they are my friends and I look after them. But, on this particular occasion, I note for the record that the submission to the inquiry—their public record position, which I have responded to—was that the co-contribution should be extended up the scale, preferably extended to SG, and I agree with that.
The next stage of reform for the co-contribution, in my view, is to extend it to SG, because, as I think Senator Coonan and Senator Sherry have said in previous debates, what we are dealing with today is a start. I hope it is not the be-all and end-all of co-contributions. What we are dealing with today is the first tentative step to finally get a co-contribution in place. In my view, targeting low-income people who are prepared to save is a reasonable place to start. It is the best place to start. The next stage is to extend that to SG for low-income people. The next stage is to extend it further up the scale and increase it. That is the way we should go, and eventually we will hopefully get a proper co-contribution that will fill that gap—the inadequacy in superannuation which was identified by Dr FitzGerald in 1993 and which, I should note, the Keating government sought to fix with their co-contribution proposal in 1996.
—They abandoned the co-contribution in 1997, not 1996.
—It was a government plan, I think, in 1995-96. My memory fails me. But the key point I want to make is that this is a start, and the changes we have made are directly in line with what ACOSS told us to do as a start: to take it up the scale. The next stage, in my view, should be as ACOSS has recommended, extending it to SG.
Finally, I want to deal with how many people will pick it up. I quoted these figures earlier, but they are worth quoting again because I think Senator Brown missed that part of the debate. The figures which Treasury has put up are based on current experience with the low-income earners' rebate. They are all that Treasury can put up, but they do not take into account the possible behavioural effects that offering an incentive of this sort would have. It is worth quoting yet again the research that IFSA had done by market research company Eureka Strategic Research. It went out and asked people in various income ranges whether they make voluntary contributions now and whether they would be prepared to make voluntary contributions if the government offered them a dollar-for-dollar rebate. Just looking at the two key areas of those earning $20,000 to $30,000 and $30,000 to $40,000, according to this research, of those earning $20,000 to $30,000, 19 per cent said they make contributions now and 33 per cent said they would be prepared to make contributions if they were offered dollar-for-dollar contributions. For those in the $30,000 to $40,000 range, 20 per cent said they make contributions now and 41 per cent said they would make co-contributions if they were offered dollar-for-dollar concessions. That suggests there will be a behavioural response and that is why this measure is worth having.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I happened to walk in when Senator John Cherry was making a very self-righteous comment about Senator Brown and his participation in the processes of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. It stirred me into action for one reason, Senator John Cherry. One should realise that the Democrats are not without some shame in this area themselves— 
—I read all the Hansards and all the committee reports.
—That is very good, but that is different from participating in the Senate process. I remember one day I stood up in this chamber on a very important bill and the Democrats had not participated in the process in any way whatsoever but chose to use the committee stage, which is the right of any senator in this place, to debate the bill. I would encourage all senators, if they have an interest in any bill, to attend the appropriate hearing on the bill, but please do not stand up here and throw stones when you are in a glass house yourself.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-17,"—On that last point, I think the record of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is well known. It has been an incredibly activist committee over the last 12 years—with a couple of years break—and has been ably chaired by Senator Watson, who is chairing the committee stage at the moment. I think it would be very unrealistic to have expected Senator Brown to have fronted up to more than perhaps a handful of those hearings.
—I looked in, saw that there were six Democrats and thought, `It can't be important'!
—We have got to have that interjection on the record. But just as we know the Democrats struggle to get to estimates committees because of the number of Democrats, Senator Brown, certainly up until the last election, was by himself. It is just a bit unfair to castigate him for not attending Senate superannuation committee hearings. If you look at the number of committee hearings there are, and it is part of the effective process of this chamber, there are literally weeks on end when there are one or more Senate committees meeting on the same day, during the non-sitting periods of parliament in particular. Senator Brown and I have had very fierce exchanges on a lot of issues, but on this issue I think the criticism that was launched at him was just a bit unreasonable.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-17,"—In the few minutes that are left before we have to terminate the debate tonight I want to make some comments about the anticipated behavioural changes that this carefully targeted measure is likely to have on low-income earners. Senator Cherry in fact outlined some of the comments I was about to make about the figures that have been based on the low-income rebate, where there was not a high take-up rate. Those figures were probably not the best, although they are the only ones available to Treasury to make current estimates.
It is a very well-targeted measure and I would hope that everyone in this chamber would support what we are trying to do for low-income earners. It is not a bad thing we are doing here tonight or tomorrow, whenever we get this passed—this is overwhelmingly important. It is a very important step to try to provide something that low-income earners do not currently have, and that is some assistance with saving. I have been astounded by the debate, which has sought to be disparaging about a measure that really can do nothing but have a good effect, I would have thought. I want to very quickly respond to Senator Brown and his question about Mr Andren's bill. Of course, those matters do not actually fall within my portfolio responsibilities.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2003-09-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
It is important in our modern society that communications be developed to a point that takes advantage of the technologies that exist. This has been the case throughout history, and there have been some dramatic advances at various points in history. Australia Post and its predecessors have always played a very important role in this. Sending things like mail is as old as the written word, but transmitting has at various times in history been fairly problematic.
In James A. Michener's book TheCovenant, the story of the settlement of South Africa, he tells of sailors in the 17th century pulling in for water and other supplies before there was any settlement at the Cape of Good Hope and leaving in a cave the mail that they wanted sent back to England. The ship coming the other way months later would pick it up and take it back to England. Sometimes it would take 18 months to two years for a letter to actually arrive back in England. Contrast this with email and the way in which we can so rapidly change and move information in the age we are now living in.
Moving on from the story of South Africa at that time, we come to the beginning of the 20th century, particularly at the time of Federation, when we set up the Australian postal system in this country. What we did was actually quite dramatic. We take this all for granted nowadays but, just think, over 100 years ago we set up the first universal service obligation with the post. It was the same price to send a letter anywhere in Australia—and of course it still is today. But just think about what we are doing. If you send a letter from Parliament House to Civic, it will cost you 50c. If you send it from here to Port Hedland, it will cost 50c. We have the same price across Australia for the standard post—the first universal service obligation. It is absolutely marvellous that we provide that service in Australia Post. In terms of providing communications and helping build the fabric of Australian society it has certainly done a marvellous job. 
We have to look at where a postal service goes in the information age from this point. I caught on Sky News tonight the story of the British postal strike. One of the problems British post is having is competition from new technologies. With the rise of email a lot of people, instead of sending things through the physical post, are now sending them by email. British post is struggling in the face of this change.
So what is happening with Australia Post? I had a look at the Statement of Corporate Intent 2003-05 tonight to pick up from its mission and vision something that might relate to that. It says in its mission and vision `to innovate easy-to-use products and services and use modern efficient networks' and, in terms of values, Australia Post will `recognise and contribute and will share its success and, where Post falls short, find constructive and efficient solutions.' It concludes, `Post will encourage innovation and continuous improvement in everything that it does.'
I really could not pick up from this entire document, which was about vision and mission and objectives, where it is already going in terms of the information age. There is a warning in Britain of what would happen in the future. I will just draw an analogy with what happened with the American railroads. The American railroads thought that they were in the railroad business and did not realise that they were in the transport business.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-09-17,"—Tonight I want to pay tribute to a very keen Work for the Dole crew in the bayside area of Greater Brisbane. In doing so, I want to commend the innovative environmental work of the Redlands IndigiScapes Centre at Capalaba and the great support of the Redland Shire Council under Mayor Don Seccombe. It is often said that everyone needs to focus on a vision, that everyone needs to find a mission and fulfil it. It is often said because it is always right. In today's language, self-confidence and self-help, combined with focused energy, can get you anywhere you want to go. On that point, it is worth remarking that Confucius got it absolutely right when he said:
Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart.
What that says is: do your best. On the question of doing your best, I often like to recall the words of the famous American actor-producer Lucille Ball, who said:
I don't know anything about luck. I've never banked on it, and I'm afraid of people who do. Luck to me is something else; hard work and realising what is opportunity and what isn't.
I believe very strongly that Work for the Dole participants and the far-sighted local councils, such as Redland Shire Council, that support them with worthwhile projects are following that path. Because of this I was very pleased to be present on 18 July to represent the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment Services and to make a very special presentation on their behalf. The Highly Commended Work for the Dole Achievement Award that I presented to the team at the Redlands IndigiScapes Centre was of course a unique tribute to all of the people involved in that project. And what great people they are—go-ahead people, lateral thinking people, people who are keen to do a good job and at the same time help their neighbours and their workmates. That is the Work for the Dole team.
The staff at IndigiScapes have grown a wonderful concept into a great community service, something that puts beautiful native plants into the suburbs, helping to bring back bird life and re-creating a truly Australian environmental experience in our streets. It is a particular tribute to Mayor Don Seccombe of Redland Shire Council that the IndigiScapes operation is as good as it is—and it is very good—and that the service it provides is truly community based. Mayor Seccombe and his council have got right behind this concept.
Work for the Dole provides a unique work experience to many thousands of unemployed Australians each year. The award I presented on 18 July recognises the important part Redlands IndigiScapes Centre and Redland Shire Council have played in the success of the program. It acknowledges the unique concept that IndigiScapes uses to show how local native plants can be used for a range of different garden styles and purposes. This is making a strong contribution to the maintenance and enhancement of the unique environment that we live in here in Australia, even in the suburbs.
Redland Shire Council has a commitment to enhancing the unique flora of our region too, and that shows the best civic spirit of all. It is a real pleasure to know that the centre is used as a meeting place for conservation groups, and is a favourite spot for picnickers, bushwalkers, gardeners, artists, birdwatchers, students and tourists. It is a pleasure too to know that two participants in the award-winning Work for the Dole placement have secured employment with Redland Shire Council and that others have gained valuable experience to improve their employment prospects in the local area, and that is what Work for the Dole is all about. 
Since the coalition government introduced Work for the Dole in 1997, there have been over 215,000 participants, and more than 12,000 activities have benefited communities across Australia. The participants who undertake this fine work benefit by gaining good work experience, improving their work skills, and becoming more motivated to find a job. They are also contributing to the continual enhancement of the sense of community that is the real essence of Australia.
A number of studies have found widespread support for, and the success of, Work for the Dole. One study, the Wallis report on attitudes to Work for the Dole and mutual obligation, found that 89 per cent of people support Work for the Dole. Successes such as the one we celebrated on 18 July, about which I speak tonight, underline the contribution that innovative and energetic people—that is, of course, the overwhelming bulk of Australians—make to programs of this nature.
It bears restating that Work for the Dole is a work experience program based on the principle of mutual obligation. Mutual obligation is a theme the Howard government presses strongly. It is a fair theme—it gives back to the taxpayer something of enduring value for money spent. It is a human development theme—it aims to develop the work habits of participants and involve them and local communities in activities that are of value.
Since July last year, participants in Work for the Dole have been able to volunteer to be part of community action groups or CAGs, as they are known. These groups provide short-term, emergency assistance to bodies such as State Emergency Service organisations and local councils, during or after natural disasters. Again we see the twin themes of mutual obligation and self-help at the centre of the picture.
It is important to note—and I do so tonight in the context of the achievements of IndigiScapes and its Work for the Dole team that I have already outlined—that the Australian economy continues to flourish, with low inflation and interest rates that will further assist economic growth, and we have heard much of that good news in recent days. In the week commencing 3 September, the Westpac-ACCI survey of industrial trends indicated that the Australian economy grew strongly in the quarter to September and expectations are for a significant acceleration in the December quarter.
Employment policy is central to economic advance. The government has a number of achievements in employment policy, most notably the fact that more than 1.2 million jobs have been created since the coalition came to office. Australia's unemployment rate now stands at 5.8 per cent, compared to 10.9 per cent in December 1992. Just in passing, it is worth comparing that figure with the latest for the euro zone in Europe. The euro zone, of course, is the core of the European Union countries that use the euro as their common currency. The European statistics office last week announced that the July unemployment rate in the euro zone was 8.9 per cent, the highest level since November 1999. 
What a contrast. What a stark reminder of the essential and beneficial difference between the policies of economic freedom we pursue here in Australia under the Howard government and the heavy-handed bureaucracy of centralised and politicised control under which the leading economies of continental Europe continue to labour and which the ALP would like to reintroduce in Australia. All this may seem a long way from the activities in Queensland of an innovative environmental operation and an active Work for the Dole team, but it is not really—not if you act locally, think globally. The lesson is there to be learnt.
The government is firmly committed to Work for the Dole. The program shows real partnerships between community groups who sponsor activities, participants and, of course, the community. Many people can play a pivotal role in building work skills and the work ethic, and under the government's Work for the Dole program they can do so to everyone's benefit. And when it is combined with civic values, as in the case of the Redlands IndigiScapes Centre and its innovative program supported by the local council and community, it is doubly a winner and, of course, it deserves applause.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Redlands IndigiScapes Centre</title>,Adjournment,29,1
