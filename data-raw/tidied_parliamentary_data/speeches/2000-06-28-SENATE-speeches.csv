"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I have a question at the outset to the minister. Minister, last night in parts of the discussion you made some reference to inadvertent material in the context of walled gardens on the Internet. Would the government be amenable to an amendment on that issue to try to resolve it?",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—Our position is that we think the regime we have devised is the best that can be put forward under the circumstances. I am conscious that there are those in industry who would argue that even with what seems to be a transparent set of categories you could find that there would be a minor overlap or that in some respects web sites might be caught which, although they might strictly run foul of the genre regime, would not be recognisably televisionlike. That is really all that I was adverting to. We would not want a situation where web sites that were not televisionlike were ruled out so, to the extent that some limited discretion might be available, that might be of assistance. Certainly our primary position is that what is there is adequate, but I can understand what you are putting forward, because it does reflect what other people have put to me about the concerns that they have.
—Minister, are you seeking leave to move your next group of amendments?
—Yes.
Leave granted.
—I move government amendments Nos 14, 15, 17 and 18:
 (14)	Schedule 1, item 91, page 24 (lines 12 to 14), omit ""and any category B digital program-enhancement content (as defined by subclause (15))"".
(15)	Schedule 1, item 91, page 24 (after line 14), after paragraph (c), insert:
	(ca)	ignore a particular item of category B digital program-enhancement content (as defined by subclause (15)), so long as the licensee does not transmit simultaneously any other item of category B digital program-enhancement content; and
(17)	Schedule 1, item 112, page 32 (lines 9 to 11), omit ""and any category B digital program-enhancement content (as defined by subclause (15))"".
(18)	Schedule 1, item 112, page 32 (after line 11), after paragraph (c), insert:
	(ca)	ignore a particular item of category B digital program-enhancement con-tent (as defined by subclause (15)), so long as the national broadcaster does not transmit simultaneously any other item of category B digital program-enhancement content; and 
The purpose of these amendments is to restrict the additional category B digital program enhancement content simultaneous live coverage of overlapping sporting events in the same sport at the same venue which can be transmitted on a free-to-air broadcaster's digital television service to a single program only. The original bill does contain provisions that would enable the carriage of the same sport at the same venue, which is a very limited form of enhancement but does go beyond the position we announced back in December. Nonetheless, in our view it would have very limited effect, because it would probably only cover tennis. That is about the only sport that would readily spring to mind, where you could potentially have—at least, say, in the early stages of Wimbledon, like right now; I was not up last night but I saw that Rafter won in straight sets—a number of games being played on outside courts as well as the main game on the centre court. In those circumstances—being played at the same venue at Wimbledon; a number of different matches all arising out of that same event—we take the view that that form of enhancement is acceptable and certainly in the consumers' interest.
Given that we do also recognise that the secondary matches may well be matters that could be of interest to pay TV operators, this amendment is designed to limit the enhancement to a single program only. In other words, you would only be able to show one additional match. The amendments clarify and constrain the scope of the provisions in the bill which allow free-to-air broadcasters to show as an enhancement another match in a particular sport, such as tennis, provided both matches are live and in the same sport and played at the same venue. The enhancement provisions operate by allowing certain content to be ignored in determining whether a broadcaster is simulcasting the same program in both digital and analog modes.
Amendments Nos 14, 15, 17 and 18 will amend items 91 and 112 of the bill which amended clause 6 of schedule 4 of the BSA. These amendments will restrict the category B digital program enhancement content that is ignored at any particular time to a single television program only. The effect of this is that only one additional match can be shown as an enhancement, rather than a number of separate matches all occurring simultaneously.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I will not take up the Senate's time talking about this except to say that the Democrats will be voting against the amendments. We have considered this very closely, and we believe that the original provisions which did not allow this are probably fairer to pay TV. We have heard the arguments and some of them are quite good, but we have to keep in mind that the pay TV industry would normally get that second tier of the tennis, and it is something that they do rely on. This would make it very likely that they would not get it. Also, people in regional areas would have a more difficult time with this, because they are less likely to get the digital regime as early as people in metropolitan areas. On those grounds, we will be voting against this and we have a couple of amendments later on.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—For Senator Bourne's information, the items we are dealing with, amendment Nos 14, 15, 17 and 18 on sheet EK215, are essentially technical amendments as opposed to amendments of substance.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-28,"—That is not what Senator Alston said. There is a restriction in programming that goes beyond the technical in these amendments, and maybe we should have that cleared up. I would like to take this opportunity to ask, through you, Madam Chairman, whether either Labor or the Democrats have a view to recommitting amendments from last night, when Labor and the Democrats voted against each other's amendments, knocking them out and allowing the government position on datacasting to prevail. I hoped there would have been some communication overnight so that the opposition could improve the situation as far as those datacasting parameters are concerned. I would be interested to know if there will be any effort to recover ground lost by the knock-out situation that occurred last night between the Labor and Democrat positions.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—Ignoring Senator Brown's repetitious grandstanding, I will make it clear that what we contemplate by these provisions is to allow an additional channel to broadcast the same event at the same venue, but it is limited to one program. In other words, if you had a series of matches on the outer courts at Wimbledon right now—which you would have—you would only be able to show one of those in addition to the match on the main court, which would be on the primary channel. For example, if Channel 7 were showing the centre court game, they would be able to show one outside match but not an unlimited number of them.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—These things are all compromises. As I said earlier, it is a matter of recognising that the pay TV industry has previously had an interest in secondary games. To the extent that this might then allow the free-to-air networks to run the second game, at least it is allowing the pay TV operators to run the third and fourth game rather than requiring them to vacate the field entirely so that all matches at the same venue would effectively be within the control of the networks. It recognises that pay TV has a legitimate interest in showing some second order games but also acknowledges that consumers watching the primary event might like to also see, by way of enhancement, one other game on an outer court that is being played at the same time.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I would like to clarify the position of the opposition. We support enhancement generally and, in the context of the amendments currently before the chair, we will support the one channel.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I am sorry to be obtuse about this, but I suspect that the government and the opposition think that this amendment goes to different areas. I thought that the amendment went to the same sport venue that the minister is talking about. I think, though, that the opposition believes the amendment to be something altogether different. If that is the case, it might be sensible if we put this off and discussed whether we were talking about the same thing and dealt with it a bit later.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—I think the situation is that the Labor Party are essentially taking the view that an additional one channel is less restrictive than an unlimited number of additional channels. To that extent, they are supporting what they see as a restriction on what is contained in the bill provision. When we come to voting on the bill provision, we will be asked to decide whether there ought to be an enhancement that allows one additional channel. You may still want to vote against that, but you will only be given a choice between one additional and no additional rather than unlimited and no additional.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I thank the minister for that explanation. I take it then that this is what the ALP are telling me they think it is, and that it does not actually involve the same-venue sport; it is just the additional multichannel. If that is the case, the Democrats would be in favour as well.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—Again, to be clear, it is do with same sport, same venue, but with the way the bill is drafted you would be able to show a number of outside court games at the same time. Your main channel might have the centre court, and you might be able to have two or three other digital standard definition channels. This is in the bill. What I am proposing is a restriction or limitation on that, and Labor is supporting that but without prejudice to the decision that might be taken down the track as to whether there should be any enhancement at all. If you are implacably opposed to the whole regime, you will in due course be voting against any enhancement, and Labor will then have to decide whether it supports any enhancement or a single additional channel enhancement. But we will have removed the current bill provision, which has an option of unlimited additional channels. In other words, we are restricting our original provision. Labor is saying, `At least for present purposes, the choice will be between none and one rather than none and many.' Then you can have your substantive debate and vote down the track.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments Nos 5, 7, 8, 11 and 12 on sheet 1827:
(5)	Schedule 1, item 91, page 24 (lines 11 to 14), omit paragraph (c), substitute:
	(c)	ignore any digital program-enhancement content (as defined by subclause (14)); and
(7)	Schedule 1, item 94, page 25 (line 14), omit ""Category A digital"", substitute ""Digital"".
(8)	Schedule 1, item 94, page 25 (line 15), omit ""category A"".
(11)	Schedule 1, item 94, page 26 (line 7), omit ""category A"".
(12)	Schedule 1, item 94, page 26 (line 13) to page 27 (line 15), omit subclauses (15) to (19).
I should explain all the amendments. We have four sets of amendments to the program enhancement. One of them relates to a 10-minute limit on what can be shown. I do not have any support at all for that one, as far as I know. One of them relates to accidental overlaps of time. I do not know whether I have support on that one. One of them relates to the category A primary program. Many of the five I am moving at the moment relate to same sport, same venue. As I said before, the Democrats are not inclined to support the tennis amendment, which would allow you to see two games from the same venue at the same time. This is because, as Senator Alston himself said, pay TV usually shows the second most interesting game on any tennis tournament, and that is where they get a substantial amount of their revenue from. There is also the problem that regional areas will change over to digital much later than we will in the metropolitan areas.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—Although we have narrowed it, we still take the view that this is in no shape or form multichannelling, which is what the original commitment was, and we adhere to that. We did that quite explicitly to limit the capacity of the free-to-air networks to expand their business cases quite dramatically and have what one would expect to be a significant impact on a growing industry. Given that this is not multichannelling, we believe it is a tightly confined enhancement with the same sport at the same venue at the same time. Very few sports are likely to be affected. We do not think it would significantly impact on the existing business of pay TV operators. We oppose the amendments.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—For the information of the chamber, whilst there is some common ground between the opposition and the Democrats, there is not sufficient common ground. We tend to agree with one sport, one venue, but if these Democrat amendments are defeated we will be next on the list moving opposition amendments Nos 3 to 16, which we think go much further. At this stage, we oppose the Democrat amendments.
Amendments not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 6:
(6)	Schedule 1, item 91, page 24 (line 21), after ""capacity"", insert ""is a program of no more than 30 minutes in length that"".
This amendment is on accidental overlaps of time. Under this amendment, if there is, for instance, a sporting event—and I think that is the only place it would occur—which goes over time, the commercial and national broadcasters would like to be able to put it on the other channel and broadcast at the same time. We hope that this will not apply to the nationals. So far it does. So, if there is an accidental over time limit on, say, a football game or a long game like cricket, golf or perhaps tennis, that game could continue to be shown until it finishes—that is the case in the minister's amendments at the moment—and on the other channel you would have the regularly scheduled program, which would start on time. 
We see that as a problem because it could lead to programming decisions. I am not saying it would, but it could. As the minister has pointed out, you have to be careful of these sorts of things in the current climate. That would give us one program that was, say, three hours long and with that one program you could have an accidental overlap—although perhaps it might not be quite as accidental as it appears—of a sport that could go as long as that program went, even if it were three hours long.
That could lead to—and I am not saying that it would—programming decisions that virtually enable multichannelling on the commercial channels. They would enable it only while the sporting events are on, but it could be a problem. We have heard that nothing will go much over 15 minutes, but I noticed two Sundays ago when I was waiting for the Sunday program to come on at 9 o'clock that there was an accidental overrun of the golf of two hours and 43 minutes. Because they have only one channel to broadcast on, the golf was shown for an extra two hours and 43 minutes, and then we saw the Sunday show. I cannot see why that should not continue to happen. For short overruns—and we have seen evidence from the commercial free-to-airs that, in general, overruns are quite short; they are generally about 15 minutes—that should be allowable. Heaven knows that it is very annoying when something that is really exciting is about to finish and they suddenly change over to another scheduled program. We think a 30-minute overrun time is a more reasonable one than the duration of any program, which I believe is the minister's preferred position. Or perhaps it was the minister's preferred position but I have just argued so brilliantly that he has changed over to my 30 minutes.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—With the greatest respect for Senator Bourne, you have to be a sports fan to appreciate how potentially absurd and highly infuriating an arbitrary 30-minute cut-off would be. Bear this in mind: these are going to be very rare occurrences. This is act of God stuff—unforeseen circumstances, rain delays play and that sort of thing—which is not normally within the power of the otherwise very powerful broadcasters to control. We have not privatised the weather yet, and it would be very difficult for them to manipulate the start of play simply so they could achieve an overrun. We will certainly be expecting the ABA to monitor any possible abuses very closely. I remember when Doug Walters was on 94, we went to the Channel 9 news and he hit a six off the last ball of the day in Perth at the WACA. That was not a half-hour, but if an AFL grand final were coming to a climax and rain had delayed play by 35 minutes, Senator Bourne might be quite happy to tune out with five minutes to go, but I would not be very happy. If it were the 1964 or 1966 grand final, where Collingwood was beaten by less than a goal each time, I would not have been very happy.
—We did win by about seven goals in 1990. I would have been happy to tune out then, because Leigh Matthews has a great theory that, in the modern era, you are home only if you are more goals in front than there are minutes left to play. So, with five minutes to go, we would have won that game.
—Minister, you can leave your comments on Collingwood.
—This is very relevant. I am demonstrating to Senator Bourne why an arbitrary 30-minute cut-off could be very aggravating indeed and would not achieve any useful purpose. You are only trying to accommodate a situation where something has been delayed by forces beyond your control to enable it to be completed. We do not want that to be manipulated in any shape or form. It will be very rare to have these situations. But, if people are wanting to watch those sporting events, they ought to be allowed to watch them until completion. That is our point. I do not think it makes sense to draw the line. If we were talking about people being able to artificially schedule so that you could have overlaps on a regular basis, that is an entirely different proposition. But this is only in unforeseen circumstances, it will occur only very rarely and the last thing I would want is for the program to be prematurely closed down if I had taken the option of staying with the sporting event. ",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I would like to make two points about that. Currently, the regime we have is that you do not have to turn the sport off. If it looks hugely exciting and it has only 10 minutes, half an hour or even an hour to run, you can leave it on. You just have to put off your regularly scheduled program. The minister said that he did not want to see a cut-off to one program. He has his own cut-off written in. I understand the minister's suggestion on this is that it be allowed to run as a multichannel to the end of one program. Programs may be movies, and they may be quite long, but in general they are only half an hour or an hour. So he has his own cut-off built into his scheme, and his cut-off is half an hour or an hour—in general, unless we are looking at a movie or something which is deliberately scheduled to be very long when it is thought that something else might go very long, such as the golf or the tennis. But there is the possibility of doing that. So, firstly, there is no necessity to cut off the sport as there is no necessity now to cut off the sport. It is always a programming decision whether that happens or not. Secondly, the minister already has his own cut-off built into his own piece of this legislation. His cut-off, though, is half an hour or an hour to any program; mine is 30 minutes to any program.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—I do not quite know why Senator Bourne thinks I have a cut-off built into my arrangement. I do not. I thought the example you gave at the outset was based on your concern that you should not have had to put up with the golf for another couple of hours when you wanted to watch the Sunday program. If that is right, by allowing the golf event to be completed on the second channel, you would be able to watch the Sunday program on time. All it is doing is providing flexibility and not putting the programmers in that very difficult situation. You or someone else might want to see the Sunday program start right on time, and others might say, `I don't care how long the golf goes for, I want to see it to the end.' Both of them are legitimate points of view, and we are trying to accommodate both. If you simply say that, to finish the golf, you ought to defer the start of the Sunday program—or whatever else it might be—you are coming down on the side of the sporting fan whereas I thought your starting point was that the sporting fan should not be accommodated for any more than 30 minutes. You end up punishing both if you allow a 30-minute overlap and nothing more.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—Minister, I may have this wrong. If this amendment does not go through, will there be a limit on accidental overruns? I had assumed through reading the legislation—though I must say it was a long time ago—that there would be a limit, and the limit would be to the end of the program that was on. But perhaps I am wrong and perhaps there is not a limit at all, in which case I am even more worried about it and I would be keener to have a 30-minute limit. ",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—No, you would only be worried if you thought that unforeseen circumstances such as weather or acts of God—lightning strikes and the like—were going to be regular occurrences. But they are not. This is simply catering for the very occasional happening. 
—But there is a limit.
—No, there is not a time limit. It is to enable the completion of the event; that is all. It may be only five minutes.
—It may be two, three or four hours. 
—It may be but, again, you cannot possibly try to strike a moving average of how long unforeseen weather circumstances normally delay the completion of a game for. It is an utterly unpredictable event; it happens only very rarely. Our proposition is that those who have started watching that event ought to be allowed to watch it to completion, however long or short that is.  
So the notion of imposing an arbitrary cut-off point runs entirely contrary to that fundamental consumer preference to be allowed to see the completion of the event, and that is not time dependent. That depends on factors beyond your control. If we thought for a moment that the broadcasters could manipulate that, we would be very worried indeed. We will monitor it to ensure that there is not any artificial manipulation. But it is very hard to see at first glance how there could be. 
The starting and finishing point ought to be to try to accommodate as many viewers as possible. Those wanting to watch a sporting event do not want to just see another 30 minutes; they want to see the completion. It might be only five minutes; it might be more than 30 minutes—who knows. The cricket can be washed out for a whole day. There are matches that have been washed out without a ball being played. On the other hand, they can go off the field for five minutes. 
It should not occur very often but, when it does, the overriding concern ought to be to accommodate those who want to see the game through to completion. Those people will not say, `Well, another 30 minutes is better than nothing.' They will say, `So what—all you have done is heighten my interest and then you have chopped me down with five minutes to go.' Therefore, we think the notion of time limiting is fundamentally opposed to the interests of consumers. Where I think you should take comfort is from the fact that this will occur very infrequently and in entirely unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the broadcaster.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I just want to clear this up. Paragraphs (d)(i) and (ii) of clause 91 is where I got the impression that we were going to the end of one program. Paragraph (d)(ii) reads: 
... the other television program broadcast using that multi-channelling transmission capacity was scheduled at least one week before the start of the designated event ... 
I assumed that meant one television program being broadcast. I assumed that the minister's intent was that the overrun could go to the end of the other television program that was being broadcast. I assumed that was one scheduled program and not an entire schedule of a free-to-air television station. Can the minister explain whether or not that was his intent in that clause?",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—I am rather puzzled at the suggestion that the combination of (d)(i) and (ii) amounts to saying that you could only delay one program but not the succeeding program. Paragraph (d) reads: 
... ignore a particular television program transmitted ... where: 
(i) the program is a scheduled program that provides live coverage of a designated event ...
That all seems to be fairly neutral. It goes on:
... and
(ii) the other television program broadcast using that multi-channelling transmission capacity was scheduled at least one week before the start of the designated event. 
I understand that to mean that you could not suddenly put the golf on at short notice. It would have to be an event that had been scheduled at least a week ahead of, say, the Sunday program on Channel 9. 
—Okay, I understand. 
—So you cannot just bring something in at the last minute. These have to be events that are set out well ahead. I suppose you could say they should be sufficiently far ahead that you could not take advantage of the likelihood of bad weather—in the UK, maybe even a week would be too short because in the middle of winter you might be reasonably confident that it will be washed out. It is a very long bow to draw. It is simply designed to ensure there is no last-minute fiddling or positioning of programming in such a way that you might be able to claim that a sporting event has been washed out and should therefore be allowed to run in conjunction with another scheduled event. It just gives that extra degree of comfort that the exceptions only apply where they are in relation to events that have been already scheduled well in advance.

(9)	Schedule 1, item 94, page 25 (lines 27 to 30), omit paragraphs (h) and (i), substitute:
	(h)	having regard to the subject matter of the content, it would be concluded that:
	(i)	the sole purpose of the transmission of the content is to enhance a television program (the primary program); and
	(ii)	the content is ancillary or incidental to the primary program; and
This amendment places limits on category A program enhancements to ensure that the bill is consistent with the original stated intention that enhancements be directly linked to the primary program. That is what we came up with, I think, two years ago. The concern has been expressed that the proposed form of words links programs on the basis of shared subject matter rather than linking them to the primary program. This could permit forms of de facto multichannelling. Obviously, subject matter is much broader than linking to the primary program. We would like to keep it narrow to ensure that multichannelling does not accidentally happen because of that.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—Our concern has always been that the enhancement ought to relate to the subject matter of the primary program. That is why we talk in terms of being closely and directly linked. I think the term `ancillary or incidental' did have some currency a year or so back. But the general view was that these words did not quite make sense in this context. If you ask yourself how something can be ancillary or incidental to the main program, it does not seem to necessarily mean that it relates to the same subject matter. What is it? It could cover almost anything. It could be very narrow. We think the primary requirement is that the matter should be directly and closely linked. In that way you know exactly what you are allowed to do. It has to be, if you like, an extension of the main program. 
If you say it is `ancillary or incidental', `incidental' could mean irrelevant. If that is the case, there is no justification at all; that is classic multichannelling. If it is `ancillary to', does that mean it is just not as important as or that it has some sort of tangential relevance? Again, I think both of those terms are moving further away from enhancements and more into the category of multichannelling. I can remember—it must be at least 12 months ago—looking at those terms and perhaps even using them at some stage and then realising that they did not achieve the purpose that we wanted to achieve. I think Senator Bourne is quite rightly concerned to keep these enhancements away from the multichannelling arena. But the way you do that is to say that they should be directly and closely linked. I think you just open it up to much more uncertainty if you use words as vague and ambiguous as `ancillary or incidental'.

The minister for communications, Senator Alston, released a media statement on 21 December 1999 indicating the government's policy approach to the scope of the enhanced services free-to-air commercial television broadcasters would be able to provide within the digital environment. The 1998 framework legislation provided for additional `incidental and directly linked programming by commercial free-to-air television broadcasters'. The term `incidental and directly linked' was not defined in that legislation. 
The minister's announcement on 21 December stated that the government would allow free-to-air broadcasters to provide digital enhancements to their main simulcast programs, provided that they are directly linked to and contemporaneous with the main program. This could take the form of additional camera angles on a sports match, statistics about a player or additional information about a segment in a lifestyle or magazine program. Multichannelling when dealing with overlaps—for example, to allow the end of a sporting match to be shown even if it runs over time and clashes with a news bulletin which commences on its scheduled time—was the parameter the minister laid down at that time.
The opposition's policy approach to this debate is that we propose to amend the govern-ment's enhanced services framework to reflect more accurately the framework announ-ced back in December of last year. This will be done by: firstly, maintaining enhanced ser-vice provisions for free-to-air broadcasters at the level described by the government's Dec-ember 1999 announcements; secondly, allow-ing simultaneous transmission of content additional to the primary broadcast content, provided that the additional content has a direct and obvious link with the primary broad-cast; and, thirdly, allowing overlap of broadcasts where an unexpected delay or extension in the time of one broadcast coincides with the scheduled broadcast of a news bulletin. These amendments achieve clarification of the relevant provisions in the bill so that the scope of enhanced services in the bill is consistent with the minister's policy announcement.
In summary, we seek to remove the category B enhancements from clause 94 of the bill. The reason for our proposed amendment is that it removes category B enhancements from the bill, as these clearly go beyond the scope of enhanced services proposed by the minister last December. Removal of the category B enhanced services makes the bill's provisions consistent with the minister's previous policy indications of what would comprise enhanced programming. 
In terms of category A amendments, in summary, we amend category A enhancements to reflect a new single category model and refer to all enhanced services content by the generic term `digital program enhancement content'. The apparent breadth of category A program enhancements in the bill includes video programming with a subject matter that is closely and directly linked to the subject matter of the primary program; our amendments restrict that so that de facto multichannelling is not allowed. The specific amendment requires a direct and obvious link with the primary broadcasts and refers to all enhanced service content using the generic term `digital program enhancement content'. The amendments ensure that broadcasters cannot simultaneously broadcast stand-alone separate programs—such as a rerun or a different program of the same series of a sequential drama program, sitcom or miniseries—at the same time as the primary program or a secondary program which has an indirect link to the primary program; for example, a secondary program in which an actor stars where that actor was a special guest on another program.
Finally, the amendments achieve this by clarifying the examples in item 94 of the bill, subclause 614, schedule 4, that video highlights from past matches and each player's ranking and career highlights are considered a program enhancement pursuant to category A so that they do not amount to multichannelling. In terms of the overlap amendment, briefly in summary, the amendment conditions for free-to-air enhanced service transmissions will specify that overlap multichannel transmissions may only occur where the overlap involves a scheduled news program. Our reasons for that amendment are these. The bill makes specific provision for overlap multichannelling in the amendments to clause 6(8), schedule 4, of the Broadcasting Services Act. The circumstances where this kind of multichannelling is permitted are considerably more extensive than originally contemplated. The minister's announcement of 21 December 1999 clearly indicated that multichannelling would be permitted where events ran into a news bulletin. The new clause allows multichannelling where the overlap is into any scheduled program. The provisions are substantially different from those previously proposed. An overlap of broadcasts, where there is an unexpected delay or extension in the time of one of the broadcasts, will be allowed when the overlap coincides with the broadcast of a scheduled news program.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—There are two separate matters that are being dealt with here, and I would really like to separate them. The first one is in relation to same sport/same venue. I think we have already had that discussion. We have narrowed it down to the proposition that you should be allowed to have one additional event or one additional game broadcast at the same time as the game on, say, the main court. That is a very separate issue from the question of whether or not you ought to confine overlaps to news. In some respects, I think it might be easier if these were dealt with and voted on separately.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-06-28,"—The example that was given was Wimbledon and matches on other courts. The virtue of this is that it has got realtime and, if you have a high definition TV set, it is very clear, et cetera. Minister, if a high definition television set will cost about $20,000, how many times could a tennis enthusiast go to Wimbledon and back for that particular cost? We really do have to put these things into perspective. I do not want to repeat what I said last night, but I think that is just indicative of the fact that we seem to be talking of things in an unreal world.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—Senator Harradine, if we were talking about only the availability of true HD television and only accessing that through a new HD set, then indeed one could expect a fairly limited audience, but we are not. Given that parliament has mandated that all free-to-air networks should simulcast in both HD and SD—sometimes described as `triplecasting'—you will be able to access multiple channels through a standard definition set-top box, which one would expect to cost a few hundred dollars—we would hope $500 or less. 
—It is more like $7,000, isn't it?
—These prices move around, but a lot of people buy video cassette recorders and digital video disks and the like and pay what might to some people seem to be significant sums of money, but it does not seem to deter quite a lot of people from actually accessing new technology opportunities. If you are able to buy a standard definition set-top box for under $1,000—as I think many people would be able to afford to do—then you would have the opportunity of accessing more than one channel at the same time. Given that seven megahertz gives you 20 megabits and a standard definition channel takes up about three to four—sport maybe a bit more—you certainly have the capability of transmitting more than one standard definition channel at the same time. Given that we are proposing only one additional match, you would be able to get both of those channels by getting the cheap option—the standard definition set-top box. I think it is reasonably affordable for the masses.
Reverting to this batch of amendments put forward by the opposition, I think they should be dealt with separately. I understand the argument that you are not comfortable even with one additional channel on the enhancements, and we ought to vote on that. If Senator Bishop is really trying to hold me to a statement that we made back last December on the basis that somehow we said that overlaps should only apply in relation to news, I would, firstly, argue that that is not right—that we were simply using that as an example. More importantly, it is the issue of principle: that is, if there are very occasional circumstances in which weather or other acts of God make it desirable to allow an overlap, that should not then be artificially constrained by whether or not it runs up against the news. As a matter of principle, once you accept that you can have the occasional overlap, then it should not be determined by whether or not the news is coming up. We said in the press release of 21 December:
The Government will allow the broadcasters to multichannel when dealing with 'overlaps' —for example, to allow the end of a sporting match to be shown even if it runs over time and clashes with a news bulletin which commences at its scheduled time. 
We were really just picking out the news as the best example, because probably Senator Bourne, if she is not a sports fan, would be most upset if the news was delayed, rather than if Home and Away was delayed. She might not be in the majority of the Australian population, but probably most people in this chamber would regard the news as the single most important event. All we are saying is that it should not be confined to that; the news is the best example that most of us could relate to. But if the principle is that on those odd occasions you ought to allow overlaps, then there should not be those sorts of limitations placed on them.
I simply appeal to the opposition, in the first instance, to reconsider the basis on which they have put forward these amendments, because I think they have proceeded on a false premise: that is, they are holding us to what they think our previous position was—that overlaps should be only allowed if they run up against news. That is not so, and I think I have demonstrated that. I am happy to table that press release if it assists Senator Bourne or Senator Bishop. Insofar as you are endeavouring to hold us to what you say is an earlier and different position, I say that this press release demonstrates that that is not so; but, even more fundamentally, the principle ought to be that on the rare occasions when overlaps occur their fate should not be determined by whether or not it is the news that they run up against. It should be any program, because we are trying to accommodate the interests of those who want to see the sporting event. That seems to me to be something that should be accommodated, irrespective of whether or not it is the news that is running in parallel. I am happy to provide that press release of 21 December to Senator Bishop so that he can at least ensure that we are both discussing the same position adopted by the government. 
—I've read it.
—Therefore, you accept, I trust, that all you are doing is putting forward the most readily identifiable example rather than saying that, in any shape or form, you wanted it to apply only to news.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I have listened to what the minister has said. If he wishes to table the press release, the opposition does not have any objection to that, but the minister can be assured that, in our deliberations leading up to this debate, we have had considerable reference to, firstly, the act of 1998 and, secondly, a series of policy announcements including, most importantly, the December 1990 press statement put out by the government. The opposition does not accept the argument by the minister that the reference to a news program or news bulletin was by way of example. We have always understood that that was the primary and dominant objective of the government. The sentence referred to in the press release might be categorised as an example but, more accurately—this was our understanding and is our understanding—it was the primary intent of the government at that time.
If it has changed subsequent to that, we have not been party to those discussions and negotiations and are not aware of it. Indeed, we are confirmed in our position by the approaches and lobbying we have received on this issue by the free-to-air broadcasters, who have, almost without exception, in their discussions with the opposition referred to news programs and news bulletins in the context of overlap and nothing else. 
The reason we hold to the importance of news programs and news bulletins is that they are on at a scheduled time every day of the week and there is a clear public interest component in accessibility to the news. It is common knowledge that a lot of families either have their evening meal around the TV set watching the news or have their meal prior to the news so that they can be informed of the day's events. If other programs that may or may not be scheduled before or after the evening news are to be altered or changed because of extraneous events, that, in our view, is a commercial decision of a commercial nature made by the broadcasters. But in terms of the news there is a clear public interest in that issue at that time of night. So the opposition is not receptive to the government's suggestion that this series of amendments be divided, and we wish to vote on them en bloc.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—Seeing that Senator Bishop is a lost cause, can I appeal to Senator Bourne to simply look at what is in that press release and to take Senator Bishop at face value insofar as he believes he is trying to hold us to our December position. I am happy to be held to my December position. My December position was one of principle that overlaps should be allowed and that they should not be determined by what other event they might run up against. We simply gave what is the classic example and what no doubt for shorthand purposes would be given as the classic example by the free-to-airs. But that does not mean they were saying they only want it for news. I do not think it is a matter of what they want. It ought to be a matter of what is the principle. If you allow overlaps, then you are trying to accommodate the interests of those wanting to see the overlapping programs through to completion. The sporting event, again, is the principal example. Therefore, whatever it runs up against, it ought to be allowed to be completed. It should not be determined only by whether or not the news happens to be around the corner. 
We might all regard news as the best example and be most put out if news were delayed, but that should not derogate from the general principle that overlaps are there to enable the completion of the event which has been delayed through circumstances beyond the control of the broadcaster and, therefore, in order to accommodate the interests of consumers. Once you accept the principle—even if Senator Bourne did to a 30-minute extent—if we are now talking about overlaps per se, then by all means hold me to that December press release, because that was the whole basis of what Senator Bishop argued.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—The fact that my amendment was defeated does not mean I do not still think it is the best idea. I therefore think that the second best idea is Senator Bishop's amendment, although I do accept from the minister's press release that he was not only talking about news bulletins when he was talking about overlaps. Despite that, I think scheduled programs can be changed if there is a particularly exciting news event. I cannot imagine that anybody is not going to show the last five minutes of a really exciting football match because another program is scheduled. Nothing in this forces people to cut off exciting moments of sport. What it does is say that the opposition believes that the news is probably the most significant event that people tune in to every day at the same time and watch—I certainly do and probably everybody I know does—but that, if there is going to be an overlap and if we are going to allow the free-to-airs to multichannel, then they should be able to do it only on that really important point of news. But apart from that they can keep showing the sports program. They will just be making another program late. Based on my own amendment, I think that is probably a second best amendment to support. The other ALP amendments look remarkably familiar to me. I think we just voted them down when they were mine. Seeing they are the same as mine, I am going to be voting for them.

I could not undertake in advance that we would implement every outcome, but we certainly proceed on the basis that it is a very important issue. We want provisions to enable spectrum clearance to occur as efficiently and as effectively as possible. We want the review to occur as quickly as possible to tell us what the options are; and some of those options, as you are probably well aware, could be controversial in terms of moving some of the broadcasters from part of the spectrum to elsewhere. You will have heard of the term `polluter pays'. All these things do deserve proper consideration. It would be wrong for us to simply try to force them now, irrespective of the consequences.

 (Senator Sherry)—We will take it that you are not moving them. We will move on to the next amendments, Senator Bourne. 
—I believe these are the amendments that relate to multichannelling for the national broadcasters, both the ABC and the SBS. I have had discussions with the ABC, the SBS, the ALP, the government and various other people on this. The ALP put up exactly the same amendment as I did on this. I think it has been agreed that it would be better if that amendment were changed. If the ALP would like to move an amendment to this amendment to change the words `is in accordance with the charter of the national broadcaster' to `is a national broadcasting service in accordance with section 13', I would be more than happy to agree to that amendment. Because I view this as so important, and I believe the ALP also views it as so important, I would be happy to move that amended amendment in conjunction with the ALP. So it would be a joint amendment. But I would be interested to hear what Senator Bishop has to say about that. 
—My understanding, Senator Bourne, is that the particular concerns you have raised have been accommodated in the ALP amendment and that we are going to move it together. With respect, I suggest that if you withdrew your amendment we could then move the opposition amendment together.

35  Multi-channelling in and after simulcast period
If there is a simulcast period for a coverage area, nothing in this Act prevents a national broadcaster, either during or after the end of the simulcast period for a coverage area, from using multi-channel transmission capacity to broadcast television programs in SDTV digital mode in that area, where:
	(a)	the programs are in addition to programs that are broadcast simultaneously by the national broadcaster in both analog and SDTV digital mode in that area; and
	(b)	the broadcast of the programs is a national broadcasting service in accordance with section 13.
I thank Senator Bourne for that cooperation. In this discussion on multichannelling concerning the national broadcasters, the government has imposed a prohibition on multichannelling by the national broadcasters in the bill. The rationale for the government's decision to prohibit multichannelling by the national broadcasters is not easily ascertained, as we understand from later discussions related to the embryonic or emerging pay TV industry. It has been made patently clear by the national broadcasters that they regard multichannelling as critical to their future. The capacity to multichannel pursuant to their charters is important because it will enable them to better fulfil their charters, giving viewers real additional choice by allowing more programming to be showcased and at times that suit their audiences. It will allow the ABC and the SBS to program content with a regional focus and for the SBS to program additional Australian and multicultural content within that focus and be more cost effective and encourage a take-up of digital technology to the benefit of the industry as a whole. Even the commercial free-to-air TV stations indicated at the Senate inquiry that they did not and do not oppose multichannelling by the ABC and the SBS, provided that multichannelling is within the charters of the two national broadcasters. 
The government's decision to prohibit multichannelling is short-sighted and, to the opposition, has no valid justification. Without amendment, the prohibition will have a detrimental impact on the national broadcasters into the future. Labor's policy position is clear: we believe that it is appropriate to allow the national broadcasters to multichannel consistent with the operation of their respective charters. The reasons for our amendment are brief. Significant sections of the industry have come out in support of permitting multichannelling by the ABC and the SBS. We do not understand there to be any valid justification for denying the national broadcasters the ability for multichannelling, particularly when those arguments are balanced against the resultant benefits. So the amendment, in detail, allows the ABC and the SBS to multichannel. This amendment provides for removal of the prohibition on multichannelling by the ABC and the SBS to permit them to multichannel within the constraints of their representative charters, and the charter based restrictions on multichannel services offered by the national broadcasters are to be defined in clause 115 of the bill.  
In summary, from the outset of this discussion the government have had a clear policy position that the national broadcasters should not be able to multichannel. The ALP has sought to get a firm understanding of the rationale behind that decision of the government. In our discussions with the government, we have not been persuaded of the merit of their view. That is really the negative side of the debate. The positive side of the debate, as far as the opposition are concerned, is that we believe there is a pivotal, necessary and vitally ongoing important role for the national broadcasters in public debate in this country. We believe they should be adequately funded by government to carry out the tasks set out in their charters as determined by their boards. We believe they make an important contribution to public life in this country. As they make an important contribution to public life in this country, we believe that there is a reverse onus on government—and it does not matter if the current government or the opposition should be in government—to adequately fund and hence protect that important public contribution that the national broadcasters make to public life. Part and parcel of that important contribution to public life and public discussion is the ability for those broadcasters to change, reflecting altered consumer desires, patterns or wants. But, more importantly in terms of capital investment and investment in new technologies, it is no good leaving our national broadcasters back using technology that is now out of date and that will be increasingly irrelevant. The switch to digital is on. The switch to multichannelling is on. The switch to enhanced services may not be going down the road as quickly as the government desires, but I am sure that issue is going to be revisited over the next four or five years.
In that debate, we believe there is an obligation upon government—either a conservative government or a Labor government—to adequately fund our national broadcasters to carry out the role that has been allocated to them by the parliament of this country. Critical to that is continuing capital investment in terms of equipment and necessary changes in terms of broadcast technology. Multichannelling is important because it enables the national broadcasters to provide information, delivery of services and topical material not just to the big cities, where most of us live and receive quite valuable services from both the commercials and the national broadcasters, but also to the outlying parts of our country outside the major capital cities, where the level of service—as we know from a whole range of debates—is not what it should be. The ABC and the SBS can make a major contribution to improving the standard of service and the range of information and the comment that persons living in rural and regional Australia can enjoy.
One of the critical matters in our deliberations in the multichannelling debate has been that rural and regional Australia should not be denied the benefits of technology. They should enjoy the progress that we are all enjoying as technology penetrates our society and the provision of technology becomes cheaper and hence the provision of services becomes cheaper. We are alarmed that the government does not wish to adequately fund the necessary changes in terms of the way the national broadcasters operate. We believe that multichannelling is critical to their future. They have repeatedly said it to us privately and they have certainly, in a number of inquiries, been on the public record as saying that multichannelling is important to their future. The opposition is of the view that that is a legitimate desire and want, and this amendment is moved accordingly.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I am very pleased to move this amendment with the opposition. I think that their wording is probably a technical improvement on our own, to start with. I am sure that the entire chamber is only too aware that I could go on in long and tedious detail about the importance of the ABC and about the underfunding of the ABC. I absolutely agree with what Senator Bishop said. I am sure that the minister, when this goes through—as I am sure it will—will go back and reconsider his oversight in the last budget in not having given the ABC enough money, so that they will find it very difficult to create digital content, seeing that they have not been funded to do it. I am sure that that was just a dreadful oversight and that the money will be forthcoming in the next budget—if not before, as I certainly hope. The ABC and SBS should certainly be able to multichannel. There is just no question about it. You have probably heard this speech a few times before, but the innovations that we see on our screens most often come from that area. Enabling the ABC and SBS to multichannel is a huge step forward in this debate. 
I note, too, that I did not think the minister was all that averse to multichannelling for the ABC and SBS when he set up the first bill. It is a pity that he has come down against it now. It certainly was the overwhelming agreement of the committee on which Senator Bishop and I sat that multichannelling for ABC and SBS would be a good thing. There was little disagreement with that, and people would be interested to see what the ABC and SBS could do with multichannelling, particularly with so few funds. It will certainly be a very interesting thing to see. I am very pleased to join Senator Bishop in moving this amendment and I look forward to it going through and to the minister therefore seeing the error of his ways in his funding of the ABC, so that in the next budget it should be hugely increased.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—I look forward to the Democrats being in government. I can see we are going to have a very serious budget deficit problem if that were ever to eventuate. I presume that it is not really a Trojan horse for you to say that the ABC would want dramatically increased funding to enable it to multichannel. I do not think that is the opposition's view. The debate ought to proceed more in terms of what is a fair regime and what is generally in the national interest. The starting point is that we do have very good quality commercial free-to-air television in this country. I think that is generally accepted on all sides. Most of us have been overseas and have seen what is on offer elsewhere. You come back and, much and all as you do not immediately rush out and turn on the commercial networks, when you do that you are constantly grateful. I say in passing that I remember being in the United States during the Atlanta Olympics, which I did not attend, and being appalled at the very poor quality of the network coverage in the US. I was told that it was deliberate, because the sports aficionados would watch it anyway and that the only way you would get in the masses was to dumb it down and to have a whole series of soft, human interest interviews with the next-door neighbour of the cousin of the high jumper who won in 1948 and that sort of nonsense. You did not get any highlights packages, you did not get a gold medal tally and you did not even get the main events. To me, that was a classic example of the differences between the quality of free-to-air in this country and elsewhere.
I can understand an argument that says, `Look, the ABC is quite different from the commercials.' Indeed, when we reviewed this whole area we said we would look at whether it was appropriate to allow the ABC and SBS to multichannel, but it was on two conditions. One was that they would have to do it in accordance with their charter. The opposition might have changed the wording, because the charter is not technically referred to in the act, I do not think, but our objection, in a sense, to the charter has always been that it is all things to all people. Brian Johns used to be out there on a regular basis saying, `No need to change the charter because it enables us to do whatever we want to do,' which is exactly our criticism of it. It ought to be more focused. It ought to make it clear that priorities ought to be given to regional coverage—news and current affairs, children's programs and the like. If that is the case, then it seems to me that you move right away from those activities of the ABC directly into the commercial realm if you allow full and unrestricted multichannelling.
I note with interest that the new managing director says that ratings are not a sin. I personally have never advocated that the ABC should simply be in the ratings game. What I have always said is that they should benchmark, and they should know in advance before they schedule a program what outcomes they expect. If it is a science program on Radio National, no-one expects it to be a runaway winner. But you ought to have some sense of how many people you expect to listen to it and, if you do not achieve that objective, then you rethink your position. The best way of judging success may be to say, `If we expect a four per cent audience and we get a one per cent, then we ought to think twice—or probably three times—before continuing it. We ought to look at whether we shouldn't have a better allocation of resources and put on a different program schedule.' I do not argue in favour of ratings per se, but I do accept the managing director's point that the ABC has to be as relevant as possible to the majority of Australians; that it has to ensure that it is catering for an audience. It is no use saying, `Well, I'm a programmer. I believe in quality. I'm disappointed if the public don't like it, but I can tell you I haven't compromised my standards.' I think that is an unjustified indulgence. But if the ABC is going to become more commercial and is going to buy in more programming from the US instead of, or in addition to, the UK, and we are to find a whole new bunch of sitcoms and what might loosely be called `mainstream programming', it does not strike me that that is the sort of thing that Senator Bourne would say is morally and spiritually uplifting to see on a second channel. Indeed, multichannelling presumably means you could run a number of channels at the same time. To what purpose? All you are really doing is becoming a de facto commercial broadcaster, and that was the second concern we had: that the ABC ought to be a quality alternative to the commercials. 
If you ask what the purpose was of the parliament originally supporting an ABC, it was not to be a pale imitation or a simulacrum of the commercials; it was to be a quality alternative to provide information, education, science and religious programming to regional areas. These are the sorts of things that distinguish the ABC from the commercials. Full and unbridled multichannelling could just as easily result in more and more programs such as The Bill and other British sitcoms. It could indeed result in bringing in a whole lot of those types of entertainment programs from around the world. I do not see that you have achieved very much if you allow that, because the commercials themselves can do it, and that is not why we are providing very significant funds to the ABC to move into the digital era. We ought to be doing it on the basis that they do not compete with the commercials and that they adhere to a tighter charter than they have now. 
Our decision in 1998—this was, of course, a decision of the parliament, so it was supported by all the major political parties—was a decision not to allow free-to-air broadcasters to multichannel, because we took the view that that would encroach on the business of the developing pay TV sector. If you allow the national broadcasters to have full and unrestricted multichannelling, then you are running up against that principle in relation to pay TV, but you are also infringing it in relation to the ordinary, commercial free-to-air networks. It seems to me that you are moving a long way away from where I am sure Senator Bourne would want the ABC to be; you are moving it more into the realm of being a second-class commercial network rather than a first-class quality alternative.
We think that this issue of multichannelling is best addressed in the statutory review that is scheduled to be conducted in 2005. That will allow us to reflect on the introduction of digital technology and digital television in general, and to look at further developments in the pay TV industry, which may well be in an even better position then than it is now: able to withstand full multichannelling from all parties. If that is the case, then you have an environment which is, I think, a lot fairer than one in which you say, `Some free-to-air networks can't multichannel because they are commercial. Others, because they are taxpayer funded, can, and they can do it on the basis that they can compete directly with the commercials.' I just do not see the logic of that argument. I would have thought that, rather than Senator Bourne asking for a blank cheque to buy in more sitcoms from offshore, she ought to be a bit more interested in how she can encourage the ABC to produce programming that is much more in line with what its charter ought to be. 
 (Senator Sherry)—Just before we proceed, I understand that this amendment has been jointly moved by the Democrats and the opposition.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-28,"—I agree with the opposition and Democrats here. This is again part of the anally retentive view that the government has towards broadcasting in general, towards modern technology and towards the ability of the community to be able to choose what it is going to select from—hopefully, a much wider range will be offered in the age of digital technology.
The ABC and the SBS ought to be given the option of extending more, not less, to the Australian public. This view that they should be restricted to religion and science—as important as those components of what the ABC puts forward are—is not what the Australian people are about. I read into what the minister has just said this censorious view that the ABC and the SBS ought to be restricted and taken out, effectively sidelined, and not be able to be part of mainstream communications with the Australian people, and I totally disagree with it.
I will be supporting this amendment, because I think SBS and ABC do provide a great service, and that should be able to expand with the new technology. We should not be waiting five years to review something to see whether perhaps we could change an option which should be available now. I remind the committee that I did not go along with the 1998 decision, and I am certainly not bound by it now. I also think there is a flawed contradiction in the minister saying that ABC and SBS on the one hand ought to be chasing ratings but on the other hand ought to be constrained from putting forward the full range of options to viewers, including quality entertainment.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I do not want to prolong this, but I feel I really must respond to a few of the things the minister has said. In his comments the minister seemed to take the ABC from a quality national broadcaster to a rather tacky copy of the commercials. I do not think that is likely to happen. If the huge funding cuts and the appalling way in which this government has treated the ABC since it came in have not turned the ABC into a tacky copy of the commercials, nothing is going to do that. I certainly do not think this amendment will. I do not think that there is any way on earth that the ABC have the intention—let alone the money—to buy in a huge number of American sitcoms. I cannot see that being on their multichannel. The minister knows as well as I do—as well as everybody in this chamber does—what the ABC have said they want to do with their multichannelling. They have shown us all the example of what their regional programming would be. It is very good. It is very interesting. They have shown us examples of education. We know that they are probably the best in Australia on children's programming, and we would expect to see a lot of that.
The minister also made the comment that significant funds have been made available to the ABC by the government to move into the digital era. That is a bit of a furphy too, isn't it? Significant funds? Please! They have not even been given enough money to properly change over their technology to transmit digital, and that is something that has been around since the original act in 1998. The government thought 25 times before they even decided to fund them to do what they had forced them to do under the last act when it came through in 1998. There is no funding—there is zero funding—for producing digital material. Generous funds? Significant funds? Where? I have not seen them. There is no funding for producing digital material. There is no funding for archiving to go from analog to digital. There is very little funding for the ABC overall. What an outrageous statement for the minister to make.
The minister said that the decision not to allow free-to-airs to multichannel—and that included the ABC—was taken in 1998. The minister knows very well that there was a debate about that in 1998. The minister knows very well that the only reason that we, and probably the opposition as well, agreed with that as a starting point was that there was a review and we had expected, because we insisted on this review, that after the review—it is obvious that the ABC and the SBS are best placed to be able to multichannel, to be able to provide programs that others do not provide; not American sitcoms, which are going to be just impossible for them to put on anyway, as they have not got the money—it would be available at this point in the debate. There should be a third point, of course, in this debate, but that is going to be eliminated under one of the minister's amendments. 
The fact is that we always expected the ABC to be able to multichannel. We always expected that. Perhaps the ALP are in agreement, but they may not be, and they would tell us if they were not. But we had always expected that. We had also always hoped that the ABC would be funded to multichannel. However, funding the ABC is not something that the government are good at, and I think they need a lot more practice at it.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I just want to make a couple of points in response to the minister's comments and pick up on the last point made by Senator Bourne. In regard to the 1998 legislation, the opposition has had a long-standing commitment to multichannelling for the ABC, and you were correct in your supposition. 
I will turn to the minister's contribution. The hole in his argument, or the mistake he makes, appears to us to be that he assumes that the ABC, if it is given the ability to multichannel and the appropriate funding, will emerge or evolve into a de facto free-to-air or, as Senator Bourne says, a tacky commercial operation. That is the mistake in the government's approach. The opposition's approach, in contradistinction, is that the national broadcasters have to stand, and survive, within their charters on their own feet and that they are worthwhile stand-alone entities. They need to receive adequate budget funding from the government and they need to be permitted to emerge, change and evolve over time; firstly, in respect of the changing dictates of the market in terms of consumer preferences and, secondly, in their ability to cater for those consumer preferences by being able to provide new equipment.
We do not want the ABC or the SBS to evolve into some sort of alternative free-to-air commercial broadcaster. We are of the view that their charter lays down their obligations and their audience and they should be confined to that. If the charter needs to be broadened, extended, changed or adapted, it would be appropriate to bring it before the parliament to consider those changes. As far as we are concerned, we do not want the ABC to emerge as an alternative, free-to-air broadcaster; we do not see it as appropriate for that to be its position in the marketplace. I am reminded of a line in an old Bruce Springsteen song: 57 Channels (And Nothin' On). That would happen if the minister's desires or fears came to pass. We do not want that to occur. We want the ABC and the SBS to evolve to cater to changing needs in the marketplace. In this debate, that is best achieved by their ability to multichannel.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 23 on sheet 1827:
(23)	Schedule 1, item 126, page 42 (line 15), at the end of subclause (2), add:
	; (c)	the objective that, after the 5-year period beginning when each commercial television broadcaster is required to commence transmitting in SDTV mode in an area, the levels of Australian content that each commercial television broadcaster transmits in HDTV digital mode (expressed as a percentage of hours of content transmitted) will be required to correspond with the Australian content standards determined by the ABA in accordance with subsection 122(2)(b).
This is the amendment on Australian content standards. I am afraid it was drafted rather hastily. It would require the commercial free-to-air broadcasters to have a high level of Australian content in their HDTV content. I am particularly keen to see a large acknowledgment of Australian content in this process. I will just pre-empt now the arguments that there is not a lot of equipment here and that it is going to be difficult to make it up. I have made it a five-year period. I have not put in the hours, which are already there. I have made it a percentage. As far as I can see, there does not seem to be any review looking at what level of Australian content should be required under the HDTV quota. If that is included in any of the reviews or any of the ALP's proposed reviews, I would be interested to hear that. I think we have forgotten Australian content to some extent. We should be starting to focus on it, so I am moving this amendment.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—To the extent that it is helpful, given that the government oppose the amendment, there is a review scheduled to be conducted by 1 January 2004 into HD quotas. I would certainly be prepared to undertake to include the issue of local content in that review. It is also a matter that has been canvassed more generally by the Productivity Commission, and we are scheduled to provide a response to that by September. I have a fair degree of sympathy for what Senator Bourne is proposing, but again it is such a complex area that one cannot predict how the market will play out and whether it will end up being an HD world, an SD world or a combination of the two. In view of those uncertainties, an arbitrary starting point for local content requirements could impose significant difficulties. I do think it is something that ought to be examined. We are prepared to look at it in both of those contexts. I think that is probably the best outcome at this stage. It will give us the opportunity to fully consider all the implications and to hear all the arguments formally. When Senator Bourne says that this has been largely overlooked, in a sense she is really underlining the fact that sufficient attention has not been given to it and that it would therefore be perhaps a bit premature for us to start imposing arbitrary start-up deadlines in advance of proper examination. I am happy with the spirit of the amendment, but I think there is a better way of achieving the same outcome.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—Senator Bourne was correct to say that, in the inquiry we had, there was little attention paid to the issue of local content. From memory, there was only one submission, from the Screen Producers Association, which drew attention to the issue. As the debate went on during the inquiry, the issue of local content probably did not receive the degree of attention that it inherently warrants. The opposition have considerable sympathy for the Democrats on this position, and we do not seek at all to retract from the past public policy positions that we have put out on the issue of local content. We do note that, in the first five years of the HD regime, quotas are optional. In that sense, quotas should not apply. After five years, the quotas become mandatory and, in our view, that is the appropriate time to incorporate the content quotas. As the minister said, we presume that the HD review is the appropriate time to perhaps pay a serious amount of attention to the issue of quotas for local production. Having made those comments, I state that the opposition support the Democrat amendment.
—Senator Bourne was generally accepting the proposition we were putting forward.
—Yes, sorry.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I thank the minister for the undertaking to put Australian content into the HD quota review. I move Australian Democrats amendments Nos 24 and 25 together:
(24)	Schedule 1, item 126, page 43 (line 37) to page 44 (line 15), omit paragraphs (2)(b) and (c), substitute:
	(b)	the objective that, after the end of that 2-year period each national broadcaster is required to transmit a least 20 hours per week of high-definition television programs in HDTV digital mode in a coverage area on the HDTV version of the national television broadcasting service concerned.
(25)	Schedule 1, item 126, page 48 (line 1) to page 49 (line 10), omit clause 37L, substitute:
37L  High-definition television programs
	(1)	For the purposes of the application of this Division to a commercial television broadcasting licensee, a high-definition television programis:
	(a)	a television program that was originally produced in a high-definition digital video format; or
	(b)	a television program that:
	(i)	was originally produced in a non-video format (for example, 16 mm or 35 mm film) that was of equivalent picture quality to a high-definition digital video format; and 
(ii)	has been converted to a high-definition digital video format;
where the conversion has not resulted in a significant reduction in picture quality. 
	(2)	For the purposes of the application of this Division to a national broadcaster, a high-definition television program is:
	(a)	a television program that was originally produced in a high-definition digital video format; or 
	(b)	a television program that:
	(i)	was originally produced in a non-video format (for example, 16 mm or 35 mm film) that was of equivalent picture quality to a high-definition digital video format; and 
(ii)	has been converted to a high-definition digital video format;
where the conversion has not resulted in a significant reduction in picture quality; or 
	(c)	a television program that: 
	(i)	was originally produced in a standard definition digital video format; and 
	(ii)	has been converted to a high-definition digital video format; or 
	(d)	a television program that: 
	(i)	was originally produced in an analog video format; and 
(ii)	has been converted to a standard definition digital video format;
where the converted program was subsequently converted to a high-defini-tion digital video format. 
The above amendments relate to the originating—I am finding so many words that I have never heard of in this debate—of HDTV original content for the national broadcasters—that is, the ABC and SBS. They are treated differently under the suggested amendments to the act, and it would probably be sensible to treat them the same. Under the bill, the ABC is required to transmit HDTV originated material for four out of its 20 hours of HDTV broadcasting. That is all in prime time, until 1 January 2006, when all of its HDTV content must be HDTV originated. In comparison, the SBS is permitted to use up-converted SDTV material for the same period. The rationale for this is that the SBS mostly sources its material from Europe, which has adopted SDTV rather than HDTV. But, as the ABC sources much of its material from Europe as well, there seems to be no sensible reason why it should be forced to move to HDTV originated material. We know overseas material for the commercial free-to-airs will probably come from the US—and a bit from Europe—whereas, with the national broadcasters, it will mostly come from the European SDTV standard.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—The government's position is that we have already given the ABC additional, and considerable, latitude. Within two years, the commercials are expected to achieve 20 hours per week of full HD. By that time, the ABC will be allowed to have 80 per cent of that quota up-converted—in other words, they will have a very significantly lower standard to comply with by that time, and they will have until 2006 to bring themselves fully into line with the commercial networks. It seems to us that that is a pretty generous regime. To say that the ABC should not be required to produce any originated HD material seems to us to be treating the ABC as though they are completely outside the HD regime, and that is not a sensible approach. The jury may be out in the longer term on the future of HDTV, but I do not see why—if you assume that it could just as easily come to pass in all its glory—the ABC should be deliberately encouraged to be behind the eight ball through that period. What we have already proposed is a very generous and relaxed attitude that singles out the ABC for special treatment in the direction they would prefer. To go beyond that is to simply give the game away altogether, and we do not think that is in anyone's interests, including the ABC's. They should be encouraged to meet the standards, even if they are allowed a bit more time to do so.

	(2AA)	Standards under subclause (1), to the extent that they deal with application program interfaces, must be directed towards ensuring the achievement of the policy objective that, as far as is practicable, those interfaces should be open to all providers of eligible datacasting services.

131A  Subclause 39(5) of Schedule 4
Insert:
application program interface has the meaning generally accepted within the broadcasting industry.
(9)	Schedule 1, item 140, page 94 (after line 21), after subclause (2), insert:
	(2A)	Standards under subclause (1), to the extent that they deal with application program interfaces, must be directed towards ensuring the achievement of the policy objective that, as far as is practicable, those interfaces should be open to all providers of eligible datacasting services.
(10)	Schedule 1, item 140, page 95 (before line 1), before the definition of conditional access system, insert:
application program interface has the meaning generally accepted within the broadcasting industry.
The purpose of these amendments is to require the technical standards relating to transmission which deal with application program interfaces—which are the platforms on the set-top boxes—for datacasting should do so on the basis that they are open to all datacasting service providers. The amendments add an additional requirement to the provisions in schedule 4 of the Broadcasting Services Act, relating to regulations which may determine transmission standards. They require that, to the extent that those regulations deal with application program interfaces, they must be directed towards the policy objective that as far as practicable those interfaces should be open to all providers of eligible datacasting services. These amendments are important in ensuring open standards so that different players are able to develop applications which are used in set-top boxes. It is increasingly becoming a world of open standards, and I will be moving at a later point some additional amendments to provide for the same open access regime for reception equipment. This is stage one of that process.

	(fa)	a condition that the licensee, and any person so authorised, must comply with any regulations made for the purposes of clause 36B of Schedule 4 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992;
The purpose of these amendments is to introduce provisions that allow regulations to require that datacasters and broadcasters who provide viewers with reception equipment must make equipment accessible to other service providers. These amendments will help to ensure that if datacasters or broadcasters provide their customers with reception equipment—for example, as part of a subscription package, as has occurred in the UK—regulations can be made to ensure that the equipment is accessible by competing service providers. In other words, we do not want proprietary systems because that will obviously add dramatically to the cost for consumers if they have to buy competing set-top boxes. This is crucial if viewers are not to be faced with the prospect of having multiple set-top boxes to receive different datacasting and broadcasting services. 
Specifically, the amendments provide that regulations can be made to prevent broadcasters and datacasters from providing domestic reception equipment, or entering into an agreement with another person to provide domestic reception equipment, unless the equipment is accessible by other television broadcasters or datacasters. These provisions are enforced by making it a licence condition that commercial broadcasters and datacasters comply with any regulations set and by requiring national broadcasters to comply with the regulations. I say in passing that we went down this track a few years ago in relation to satellites and we are now doing the same in the digital television environment. The principle is the same: that as much as possible at all levels of the process consumers ought to have that interoperability, which will enable them to access the maximum range of programs at the least possible price.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I wish to oppose schedule 1, item 134. I am sure honourable senators will remember that when we started the debate two years ago—it was longer than that—we made quite a point in that debate of saying that we needed a lot of time to consider this and that we needed to have many points within the debate where we could reconsider what was happening and make sure that it seemed to us to be in the best interests of the community. The end result was the original act in 1998, then there was this amendment which is before us now, and then there was a further third and final mechanism for the scrutiny of this whole regime. 
So the government expected first of all to conduct inquiries, then to create legislation and finally to create standards. All of those were supposed to have a provision for parliamentary scrutiny over them. The results of the inquiries were released after the shape of the legislation was known, which I think is a bit unfortunate. This legislation, as we all know, has been unreasonably quickly put on. If we agree to item 134 in schedule 1 of this bill then that last plank will disappear. This would mean that on proclamation of this bill everything becomes law without that extra step of waiting until we see what the regulations and standards are. I am aware that the regulations are disallowable instruments. But I would like to see the whole of this carried out, as was promised two years ago—I know we are in a hurry now; I do not think we need to be—and I would like to see that last step maintained. Obviously, the government would like to take that plank out because that is what is in their bill. I would rather have it in there to give us one more go at seeing whether or not this is the best way to go forward.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—Can I just explain why I do not think we should have this additional and, in many respects, onerous obligation imposed. The original 1998 provisions were designed to ensure that the government could not simply run off and prescribe standards and make regulations ahead of the eight reviews, I think there were, that emanated from that legislation—or were there more than eight?  
—No, there were eight. 
—In any event, quite clearly we wanted to see the outcome of those relevant reviews on captioning, transmission and HD standards before this legislation came to the parliament, and we have done that. It has been two years—I would not say that is rushing it—but certainly we have had the benefit of those reviews. They have been tabled in the parliament. There has been plenty of opportunity to debate them. 
But to now say that we cannot give effect to any intentions in relation to standards in these critical areas without a proclamation would have the effect of ensuring that you could not go ahead and do anything. You would delay the introduction of any regulations unnecessarily, and it would mean that no standards would apply to broadcasters in the absence of the proclamation. I do not think that is what we have in mind. This legislation will provide regulation making powers to proceed to give effect to the outcome of those reviews and to completely honour the original requirement which was there for a limited period of time—not indefinitely or until such time as the parliament, in its wisdom, might choose to allow or disallow a whole set of different standards. It could mean, for example, that it is many months before you finally have HD, captioning and transmission standards in place.
This digital television era is meant to start in just over six months. We want people to have maximum certainty. We want them to get on with it. We have all had the benefit of the reviews. It has been a very transparent process. I do not think that you aid the cause at all by introducing a potentially very destabilising and uncertain environment in which each of those standards is going to be deferred until such time as the parliament has passed further judgment on them. In those circumstances, I would hope that the chamber would accept that we have fully honoured the 1998 legislation and all we are doing now is enabling the broadcasters and all other stakeholders to get on with the business as quickly as possible ahead of 1 January.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—The question is that item 134 stand as printed.

The purpose of the first batch of amendments is to clarify the access rights under the transmitter access regime to ensure that a free-to-air television broadcaster or datacaster can gain access not just to broadcasting transmission towers and sites but also to designated associated facilities on those sites and towers for the purpose of installing or maintaining a digital television or datacasting service. The access regime applies to towers, sites and associated facilities that are used to supply a datacasting service as well as those used to supply a television broadcasting service.
These amendments clarify the access rights under the transmitter access regime to facilitate the successful rollout of the digital television and datacasting infrastructure. In order to transmit their services in digital mode, free-to-air television broadcasters and data-casters may in practice require access not only to towers and sites but also to commonly used combiners, antennas and feeder systems situated on the site. However, a literal reading of the existing provisions in part (5) of schedule 4 would mean that access seekers could be denied access to necessary associated facilities on reasonable terms and conditions and would not have access to arbitration—a la the telecommunications model. 
The proposed amendments will ensure that there is a right of access to these essential common facilities and to any associated facilities that are prescribed by regulations. The regulation making power will provide flexibility to designate other facilities if, following industry consultation, it can be demonstrated that it is not practicable to expect access seekers to install those facilities at the transmission site. The amendments will also extend the obligation to provide access to designated associated facilities to the owner or operator of those facilities to cover situations where the owner or operator is not the same person as the owner or operator of the transmission tower. These provisions will ensure that the access regime for associated facilities covers all possible ownership and control arrangements at the transmission site. The existing right to refuse access to sites and towers where compliance with the access obligation is not technically feasible will also apply to the right of access to designated associated facilities. To the extent that access to an associated facility involves access to a service provided by means of a facility, there may also be circumstances where the owner or operator of a facility may have legitimate economic grounds to refuse access.
The proposed amendments therefore also include the flexibility for regulations to set out further exemption criteria. The nature and extent of any regulations of this kind would be determined following consultation with broadcasters, transmission tower operators and other stakeholders having regard to exemptions provided under part XIC of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Consistent with the existing access provisions in part (5), reasonable notice needs to be given by a broadcaster or datacaster seeking access to a designated associated facility. Provision is made for arbitration of disputes about access to associated facilities and the conditions that are to be complied with in relation to access to those facilities to be determined in an ACCC access code.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—I move government amendment No. 21:
(21)	Schedule 1, page 51 (after line 13), after item 136, insert:
136C  Clause 43 of Schedule 4 (definition of television broadcasting service)
Repeal the definition. 
This amendment makes a technical change to delete the definition of `television broadcasting service' from clause 43 of schedule 4, as the term is defined now in clause 2 of schedule 4. The amendment will have the effect of deleting the definition of `television broadcasting service' from clause 43 of schedule 4. This will ensure that there is no duplication or confusion as the definition of `television broadcasting services' is now in clause 2 of schedule 4. It is just tidying up.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—The next four Democrat amendments now, for various reasons, I think I will move separately rather than together. Democrat amendment No. 31 is consequent upon the ABC and SBS being able to multichannel, which has been passed previously. On my new running sheet, I think it is almost the same as the ALP's amendment along the same lines. So I am happy to move my amendment in conjunction with them, if the opposition are happy to do that.
—That is amendment 32?
—Yes, 32. So, if Senator Bishop is happy with that, I am happy to put my name on his or, if he wants to put his name on mine, that is fine. That is the one in relation to the national broadcasters as a consequential amendment. The second one is about community television broadcasting services and an inquiry into whether access to spectrum should be free of charge. I think it would be better if this, Democrat amendment No. 32, came after we had looked at Senator Brown's amendment on community television. If his amendment passes, then this one would need to be changed, and he has another amendment which would be better. So it would probably be better if we did all of those together a bit later, if that is all right.
Democrat amendment No. 33 looks into the viability of creating an indigenous television broadcasting service and the regulatory arrangements that should apply to the digital transmission of such a service using spectrum in the broadcast services band. This is as a consequence of information that came from the Senate inquiry that Senator Bishop and I were on and also from the Productivity Commission report into broadcasting, which had what I thought were very strong and sensible recommendations on the future of indigenous television and radio broadcasting in Australia. So that would be an inquiry looking into whether that was feasible at that period.
Finally, Democrat amendment No. 34 concerns the inquiry which looks into whether the HDTV quotas should be amended or repealed. I believe that, if they are repealed, we are very likely to see HDTV disappear pretty quickly in Australia. I think that that should not be an option at this stage—or even at that stage when that amendment comes up. I would rather that the words `or repealed' were taken out.
So, if it is acceptable to the committee, I would be happy to move Democrat amendment No. 31 in conjunction with Senator Bishop's, if that is acceptable to Senator Bishop. I would rather leave Democrat amendment No. 32 until later, but I would be happy to move Nos 33 and 34 now as well.

(31)	Schedule 1, page 51 (after line 20), after item 137, insert:

So we support this amendment. We do not have a problem with deferral of amendment No. 32. We support amendment No. 33. Amendment No. 34 is the issue of repeal on the HD?",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—I am happy to have amendment No. 32 deferred and considered later. In relation to No. 33, I would simply say that the government would oppose that, but I hear that both the other parties are in favour. We will be considering the Productivity Commission report by September this year, and it did make some recommendations in that area. 
But in relation to amendment No. 34, the purpose of the review is to decide whether the quotas for HDTV should change. It is not intended to examine the basic requirement to provide HDTV and, if necessary, that can be made very clear or clearer. In addition, the word `repealed' is needed to allow the review to consider whether any existing clauses need to be repealed—for example, to be replaced with another clause—rather than just being amended. So that is a process point. But if your concern is that this might be a backdoor way of dismantling the whole HD regime, that is certainly not our intention. I do not think there is any basis on which anyone would support that. Certainly I can clarify that in the context of the review, if necessary.

This series of amendments goes to a series of reviews that the opposition proposes to bring into the act. Amendment (40) goes to the issue of audio and video streaming. This amendment proposes that the ABA review referred to in Minister McGauran's second reading speech in the other house, to determine whether services such as streamed audio and video obtained via the Internet constitute broadcasting services, will be a statutory review to report to the parliament prior to 1 January 2002. So the issue there is to bring it forward. The amendment requires that the review should consider the matter in the context of convergence of media technologies, which is a critical issue at the heart of these deliberations and crucial to the efficacy of policy in the area.
The industry is keen for the review to be completed without delay to provide certainty as to the regulatory scheme applicable to video and audio streaming. The transparency of this review is critical to its eventual outcome. Transparency, we believe, is best achieved by making the review statutory and required by this legislation, and hence open and accountable to the parliament. Yesterday evening, Senator Harradine alluded to this issue of audio and video streaming in another context. We are of the view that there is considerable speed in which a range of technologies are converging. The minister's second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum made it quite clear that the issue of audio and video streaming may well not be covered by the current definition in the Broadcasting Services Act, and hence regulation free.
That is a matter, I presume, of concern to the government. It is a matter that the opposition wishes to have a good, long, hard and serious think about in the future. We know from the range of correspondence and approaches that we have received from a range of current industry players and prospective industry players that the issue of regulation of this new method of receiving information is quite critical. Amendment (40) goes to that and, essentially, sooner rather than later, reporting to the parliament by the beginning of the year after next.
Amendment (39) is a general review of schedules 4 and 6 of the Broadcasting Services Act—the two most important schedules. This amendment allows the minister to conduct a general review of the operation of schedule 4 concerning digital TV and schedule 6 concerning datacasting services, commencing after 1 January 2003 and again reporting to the parliament no later than 1 January 2004. The importance of this legislation in achieving the policy outcomes of the government in respect of digital conversion necessitates this overarching interim review of the progress of the legislation in fulfilling these policy objectives. The legislation is transitional. The opposition is of the view that the government needs to be flexible for the market to adapt to new technologies and circumstances previously unforeseen or unanticipated. This review, we believe, will assist the government in its decision making on these issues.
Amendment (49) is in relation to commercial broadcasting licensing conditions at the expiry of the moratorium. The conditions which will apply to broadcasting commercial broadcasting licences at the end of the moratorium on the issue of new licences need to be determined by a review, the opposition believes, prior to that time to again provide certainty to existing and aspirant commercial broadcasters and to ensure that conditions are consistent with policy objectives at that time. This amendment incorporates a review of the conditions to apply to commercial broadcasting licences at the end of the moratorium on the issue of new licences to report no later than 1 January 2005.
Amendment (46) is in relation to schedule 4 of the BSA. Amendments proposed in the government's bill require various reviews to occur during the transition to digital broadcasting. The opposition's policy position is to amend the report dates for existing reviews—group A and group B—and to propose additional reviews. So we break them up into group A and group B reviews, with different report dates, and propose additional reviews. Group A reviews are those reviews currently due to be completed by 1 January 2006 or 31 December 2005. 
In recognition of the transitional nature of the legislation, it is highly desirable that its consequences and efficacy are measured over the coming years to ensure the parliament's policy objectives are being properly and effectively implemented. This is particularly so in view of the considerable doubts that have been raised during the process of the Senate committee's inquiry into the bill. It has become apparent that any reviews undertaken in analysis of the legislative scheme should be conducted as early as practicable. I think there was almost unanimous support for that position.
The group A reviews, as I said, are those reviews required to be completed by 1 January 2006 or 31 December 2005, and the amendment proposes that these reviews be completed by 1 January 2005. So our proposition is that the reviews be brought forward by that 12-month period for the reasons that I outlined. The group A review includes spectrum use, identification and efficient use of available broadcasting spectrum, the simulcast period duration and any further requirements, subscription TV services, and the regulatory and revenue arrangements for datacasting transmission licences; and the implications of the expiry of the moratorium on commercial TV broadcasting licences need to be ascertained prior to its expiry to provide the datacasting industry with certainty. It is clear that there is a considerable degree of confusion on this matter with the ABA disagreeing with the minister's statement on 16 June—a speech on the status of datacasting licences at the expiry of the moratorium. The final group A review will also include commercial television licences in underserved areas.
Turning to the datacasting transmission licence review and its expanded breadth, in summary the amendment seeks to insert the words `competitive and regulatory arrangements' and further add `revenue to Commonwealth provisions'. So the bill provides for a review of regulatory arrangements that should apply to, and the revenues to be raised by the Commonwealth in connection with, the operation of a datacasting transmitter under a datacasting transmitter licence to transmit licensed broadcasting services on or after 1 July 2007. This amendment provides that the review will include the words `competitive and regulatory arrangements' and `revenue to the Commonwealth'. The opposition believes that both of these amendments, of some few words, are important to take account of competitive arrangements which are critical to the ongoing conduct of broadcasting policy.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—Our general attitude is that it is not necessary to bring forward any of these reviews because they are all `out dates', in other words, the latest date by which something might be reviewed. The government are as conscious as anyone else in the industry that this is a fast moving game, that technology can throw up some pleasant and unpleasant surprises for various people and that in those circumstances you need to be flexible and to monitor progress. So we would certainly want to ensure that, if there was a demonstrated need to conduct an earlier review, we did it. The vice of this approach is to simply say that, because you guarantee there will be reviews in all these areas by a certain date with the flexibility to bring them forward if necessary, you are bringing them forward irrespective of need. It is an industry that is going to be regulated to death anyway, and for it to be reviewed on such a frequent basis seems to us to be perhaps very premature. 
The first review into the operations of digital television and datacasting is proposed to be brought forward by 12 months, I think. As digital television may not even start in some areas until 2004, a review may exclude findings from those areas. Again, you can have a partial review, and you can tailor it in some respects, but it is likely that bringing forward a wholesale review of the digital television provisions would overlap with most of the reviews that are already proposed.  
Insofar as there is a proposal for a statutory review of streamed audio and video content, we have already made it public that the government will be asking the ABA to undertake a review of video and audio streaming services provided over the Internet and their relationship with broadcasting services. This is a generic issue relating to the convergence of broadcasting with other services and it is therefore proposed to refer the matter to the ABA for its detailed consideration. As the matter does not specifically relate to digital television it was not proposed to make it a statutory review, but parliament will be aware that this whole exercise will be conducted in the public arena and any regulatory changes proposed would require public scrutiny and decision making. We also see the nature of that review as narrow and prescriptive because we need to allow a wide range of possibilities to be examined in relation to the regulation of these industries, not just the issue of whether they should be regarded as a broadcasting service. The review would also have to be conducted in a very short time frame and that is not desirable in an area of such complexity. 
In relation to the next review, which I think is in amendment No. 46—`bring forward all the reviews currently scheduled for 2005 to 2004 into simulcasting and spectrum efficiency'—a review of simulcasting provisions and spectrum availability does need to be conducted closer to the prescribed end of the simulcast period. In other words, we are not seeking to amend the simulcast time frame. Therefore, it is desirable to wait until you are getting reasonably close to the expiration of that period to make a proper judgment about the level of take-up and what arrangements might apply for the simulcast period and beyond. 
Digital television in regional areas, as I said earlier, may not have commenced until 2004. In a number of areas, and certainly in remote areas, there is no prescribed start-up date. We need time for all these new initiatives to settle down. The review of whether commercial television broadcasters can offer other forms of broadcasting services, including pay TV services, is also more appropriately timed so that the effect of the introduction of digital commercial television on pay television can be properly gauged, including in regional areas where start-up may not be until 2004. 
In other words, you ought to give yourself the maximum opportunity to allow this regime to prove itself, to make judgments in the lead-up to a legislative requirement for change at a later point, but not perhaps conduct a review that may itself be out of date by the time the expiration period arrives. You want it to be as close as reasonably possible, without running out of time, to enable to you make judgments beyond the expiration dates that are still contemporary. So that would be a particular concern in relation to that matter.
In relation to the proposed review of regulatory and revenue arrangements, I do not think we would quarrel to any significant extent with that. The opposition is proposing to include a review of competition arrangements, and I think probably that will be part and parcel of that review in any event. In other words, it is a necessary implication. 
The last amendment is (49) and that is to require a new statutory review of the conditions applying to commercial television broadcasting licences on or about 2007. Given the range of reviews already provided for in the legislation, it would seem to the government that it is unnecessary to conduct yet another review into all of those matters—datacasting, simulcast period, multichannelling, other broadcasting services, terms applying to datacasting conversion arrangements and, of course, HD.

I have been trying to work out a way to amend Senator Bishop's amendments in order to achieve not moving that one forward but moving the others forward.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—I move government amendment No. 1 on sheet DW212:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 52 (after line 24), after item 138, insert:
138A  After subclause 60(1) of Schedule 4
Insert:
	(1A)	A review under subclause (1) of a matter referred to in paragraph (1)(h) or (i) is to be conducted on the basis that, if the licence referred to in subparagraph (1)(h)(i) or (i)(i) is a commercial television broadcasting licence, the licensee should, on and after 1 January 2007, be treated in the same way as persons who held commercial television broadcasting licences immediately before that date, in relation to: 
	(a)	the duration of related transmitter licences; and
	(b)	fees under the Television Licence Fees Act 1964.
The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the proposed review of the regulatory and revenue arrangements that should apply to datacasting transmitter licences on or after 1 January 2007 should be conducted on the basis that, if the transmitter licence is to be used to provide a commercial television broadcasting service, the licensee should be treated equitably with incumbent commercial broadcasters. The statutory moratorium on the issue of new commercial television broadcasting licences is scheduled to end in 2006. From 1 January 2007, therefore, under provisions proposed in the bill, spectrum licensed to datacasters will be able to be used for any other service licensed under the Broadcasting Services Act in addition to licensed datacasting.
The bill provides that the regulatory arrangements applying to the use of this spectrum from 1 January 2007 will be the subject of a statutory review in 2005. The review will also examine what charges and other financial arrangements, if any, should apply to this spectrum. This amendment requires that review to be conducted on the basis that, if the service that the datacasting transmitter licensee transmits on or after 1 January 2007 is a commercial television broadcasting service, the licensee should, from 1 January 2007, be treated in the same way as incumbent commercial broadcasters in relation to the duration of related transmitter licences and fees under the Television Licence Fees Act 1964. It is the government's intention that, if the licensee obtains a commercial television broadcasting licence for the area where the datacasting transmitter transmits on or after 1 January 2007, there should be a level playing field between that licensee and existing commercial television broadcasters in relation to tenure of spectrum and the licence fees applying to the use of that spectrum. So the 2005 review would be conducted on the basis of competitive neutrality at that point.

(51)	Schedule 1, item 139, page 52 (line 28), omit ""2004"", substitute ""2003"".
This goes to what we have characterised as the group B reviews to be completed by 1 January 2004, going to the issue of HDTV quota review. We say that, for the same reasons that the group A reviews require timely completion, the HDTV quota review requires the same treatment; that is, the legislation is transitional in nature and it is highly desirable that its consequences are measured over the coming years to ensure that the parliament's policy objectives are being properly and effectively implemented. Doubts raised during the process of the Senate committee's inquiry into the bill indicate that any reviews undertaken in analysis of the legislative scheme should be conducted as early as practicable.
The review of the HDTV quotas is required to be completed by 1 January 2004. Amendments Nos 50 and 51 propose that these reviews be completed by 1 January 2003. This review involves a review of HDTV quotas, both generally and in remote or single-service areas by commercial and national broadcasters. Once again, the issue as far as the opposition are concerned is the progress of implementation of the legislation and the issue of the HDTV quota review. We are of the view that, for the reasons that were put forward in the Senate inquiry—reasons which I will not bother to repeat now—are better done sooner rather than later, and so we amend to bring that forward to 1 January 2003.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech

We would rather that that was put off for another year, and so we would rather stick with the government's timetable on that one.

It does not substantively change the provisions in the schedule; it simply puts the emphasis on what we all think will be the fruits of the technology revolution, and that is the widespread availability of new and innovative services.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—These amendments essentially cover areas that are provided for in government amendments Nos 35 and 41. In our view, ours are more effective in addressing the idea behind the amendments—which we agree with—which is to ensure that news can include related analysis and commentary without breaching the prohibition on current affairs, which is currently in prohibited category A genre. We would prefer the government amendments because they respond to these concerns without affecting the distinction between category A and category B programs. I do not know whether both the opposition and the Democrats might like to consider the government amendments in this context. It may well be that we are in agreement on what we are seeking to achieve. 
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Would you care to recite those government amendments, Minister?
—Yes, they are Nos 35 and 41. I will indicate what ours do. Amendment 35 would add a new provision that allows news, weather or combined bulletins to also include discussion, commentary or analysis in relation to the items included in such bulletins. Financial market and business information bulletins, which are also in category B, do not need to be amended as they are already defined as including discussion, commentary and analysis. Consistent with amendment No. 35, amendment No. 41 adds a new provision that allows news, weather and combination bulletins, which are selected by end users from an on-screen menu, to also include discussion, commentary or analysis in relation to the items included in such bulletins. These amendments recognise that such bulletins are likely to include some commentary or similar embellishment designed to explain or amplify the factual information provided. This amendment will mean that the provision of such commentary will not result in the bulletins being prohibited as current affairs programs under category A.
I think we are all conscious of what, in many respects, can be an artificial distinction between news and current affairs. We think that our approach most effectively addresses it, because it maintains the category A, category B distinction, but it ensures that news, weather and combined bulletins can have that same degree of commentary, discussion or analysis that is allowed in the other category B areas. I think that really should deal with what both the Democrats and the Labor Party are seeking to achieve.

These amendments respond to that recommendation by amending the definition of educational programs in the bill so that educational programs provided by a datacasting service are no longer limited solely by the requirement to be linked to a course of study or instruction. They may also have the purpose of educating children. So it amends the definition of `educational programs' to add `or to educate children'. Amendment No. 28 modifies the test for an educational program by enabling the sole or dominant purpose of the matter to be: `to teach, instruct or train, to assist a course of study or instruction, or to educate children.'

This amendment subjects the fees determined to be payable by commercial television licence holders for datacasting to parliamentary disallowance. The amendment will ensure that the fees determined to be paid are reasonable and will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. This whole issue of fees has become quite topical lately. It is a matter that is under constant scrutiny in the press. There is constant discussion in industry circles about the level of fees. The fees are of a significant amount. We do have a new industry emerging in the datacasting area, and the fees that are going to be paid in the future could involve quite significant sums of money and have a significant effect on the future of individual companies and industries, let alone the government of the day. The opposition are of the view that it is appropriate that those fees are, as I said, reasonable and, more importantly, subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

It would be the ultimate example of micromanagement if we are going to be calling in the ABA to look at its cost structures. I just say for the benefit of others that if the real concern is the datacasting charge to be applied to broadcasters—which, of course, could be quite significant—then that is already disallowable under section 7 of the Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Act 1998.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—Perhaps I should explain a bit further, but I do not think there is any disagreement about this one. The amendment will remove the requirement that extracts of category A programs must not be fully self-contained. This has the result that datacasters may provide extracts of category A programs as long as an extract is not longer than 10 minutes, is not combined with other extracts to form a whole or majority of a category A program and it could be concluded from the facts that the licensee did not intend that it be so combined. The amendment responds to industry concerns that extracts that are not self-contained may be unintelligible. I think we have all had those representations put to us. Where do you start and finish? Whatever you put on starts at a point: if it is not self-contained, what is it? Presumably, it does not catch someone in mid-flight or halfway through a sentence. It seemed to us, on reflection, that we do not need that provision. The requirement that the matter provided be an extract, the 10-minute limitation and the provisions preventing extracts from being combined are considered sufficient in themselves to ensure that extracts are not used as a means of circumventing the general prohibition on category A programs.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I move government amendments Nos 34 and 43 on sheet E215: 
 (34)	Schedule 1, item 140, page 64 (after line 25), at the end of clause 14, add:
	(5)	If, because of subclause (2) of this clause, a datacasting licensee can transmit matter without breaching the condition set out in subclause (1) of this clause, the condition set out in subclause 16(1) does not prevent the licensee from transmitting that matter.
(43)	Schedule 1, item 140, page 66 (after line 24), at the end of clause 16, add:
	(5)	If, because of subclause (2) or (3) of this clause, a datacasting licensee can transmit matter without breaching the condition set out in subclause (1) of this clause, the condition set out in subclause 14(1) does not prevent the licensee from transmitting that matter.
The effect of these amendments is to ensure no double jeopardy. The proposed amendments give further certainty by ensuring that programs or extracts permitted by the exceptions to the condition in clauses 14 or 16 are taken to be permitted for the purpose of the other clause. The amendments are intended to limit the risk of double jeopardy in relation to category A extracts and category B news, business, financial information and weather bulletins. This is the crucial point: they ensure that, if something is allowed as an extract, it cannot then be prohibited by the provisions relating to news, business and weather bulletins, and vice versa. 
The amendments amend item 140 of the bill, inserting new provisions in proposed clauses 14 and 16 of schedule 6. Amendment No. 34 inserts a new subclause which makes it clear that, where an extract of a television program is permitted under clause 14(2), the condition in clause 16(1) does not prevent the licensee from transmitting the program. Amendment No. 43 inserts a new subclause, 16(5), to clarify that, where a news, business, financial information or weather television program is permitted under subclause (2) or (3) of clause 16, the condition in clause 14(1) does not prevent the licensee from transmitting the program. They are two sides of the same coin. It is simply saying that, if you are okay on one score, you cannot be held to be in breach on the other.

(37)	Schedule 1, item 140, page 66 (line 1), omit ""presenter-based"".
The purpose of the above amendments is to remove the requirement for a 10-minute news, financial market, business or weather bulletin to be presenter based. Subclause 16(2) of schedule 6 allows datacasters to transmit a presenter bulletin of not more than 10 minutes. The intention was to allow datacasters to provide short, traditional, overview news bulletins of the kind typically provided by free-to-air television. The key requirements for such bulletins are that they should not be more than 10 minutes in length and they should not be updated more than once every half-hour. Provided these requirements are met, there seems little reason to require that such bulletins have a formal presenter. The amendments, therefore, make it clear that these bulletins can be provided, whether or not they are presenter based.

The purpose of these amendments is to include an anti-avoidance provision to deal with the possibility of a licensee entering into a contrived arrangement through multiple licences to avoid the operation of the 10-minute bulletin rule. These amendments insert anti-avoidance provisions in clause 16(2) of schedule 6 to deal with the possibility that a licensee may enter into a contrived arrangement to avoid the operation of the 10-minute bulletin rule under which a different licensee broadcasts a subsequent bulletin, which the viewer can combine to view as a longer bulletin. This responds to concerns that the same person may use two or more datacasting licences to avoid category B provisions. A similar provision already exists in paragraph 14(2)(d) in relation to extracts of category A programs.

The amendment relates to item 140 of the bill to amend proposed clause 16(3) of schedule 6. Under subclause 16(3), the following category B bulletins are allowed to be provided by datacasters, provided they can only be accessed by a user making a selection from an on-screen menu and they are not presenter based bulletins; single items of news, financial market or a business information bulletin that deals with a single topic or a weather bulletin. The amendment adds a fourth category of bulletin to this list, a bulletin which is a compilation of items, the subject of which is the same or directly related and is not longer than 10 minutes.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-06-28,"—Today I want to talk about country Australia and rural Victoria in particular. Country Australia has made an indelible and irreversible mark on what we are as a nation and what shape we will take in the future. As a senator for Victoria, I regularly visit rural and regional Victoria, see the resilience of people in the country and enjoy enormous hospitality from those people. I recently attended the completion of a Work for the Dole project in Churchill, Gippsland and was pleased to officially open the Churchill community swimming pool project. Try Youth and Community Services were the group that oversaw the project, and they have developed a number of Work for the Dole projects covering 11 sites across west and south Gippsland and south-east Melbourne. I would like to congratulate them on the work they are doing in those areas.
The Churchill community swimming pool project began in November 1999 and was completed six months later in May 2000. The project engaged seven members of the local community and two supervisors, Mick Kellet and Leon Robinson, and has turned a disused area behind the Churchill swimming pool complex into an outdoor barbecue and play area. Like all Work for the Dole participants, those who participated in the Churchill swimming pool project can be very proud of their efforts and of the contribution that they have made to their local community. 
The 2000-01 budget has seen an expansion of Work for the Dole projects such as the one at Churchill, which is testament to their effectiveness and popularity within the community. Work for the Dole aims to involve unemployed people and, in particular, younger Australians who are looking for work. It aims to harness their interest in maintaining and being part of their local communities. It also fosters necessary work habits and skills and, perhaps most importantly, it develops and promotes the self-esteem of the individual participants. The government is very pleased that almost half of all Work for the Dole participants are in permanent employment or further training or education within three months of participating in Work for the Dole projects. I talked to one of the young fellows at Churchill who, only that afternoon, had been asked to go for an interview for a job. I could see how excited and thrilled he was at the possibility that his involvement in this project might lead to full-time employment.
A few weeks earlier, in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I participated in an Access AusAID seminar at the waterfront campus of Deakin University in Geelong. The Access AusAID seminars are an opportunity to introduce local Australian industries to business opportunities in the development work which the federal government funds overseas. The Geelong seminar was very well attended and showed that businesses in Geelong have an acute sense of how to generate growth and ultimately jobs for the local community, and I commend them for that. While I was there, I had the pleasure of launching the official Smart Geelong Network web site, which aims to promote an integrated Internet entry point for businesses, education, industry and tourism ventures to access information about Geelong and the surrounding region. The network aims to promote Geelong as a region of excellence in education and research capabilities and is an initiative of the Geelong Chamber of Commerce. The web site will allow access to a much wider audience and will market Geelong and the region in a coordinated and very direct way.
While I was in Geelong, I also visited Sacred Heart College in Newtown to thank the students there for their outstanding fundraising efforts during the recent stay of the Kosovar evacuees at the Puckapunyal safe haven in central Victoria. The students of Sacred Heart College took on the Kosovar children as a special project and collected books, musical instruments and other items for use at the safe haven. They also raised enough funds through a casual clothes day to purchase an English-Albanian dictionary for every family at the haven, which has been invaluable in the continuing English language education of the Kosovars as they have returned home.
Ballarat is a city of great history and character—a fact that you cannot help but notice as you enter the city and see the tremendous buildings and the great heritage from the gold rush days. I visited there, working with my colleague Michael Ronaldson, in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. When I visited a local school, it was heartening to see the interest that the students took in Australia's de-mining project. As Australia's special representative on de-mining, one of my roles is to actively promote the Destroy a Minefield program and to encourage Australians to be involved in a project we have in western Cambodia. Mr Ronaldson and one of my other colleagues, Fran Bailey, have taken a very active interest in this. Fran Bailey has talked to people in schools and in Rotary clubs about de-mining and has really encouraged her electorate to be involved in this challenge. Through the encouragement of Mr Ronaldson, Loreto College in Ballarat has also become involved in the challenge of raising funds for the area of western Cambodia where we have a very important de-mining program.
Since coming to office, the Howard government has introduced practical measures designed not only to bring jobs, employment and some measure of prosperity back to rural life but to place the tools and mechanisms of that prosperity back into the hands of local communities. Undoubtedly, it is from our local communities that long-term and sustainable solutions to problems and concerns spring. The coalition government has supported country Victorians and Australians on both counts. As the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, said recently: 
... our broader goal must be to provide all regional communities with the tools they need to find and develop their best opportunities. They know what their strong points are ... They know best how to develop those strong points.
The aim of this government's policies is to support rural communities by equipping them with the tools which they will need to address their concerns. The practical measures of the Howard government that will provide positive results for country communities include the $1.5 billion Natural Heritage Trust, which has funded myriad practical community initiated projects across Australia, particularly in rural regions, and the $464 million Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, which has provided $120 million for a television fund to expand SBS broadcasting into rural areas. When I go out to rural areas, this is the thing people ask me about over and over. They want access to SBS. There is also $36 million over three years for increased Internet access in rural Australia. This issue is raised often. People in rural areas want access to the Internet at the speed of transmission that their city cousins enjoy. There is also $25 million over three years for continuous mobile phone coverage along designated major highways and $45 million towards local government funds to support the local government authorities' access for rural people to their online services.
In addition, there has been a $70 million five-year Rural Transaction Centre program, and that has been designed to support the establishment of rural transaction centres in towns with populations of less than 3,000 people, providing access to services such as banking, post, phone, fax, Medicare and Easyclaim services. When my mother was alive, she lived in a small rural town in New South Wales. It is very important for people in rural areas to have access to something like those transaction centres, because many of them are older people who are not able to drive and who need to be able to make those sorts of transactions easily in their local communities. We have also established a regional solutions fund, which will allow communities to identify and implement development opportunities that meet their specific community needs, with grants between $1,000 and $500,000.
Health is a major issue in rural and regional areas. There is a $137 million regional health services package aimed at enabling rural towns of under 5,000 people to fund health projects that they develop to meet specific community needs, such as a home carer for a recently discharged elderly resident in their own home. The Howard government has also provided just over $1 million to assist people with dementia and their carers living in rural areas. This is in conjunction with an additional $270,000 for the establishment of videoconferencing services in rural centres to help diagnose dementia in the first instance and to provide first-rate care assessments. This is an important area again, as many people in small rural areas are ageing. They are facing the problems of people caring for a loved one often with the younger members of the family significant distances away.
Over half a billion dollars has been committed for a regional health strategy aimed at providing infrastructure funding for a range of new specialised initiatives. There has also been a $49.5 million package for increased access to nursing, psychologists and podiatry services in the country. Nearly $50 million has been committed for a medical specialist outreach assistance package to ensure access to specialist health care for rural Australians. One of the areas of particular need is psychiatric care, and it was previously not possible to receive psychiatric care west of Bendigo. If people were in need, they had to come into Bendigo on one particular day. We need to ensure that specialist health care is more available, and that package goes towards achieving that goal.
There is a $41.6 billion rural pharmacy maintenance allowance, which will improve the access of rural people to quality medicines and pharmacy care. The encouragement of GPs and medical graduates to country areas has been commended by the Hunter Rural Division of General Practice, and their spokesman said in the Newcastle Herald last month: 
This is the first time in living memory that a government has made a serious attempt to rectify the 30 year drain on rural communities in the health sector.
There has been a commitment in a number of programs to encourage young people from rural areas to enter into medical training and also encouragement for them to go back to those areas to deliver health services. Rural and remote communities have also received more than two-thirds of the $22 million available nationally for aged care capital funding, which we use to build and upgrade nursing homes. A report by Professor Gregory, commissioned by the Labor Party when they were in government, demonstrated the appalling neglect of capital in nursing homes around Australia, and particularly in rural and regional areas. That money is being used to address some of the Labor Party's 13-year lack of attention to building up the capital of nursing homes. A further $5.3 million over four years will go towards reviewing the aged care planning process for rural Australia, and the $240 million that has been dedicated to the Stronger Families and Communities strategy will be directed to rural and remote areas. So, in the health area, enormous strides have been made in trying to address some of the specific problems faced by people in rural and regional areas.
Networking the Nation was launched in June 1997 to assist the economic and social development of rural Australia. Some $464 million has been set aside for the BARN—Building Additional Rural Networks—program, for a local government fund for additional mobile phone coverage in several states and for networking Tasmanian schools. The Regional Women's Advisory Council has been set up to enable rural women to participate further in issues of concern to their communities. It has its own web site to enable easy access to this forum, and the address is www.dotrs.gov.au/regional/rwac. The women in the Regional Women's Advisory Council are dynamic and enthusiastic advocates of not only the needs of people in rural and regional areas but also the skills and the initiative that they can bring to bear in encouraging local communities to maximise the resources they have and the positive aspects of their local communities. They are the very ones that know the attributes of their local areas, the things they can promote and the things they can do. Many of my federal colleagues and I met those women the other day, and I was incredibly impressed by their dynamic approach and by their interest.
There are many other programs, but time has caught me out. I want to contrast the approach of this government with that of the state Labor government in Victoria, for example. The state Labor government in Victoria said before a campaign that they could not fund an ambulance service, but when a by-election came up, they suddenly found the money for it. Then they produced a document on the campaign. They told us in each booth where they spent money and what the swing was. That is not the approach this government is taking. It is looking at the overall needs of the community and at addressing those needs rather than trying to attack a prob-lem when faced with a by-election, which is what happened in the state of Victoria.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia: Development</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-28,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. Can the minister explain how the GST has led to a 10 per cent increase in Westpac's fees for its small business customers when the government's own ANTS package predicted that banks would save $670 million in costs from the introduction of the GST?

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-28,"—I thank Senator Conroy for that fairly topical question.
—In ANTS—page 170. 
—Just relax, we will get to that. Frankly, given the GST treatment of banks, it is very difficult to see how the increases announced by Westpac can be justified. In fact, last February—this probably goes to the nub of what Senator Conroy was on about—the Commonwealth Bank's Managing Director stated that bank customers should pay less in fees and charges under the GST. For example, in the Adelaide Advertiser—a very worthy newspaper—there was the headline `GST will cut fees says bank chief'. The article states: 
""Bank customers should pay less in fees and charges under the GST,"" the Commonwealth Bank's Managing Director said yesterday. 
He went on to say that banks would benefit particularly when the financial institutions duty was scrapped. I wonder if the Senate can remember who is really responsible for the delays in the scrapping of the FID. Who is really responsible for that delay? Senator Conroy and his colleagues are responsible for that delay.
—You did the deal with the Democrats.
—Senator, I know you are a bit tense about all this, but the truth is that the Labor Party adopted an incredibly negative attitude to tax reform. There were changes made, and one of those was the delay in the scrapping of the FID. What is the reason for the delay? The answer is that the ALP is the reason for the delay. 
—Come on, get Fels to beat up the banks.
—Before he slags off—an unfortunate expression but nonetheless true when you refer to Senator Conroy—other people, he should look very closely at his own behaviour on this and the behaviour of his own party. I have referred some quotes to Senator Conroy. What am I going to do about it? I am not actually the responsible minister in this particular area of the ACCC. But my understanding is, and I will seek confirmation, that Mr Hockey is the responsible minister. 
—You represent him in this chamber.
—I am answering your question. 
—Order! Senator Conroy, the minister is answering your question and you should not be engaging in conversation across the chamber.
—I don't mind if you blame Hockey.

—I am attempting to answer Senator Conroy's question but, every time one responds, Senator Conroy gets overexcited and starts to jump up and down and call out.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-28,"—There is no argument that very significant benefits will flow to small, medium and large sized businesses as a result of the new tax system. I do not think that that can be argued. In fact, tax reform had its genesis quite a long time ago in the concerns that the business community had about the mess of a tax system that was left to this country by the Labor Party. The Labor Party showed no capacity to bring about substantial reform. This government believes in reform. This reform is good for business and good for Australia, in contrast to the negative, carping attitude of the Australian Labor Party. When this plays itself out fully, the Labor Party will be exposed for the hypocritical approach it has taken to this very important prospect of tax reform.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Banking Fees</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer

Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator Stott Despoja—asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone, the following question:
Given the historic announcement overnight of the finalisation of the human genome project, when will the Australian Government finally take steps to ensure that we have legislation in place that prevents discrimination on the basis of someone's genetic information and also ensures that the information is kept private? Does the Government recognise that it is more than a year since the recommendation was made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that a national working party be established to look into these issues? I ask the Minister what progress, if any, has been made and what assurance can this Government give Australians given this historic breakthrough, that their genetic information is safe, will be protected and cannot be used against them?
Senator Vanstone—I am advised that the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
The Government is aware of media reports concerning the recent announcement of the progress on the human genome project.
The Government considers that genetic information has many important scientific and medical applications which are of benefit to the community as a whole.
The Government is conscious that advances in genetic technology raise unique and complex privacy and discrimination issues. It is therefore important to work towards ensuring that genetic information is not used as a basis for unjustifiable discriminatory practices.
The Government is currently considering these complex issues in the context of its response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee Report on the provisions of the Genetic Privacy and Non-Discrimination Bill 1998. This will require extensive consultation with a broad range of affected groups and individuals.
I note the Government has introduced an important initiative to protect the privacy of people's health information. On 12 April 2000 the Attorney-General introduced the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000 into Parliament.
When enacted, the Bill will apply to information about individuals that is derived from genetic technologies to the extent that this information could constitute personal information about an individual. Such information will have the same level of privacy protection that is afforded to other types of sensitive personal information under the Bill.
However, the Attorney-General acknowledges that advances in gene technology raise unique privacy and discrimination issues that will require separate consideration, and has announced that he intends to pursue further policy consideration of such issues.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetic Information: Legislation</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech

Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
On Monday 26 June 2000, (Hansard page: 14609) Senator O'Brien asked me:
1.	Can the Minister inform the Senate whether GST is payable on real estate commissions on contracts which are exchanged before I July but will not be settled until after that date?
2.	Is the minister aware that the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales believes that GST is payable on settlements made after 1 July but the National Real Estate Institute is advising that GST can be avoided by proving that introductions of buyer and seller occurred before 1 July? Can the Assistant Treasurer, who, after all, has ministerial responsibility for GST implementation, provide a definitive answer for the many real estate buyers and sellers with thousands of dollars each riding on this important decision and a number of settlements which will occur on 1 July or on Monday.
I now seek leave to have this incorporated in Hansard.
1.	Where a real estate agent's contract of service is for the sale of a house, then the time the service is performed is when settlement is completed.
If settlement occurs after 1 July 2000 then the commission will be subject to GST.
However, subject to any applicable State or Territory law, if an agent has an agreement for service such that his services are complete at an earlier point in time, then the time of supply will be at that time. For example, where the contract for service is to establish an unconditional sale agreement, the time of supply is when the contract becomes unconditional. Where this occurs before 1 July 2000, GST will not apply.
Where independent services such as advertising or valuations occur before 1 July 2000 these may be regarded as separate supplies and would not be subject to GST.
2.	Under A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Transition) Act 1999 the seller of real property is liable for GST on the sale of taxable real property when the freehold interest is ""made available"" to the purchaser after 1 July 2000.
The freehold interest in real property is generally made available at the time of settlement of the sale contract, whether the contact is conditional or unconditional.
GST cannot be avoided by proving that the introduction of the buyer and the seller of a taxable supply of real property occurred before 1 July 2000.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods And Services Tax: Real Estate Commissions</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech

Motion (by Senator Calvert) proposed:
That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I move an amendment to the Selection of Bills Committee report motion:
At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000, the bill be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 16 August 2000"".
Item 3 of the report states:
The committee considered the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000 but could not agree on whether the bill should be referred to a committee. 
I seek to amend the report by adding to the items in 2(a) the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000 and make it referable immediately to the economics committee with a reporting date of 16 August 2000. Let me say in support of this proposal that this bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on the 21st of this month—that is, last Wednesday, a week ago. The government says that this piece of legislation should not be referred to a committee and committed by that process, apparently with some view that it ought be available to be dealt with this week. I would have thought that the government had a considerable program of legislation to deal with this week, some of which is critical to the timeliness of the implementation of the GST. 
—I am not sure what the sotto voce interjection was from Senator Kemp. Perhaps he knows that this really is not something that the government wants to deal with this week but merely does not want referred to a committee. I am not sure which is the case. 
—Sit down and I will tell you.
—I am happy for you to tell me when you have the opportunity. I thought Senator Campbell was going to speak to this. It seems to me that the opposition's position, which is to have this bill available to be dealt with in the next week of sittings, is very reasonable. For it to be suggested that somehow, because there is a loophole in the legislation, we ought to forgo our rights, given that the government did not give priority to this piece of legislation for it to be introduced in the House of Representatives until last Wednesday, is wrong. Then they say that we should not have an opportunity to give it consideration so that there are actually two parliamentary sitting weeks between the time it is introduced into the House of Representatives and potentially the time it is dealt with here. That is the opposition's position on this matter. It seems to me to be quite a reasonable proposition. I would urge the Senate to accept the amendment proposed to the report of the Selection of Bills Committee and allow the economics committee to conduct a hearing in relation to the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000, which I stress again was introduced into the House of Representatives last Wednesday.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-28,"—We oppose the reference of the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000 to a Senate committee. It is an important bill which deals with excise evasion. Interestingly, it is a bill that the Labor Party have called for. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, has called for this. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, put out a press release saying that he supported the bill. Further, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, constantly goes on record complaining about the government's record in tackling things like tax evasion and excise evasion.
This is one occasion on which the Labor Party could have ensured the speedy passage of a bill which it supports. The fact that it has not I think is disgraceful. In future, every time the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, speaks about whether or not the government is moving speedily on an issue, I will have some pleasure in pointing out to him how he delayed this important bill, contrary to his calls for speedy action and in contradiction to his position that the Labor Party supports this bill.
Frankly, this bill is a result of very wide consultation with the industry. There is a very serious problem. There may well be arguments about exactly how much excise is being evaded, but there is no argument that the amount is substantial. The government opposes the reference of this bill.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-06-28,"—Madam Deputy President, I wish to move an amendment.
—Senator Allison, we already have one amendment before the chair, but you can foreshadow an amendment.
—Madam Deputy President, I foreshadow an amendment  which will add `and in respect of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Bill 2000 that the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee report on 6 September 2000'.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I normally would not speak in such a debate, but the buffoonery of the Assistant Treasurer has forced me to join with my—
— Senator, do not reflect upon another senator in this place, please.
—I was not. I was talking about his contribution. I described it as buffoonery, which I believe is parliamentary. But if you were suggesting to me it is not, I would not use it. But, with respect, Madam Deputy President, I think buffoonery is not unparliamentary. So we have the buffoonery of the Assistant Treasurer, who is proposing that with important legislation we break with the tradition of this chamber; that is, of course, when senators wish to have bills referred to committees, it normally is accepted by the Selection of Bills Committee that that process take place without debate. That is the way this place has worked. Senator O'Brien tells me that, since he has been whip, he can only recall one other occasion where that has not been accepted as a matter of course.
What I think the Senate needs to understand and acknowledge is that what Senator Kemp is proposing is quite out of the ordinary. What the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, has proposed is that there be adequate parliamentary scrutiny of important legislation. I must say that Mr Kelvin Thomson's approach on this is one that I warmly share and embrace. He is quite right: we ought to closely examine this legislation and it is appropriate that it be done within a reasonable time frame. It is not an outlandish proposal that Senator O'Brien has moved; it is a perfectly reasonable proposal to have a quick committee inquiry into this particular legislation. That is just standard operating procedure for the Senate. It is the way the Senate works on legislation like this. 
No case has been put forward by the Assistant Treasurer for urgency in relation to this bill, none at all. He did not even canvass the issue before the chamber. His only case was that Mr Thomson wanted the bill to pass. That may well be so. But Mr Thomson and the opposition want adequate parliamentary scrutiny. Here you have the Assistant Treasurer either unwilling or unable—probably unable—to make a case before this chamber. This is wholly unsatisfactory. It is typical of the sort of performance we see from the Assistant Treasurer—unable to answer a question in this place, unable to put a case before the chamber. As far as the opposition is concerned, we will not accept the inadequacy of the Assistant Treasurer's performance in this regard. No case has been put forward that this bill should be exempt from proper parliamentary scrutiny.
The opposition and, I hope, the whole chamber will take seriously the need to have proper parliamentary scrutiny of important legislation. But the opposition is not standing here saying, `Oh, we need to deal with this bill; this bill ought to be dealt with some time in the never-never.' A reasonable time constraint has been applied. It can be dealt with when the Senate resumes its sittings in a few weeks time. That is a sensible and responsible proposal that Senator O'Brien has put forward. It means that there will be adequate scrutiny and the Senate will fulfil its obligations to review this legislation.
I hope that the whole chamber deals with the Assistant Treasurer's proposition—and the manner in which he has put it—with the contempt it deserves. We need to defend the Senate's role in relation to scrutiny of this important legislation, and I would like to say that I warmly endorse what I think is a very sensible amendment. I indicate that the opposition will be strongly behind this important amendment that has been moved by the opposition whip, Senator O'Brien. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-06-28,"—Just for the information of the chamber, the Democrats will be supporting the Labor amendment. We are concerned also about the hasty nature of this process.
—Hear, hear!
—Of course—through you, Madam Deputy President, to Senator Faulkner—we very much stand up for proper scrutiny of legislation and policy in this place. I understand that Senator O'Brien referred to the recent introduction of that legislation. The Democrats were only offered a briefing on that bill, I think, in the last 24 hours. So we will be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-28,"—I want to speak just briefly on the issue of the foreshadowed amendment by Senator Lyn Allison from the Democrats to say that it does make the Selection of Bills Committee process hard to manage. The issue we have been debating in relation to the so-called chop-chop bill—as I like to call it—the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000, was something we expected. There was a genuine disagreement between the parties. Those things have to be resolved on the floor of the chamber, and of course that will be resolved.
The one that Senator Allison has foreshadowed relates to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000. All parties at the Selection of Bills Committee, including the Australian Democrats Whip, agreed that the reporting date would be 14 August. I understand the date was agreed to unanimously. In fact, the Selection of Bills Committee can only work where there is unanimous agreement for references and references reporting, and that includes the committee that that reference is to go to and the reporting date. I understand from the very quick inquiries I have been able to make since Lyn Allison foreshadowed her amendment in respect of the reporting date that the government has not been consulted about a change to the reporting date. We have not had any reason why the reporting date should be extended. The government regards this as a bill that we would like to deal with as soon as the Senate returns. We obviously have something like 6½ weeks to consider this bill between now and then. 
—What was the committee's recommendation?
—The committee's recommendation was unanimous. It agreed to 14 August, which I think is in the middle of the first week back.
—With the legislation committee?
—Yes, with the legislation committee. I do not think Senator Allison is intending moving the committee it goes to; I think it is just a matter of the reporting date. That is correct—she has just nodded. So there is no disagreement to that. Indeed, as Senator Faulkner would know from his own experiences, the manager of the Selection of Bills Committee can only refer things to legislation committees.
—But you were upending that process a bit earlier.
—Senator Campbell, I understand that the foreshadowed amendment has the effect of sending it to the references committee.
—Yes. Clearly the Senate can obviously decide wherever they want to send bills, but the Selection of Bills Committee can only send stuff to legislation committees.
—That is not right. It can send it anywhere it wants, but it usually sends it to legislation committees.
—It usually sends it to legislation committees. The other thing it usually does is unanimously agree on where they should go and when they should report. Yesterday afternoon, less than 24 hours ago, the Australian Democrats agreed, as did the Labor Party and the coalition parties, to send this to the legislation committee and to report by 14 August. The government will be sticking by the agreement that was made at that committee meeting yesterday.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I would like to explain the circumstances around the referral. There are two matters that I want to raise. Firstly, this question has been considered at length by the environment references committee in its other inquiry on global warming, so it seems most appropriate that it be referred to the references committee. I apologise for the lateness of this change. I was not aware that we had agreed in the Selection of Bills Committee. However, the last 24 hours has been spent trying to find appropriate times for hearing dates. We need only two—that is the plan. It has just been impossible to get those senators on that committee to be available at that time. So, even with our best endeavours, it will not be possible for us to report on 14 August, given the pressures on senators on that committee and on the secretariat itself.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—This is a matter which was dealt with at the Selection of Bills Committee meeting. There are occasions, however, where things change subsequent to the Selection of Bills Committee meeting and where arrangements are made about references and reported to this chamber. This matter has come, I would concede, at a very late hour for us to deal with. The alternative proposition is simply to remove reference to this bill from the report and, by notice of motion, proceed to reference of this bill. That is the alternative course of action which seems to me to unscramble the omelette that we have created by the apparently changed circumstances. I understand what Senator Allison is saying, and I accept that she has had discussions with Senator Bolkus and that there is a measure of agreement with it. I say that without having had the opportunity of talking to Senator Bolkus. I see he is here now nodding, but I have not been able to talk to him before this very second. It seems to me that it would be more productive if Senator Allison were permitted to amend this report by removing this reference and be given leave to give notice. 
—You could just let the report stand as it is and negotiate a further amendment later on, I understand.
—If that is a better course, I am happy for any advice that can be given, given that I am speaking, as it were, on the run on this matter, so that we can resolve the matter. In trying to truncate the debate on this matter, I think the outcome will be, as the Labor Party understands it, that this bill will be referred to a references committee. We will be supporting that reference with a reporting date of 6 September.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I wish to speak to this while people try to work something out. I think the best approach is for Senator Allison to move an amendment, or to indicate an amendment, at this stage to the committee report and handle it that way. That means we do not, as a set-up, lock ourselves into one course of action when we know that we really want to embark upon another course of action. I also apologise for some sort of communication breakdown here, but we have been working on this. There are issues involved in this legislation which are broader than just the legislation. That is why we have taken this approach. Not just environmentalists but also industry have a range of issues they want to raise with respect to this matter. Those issues would not be accommodated by a legislation committee process. So, without wanting to prolong the Senate too much, can I suggest, following up the whips' suggestion, that Senator Allison should give notice of an amendment and we will proceed down that way. 
—I would like to put to the vote that the amendment moved by Senator O'Brien to the adoption of the report be agreed to. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Motion (by Senator Allison) proposed: 
At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Bill 2000, the provisions of the bills be referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and report by 6 September 2000"".",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-28,"—I thought that Senator O'Brien had suggested that Senator Allison would seek leave to give notice of a motion to refer this bill to a references committee. Is she now proposing to amend the motion in the way she has already foreshadowed? In other words, is she going to proceed with amending the report? 
—At the moment Senator Allison has moved her motion as she foreshadowed it, to amend the report. The question is that that amendment be agreed to. 
—I thought that the course of action proposed by the opposition was the correct position. They have made it clear in their statements previously that they were not aware that this recommendation of the committee was going to be upturned less than 24 hours later. The government has not been consulted about changing the committee to which it was to be sent and the date on which it was going to be sent. The Democrat whip agreed less than 24 hours ago that it would go to a legislation committee and that it would report on 14 August. We are now to see the cold, hard use of the numbers in this place to overturn an agreement that was made in good faith less than 24 hours ago. I have now had it alluded to us as to why they would like it sent to a references committee. We have not had good reason why the reporting date should be extended by a significant period. The government has not been consulted on this. 
I regard this as bad form, bad practice, when you have a Selection of Bills Committee that is supposed to make these things proceed on a consensus basis. We have had no consultation whatsoever. It leaves the Democrat whip in an invidious position that she should have to make agreements on behalf of her party. The Labor Party whip makes an agreement on behalf of his party and we see it undone on the floor of the chamber. It destroys the goodwill that has been built up in the Selection of Bills Committee process over a long period with whips like Senator Kerry O'Brien, who does a superb job on behalf of the Labor Party, and Senator Vicky Bourne, who does a superb job on behalf of the Democrats. The government is strongly opposed to this and also opposes in the most vigorous terms what I regard as a serious undermining of the processes of the Selection of Bills Committee meeting.  ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-06-28,"—There is some substance in regard to this matter in what the Manager of Government Business says. However, we have already had one instance just a few minutes ago where the usual modus operandi of the Selection of Bills Committee has been overturned also. But I hear what the Manager of Government Business says. It seems to me in this circumstance that a sensible way of dealing with this matter, given that I understand the manager indicated that the government is happy with this course of action, would be if leave were sought at a later stage for a notice of motion to be given after this so that the matter can be sorted out outside the chamber. In that circumstance, that seems to me to be a reasonable way forward. 
The general point that ought to be made here is that the Selection of Bills Committee process works in the best interests of all senators. We have had the extraordinary and unacceptable proposition argued by Senator Kemp. But on the same basis, if we are going to be consistent on this, then we ought to deal with the matters put to the Selection of Bills Committee previously in relation to this legislation in a similar way. I say to the Australian Democrat senators, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that, if there is an understanding that we can deal with this via leave being given for a notice of motion and it can be sorted out outside the chamber over the next few hours, the opposition certainly will give leave. The government has indicated it will give leave. 
Anyway, the tyranny of numbers is such that if that does not progress in an appropriate way we will suspend standing orders and ensure that appropriate notice is given. Maybe we can just short-circuit this and save a bit of time and deal with it that way. As far as the opposition is concerned, the whips can consult shadow ministers. There can be continuing arrangements that bring the government whip and the government manager into the loop with what is being proposed. I think that is a sensible way forward and I am happy to embrace that in these circumstances. It will not impact the final outcome that I understand perhaps a majority of senators are trying to achieve. If we go down this track we maintain the integrity of the processes and we do not upend them, like we saw from Senator Kemp just a few moments ago. 
—Thank God he has left.
—Thank God he has left.

Motion (by Senator Calvert) proposed:
That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,7,2,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I move an amendment to the Selection of Bills Committee report motion:
At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000, the bill be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 16 August 2000"".
Item 3 of the report states:
The committee considered the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000 but could not agree on whether the bill should be referred to a committee. 
I seek to amend the report by adding to the items in 2(a) the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000 and make it referable immediately to the economics committee with a reporting date of 16 August 2000. Let me say in support of this proposal that this bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on the 21st of this month—that is, last Wednesday, a week ago. The government says that this piece of legislation should not be referred to a committee and committed by that process, apparently with some view that it ought be available to be dealt with this week. I would have thought that the government had a considerable program of legislation to deal with this week, some of which is critical to the timeliness of the implementation of the GST. 
—I am not sure what the sotto voce interjection was from Senator Kemp. Perhaps he knows that this really is not something that the government wants to deal with this week but merely does not want referred to a committee. I am not sure which is the case. 
—Sit down and I will tell you.
—I am happy for you to tell me when you have the opportunity. I thought Senator Campbell was going to speak to this. It seems to me that the opposition's position, which is to have this bill available to be dealt with in the next week of sittings, is very reasonable. For it to be suggested that somehow, because there is a loophole in the legislation, we ought to forgo our rights, given that the government did not give priority to this piece of legislation for it to be introduced in the House of Representatives until last Wednesday, is wrong. Then they say that we should not have an opportunity to give it consideration so that there are actually two parliamentary sitting weeks between the time it is introduced into the House of Representatives and potentially the time it is dealt with here. That is the opposition's position on this matter. It seems to me to be quite a reasonable proposition. I would urge the Senate to accept the amendment proposed to the report of the Selection of Bills Committee and allow the economics committee to conduct a hearing in relation to the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000, which I stress again was introduced into the House of Representatives last Wednesday.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-28,"—We oppose the reference of the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000 to a Senate committee. It is an important bill which deals with excise evasion. Interestingly, it is a bill that the Labor Party have called for. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, has called for this. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, put out a press release saying that he supported the bill. Further, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, constantly goes on record complaining about the government's record in tackling things like tax evasion and excise evasion.
This is one occasion on which the Labor Party could have ensured the speedy passage of a bill which it supports. The fact that it has not I think is disgraceful. In future, every time the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, speaks about whether or not the government is moving speedily on an issue, I will have some pleasure in pointing out to him how he delayed this important bill, contrary to his calls for speedy action and in contradiction to his position that the Labor Party supports this bill.
Frankly, this bill is a result of very wide consultation with the industry. There is a very serious problem. There may well be arguments about exactly how much excise is being evaded, but there is no argument that the amount is substantial. The government opposes the reference of this bill.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,7,2,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-06-28,"—Madam Deputy President, I wish to move an amendment.
—Senator Allison, we already have one amendment before the chair, but you can foreshadow an amendment.
—Madam Deputy President, I foreshadow an amendment  which will add `and in respect of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Bill 2000 that the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee report on 6 September 2000'.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,7,2,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I normally would not speak in such a debate, but the buffoonery of the Assistant Treasurer has forced me to join with my—
— Senator, do not reflect upon another senator in this place, please.
—I was not. I was talking about his contribution. I described it as buffoonery, which I believe is parliamentary. But if you were suggesting to me it is not, I would not use it. But, with respect, Madam Deputy President, I think buffoonery is not unparliamentary. So we have the buffoonery of the Assistant Treasurer, who is proposing that with important legislation we break with the tradition of this chamber; that is, of course, when senators wish to have bills referred to committees, it normally is accepted by the Selection of Bills Committee that that process take place without debate. That is the way this place has worked. Senator O'Brien tells me that, since he has been whip, he can only recall one other occasion where that has not been accepted as a matter of course.
What I think the Senate needs to understand and acknowledge is that what Senator Kemp is proposing is quite out of the ordinary. What the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, has proposed is that there be adequate parliamentary scrutiny of important legislation. I must say that Mr Kelvin Thomson's approach on this is one that I warmly share and embrace. He is quite right: we ought to closely examine this legislation and it is appropriate that it be done within a reasonable time frame. It is not an outlandish proposal that Senator O'Brien has moved; it is a perfectly reasonable proposal to have a quick committee inquiry into this particular legislation. That is just standard operating procedure for the Senate. It is the way the Senate works on legislation like this. 
No case has been put forward by the Assistant Treasurer for urgency in relation to this bill, none at all. He did not even canvass the issue before the chamber. His only case was that Mr Thomson wanted the bill to pass. That may well be so. But Mr Thomson and the opposition want adequate parliamentary scrutiny. Here you have the Assistant Treasurer either unwilling or unable—probably unable—to make a case before this chamber. This is wholly unsatisfactory. It is typical of the sort of performance we see from the Assistant Treasurer—unable to answer a question in this place, unable to put a case before the chamber. As far as the opposition is concerned, we will not accept the inadequacy of the Assistant Treasurer's performance in this regard. No case has been put forward that this bill should be exempt from proper parliamentary scrutiny.
The opposition and, I hope, the whole chamber will take seriously the need to have proper parliamentary scrutiny of important legislation. But the opposition is not standing here saying, `Oh, we need to deal with this bill; this bill ought to be dealt with some time in the never-never.' A reasonable time constraint has been applied. It can be dealt with when the Senate resumes its sittings in a few weeks time. That is a sensible and responsible proposal that Senator O'Brien has put forward. It means that there will be adequate scrutiny and the Senate will fulfil its obligations to review this legislation.
I hope that the whole chamber deals with the Assistant Treasurer's proposition—and the manner in which he has put it—with the contempt it deserves. We need to defend the Senate's role in relation to scrutiny of this important legislation, and I would like to say that I warmly endorse what I think is a very sensible amendment. I indicate that the opposition will be strongly behind this important amendment that has been moved by the opposition whip, Senator O'Brien.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-06-28,"—Just for the information of the chamber, the Democrats will be supporting the Labor amendment. We are concerned also about the hasty nature of this process.
—Hear, hear!
—Of course—through you, Madam Deputy President, to Senator Faulkner—we very much stand up for proper scrutiny of legislation and policy in this place. I understand that Senator O'Brien referred to the recent introduction of that legislation. The Democrats were only offered a briefing on that bill, I think, in the last 24 hours. So we will be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,7,2,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-28,"—I want to speak just briefly on the issue of the foreshadowed amendment by Senator Lyn Allison from the Democrats to say that it does make the Selection of Bills Committee process hard to manage. The issue we have been debating in relation to the so-called chop-chop bill—as I like to call it—the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000, was something we expected. There was a genuine disagreement between the parties. Those things have to be resolved on the floor of the chamber, and of course that will be resolved.
The one that Senator Allison has foreshadowed relates to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000. All parties at the Selection of Bills Committee, including the Australian Democrats Whip, agreed that the reporting date would be 14 August. I understand the date was agreed to unanimously. In fact, the Selection of Bills Committee can only work where there is unanimous agreement for references and references reporting, and that includes the committee that that reference is to go to and the reporting date. I understand from the very quick inquiries I have been able to make since Lyn Allison foreshadowed her amendment in respect of the reporting date that the government has not been consulted about a change to the reporting date. We have not had any reason why the reporting date should be extended. The government regards this as a bill that we would like to deal with as soon as the Senate returns. We obviously have something like 6½ weeks to consider this bill between now and then. 
—What was the committee's recommendation?
—The committee's recommendation was unanimous. It agreed to 14 August, which I think is in the middle of the first week back.
—With the legislation committee?
—Yes, with the legislation committee. I do not think Senator Allison is intending moving the committee it goes to; I think it is just a matter of the reporting date. That is correct—she has just nodded. So there is no disagreement to that. Indeed, as Senator Faulkner would know from his own experiences, the manager of the Selection of Bills Committee can only refer things to legislation committees.
—But you were upending that process a bit earlier.
—Senator Campbell, I understand that the foreshadowed amendment has the effect of sending it to the references committee.
—Yes. Clearly the Senate can obviously decide wherever they want to send bills, but the Selection of Bills Committee can only send stuff to legislation committees.
—That is not right. It can send it anywhere it wants, but it usually sends it to legislation committees.
—It usually sends it to legislation committees. The other thing it usually does is unanimously agree on where they should go and when they should report. Yesterday afternoon, less than 24 hours ago, the Australian Democrats agreed, as did the Labor Party and the coalition parties, to send this to the legislation committee and to report by 14 August. The government will be sticking by the agreement that was made at that committee meeting yesterday.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,7,2,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I would like to explain the circumstances around the referral. There are two matters that I want to raise. Firstly, this question has been considered at length by the environment references committee in its other inquiry on global warming, so it seems most appropriate that it be referred to the references committee. I apologise for the lateness of this change. I was not aware that we had agreed in the Selection of Bills Committee. However, the last 24 hours has been spent trying to find appropriate times for hearing dates. We need only two—that is the plan. It has just been impossible to get those senators on that committee to be available at that time. So, even with our best endeavours, it will not be possible for us to report on 14 August, given the pressures on senators on that committee and on the secretariat itself.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,7,2,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—This is a matter which was dealt with at the Selection of Bills Committee meeting. There are occasions, however, where things change subsequent to the Selection of Bills Committee meeting and where arrangements are made about references and reported to this chamber. This matter has come, I would concede, at a very late hour for us to deal with. The alternative proposition is simply to remove reference to this bill from the report and, by notice of motion, proceed to reference of this bill. That is the alternative course of action which seems to me to unscramble the omelette that we have created by the apparently changed circumstances. I understand what Senator Allison is saying, and I accept that she has had discussions with Senator Bolkus and that there is a measure of agreement with it. I say that without having had the opportunity of talking to Senator Bolkus. I see he is here now nodding, but I have not been able to talk to him before this very second. It seems to me that it would be more productive if Senator Allison were permitted to amend this report by removing this reference and be given leave to give notice. 
—You could just let the report stand as it is and negotiate a further amendment later on, I understand.
—If that is a better course, I am happy for any advice that can be given, given that I am speaking, as it were, on the run on this matter, so that we can resolve the matter. In trying to truncate the debate on this matter, I think the outcome will be, as the Labor Party understands it, that this bill will be referred to a references committee. We will be supporting that reference with a reporting date of 6 September.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,7,2,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I wish to speak to this while people try to work something out. I think the best approach is for Senator Allison to move an amendment, or to indicate an amendment, at this stage to the committee report and handle it that way. That means we do not, as a set-up, lock ourselves into one course of action when we know that we really want to embark upon another course of action. I also apologise for some sort of communication breakdown here, but we have been working on this. There are issues involved in this legislation which are broader than just the legislation. That is why we have taken this approach. Not just environmentalists but also industry have a range of issues they want to raise with respect to this matter. Those issues would not be accommodated by a legislation committee process. So, without wanting to prolong the Senate too much, can I suggest, following up the whips' suggestion, that Senator Allison should give notice of an amendment and we will proceed down that way. 
—I would like to put to the vote that the amendment moved by Senator O'Brien to the adoption of the report be agreed to. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Motion (by Senator Allison) proposed: 
At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Bill 2000, the provisions of the bills be referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and report by 6 September 2000"".",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,7,2,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-28,"—I thought that Senator O'Brien had suggested that Senator Allison would seek leave to give notice of a motion to refer this bill to a references committee. Is she now proposing to amend the motion in the way she has already foreshadowed? In other words, is she going to proceed with amending the report? 
—At the moment Senator Allison has moved her motion as she foreshadowed it, to amend the report. The question is that that amendment be agreed to. 
—I thought that the course of action proposed by the opposition was the correct position. They have made it clear in their statements previously that they were not aware that this recommendation of the committee was going to be upturned less than 24 hours later. The government has not been consulted about changing the committee to which it was to be sent and the date on which it was going to be sent. The Democrat whip agreed less than 24 hours ago that it would go to a legislation committee and that it would report on 14 August. We are now to see the cold, hard use of the numbers in this place to overturn an agreement that was made in good faith less than 24 hours ago. I have now had it alluded to us as to why they would like it sent to a references committee. We have not had good reason why the reporting date should be extended by a significant period. The government has not been consulted on this. 
I regard this as bad form, bad practice, when you have a Selection of Bills Committee that is supposed to make these things proceed on a consensus basis. We have had no consultation whatsoever. It leaves the Democrat whip in an invidious position that she should have to make agreements on behalf of her party. The Labor Party whip makes an agreement on behalf of his party and we see it undone on the floor of the chamber. It destroys the goodwill that has been built up in the Selection of Bills Committee process over a long period with whips like Senator Kerry O'Brien, who does a superb job on behalf of the Labor Party, and Senator Vicky Bourne, who does a superb job on behalf of the Democrats. The government is strongly opposed to this and also opposes in the most vigorous terms what I regard as a serious undermining of the processes of the Selection of Bills Committee meeting.  ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,7,2,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-06-28,"—There is some substance in regard to this matter in what the Manager of Government Business says. However, we have already had one instance just a few minutes ago where the usual modus operandi of the Selection of Bills Committee has been overturned also. But I hear what the Manager of Government Business says. It seems to me in this circumstance that a sensible way of dealing with this matter, given that I understand the manager indicated that the government is happy with this course of action, would be if leave were sought at a later stage for a notice of motion to be given after this so that the matter can be sorted out outside the chamber. In that circumstance, that seems to me to be a reasonable way forward. 
The general point that ought to be made here is that the Selection of Bills Committee process works in the best interests of all senators. We have had the extraordinary and unacceptable proposition argued by Senator Kemp. But on the same basis, if we are going to be consistent on this, then we ought to deal with the matters put to the Selection of Bills Committee previously in relation to this legislation in a similar way. I say to the Australian Democrat senators, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that, if there is an understanding that we can deal with this via leave being given for a notice of motion and it can be sorted out outside the chamber over the next few hours, the opposition certainly will give leave. The government has indicated it will give leave. 
Anyway, the tyranny of numbers is such that if that does not progress in an appropriate way we will suspend standing orders and ensure that appropriate notice is given. Maybe we can just short-circuit this and save a bit of time and deal with it that way. As far as the opposition is concerned, the whips can consult shadow ministers. There can be continuing arrangements that bring the government whip and the government manager into the loop with what is being proposed. I think that is a sensible way forward and I am happy to embrace that in these circumstances. It will not impact the final outcome that I understand perhaps a majority of senators are trying to achieve. If we go down this track we maintain the integrity of the processes and we do not upend them, like we saw from Senator Kemp just a few moments ago.

We have just had the government being concerned about the lack of process in this place, but that is the first I have heard of that motion. I will be interested to hear what the government's reasoning for that is and what the legislative slate that it expects to deal with on Friday is before we get into what could be quite a prolonged debate on that matter in the morning.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-28,"—I think it is appropriate that I respond to Senator Brown's question. We have given notice of a motion. The government's intention is to conclude our business on schedule tomorrow night. We think the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000 has taken longer than any of us envisaged. I think that is fair to say. We have now given notice that we may need to sit tomorrow night—that is, Thursday night—to try to conclude our schedule. I have distributed to all honourable senators, or at least leaders and whips, and that includes Senator Brown, a list of the bills we would be hoping to complete consideration of before we rise at the conclusion of these sittings. They are the bills we seek to conclude. We have given notice of a motion to sit on Friday as a contingency. It is a contingency I earnestly, honestly and frankly hope we do not need to use. I hope we can conclude our business by normal sitting hours tomorrow. If we cannot do that, sit on Thursday night and, clearly, if we cannot do that, sit on Friday. But I really hope that we do not have to use that. It is very much put on the Notice Paper, Senator Brown, as a contingency.

Leave granted.
—I move:
(1)	Omit ""5 September 2000"", substitute ""5 October 2000"".
(2)	After paragraph (a), insert:
	(aa)	the provision and promotion of appeal mechanisms for decisions by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator and the veto role of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage under the bill and related Acts;
	(ab)	the reflection and promotion of the precautionary principle in the Bill;
(3)	After paragraph (d), insert:
	(da)	the adequacy and effectiveness of public consultation and participation in gene technology regulation by the OGTR; 
(4)	At the end of the motion, add:
	(l)	the adequacy of current and proposed notification and containment procedures, under the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, for deliberate releases of genetically modified organisms.
The gist of the Australian Democrats' amendments to this motion of reference to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee proposing an inquiry into the Gene Technology Bill 2000 is essentially designed to strengthen what we see as a good terms of reference but can be improved upon. I understand that there is not majority support for those amendments. Rather than hold up the Senate under Order of Business today, I sought leave to comment now. The amendments call for a longer reporting date—that is, we have nominated 5 October—largely as a result of the fact that the introduction of this legislation has been delayed by at least a month by the government. So we do not see that we should necessarily have a reporting date that is strictly in September.
The amendments also seek to ensure that the issue of the role of the environment minister in relation to the gene technology bill is highlighted—in particular, the power of veto for the Minister for the Environment and Heritage under the bill and related acts. We have also included in our proposed amendment the fact that the adequacy and effectiveness of public consultation should be a matter for examination under the committee's reference. We have also proposed that the adequacy of current and proposed notification and containment procedures for the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms under the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, GMAC, also be investigated. 
I would say that the Democrats have tried, on many occasions and over many years, to have an investigation or inquiry into genetic engineering and the issue of GMOs. I am glad to see that it is finally happening but I do make one last plea to the opposition and, indeed, the government: that they support terms of reference that include those factors to which I referred. I can see that they would only strengthen the terms of reference and greatly improve the committee's inquiry. I hope that honourable senators will support the Democrat amendments. As I say, I have moved the amendments standing in my name that were circulated earlier today.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,11,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I realise that we are approaching the end of this session. Normally, in a spirit of generosity, I might entertain the plea, but on this occasion it cannot extend that far. In respect of the matters raised by Senator Stott Despoja on behalf of the Democrats, these terms of reference have been excruciatingly examined and discussed amongst various parties. We have attempted to do that with the Democrats. There have been some problems, particularly when we noted that they issued a press release saying that they were going to refer the bill to the committee—before we had even managed to finalise any terms of reference. Be that as it may, we now have a motion before the chamber. In our view the reporting date that was set strikes a good balance between, on the one hand, the necessity for proper scrutiny—particularly public scrutiny—of the issues, and, on the other, the importance of ensuring that an adequate regulatory regime is introduced as soon as possible. In any event, the ultimate reporting date is a matter that is within the hands of the Senate and the committee in the future, if that is required to be amended. But we aim to meet the timetable. In respect of the other proposed terms of reference, it is our view that they are really adequately covered within the terms of reference set out in the notice of motion, and therefore we will not be able to support the Democrats' amendments on this occasion; but we look forward to their cooperation in the inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I support the amendments that Senator Stott Despoja has moved, because they do improve what is a good set of recommendations for the committee. Gene technology and genetic engineering is not only a complex issue but one that affects all Australians. It is a huge issue. It is extraordinarily important to Australia's future wellbeing—from the health and wellbeing of the rapidly growing organic farming sector in Australia, to the consumers and their right to know what is happening as far as genetically engineered products are concerned. It is an extraordinarily important committee. It will have a very big public input. It has got a very tough task, but this parliament needs to see it for the importance it has. I believe that the one omission—if I can point to one—that I would be adding to this is the economic impact of genetic engineering on Australia. I think it is negative. One only has to see the difficulty that American and Canadian farmers who are growing genetically engineered canola have in trying to sell their unwanted products—so much so that some of them are dumping their products in overseas aid commitments—to know that Australia has to look very carefully at the economic impact, for the worse, that this engineering alternative being foisted rapidly upon Australia by the multinationals might have. I will be taking a very keen interest on behalf of the Greens and will be fostering maximum public awareness of this committee and of the need for input to the committee, to help balance the undoubted huge sway that the multinational corporations will have on it. I support the Democrat amendments. It would improve the committee's ability to look at the matter if they were adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,11,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I believe that the amendments put forward by the Democrats do add substantially to an issue that is of very great public importance, particularly when you look at the fact that the amendments themselves ask for the committee to look at and reflect upon the precautionary principle. If there is anything that we should show precaution in, it is genetically modified food. They also go to the adequacy and effectiveness of the public consultation process. To a great degree, one of the most important ones is the adequacy of the current and proposed notifications. I bring to the chamber's notice that there are concerns about seeds that are already being brought into Australia for broadacre planting that have genetically modified material in them. Since 1997, we have had within Australia by-products of genetically modified crops entering the food chain being used as supplementary feed for animals that are bred for human consumption. Therefore I believe that the last amendment by the Democrats is quite probably the most important of the whole lot, because genetically modified food is already getting into our food chain. I place on record One Nation's support for the Democrat amendments.

Leave granted.
—I move:
(1)	Omit ""5 September 2000"", substitute ""5 October 2000"".
(2)	After paragraph (a), insert:
	(aa)	the provision and promotion of appeal mechanisms for decisions by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator and the veto role of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage under the bill and related Acts;
	(ab)	the reflection and promotion of the precautionary principle in the Bill;
(3)	After paragraph (d), insert:
	(da)	the adequacy and effectiveness of public consultation and participation in gene technology regulation by the OGTR; 
(4)	At the end of the motion, add:
	(l)	the adequacy of current and proposed notification and containment procedures, under the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, for deliberate releases of genetically modified organisms.
The gist of the Australian Democrats' amendments to this motion of reference to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee proposing an inquiry into the Gene Technology Bill 2000 is essentially designed to strengthen what we see as a good terms of reference but can be improved upon. I understand that there is not majority support for those amendments. Rather than hold up the Senate under Order of Business today, I sought leave to comment now. The amendments call for a longer reporting date—that is, we have nominated 5 October—largely as a result of the fact that the introduction of this legislation has been delayed by at least a month by the government. So we do not see that we should necessarily have a reporting date that is strictly in September.
The amendments also seek to ensure that the issue of the role of the environment minister in relation to the gene technology bill is highlighted—in particular, the power of veto for the Minister for the Environment and Heritage under the bill and related acts. We have also included in our proposed amendment the fact that the adequacy and effectiveness of public consultation should be a matter for examination under the committee's reference. We have also proposed that the adequacy of current and proposed notification and containment procedures for the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms under the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, GMAC, also be investigated. 
I would say that the Democrats have tried, on many occasions and over many years, to have an investigation or inquiry into genetic engineering and the issue of GMOs. I am glad to see that it is finally happening but I do make one last plea to the opposition and, indeed, the government: that they support terms of reference that include those factors to which I referred. I can see that they would only strengthen the terms of reference and greatly improve the committee's inquiry. I hope that honourable senators will support the Democrat amendments. As I say, I have moved the amendments standing in my name that were circulated earlier today.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,11,2,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I realise that we are approaching the end of this session. Normally, in a spirit of generosity, I might entertain the plea, but on this occasion it cannot extend that far. In respect of the matters raised by Senator Stott Despoja on behalf of the Democrats, these terms of reference have been excruciatingly examined and discussed amongst various parties. We have attempted to do that with the Democrats. There have been some problems, particularly when we noted that they issued a press release saying that they were going to refer the bill to the committee—before we had even managed to finalise any terms of reference. Be that as it may, we now have a motion before the chamber. In our view the reporting date that was set strikes a good balance between, on the one hand, the necessity for proper scrutiny—particularly public scrutiny—of the issues, and, on the other, the importance of ensuring that an adequate regulatory regime is introduced as soon as possible. In any event, the ultimate reporting date is a matter that is within the hands of the Senate and the committee in the future, if that is required to be amended. But we aim to meet the timetable. In respect of the other proposed terms of reference, it is our view that they are really adequately covered within the terms of reference set out in the notice of motion, and therefore we will not be able to support the Democrats' amendments on this occasion; but we look forward to their cooperation in the inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,11,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I support the amendments that Senator Stott Despoja has moved, because they do improve what is a good set of recommendations for the committee. Gene technology and genetic engineering is not only a complex issue but one that affects all Australians. It is a huge issue. It is extraordinarily important to Australia's future wellbeing—from the health and wellbeing of the rapidly growing organic farming sector in Australia, to the consumers and their right to know what is happening as far as genetically engineered products are concerned. It is an extraordinarily important committee. It will have a very big public input. It has got a very tough task, but this parliament needs to see it for the importance it has. I believe that the one omission—if I can point to one—that I would be adding to this is the economic impact of genetic engineering on Australia. I think it is negative. One only has to see the difficulty that American and Canadian farmers who are growing genetically engineered canola have in trying to sell their unwanted products—so much so that some of them are dumping their products in overseas aid commitments—to know that Australia has to look very carefully at the economic impact, for the worse, that this engineering alternative being foisted rapidly upon Australia by the multinationals might have. I will be taking a very keen interest on behalf of the Greens and will be fostering maximum public awareness of this committee and of the need for input to the committee, to help balance the undoubted huge sway that the multinational corporations will have on it. I support the Democrat amendments. It would improve the committee's ability to look at the matter if they were adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,11,2,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I believe that the amendments put forward by the Democrats do add substantially to an issue that is of very great public importance, particularly when you look at the fact that the amendments themselves ask for the committee to look at and reflect upon the precautionary principle. If there is anything that we should show precaution in, it is genetically modified food. They also go to the adequacy and effectiveness of the public consultation process. To a great degree, one of the most important ones is the adequacy of the current and proposed notifications. I bring to the chamber's notice that there are concerns about seeds that are already being brought into Australia for broadacre planting that have genetically modified material in them. Since 1997, we have had within Australia by-products of genetically modified crops entering the food chain being used as supplementary feed for animals that are bred for human consumption.

SENATOR CROWLEY:
In seeking this extension of time to report, I wish to advise the Senate of the Committee's proposed course of action to finalise the inquiry.
The Community Affairs References Committee has received a large volume of information and evidence during its inquiry into public hospital funding. A diversity of views and options as to future directions has been expressed in this evidence.
The Committee will shortly release a First Report, representing its initial response to the terms of reference relating primarily to funding within the Australian health system. In this Report, the Committee will present an overview of the public hospital sector, identify the major problems and issues faced by the sector, examine the adequacy of funding and canvass options for reform.
The Committee has not yet taken a position on any options to be presented in this report, but rather, will present the various possible courses of action for consideration and debate.
The Committee plans to convene a Roundtable Discussion/Forum in August at which expert participants will consider the options presented in this Report. It is the Committee's intention that the Roundtable Discussion/Forum will create an opportunity to provide focussed consideration of the options and enable further development of mechanisms for their introduction.
This process will assist the Committee in its deliberations during the preparation of its final report.

Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into the provisions of the Northern Prawn Fishery Amendment Management Plan 1999 in February 2000. The Committee's report to the Senate on the reference was tabled on 8 March 2000.
The Committee received 81 written submissions on the inquiry, the majority of which were received in the 10 days prior to the Committee's hearing on the inquiry in Brisbane on 3 & 4 February 2000.  The Committee subsequently receiv-ed a further 8 supplementary written submissions. 
Those submissions were not tabled with the Committee's report, and are now tabled.
On the second day of the Committee's hearing, that is, 4 February 2000, two witnesses—Mr Ron Edwards and Mr Murray France—drew the Committee's attention to statements made in several written submissions which they considered contained adverse reflection on a number of individuals: Mr France, Ms Trysh Stone, Mr Bruce Wallner and Ms Annie Jarrett who are involved in private industry, the Northern Management Advisory Committee (NORMAC) or the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA).
During the course of their evidence, the witnesses asked the Committee to consider expunging the statements complained of from the submissions in question pursuant to the Committee's powers under paragraphs (11), (12) and (13) of the procedures which the Senate has ordered be observed by Senate committees for the protection of witnesses appearing before them.
Following the Committee's public hearings on 3 & 4 February 2000, and following further representations to the Committee by Mr Edwards, Mr France and Ms Jarrett, the Committee sought written responses from the persons named in the submissions in question on the statements made.
The persons invited to make responses to the Committee were 
Mr Murray France;
Ms Annie Jarrett;
Ms Trysh Stone; and
Mr Bruce Wallner 
The Committee received a written submission from each person responding to both general and specific comments made about them in a total of 5 of the written submissions published by the Committee.
Each of these persons asked that, if it was within the Committee's power to order certain statements expunged from the submissions.
As all submissions received by the Committee were published at the commencement of the Committee's Brisbane hearing on 3 February 2000, the Committee has obtained the advice of the Clerk of the Senate on the Committee's powers to consider and comply with such a request.
In a letter dated 8 March 2000, the Clerk of the Senate advised the Committee that—pursuant to current Senate resolutions regarding privilege and on the protection of witnesses appearing before Committees—the Committee has no power to order that statements in written submissions which had been published by the Committee be expunged. 
The Clerk has also advised that the Committee should table all written submissions published by the Committee together with the further correspondence sent to the Committee by Mr France, Ms Stone, Ms Jarrett and Mr Wallner. 
The Clerk's letter of advice to the Committee is tabled with this statement.
As Chairman of the Committee I should make some comment, on the Committee's behalf, on this matter.
The Committee's inquiry into the Northern Prawn Fishery Amendment Plan was the final inquiry in a difficult, time-consuming process of scientific study, industry consultation and decision on future fishing management methods within the northern Australian prawn fishing industry.
Hearings were held in Brisbane over two days following notification by operators from Western Australia and the Northern Territory that they were prepared to attend hearings by the Committee in Brisbane.
Twenty years ago, it should be stressed, the north Australian prawn trawl fishery was a prolific and highly profitable fishery. However, evidence is now clear that a substantial reduction in fishing effort is required if it is to remain economically and environmentally sustainable.
Such a reduction in effort appears the only way that rapid further depletion of the resource can be avoided. AFMA recommended, after extensive consultation through NORMAC, and after a review of the process by Justice Toohey that—in view of the depleting resource level—reduction in fleet effort by way of gear limitation, as opposed to restrictions on fishery output based on quota catch, was the favoured option.
The Committee found during its hearings that the decision to amend the prawn fishery management plan was controversial and one to which a number of trawler owners strenuously objected.
It is in this context that the statements and assertions made in these submissions in question were made.
The Committee, I must emphasise, considers that the statements that were complained of do reflect adversely on each individual and that the reflections in no way assist the case made in those submissions. The Committee has no reason to doubt the integrity and professional capacity or honesty of those named and reflected upon.
The Committee has also been provided with a copy of a letter dated 30 May 2000 from Mr Warren Entsch, MP, the Member for Leichhardt sent to the acting Chair of AFMA. Mr Entsch strongly criticised AFMA and, in the course of the letter, criticising the extent of this Committee's inquiry.  This letter is also tabled. 
The Committee points out that its report on the Fishery Amendment plan was a unanimous report by a Committee with Government Senators Crane and McGauran, Opposition Senators Forshaw and O'Brien and Democrat Senator Bartlett.  That usual membership was supplemented by the participation in the inquiry of Senators Crossin, Harris and McLucas, representing areas of Australia where the fishery operates. 
The Committee was careful to ensure that a broad representative cross section of parties making representations to the Committee were given a hearing, and that—in particular—scientific evidence on the state of the fishery and forecasts for its sustainability were scrutinised.
Accordingly, the Committee believes that the comments made by Mr Enstch MP, after the Committee had completed its inquiry and tabled its report, were not accurate and nor were they helpful in resolving the ongoing management issues required to manage this significant fishery.
The Committee understands that AFMA itself has now responded to Mr Enstch's letter.  
It was not the responsibility of the Committee to involve itself in the political issues related to the fishery, but to examine the plan proposed by AFMA as a way forward: was it necessary, could the old fishery regime be maintained and were there alternative management regimes that would resolve the sustainability issues?
The Committee concluded that the existing Management Plan was not delivering sustainable management due to a number of factors.  It was obvious to the Committee that the existing fishery regime together with technological change had allowed many of the problems, such as effort creep, to arise in the fishery, and that the new plan has real potential to significantly improve the situation.  Consequently, the Committee supported the implementation of the amended Management Plan but also made significant recommendations for further scientific research on a number of important proposals for improvement of the current plan placed before the Committee during the inquiry.
The principal consideration for all Committee members was to put a regime in place which allows a return to a situation where yields are such as to allow a restoration of profitability and also to assist offshore businesses associated with the fishery.  This could only be achieved by having an economically and environmentally sustainable regime.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,16,1,speech

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2000-06-28,"—I present the 16th report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund entitled CERD and the Native Title Amendment Act 1998, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings, tabled documents and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This inquiry resulted from a Senate reference on 9 December 1999 which required the committee to consider whether the amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 were consistent with Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Native Title Act 1993 was amended in 1998 by the Native Title Amendment Act 1998. These amendments were necessary to deal with a range of practical issues that affected the operation of the Native Title Act and the Native Title Tribunal. In particular, the decision of the High Court in Wik highlighted the need for amendments to deal with the practical implications of this decision for the possible coexistence of native title on pastoral leases.
The original Native Title Act was, of course, drafted on the reasonable expectation that the grant of a pastoral lease did in fact extinguish native title. The then Prime Minister and a number of his other ministers in the previous government expressed this view during debates on the original Native Title Bill. The Wik decision changed the view that the grant of a pastoral lease did not necessarily extinguish native title and the rights of pastoralists and native title holders may coexist. This raised a great deal of uncertainty for many people, including miners and pastoralists who had received grants from governments in good faith on the basis of their legitimate understanding of when and how native title was extinguished.
The Native Title Act was amended after an extensive period of consultation with the major stakeholders: indigenous groups, pastoralists, miners and others. The committee held two inquiries into the amendment bills and reported on these inquiries in three reports. As well, the native title amendment bills were debated for over 100 hours in this parliament, a record for any legislation in the history of the Commonwealth parliament. As this report argues, amending the Native Title Act made it a very difficult task for the government to balance the competing interests of all key stakeholders who were potentially affected by native title. 
As this report concludes, the government was entitled at international law to balance these competing rights and interests, when amending the Native Title Act. The amended act achieves a successful balance between competing interests in a way that is fair and reasonable in all of the circumstances. This balance respects the unique rights of indigenous people and their connection to their land, while at the same time providing certainty and workability for all other people. A wide range of measures in the amended act recognise and protect native title, address the special features of native title and, very importantly, address prior extinguishment of native title. In particular, sections 47A and 47B of the amended Native Title Act allow for the prior extinguishment of native title to be disregarded in certain circumstances where indigenous people are occupying the land. One of the substantial amendments to the act was the introduction of the indigenous land use agreement—ILUA—provisions. These provisions have greatly improved the capacity for reaching binding agreements under the amended act and are increasingly being used to resolve claims. The amendments to the act also introduced a new registration test, which was necessary to ensure that only bona fide claimants are able to have their claims registered and therefore gain access to valuable rights such as the right to negotiate and the ILUA provisions.
Australia ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 1975. The Racial Discrimination Act was enacted in the same year to implement Australia's obligations under that convention. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was established under the convention to monitor the compliance of states' parties with their obligations under the convention. In March 1999, the CERD issued its decision on the Native Title Act, in which it expressed concern about the compatibility of the act with Australia's obligations under the convention. As part of its inquiry, CERD heard from a high level Australian delegation led by Mr Robert Orr, the Deputy General Counsel with the Australian Government Solicitor's Office. Curiously, the CERD decision did not refer anywhere to the submissions that were put by the Australian delegation; nor did the CERD decision appear to consider the many beneficial aspects of the Native Title Act, which I have already discussed. 
In particular, CERD asserted that the amendments to the Native Title Act had been enacted without the informed consent of indigenous people. There is, however, no requirement for informed consent at international law. Under Article 5(c) of the convention, Australia is simply required to ensure the effective participation of indigenous people in public affairs. In fact, the government consulted widely, especially with indigenous people, about amending the Native Title Act. As this report notes, there were extensive discussions and negotiations among representatives of indigenous groups, including the National Indigenous Working Group and ATSIC, non-government parties and the Independent senators, particularly in relation to amendments to the act. Indigenous people had a wide range of opportunities to have their views on the proposed amendments to the act considered. As well as the parliamentary inquiries, the Prime Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and senior departmental officers also met with indigenous representatives to discuss the amendments.
So the views of indigenous people were clearly taken into account. Many of the proposals that formed the basis of negotiations with the government, and which were accepted in some form, had their genesis in proposals from indigenous representatives themselves. For instance, the indigenous land use agreement provisions are largely based on a model originally proposed by the National Indigenous Working Group. Australia's obligation under the convention and at international law generally is to prohibit racial discrimination or to ensure that racial equality exists. This is of fundamental importance. The amended Native Title Act is not inconsistent with this obligation. As discussed previously, and as this report highlights, the amended act contains a large number of measures that ensure the protection of native title, take the special nature of native title into account and, in some cases, allow for the restitution of native title where it has already been extinguished. 
In reaching its decisions on Australia's native title legislation, CERD also failed to take into account any of these countervailing beneficial measures. Furthermore, the CERD decision considers individual amendments to the Native Title Act in isolation, rather than taking the more proper approach, which is to consider the amended act as a whole. The CERD decision appears to show some misunderstanding of the operation of Australia's parliamentary democracy by suggesting that the 1998 amendments be `suspended' when this is surely simply not possible to do. It surprised me that CERD did not make itself aware of whether this could be carried out. This parliamentary joint committee on native title is also concerned that CERD was suggesting that all of the 1998 amendments be suspended. This would presumably include the large number of necessary and beneficial amendments that were made to the act—again, a puzzling decision by CERD. This would therefore include the amendments that deal with the operations of the National Native Title Tribunal and the Federal Court, as well as the critical indigenous land use agreement provisions which are now so popular around the country. As the committee notes in this report, it would consider such action a fundamentally retrograde step, which would create at the very least further uncertainty for indigenous and non-indigenous people. A non-government members report would have exactly the same disastrous results. This report, having analysed CERD's decision and the evidence received in the course of this inquiry, concludes, quite properly, that the Native Title Act is consistent with Australia's obligations under the convention to prohibit racial discrimination. I therefore commend the committee's 16th report to the Senate.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2000-06-28,"—This report—framed, written and tabled here in accordance with the statutory responsibilities of this committee—marks a significant step forward in our understanding of native title and indigenous rights. I refer to the non-government members' report. The terms of reference for the joint parliamentary committee required us to evaluate the finding of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 contained provisions and was developed in a manner inconsistent with Australia's international legal obligations. The government vehemently rejected CERD's findings. It went to great lengths to discredit the committee and its work, and we have heard more of that today. They made blustering threats to withdraw from UN treaty bodies.
It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that the non-government members of the joint parliamentary committee have been unable to present a report on this reference that reflects a consensus with the government members. That having been said, I wish to stress that the non-government members of the committee have avoided any suggestion of making a party political or partisan statement in our report. Our report marks the end of a rigorous process of research and hearings in which an impressive list of widely regarded experts put their views to us. Our reflections on their submissions and the recommendations that flow from our findings are intended to be a blueprint for governments into the future to facilitate decent processes and defensible legislation dealing with indigenous rights. They are recommendations that stand independent of the political persuasion of the government of the day.
Reactions to the Mabo decision in 1992 continue to shape relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians today. What could have been the dawn of an era of reconciliation and better understanding in fact ushered in a period of politically driven division and discord. Conservative politicians and certain interest groups set out with a clear intention to misrepresent the decision, to deny its validity and to attack the High Court itself. Drafted as it was in this poisonous climate of debate with only one piece of case law and no statutory precedent, the Native Title Act 1993 was a worthy first step in dealing with what was for Australia the legal and social novelty of native title. This act was bound to be imperfect. Later court decisions and practical experience were always going to bring forward the need for amendment. But it was a worthy start to a long and complex process. The government of the day engaged all stakeholders in real negotiations. The final product did not deliver, nor did the government set out to deliver, victory to any one interest group and its particular wish list.
Vital to Australia's international reputation and to the legal sustainability of the act, the compromises needed to take this first legislative step were made with the informed consent of those negotiating on behalf of indigenous interests. The act was passed in the face of the totally negative opposition of the coalition parties, who at that time rejected both the validity of the act and the concept of native title itself. In government, they set out to dismantle the Native Title Act. Using the pretext of the Wik decision, they set out with a predetermined agenda to wind back the rights won by indigenous Australians in the Mabo decision and protected in the Native Title Act 1993.
What brings us here today is that the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found that both the process by which the Howard government amended the act and the amendments they implemented are inconsistent with our international undertakings as signatories to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Let the report of the non-government members be a circuit-breaker in what has become a divisive process that has brought us social discord and international shame as a nation. There will always be a temptation for governments or governments in waiting to put forward quick and easily understood solutions to problems of the day. When the problem is as legally complex as native title, as potentially divisive and as central to our sense of national decency as this issue is, then the Australian people deserve better than quick fixes and populist hyperbole. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my comments in Hansard as I wish to leave the remaining five minutes of this debate to my colleague Senator Crossin. 
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
We have many issues to resolve in our journey towards lasting accord between indigenous and non indigenous Australians. Native Title is one—but only one—such important issue. If the government of the day persists with processes and statutory provisions that are neither legally sustainable nor socially acceptable we will be forever caught up in repeated cycles of Native Title debate. The debate will not move on. Our community will not move on. Indigenous and Non Indigenous Australians deserve better.
This Report has uncovered substantial, authoritative and widely expressed criticism of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998. The government can proceed on its chosen course of attacking its critics and deriding their motives, or it can take a serious look at what this Report has to offer. The satisfactory progress of this matter, and our capacity to move on to other matters in a cooperative spirit, hangs precariously in the balance. This issue cannot be dealt with in isolation from the wider national desire for reconciliation. Nor can it be dealt with in isolation from our need to protect indigenous heritage and languages or improve indigenous health outcomes.
The principles are indivisible. We must proceed in a non-discriminatory way. We must reject the paternalism and, indeed, malice that has characterised the relations between governments and indigenous Australians in the past. This government has failed the nation in its desire for reconciliation. It need not fail again. It still has the chance to take up its responsibility to facilitate the decent and non-discriminatory absorption of the concept of native title into our statutes, our legal institutions and the wider society.
In casting off its defensive attitude, and engaging expert international bodies such as the CERD committee, and in negotiating with indigenous Australians, this government can still fulfil its sworn commitment to govern for all Australians. I commend the Non Government Members Report on CERD and the NTAA 1998 to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title>,Committees,24,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I rise to continue to represent the views of non-government members in our contribution to this report. I place it on the record that, in 1998, CERD, which is composed of a body of international law experts, decided that the amendments to the Native Title Act might not be compatible with Australia's obligations under the CERD. The CERD places an obligation on Australia to ensure racial equality or, conversely stated, to prohibit racial discrimination in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights. The prohibition on racial discrimination—the obligation to ensure racial equality—is enshrined in the CERD and is a fundamental principle of international law.
The original Native Title Act sought to provide a form of protection to native title that would take into account the unique nature of indigenous traditional title and its central importance in maintaining distinct cultural identity. Of critical significance to CERD was that the provisions of the Native Title Act were implemented with the agreement of indigenous representatives, led by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. In 1994, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found that the original Native Title Act was consistent with Australia's obligations under the CERD, despite the fact that the original act contained some provisions that were adverse to indigenous interests. This was primarily because the original Native Title Act was enacted with the consent of indigenous representatives.
One of the justifications advanced by the Commonwealth government for the amendments to the Native Title Act in 1998 was that the act was `unworkable'. The dissenting report shows how the government have approached their obligations under the act with a view to deliberately creating a situation where the legislation is unworkable. The amendments to the Native Title Act were mainly discriminatory amendments in that they specifically targeted native title for the extinguishment of suspension for the benefit of non-indigenous title holders and governments. 
The CERD committee identified four sets of provisions in the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 that discriminated against indigenous people, and these provisions were: the amendments to the right to negotiate; provisions which purported to confirm the extinguishment of native title; provisions which allowed for primary production upgrades, essentially allowing for the expansion of the rights of those with grazing leases at the expense of native title holders; and provisions for the validation of acts done by government in breach of the Native Title Act and the Racial Discrimination Act.
In addition, our dissenting report identifies other provisions in the amended Native Title Act which have an adverse impact on the rights of native title holders. A matter of particular concern to the CERD committee was that, while the original act constituted an agreement between the Commonwealth government and indigenous representatives, the largely discriminatory amendments to the Native Title Act in 1998 were imposed on indigenous people. The dissenting report shows clearly that not only did the Commonwealth government fail to secure the consent of—as opposed to negotiate or consult with—the indigenous community regarding the amendments; it never genuinely attempted to negotiate with indigenous people. One matter identified by the CERD committee is that, under international law, it is important that indigenous people are able to effectively participate in making decisions which affect their rights and that they give their informed consent to these decisions. The requirement of effective participation and informed consent has also been identified in the dissenting report as being of critical importance in framing legislation or amendments to legislation which affects the rights of indigenous people.
The dissenting report makes 10 recommendations arising from the consideration of issues in this inquiry. The first recommendation is that the CERD committee is an expert and independent body that is competent to receive and consider complaints, despite the fact that the government in this inquiry continually undermined the members of the committee and the role the committee plays. Another important point is that individuals and groups in Australia had, and still have, the right to bring to the attention of the CERD committee alleged violations of Australia's undertakings. There is a recommendation from non-government members that the evidence presented to the committee clearly shows the Native Title Act, as amended in 1998, does conflict with Australia's international obligations.
We found that the government should amend the Native Title Act through a process of negotiation with indigenous people, with the aim of gaining their informed consent to any such amendments. We recommend that the government, in amending the Native Title Act, implement uniform, decent and enforceable national standards for dealing with native title. We also found that the native title legislation is only one early element of a range of instruments to be drafted over time, and it should be seen as part of the process for a lasting settlement and accord between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.
Finally, we would recommend that the government, consistent with its obligations, protect Australia's international reputation, desist from any further attacks on United Nations expert bodies and renew positive dialogue with them. On behalf of the Labor Party committee members in the Senate, Senator McLucas and me, I would like to place on the record our utmost thanks to the secretariat for the role they played in this inquiry. I thank Peter Grundy and Richard Selth, who were both secretaries during this time. More particularly, I want to emphasise the terrific work of both Anne Desoyza and Suzanne Wood in providing us with the research and the draft reports. I also thank the other executive and research assistants in the committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title>,Committees,24,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-06-28,"—I want to speak to the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund's report on the consistency of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 with Australia's international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is an absolutely critical report in the ongoing debate about native title in this country. It is critical from the point of view that it is very clearly divided into two sections. There is a completely divided opinion in this country about native title. While I reject almost all of the government's section of the report, it is nevertheless important that the government put down its view of its position in this debate. 
I am going to concentrate on the report of the non-government members and senators because it is the part of the report that I give enthusiastic assent to. I do recognise that both parts of the report need to be read carefully by people in this country if they are to understand the extent of the debate and the division which we have. I want to add my congratulations to the secretariat. They did an absolutely fabulous job in representing very effectively and fairly both sides of this debate. I also want to congratulate the chair of the committee. While I disagree with the part of the report that she signed off on and while I probably do not accept much of the speech she gave, I want to say that with one of the very controversial issues that is part of the ongoing debate in this country she did a very good job in enabling both sides of the debate to be put fairly, and she should be congratulated for that.
I see my colleague Senator Harradine here. We also ought to recognise that in this debate he played and plays a critical part. While I did not agree with all of the amendments made by Senator Harradine and the government to the original Native Title Act in the 1998 amendment act, without the one amendment that Senator Harradine moved, this debate probably would have been cut off in its infancy. It was the amendment moved by Senator Harradine that gave the federal parliament ongoing scrutiny of proposed state regimes, which has enabled this debate to continue. So, Senator Harradine, you did an invaluable job in making sure that amendment was part of the 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act.
—It was the longest debate in federal parliamentary history.
—It certainly was, and it continues. I return to the report of the non-government members and senators. I want to read some of the report to the Senate just to give the flavour of the nature of this report and of the debate that continues. Towards the end of the non-government senators and members report is a chapter headed `Is the CERD committee's decision sustainable?' I want to read the conclusion:
7.39	On an analysis in the context of the applicable international law the conclusion can be drawn that the findings of the CERD Committee which are relevant to the first term of reference are sustainable. Specifically, the amended NTA as a whole is incompatible with Australia's international legal obligations arising under the CERD, and international law generally. This incompatibility arises primarily as a result of the process that was followed in implementing the amendments to the NTA, without the informed consent of Indigenous people whose rights and interests are affected by the operation of the NTA.
That whole issue of informed consent is one of the issues under debate. But I am satisfied that, while in the 1993 debate there were some indigenous people who were not happy, at the end of the day they all signed off on that particular act.
The chair of our committee has put to the Senate that the government fulfilled all of its obligations. The problem is, however, that, under international law—and particularly in this area—the whole issue of informed consent is absolutely crucial. We cannot put the proposal that indigenous people have not been discriminated against unless their informed consent has been obtained. I am satisfied that, in the 1998 negotiations over the amendments, although native title representatives were informed, we certainly could not say that their informed consent was obtained. Another issue raised by the chair of our committee was whether or not the act can be amended. I want to address that by reading part of the chapter entitled `Amending the Native Title Act' in the non-government members and senators report:
8.1	The second term of reference for this inquiry requires this Committee to consider: 
what amendments are required to the Act, and what processes of consultation must be followed in effecting those amendments, to ensure that Australia's international obligations are complied with.
Australia has long been a leading member of the international community, but this particular report is evidence of the stain the government has placed on our international reputation. I say that very carefully.  
However, this report is not only about taking note of our international obligations but also about the evidence of leading lawyers, academics and churches in this country. Their evidence was overwhelming in support of the CERD committee's findings and against the proposition put by the government that they had fulfilled all they were required to do under those international obligations. So it is not simply that we are taking account of those people outside of this country whose opinion we can ignore; the evidence was overwhelming from our own people. The opinion of the majority of lawyers, academics and churches was that the CERD committee is correct and the government is wrong. I believe that a majority of Australians are of the same opinion as the CERD committee that the 1998 amendments, known as the Prime Minister's 10-point plan, are racially discriminatory and invalid.
I want to turn now very quickly to the issue of state regimes, because it is quite clear that any state regime that is based on section 43A of the amended Native Title Act is invalid. This report clearly shows that basing a state regime on that 1998 act calls that state regime into question. The report states in paragraph 8.24:
... it is open to the Commonwealth Government to take a policy decision not to approve any alternative State or Territory future act regimes. These alternative regimes, as described in Chapter 6, would, if approved by the Commonwealth Attorney-General, allow State and Territory Governments to replace the RTN with lesser procedural rights. Given the CERD Committee's concerns about the changes to the right to negotiate, it has been suggested that there should be no further determinations made under these provisions pending the outcome of negotiations with Indigenous people.
And with that I agree. The final comment of the report is worth recording:
9.24	No doubt, as discussed above, dialogue with the CERD Committee would assist with Australia's understanding of its international legal obligations. However, as discussed in Chapter 8 and noted in the submission by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner: 
The first priority ... is to establish a better informed basis for amendment through consultation and negotiation with Indigenous people.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title>,Committees,24,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-06-28,"—I am not sure what time—
 (Senator Knowles)—Senator Harradine, the time has actually expired. If you would like to make a contribution, you may seek leave of the Senate to do so.
—I seek leave to make a very short statement. 
Leave granted. 
—In due course, I will give a response to some of the points made in this report, particularly those made in the non-government section of the report. But I wish that senators would put themselves in the situation of that particular time. We were faced with the real likelihood of a race based double dissolution election at a time when, if you remember, the One Nation Party had ascendancy. In the election subsequent to the decisions in respect of the native title amendments, it had received 20 per cent of the vote in Queensland and obtained 11 seats. Multiply that throughout Australia—probably you could not multiply that one for one throughout Australia—and you can see what the outcome could have been. It was absolutely essential that I did what I did and did it on behalf of all Australian people, not least the indigenous people. This piece of legislation related to that matter.
The Queensland Labor Party is operating under those amendments to bring forward an alternative right to negotiate scheme. That is currently before the parliament as a disallowable instrument. No doubt that discussion will take place in August. I wish to emphasise that the then chairman of ATSIC indicated to me that this was the best I could do. Of course, you could take that various ways, but I think that was a genuine expression of at least some sort of an appreciation of the fact that the thing was pulled out of the fire at that time. It was, after all, the longest debate since Federation in this parliament. I want at some stage to make further comments on this matter. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2000-06-28,"—I present the 16th report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund entitled CERD and the Native Title Amendment Act 1998, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings, tabled documents and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This inquiry resulted from a Senate reference on 9 December 1999 which required the committee to consider whether the amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 were consistent with Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Native Title Act 1993 was amended in 1998 by the Native Title Amendment Act 1998. These amendments were necessary to deal with a range of practical issues that affected the operation of the Native Title Act and the Native Title Tribunal. In particular, the decision of the High Court in Wik highlighted the need for amendments to deal with the practical implications of this decision for the possible coexistence of native title on pastoral leases.
The original Native Title Act was, of course, drafted on the reasonable expectation that the grant of a pastoral lease did in fact extinguish native title. The then Prime Minister and a number of his other ministers in the previous government expressed this view during debates on the original Native Title Bill. The Wik decision changed the view that the grant of a pastoral lease did not necessarily extinguish native title and the rights of pastoralists and native title holders may coexist. This raised a great deal of uncertainty for many people, including miners and pastoralists who had received grants from governments in good faith on the basis of their legitimate understanding of when and how native title was extinguished.
The Native Title Act was amended after an extensive period of consultation with the major stakeholders: indigenous groups, pastoralists, miners and others. The committee held two inquiries into the amendment bills and reported on these inquiries in three reports. As well, the native title amendment bills were debated for over 100 hours in this parliament, a record for any legislation in the history of the Commonwealth parliament. As this report argues, amending the Native Title Act made it a very difficult task for the government to balance the competing interests of all key stakeholders who were potentially affected by native title. 
As this report concludes, the government was entitled at international law to balance these competing rights and interests, when amending the Native Title Act. The amended act achieves a successful balance between competing interests in a way that is fair and reasonable in all of the circumstances. This balance respects the unique rights of indigenous people and their connection to their land, while at the same time providing certainty and workability for all other people. A wide range of measures in the amended act recognise and protect native title, address the special features of native title and, very importantly, address prior extinguishment of native title. In particular, sections 47A and 47B of the amended Native Title Act allow for the prior extinguishment of native title to be disregarded in certain circumstances where indigenous people are occupying the land. One of the substantial amendments to the act was the introduction of the indigenous land use agreement—ILUA—provisions. These provisions have greatly improved the capacity for reaching binding agreements under the amended act and are increasingly being used to resolve claims. The amendments to the act also introduced a new registration test, which was necessary to ensure that only bona fide claimants are able to have their claims registered and therefore gain access to valuable rights such as the right to negotiate and the ILUA provisions.
Australia ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 1975. The Racial Discrimination Act was enacted in the same year to implement Australia's obligations under that convention. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was established under the convention to monitor the compliance of states' parties with their obligations under the convention. In March 1999, the CERD issued its decision on the Native Title Act, in which it expressed concern about the compatibility of the act with Australia's obligations under the convention. As part of its inquiry, CERD heard from a high level Australian delegation led by Mr Robert Orr, the Deputy General Counsel with the Australian Government Solicitor's Office. Curiously, the CERD decision did not refer anywhere to the submissions that were put by the Australian delegation; nor did the CERD decision appear to consider the many beneficial aspects of the Native Title Act, which I have already discussed. 
In particular, CERD asserted that the amendments to the Native Title Act had been enacted without the informed consent of indigenous people. There is, however, no requirement for informed consent at international law. Under Article 5(c) of the convention, Australia is simply required to ensure the effective participation of indigenous people in public affairs. In fact, the government consulted widely, especially with indigenous people, about amending the Native Title Act. As this report notes, there were extensive discussions and negotiations among representatives of indigenous groups, including the National Indigenous Working Group and ATSIC, non-government parties and the Independent senators, particularly in relation to amendments to the act. Indigenous people had a wide range of opportunities to have their views on the proposed amendments to the act considered. As well as the parliamentary inquiries, the Prime Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and senior departmental officers also met with indigenous representatives to discuss the amendments.
So the views of indigenous people were clearly taken into account. Many of the proposals that formed the basis of negotiations with the government, and which were accepted in some form, had their genesis in proposals from indigenous representatives themselves. For instance, the indigenous land use agreement provisions are largely based on a model originally proposed by the National Indigenous Working Group. Australia's obligation under the convention and at international law generally is to prohibit racial discrimination or to ensure that racial equality exists. This is of fundamental importance. The amended Native Title Act is not inconsistent with this obligation. As discussed previously, and as this report highlights, the amended act contains a large number of measures that ensure the protection of native title, take the special nature of native title into account and, in some cases, allow for the restitution of native title where it has already been extinguished. 
In reaching its decisions on Australia's native title legislation, CERD also failed to take into account any of these countervailing beneficial measures. Furthermore, the CERD decision considers individual amendments to the Native Title Act in isolation, rather than taking the more proper approach, which is to consider the amended act as a whole. The CERD decision appears to show some misunderstanding of the operation of Australia's parliamentary democracy by suggesting that the 1998 amendments be `suspended' when this is surely simply not possible to do. It surprised me that CERD did not make itself aware of whether this could be carried out. This parliamentary joint committee on native title is also concerned that CERD was suggesting that all of the 1998 amendments be suspended. This would presumably include the large number of necessary and beneficial amendments that were made to the act—again, a puzzling decision by CERD. This would therefore include the amendments that deal with the operations of the National Native Title Tribunal and the Federal Court, as well as the critical indigenous land use agreement provisions which are now so popular around the country. As the committee notes in this report, it would consider such action a fundamentally retrograde step, which would create at the very least further uncertainty for indigenous and non-indigenous people. A non-government members report would have exactly the same disastrous results. This report, having analysed CERD's decision and the evidence received in the course of this inquiry, concludes, quite properly, that the Native Title Act is consistent with Australia's obligations under the convention to prohibit racial discrimination. I therefore commend the committee's 16th report to the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,24,2,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2000-06-28,"—This report—framed, written and tabled here in accordance with the statutory responsibilities of this committee—marks a significant step forward in our understanding of native title and indigenous rights. I refer to the non-government members' report. The terms of reference for the joint parliamentary committee required us to evaluate the finding of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 contained provisions and was developed in a manner inconsistent with Australia's international legal obligations. The government vehemently rejected CERD's findings. It went to great lengths to discredit the committee and its work, and we have heard more of that today. They made blustering threats to withdraw from UN treaty bodies.
It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that the non-government members of the joint parliamentary committee have been unable to present a report on this reference that reflects a consensus with the government members. That having been said, I wish to stress that the non-government members of the committee have avoided any suggestion of making a party political or partisan statement in our report. Our report marks the end of a rigorous process of research and hearings in which an impressive list of widely regarded experts put their views to us. Our reflections on their submissions and the recommendations that flow from our findings are intended to be a blueprint for governments into the future to facilitate decent processes and defensible legislation dealing with indigenous rights. They are recommendations that stand independent of the political persuasion of the government of the day.
Reactions to the Mabo decision in 1992 continue to shape relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians today. What could have been the dawn of an era of reconciliation and better understanding in fact ushered in a period of politically driven division and discord. Conservative politicians and certain interest groups set out with a clear intention to misrepresent the decision, to deny its validity and to attack the High Court itself. Drafted as it was in this poisonous climate of debate with only one piece of case law and no statutory precedent, the Native Title Act 1993 was a worthy first step in dealing with what was for Australia the legal and social novelty of native title. This act was bound to be imperfect. Later court decisions and practical experience were always going to bring forward the need for amendment. But it was a worthy start to a long and complex process. The government of the day engaged all stakeholders in real negotiations. The final product did not deliver, nor did the government set out to deliver, victory to any one interest group and its particular wish list.
Vital to Australia's international reputation and to the legal sustainability of the act, the compromises needed to take this first legislative step were made with the informed consent of those negotiating on behalf of indigenous interests. The act was passed in the face of the totally negative opposition of the coalition parties, who at that time rejected both the validity of the act and the concept of native title itself. In government, they set out to dismantle the Native Title Act. Using the pretext of the Wik decision, they set out with a predetermined agenda to wind back the rights won by indigenous Australians in the Mabo decision and protected in the Native Title Act 1993.
What brings us here today is that the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found that both the process by which the Howard government amended the act and the amendments they implemented are inconsistent with our international undertakings as signatories to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Let the report of the non-government members be a circuit-breaker in what has become a divisive process that has brought us social discord and international shame as a nation. There will always be a temptation for governments or governments in waiting to put forward quick and easily understood solutions to problems of the day. When the problem is as legally complex as native title, as potentially divisive and as central to our sense of national decency as this issue is, then the Australian people deserve better than quick fixes and populist hyperbole. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my comments in Hansard as I wish to leave the remaining five minutes of this debate to my colleague Senator Crossin. 
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
We have many issues to resolve in our journey towards lasting accord between indigenous and non indigenous Australians. Native Title is one—but only one—such important issue. If the government of the day persists with processes and statutory provisions that are neither legally sustainable nor socially acceptable we will be forever caught up in repeated cycles of Native Title debate. The debate will not move on. Our community will not move on. Indigenous and Non Indigenous Australians deserve better.
This Report has uncovered substantial, authoritative and widely expressed criticism of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998. The government can proceed on its chosen course of attacking its critics and deriding their motives, or it can take a serious look at what this Report has to offer. The satisfactory progress of this matter, and our capacity to move on to other matters in a cooperative spirit, hangs precariously in the balance. This issue cannot be dealt with in isolation from the wider national desire for reconciliation. Nor can it be dealt with in isolation from our need to protect indigenous heritage and languages or improve indigenous health outcomes.
The principles are indivisible. We must proceed in a non-discriminatory way. We must reject the paternalism and, indeed, malice that has characterised the relations between governments and indigenous Australians in the past. This government has failed the nation in its desire for reconciliation. It need not fail again. It still has the chance to take up its responsibility to facilitate the decent and non-discriminatory absorption of the concept of native title into our statutes, our legal institutions and the wider society.
In casting off its defensive attitude, and engaging expert international bodies such as the CERD committee, and in negotiating with indigenous Australians, this government can still fulfil its sworn commitment to govern for all Australians. I commend the Non Government Members Report on CERD and the NTAA 1998 to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,24,2,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I rise to continue to represent the views of non-government members in our contribution to this report. I place it on the record that, in 1998, CERD, which is composed of a body of international law experts, decided that the amendments to the Native Title Act might not be compatible with Australia's obligations under the CERD. The CERD places an obligation on Australia to ensure racial equality or, conversely stated, to prohibit racial discrimination in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights. The prohibition on racial discrimination—the obligation to ensure racial equality—is enshrined in the CERD and is a fundamental principle of international law.
The original Native Title Act sought to provide a form of protection to native title that would take into account the unique nature of indigenous traditional title and its central importance in maintaining distinct cultural identity. Of critical significance to CERD was that the provisions of the Native Title Act were implemented with the agreement of indigenous representatives, led by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. In 1994, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found that the original Native Title Act was consistent with Australia's obligations under the CERD, despite the fact that the original act contained some provisions that were adverse to indigenous interests. This was primarily because the original Native Title Act was enacted with the consent of indigenous representatives.
One of the justifications advanced by the Commonwealth government for the amendments to the Native Title Act in 1998 was that the act was `unworkable'. The dissenting report shows how the government have approached their obligations under the act with a view to deliberately creating a situation where the legislation is unworkable. The amendments to the Native Title Act were mainly discriminatory amendments in that they specifically targeted native title for the extinguishment of suspension for the benefit of non-indigenous title holders and governments. 
The CERD committee identified four sets of provisions in the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 that discriminated against indigenous people, and these provisions were: the amendments to the right to negotiate; provisions which purported to confirm the extinguishment of native title; provisions which allowed for primary production upgrades, essentially allowing for the expansion of the rights of those with grazing leases at the expense of native title holders; and provisions for the validation of acts done by government in breach of the Native Title Act and the Racial Discrimination Act.
In addition, our dissenting report identifies other provisions in the amended Native Title Act which have an adverse impact on the rights of native title holders. A matter of particular concern to the CERD committee was that, while the original act constituted an agreement between the Commonwealth government and indigenous representatives, the largely discriminatory amendments to the Native Title Act in 1998 were imposed on indigenous people. The dissenting report shows clearly that not only did the Commonwealth government fail to secure the consent of—as opposed to negotiate or consult with—the indigenous community regarding the amendments; it never genuinely attempted to negotiate with indigenous people. One matter identified by the CERD committee is that, under international law, it is important that indigenous people are able to effectively participate in making decisions which affect their rights and that they give their informed consent to these decisions. The requirement of effective participation and informed consent has also been identified in the dissenting report as being of critical importance in framing legislation or amendments to legislation which affects the rights of indigenous people.
The dissenting report makes 10 recommendations arising from the consideration of issues in this inquiry. The first recommendation is that the CERD committee is an expert and independent body that is competent to receive and consider complaints, despite the fact that the government in this inquiry continually undermined the members of the committee and the role the committee plays. Another important point is that individuals and groups in Australia had, and still have, the right to bring to the attention of the CERD committee alleged violations of Australia's undertakings. There is a recommendation from non-government members that the evidence presented to the committee clearly shows the Native Title Act, as amended in 1998, does conflict with Australia's international obligations.
We found that the government should amend the Native Title Act through a process of negotiation with indigenous people, with the aim of gaining their informed consent to any such amendments. We recommend that the government, in amending the Native Title Act, implement uniform, decent and enforceable national standards for dealing with native title. We also found that the native title legislation is only one early element of a range of instruments to be drafted over time, and it should be seen as part of the process for a lasting settlement and accord between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.
Finally, we would recommend that the government, consistent with its obligations, protect Australia's international reputation, desist from any further attacks on United Nations expert bodies and renew positive dialogue with them. On behalf of the Labor Party committee members in the Senate, Senator McLucas and me, I would like to place on the record our utmost thanks to the secretariat for the role they played in this inquiry. I thank Peter Grundy and Richard Selth, who were both secretaries during this time. More particularly, I want to emphasise the terrific work of both Anne Desoyza and Suzanne Wood in providing us with the research and the draft reports. I also thank the other executive and research assistants in the committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,24,2,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-06-28,"—I want to speak to the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund's report on the consistency of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 with Australia's international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is an absolutely critical report in the ongoing debate about native title in this country. It is critical from the point of view that it is very clearly divided into two sections. There is a completely divided opinion in this country about native title. While I reject almost all of the government's section of the report, it is nevertheless important that the government put down its view of its position in this debate. 
I am going to concentrate on the report of the non-government members and senators because it is the part of the report that I give enthusiastic assent to. I do recognise that both parts of the report need to be read carefully by people in this country if they are to understand the extent of the debate and the division which we have. I want to add my congratulations to the secretariat. They did an absolutely fabulous job in representing very effectively and fairly both sides of this debate. I also want to congratulate the chair of the committee. While I disagree with the part of the report that she signed off on and while I probably do not accept much of the speech she gave, I want to say that with one of the very controversial issues that is part of the ongoing debate in this country she did a very good job in enabling both sides of the debate to be put fairly, and she should be congratulated for that.
I see my colleague Senator Harradine here. We also ought to recognise that in this debate he played and plays a critical part. While I did not agree with all of the amendments made by Senator Harradine and the government to the original Native Title Act in the 1998 amendment act, without the one amendment that Senator Harradine moved, this debate probably would have been cut off in its infancy. It was the amendment moved by Senator Harradine that gave the federal parliament ongoing scrutiny of proposed state regimes, which has enabled this debate to continue. So, Senator Harradine, you did an invaluable job in making sure that amendment was part of the 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act.
—It was the longest debate in federal parliamentary history.
—It certainly was, and it continues. I return to the report of the non-government members and senators. I want to read some of the report to the Senate just to give the flavour of the nature of this report and of the debate that continues. Towards the end of the non-government senators and members report is a chapter headed `Is the CERD committee's decision sustainable?' I want to read the conclusion:
7.39	On an analysis in the context of the applicable international law the conclusion can be drawn that the findings of the CERD Committee which are relevant to the first term of reference are sustainable. Specifically, the amended NTA as a whole is incompatible with Australia's international legal obligations arising under the CERD, and international law generally. This incompatibility arises primarily as a result of the process that was followed in implementing the amendments to the NTA, without the informed consent of Indigenous people whose rights and interests are affected by the operation of the NTA.
That whole issue of informed consent is one of the issues under debate. But I am satisfied that, while in the 1993 debate there were some indigenous people who were not happy, at the end of the day they all signed off on that particular act.
The chair of our committee has put to the Senate that the government fulfilled all of its obligations. The problem is, however, that, under international law—and particularly in this area—the whole issue of informed consent is absolutely crucial. We cannot put the proposal that indigenous people have not been discriminated against unless their informed consent has been obtained. I am satisfied that, in the 1998 negotiations over the amendments, although native title representatives were informed, we certainly could not say that their informed consent was obtained. Another issue raised by the chair of our committee was whether or not the act can be amended. I want to address that by reading part of the chapter entitled `Amending the Native Title Act' in the non-government members and senators report:
8.1	The second term of reference for this inquiry requires this Committee to consider: 
what amendments are required to the Act, and what processes of consultation must be followed in effecting those amendments, to ensure that Australia's international obligations are complied with.
Australia has long been a leading member of the international community, but this particular report is evidence of the stain the government has placed on our international reputation. I say that very carefully.  
However, this report is not only about taking note of our international obligations but also about the evidence of leading lawyers, academics and churches in this country. Their evidence was overwhelming in support of the CERD committee's findings and against the proposition put by the government that they had fulfilled all they were required to do under those international obligations. So it is not simply that we are taking account of those people outside of this country whose opinion we can ignore; the evidence was overwhelming from our own people. The opinion of the majority of lawyers, academics and churches was that the CERD committee is correct and the government is wrong. I believe that a majority of Australians are of the same opinion as the CERD committee that the 1998 amendments, known as the Prime Minister's 10-point plan, are racially discriminatory and invalid.
I want to turn now very quickly to the issue of state regimes, because it is quite clear that any state regime that is based on section 43A of the amended Native Title Act is invalid. This report clearly shows that basing a state regime on that 1998 act calls that state regime into question. The report states in paragraph 8.24:
... it is open to the Commonwealth Government to take a policy decision not to approve any alternative State or Territory future act regimes. These alternative regimes, as described in Chapter 6, would, if approved by the Commonwealth Attorney-General, allow State and Territory Governments to replace the RTN with lesser procedural rights. Given the CERD Committee's concerns about the changes to the right to negotiate, it has been suggested that there should be no further determinations made under these provisions pending the outcome of negotiations with Indigenous people.
And with that I agree. The final comment of the report is worth recording:
9.24	No doubt, as discussed above, dialogue with the CERD Committee would assist with Australia's understanding of its international legal obligations. However, as discussed in Chapter 8 and noted in the submission by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner: 
The first priority ... is to establish a better informed basis for amendment through consultation and negotiation with Indigenous people.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,24,2,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-06-28,"—I am not sure what time—
 (Senator Knowles)—Senator Harradine, the time has actually expired. If you would like to make a contribution, you may seek leave of the Senate to do so.
—I seek leave to make a very short statement. 
Leave granted. 
—In due course, I will give a response to some of the points made in this report, particularly those made in the non-government section of the report. But I wish that senators would put themselves in the situation of that particular time. We were faced with the real likelihood of a race based double dissolution election at a time when, if you remember, the One Nation Party had ascendancy. In the election subsequent to the decisions in respect of the native title amendments, it had received 20 per cent of the vote in Queensland and obtained 11 seats. Multiply that throughout Australia—probably you could not multiply that one for one throughout Australia—and you can see what the outcome could have been. It was absolutely essential that I did what I did and did it on behalf of all Australian people, not least the indigenous people. This piece of legislation related to that matter.
The Queensland Labor Party is operating under those amendments to bring forward an alternative right to negotiate scheme. That is currently before the parliament as a disallowable instrument. No doubt that discussion will take place in August. I wish to emphasise that the then chairman of ATSIC indicated to me that this was the best I could do. Of course, you could take that various ways, but I think that was a genuine expression of at least some sort of an appreciation of the fact that the thing was pulled out of the fire at that time. It was, after all, the longest debate since Federation in this parliament. I want at some stage to make further comments on this matter. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-28,"—Madam Chair, does the message deal with my amendments to the Social Security Act relating to portability or the veterans' disability pension?
—It is the veterans' one, I understand, Senator Schacht.
—I have to say that the opposition is disappointed that the government has missed the opportunity to have further discussion about reaching an agreement on the issue of removing the anomaly, which everyone agrees is there, that the disability pension no longer be counted for income test purposes for social security benefits. I am disappointed that the government would not assist even technically to overcome the difficulties of drafting an amendment. The government pointed out to Senator Bartlett on two different occasions that his amendments apparently created other anom-alies or would not do what he expected his amendments would do. 
When I discussed with the clerks of the Senate—who always offer their fullest possible assistance—the possibility of having their assistance in drafting an amendment that would carry out what I wanted to do on behalf of the opposition, they had to say that there was no way they could draft an amendment for the opposition without being able to consult with the technical experts in the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. If, without having been able to consult with those experts, they were to put out an amendment, the minister then would get up and say, `You've made another mistake.' I have to say, Minister, I think it is unfortunate that you have said no to the suggestion not only of an amendment but also of the officers being made available to assist us in at least getting such an amendment technically right. You could have agreed to both suggestions and then, if you had still wanted to, voted against the amendment. That would have been fine. This lack of cooperation on that matter is disappointing. In sorting out issues which are to the benefit of veterans, such as this one is, I have always attempted to take a broader bipartisan position.
Minister, you gave an indication that the next time the government would consider this it would be in the budget context. That is 11 months away. I believe that those in the veterans community are getting a little more restless at the thought of having to wait 11 months more. This morning I attended the Victorian RSL state conference, as did the minister, where the issue of this disability pension was raised informally. The minister made a comment about it. I also made a comment about it, saying that we as an opposition would still try on this. But, with this message having come back, it is clear that the government is not going to budge on it. I had a discussion with a number of people from the RSL there today and I indicated that reluctantly, if that were the case, we would not insist on our amendment being carried.
But I want to give fair warning: I have now sought the assistance of the RSL. I have asked the RSL to use its resources in cooperation with the opposition to draft an appropriate amendment. With the next bill that comes to this place in the spring session, whether social security and/or veterans entitlement, we again will be putting forward this amendment to achieve the removal of this discrimination, this anomaly that has been there for a long time. I agree with the minister: when my party was in government we did not fix the anomaly. On a lot of these issues, I have always acknowledged that the governments of the day have not responded to what the veterans have wanted. I also have to say, Minister, that it was made clear to me today in private conversation that the removal of this anomaly is of pretty high priority in the veterans community. I do not blame them for that. I think the sooner we get this fixed, the better. Therefore, the opposition will not insist on that amendment. I say to Senator Bartlett and his staff: thank you for your heroic efforts in trying to draft an amendment to achieve our purpose. But to be criticised by the government for not getting it right I think is a bit rich when it has all the expertise and would not give us any advice on the matter.
From the conversations I had with Senator Bartlett yesterday, I think he realises that there is still a difficulty. Senator Bartlett, I do not like, so to speak, leaving you in the lurch with your amendment because I agree with the principle that you are going for. But I have to say that maybe it is best for both of us to work together and have another go at this in the spring session. Then if we do not support this bill, perhaps we will not be held to ransom in this place by other entitlements to veterans being delayed unnecessarily for a couple of months. Governments on both sides of politics always play this card: you produce the joker from the pack to say, `Well, we won't accept your amendment and you'll be blamed when people miss out on benefits through your not agreeing to our original legislation.' You can play that bluff for a while, but in the end I believe that the veterans community will see that card for what it is—a blackmail card. They will see the government's playing of it as not being acceptable.
We will revisit this in the spring session. At that stage, Minister, I hope you and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs will be more cooperative in trying to seek a reasonable solution here to what the veterans community want.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-28,"—On behalf of the Democrats, I will not oppose this motion by the minister and I will not insist on our amendment. Certainly I share the disappointment of Senator Schacht and agree with the comments he has made.
Just to clarify it for the record and for those listening, this issue is specifically about what are compensation payments made to veterans which are treated as income by the Department of Social Security but not by the Department of Veterans' Affairs if veterans are receiving a payment through the veterans' affairs department. It is clearly an issue that is high on the priority list for veteran's organisations. Obviously it is not the only concern they have, but it is a significant one. There is no doubt about that.
I very much welcome the commitment of the opposition on this issue to continue to pursue it, as the Democrats will. I note the minister's comment that the government may consider it in next year's budget context. But I think those in the veterans community have been waiting a long time, and 11 months is too long a time to continue to wait for what is recognised by everybody as an unjustifiable anomaly—at least I trust that is still the government's position. Nonetheless, I do note the minister's comment that it will consider it in that context. I certainly hope the government considers it favourably, whether in that context or the next time that it is brought up again in this chamber. So, given the circumstances that there are other measures in this bill that need to be passed and that the government clearly is not going to be cooperative and is not going to recognise the legitimate concerns of the veterans community on this issue, the Democrats will not insist at this particular time.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-06-28,"—I thank senators for the contributions that they have just made. Perhaps I can just be very brief in reiterating a few points. I think all sides of parliament would acknowledge that Australian veterans do already have one of the most generous compensation schemes in the world, and no-one can dispute the level of care that we provide for our veterans. Successive governments, and this government too, have always looked at the priorities of the veterans organisations. Usually that would mean that we would wait until the national conferences and congresses of these organisations had been held so as to confirm their current list of priorities. Senator Schacht tells me that this is now an issue which is at the top of—
—It is one of the top issues.
—I am glad you amended that. I thought the other day you said it was the top issue.
—I did not say that it was the top issue; I said it was one of the top issues.
—I am sure you are right, and it has been one of the top issues for quite a long time. Their priorities, however, have not put that at the top until today. I do not know what their current list of priorities is. For instance, are they going to do anything about the situation that the previous government put them in in regard to war widows' entitlements going backwards and forwards? That is a most unfortunate history in that area. I am not trying to play politics with it, but I would have thought that that would have been one of the issues pretty high on their list, as well. We will have to wait and see what is the current list of priorities.
—Veterans' organisations can actually deal with more than one issue at a time—they can chew gum and march at the same time.
—I am sure Bruce Ruxton could do that even walking backwards, as well. Nevertheless, it is appropriate that the government of the day waits until it sees all the congresses that have met for the year and what is confirmed as their current list of priorities. That is reasonable for the government to do. Successive governments have done it, and we intend to do that too. I will reiterate for Senator Bartlett's benefit, although he is not in the chamber at moment, that this government is well aware of the issue that has been raised. It will be kept in mind for the next budget. It will be something that the government will look to redress as it comes to the top of the priority list—a list that reflects the concerns of the veterans' community. 
As to the drafting issue that the opposition spokesman referred to, I was opposition spokesman for veterans' affairs for some time when we were in opposition, and I cannot remember ever either getting help or seeking help from the government of the day to produce amendments for me. It is a novel concept. The opposition parties have the benefit of excellent support from the Clerks.
—I said that.
—Yes, and we have said that before. I hardly think that you need to have the assistance of the department to draft your amendments for you, Senator. I find it a novel idea; maybe it is something we should ponder.
—This is not a question of advice. You were talking about getting your amendments drafted, and I find that a novel concept. You have the ability in the Senate to get that from the Clerks, and very good Clerks they are too.
—I said that.
—Yes, we are both agreed on that.
—I think that we have more than canvassed these issues.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—I move government amendment No. 42 on sheet EK215:
(42)	Schedule 1, item 140, page 66 (lines 22 and 23), omit paragraph (a), substitute:
	(a)	introductory or closing segments, or both, spoken by a host, or an anchor presenter, who is visible on the screen; and
This amendment is aimed at amending the definition of `presenter based bulletin' and thereby allowing click-on single item news, financial market, business or weather bulletins which must not be presenter based to have an on-location journalist visible on the screen. Under subclause 16(3) of schedule 6 datacasters may provide bulletins of certain kinds provided they are only accessible from an on-screen menu and are not presenter based. Subclause 16(4) currently defines `presenter based' as including `one or more introductory segments spoken by a presenter who is visible on screen'. As currently drafted, the definition of `presenter based' could exclude footage of a reporter at the scene of the news story at the beginning or during a particular item. There is a significant risk that this would prevent a datacaster from obtaining reports from independent news outlets that feature on-scene reporters. The proposed amendment changes the definition of `presenter based'—`presenter based bulletin' means a bulletin that consists of or includes a combination of: 
	(a) introductory or closing segments, or both, spoken by a host, or an anchor presenter, who is visible on the screen; and
(b) video images, whether or not there is accompanying sound. 
The amendment narrows the definition of `presenter based', thereby allowing datacasters to make available a wider range of news and related material through on-screen menus.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I move government amendments (44) and (48):
(44)	Schedule 1, item 140, page 67 (after line 24), after clause 18, insert:
18A  Genre conditions do not apply to advertising or sponsorship material
		The conditions set out in clauses 14 and 16 do not prevent a datacasting licensee from transmitting advertising or sponsorship material.
 (48)	Schedule 1, item 140, page 70 (after line 10), after clause 23, insert:
23A  Audio content condition does not apply to advertising or sponsorship material
		The condition set out in clause 21 does not prevent a datacasting licensee from transmitting advertising or sponsorship material.
The purpose of these amendments is to clarify that the genre and audio content conditions do not apply to advertising and sponsorship material transmitted by datacasting licensees. The proposed amendments clarify the treatment of advertising and sponsorship material transmitted by datacasting licensees. Amendment (44) inserts a new clause 18A in proposed schedule 6 to make it clear that the conditions in clauses 14 and 16 do not prevent a datacasting licensee from transmitting advertising or sponsorship material. Such material would not, in any event, be a category A or category B television program but the provision is included to give greater certainty to potential datacasters. Amendment (48) inserts a new clause 23A in proposed schedule 6 to make it clear that the condition in clause 21 does not prevent a datacasting licensee from transmitting advertising or sponsorship material. The provision is included to give greater certainty to potential datacasters.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—I see that amendment (39) on sheet 1827 is exactly the same—or I think it is exactly the same—as opposition amendment (35). So if Senator Bishop would like us to move this together, I would be happy to do that. I move:
(39)	Schedule 1, item 140, page 69 (after line 9), after clause 21, insert:
21A Audio content condition does not apply to national broadcaster
The condition set out in clause 21 does not apply to a datacasting licensee if the licensee is a national broadcaster.
In terms of this amendment, I believe that the national broadcasters—I may have this wrong; I hope not—are able to broadcast radio on broadcasting but not on datacasting. I may have that the wrong way around, but we think they should be able to broadcast radio on both broadcasting and datacasting, and this would allow them to do that.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—I am advised that there is general agreement that our form of words is preferred, but I am seeking to locate our amendments. I understood that our amendments (13), (16) and (51) on sheet EK215 were the preferred form of words. In other words, we support the intent of the amendment, which is to allow the national broadcasters to broadcast their radio programs on their digital television spectrum. It is simply a matter of how you can best accomplish this. It is necessary to amend both provisions of schedule 4 relating to the National Conversion Scheme and the provisions in the Radiocommunications Act relating to use of digital television transmitters for transmitting radio services. So I assume, without having our amendments in front of me, that we go down to a greater level of detail in order to accomplish effectively what is obviously the intent of both the Labor and Democrat amendments.
 (Senator Hogg)—I can assist you with locating those government amendments, Minister. They are on page 3 of the running sheet, and they have already been agreed to. 
—Perhaps Senator Bourne can indicate—and I know this is a little difficult on the run—to what extent she believes her amendment goes beyond what we now ascertain has already been passed by the chamber. I have indicated what we think this is about—in other words, to provide the national broadcasters with the capacity to broadcast radio programs on their digital television spectrums. As I say, I think we all have the same intent. It is a matter of how you can most effectively achieve it.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—In respect of Senator Bourne's comment that the opposition and the Democrats are co-sponsoring the amendment, that is correct.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—There may be some confusion as to what the Democrat amendment is. That may be because I have some advice here that does not accurately reflect it. I wonder whether Senator Bourne can tell us what is contained in her Democrat amendment No. 39.
—It is exactly the same as Senator Bishop's amendment.
—Maybe Senator Bishop can tell us what is in his.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-06-28,"—Thanks very much, Mr Temporary Chairman. I think we have passed those amendments that the minister thinks we have. 
—Yes, that is quite correct, Senator Bourne. We did pass those. 
—I have gone back to have a look at the minister's amendments. From memory—and this is difficult on the run—at one point we believed that there was a problem with our amendments and Senator Bishop's amendments that was fixed by the minister's amendments. But, having had a look at it, we now believe that our own amendment is in fact superior, which is a pity because the minister's amendments have already been passed. 
—No, we don't. 
—Senator Bishop is shaking his head at me, so he obviously believes that the minister's amendments are now okay. 
—Yes. 
—He is nodding at me. That is very good. In which case, it might be just as well to leave it to the minister's amendments and not worry about our amendment at all. But I would like to hear from Senator Bishop on that. 
—Senator Bishop, we are a little bit confused, so you might help us.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I might be able to shed light on this. My understanding is that the ALP and Democrat amendments sought to allow the national broadcasters to datacast radio services and the government amendments sought to allow the national broadcasters to both datacast and multichannel radio services. My understanding is that there have been negotiations between the three parties. We are all agreed that the government's position is preferable and we all want to support the government's amendments, which have already been passed. I presume that means we can withdraw both the Democrat amendment and the opposition amendment.

The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that the audio content conditions do not apply to the transmission of audio content that is incidental to, or provided as background to, matters displayed on the screen. The proposed amendment clarifies the treatment of audio content that is provided as purely incidental or background sound to matters displayed on the screen. Amendment (46) inserts a new subclause 21(8A) in proposed schedule 6 to make it clear that the prohibition in clause 21(1) does not prevent a datacasting licensee from transmitting audio content that is incidental to, or provided as background to, matter displayed on the screen.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—We seek to amend opposition amendment No. 21, going to the definition of a news or current affairs program, by, in paragraph (c), second line, deleting the word `on' as it appears after the word `discussion' and inserting in lieu `principally designed to inform the general community about'. So paragraph (c) would then read:
a program (whether presenter-based or not) whose sole or dominant purpose is to provide analysis, commentary or discussion principally designed to inform the general community about social, economic or political issues of current relevance to the general community.
As I said, this in the context of the definition of a news or current affairs program, allowing for that discussion to occur in the program not solely or purely related to news but to allow that analysis, commentary or discussion which may well be part of the combined news or current affairs program. 
—You have amended opposition amendment No. 21 on sheet 1823. Are you moving amendments Nos 19, 21, 22, 28, 30, 31 and 34 together? If so, you will need leave. Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-28,"—I would say by way of clarification that we may be in the same situation that we were in previously, when I think that you withdrew an amendment: this is only concerned with the application fee, which will be an administrative matter and will be of very small import. So we are not talking about anything that any body would not be able to afford. We are talking about simply covering administrative costs associated with the allocation of the licence, which is quite a different matter, of course, from the datacasting charge to be applied to broadcasters for datacasting, imposed under the Datacasting Charge Imposition Act. So the government's view is that it is not appropriate to treat national broadcasters any differently. It is just a process point.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-28,"—Yes. I was talking about the datacasting fee, which you properly describe as essentially an administrative cost. Upon reflection, there is no good reason that the national broadcasters should be treated any differently in that respect, and accordingly I will withdraw opposition amendment No. 27 on sheet 1823, but we will persist with the amendment on the datacasting charge at a later time.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-28,"—I refer in my remarks on the motion for the adjournment to some remarks that were made earlier this day by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator John Faulkner. He was referring to the situation of a Mr Chris Stewart, who has been the subject of some publicity, I believe, in the Financial Review recently. The speech made by Senator Faulkner in the lunchtime debate today on matters of public interest is yet another in a series of examples where Senator Faulkner comes into this place with, clearly, part of a story where he has ensured that not only has he come in here with a case to put but he has decided to make his case by slurring the reputations of private citizens. He has once again come into this place and sought to damage the reputations of fine, upstanding Australians who happen to have chosen, in a couple of examples, to make their career in the organisation of the Liberal Party of Australia—people who have dedicated their lives to the better government of Australia.
The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate comes in here and makes allegations about people such as the Baillieu family and members of that family who are long since deceased—and refuses, of course, to apologise to that family—and who makes allegations at whim about members of Senator Crane's family, causing great distress to that family, and again refuses to apologise. This is the bloke who, in question time after question time, absolutely ignores the protocols of the Senate, ignores the President of the Senate, and abuses people at whim. But at least when he comes in here and abuses his colleagues or even abuses the President—or even on occasion yourself, Madam Deputy President—those of us in here have the opportunity to stand up and correct the record, which is done on so many occasions. But today what does he do? He comes in here, under the pretext of standing up for this Mr Chris Stewart, and at the end of his speech slurred the reputations of people such as Mr Lynton Crosby, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party of Australia, and Mark Textor, one of Australia's most successful international research organisation heads in the history of this nation. He slurred a private citizen, a private business person running a very successful, now international, research organisation. Those people cannot defend themselves. He does this under the guise of trying to have the case of Mr Chris Stewart, a person who was employed by the Australian Bankers Association during one of the worst periods in that association's history, one of the most embarrassing periods in the history of banking in Australia—
—You're out of your depth now, Campbell. You're out of your depth now!
—Order, Senator Conroy!
—I will not, Senator Conroy, sink to the depths that your leader chose to today by attacking people. I do not know Mr Stewart. Anyone who wants to find out about Mr Stewart can read Mr Stewart's own testimony before the inquiry into the `cash for comments' affair. All they have to do is read that, and that speaks for itself. I am not going to slip down into the gutter with Senator Faulkner and seek to destroy the reputation of someone such as Mr Stewart in the way that Senator Faulkner does day after day in here when he has got nothing else to talk about. This is the bloke who has been the spokesman on Public Service matters in this place for coming up to four years now. He has not come up with a policy on Public Service matters, he has not come up with any new ideas on any policy, but when he is running out of muck to sling he comes in here and attacks Mr Textor and Mr Crosby. People will be able to judge Mr Chris Stewart when they look at the testimony that he gave under cross-examination from Mr Burnside. They will make judgments about Mr Stewart's integrity, honesty and professionalism in the development of the scripts that were used by John laws, the potential conflicts of interest between developing those scripts, receiving money for those scripts, and at the same time being on the payroll of the Australian Bankers Association. Senator Faulkner came in here today and said that Mr Textor is some sort of evil researcher. He tried to say that Mr Textor is evil because he learnt from Richard Worthlin. You will have to ask Senator Faulkner, if you have the chance, who is his favourite American pollster. He accuses Mr Textor of supporting Richard Worthlin.  I presume, based on Senator Faulkner's experience, that he would hitch his bandwagon to Dick Morris. Also, in his speech he created some sort of conspiracy theory. 
I think you need to understand why Senator Faulkner came in here in the first place. He came in here to seek justice for Chris Stewart, ostensibly. At the end of his speech, Senator Faulkner said he wanted the Public Service Commissioner, Ms Williams, to look into this matter. So he is seeking justice for this bloke. How do you seek justice for someone in the Australian system before an arbitration tribunal or a court? Do you come into parliament and put the whole skewed story, based on information that Senator Faulkner would probably claim is reliable, with his sordid political spin on it, or do you allow someone such as Mr Stewart, or any other public servant in this nation of ours, to seek justice? Of course not. Senator Faulkner came in here and put his spin on a whole series of events. He said that the sacking of Chris Stewart, this employee of the Australian Bankers Association during the `cash for comment' crisis, had all of a sudden gone offside with the Liberal Party hierarchy because he employed John Utting. But he did not, of course, go into John Utting's history. I think the great irony in this is that the scripts Mr Chris Stewart wrote for John Laws and others were titled `The Whole Story'. I think it is about time Senator Faulkner told us the whole story about the involvement of John Utting and the Australian Labor Party. How did John Utting get his first payment? How did John Utting set up UMR?
—Who made the call?
—I invite Senator Ray to get up and tell us the whole story about John Utting.
—Happily.
—He will happily tell us. Is he going to tell us that John Utting, in evidence before the WA Inc. royal commission, received his first payment—I think it was $50,000—out of a safe in Brian Burke's office? Does Robert Ray know that? Is he going to tell us about John Utting's history and how he got his start in business? Of course he is not going to tell us the whole story. He will try to further persecute people such as Mark Textor, who has created a successful research organisation in Australia, who has been a provider of quality research to the Liberal Party of Australia and who has ensured through that success that he is able to run a successful business, not only across Australia but also internationally. But because Mr Textor happens to have worked for the Liberal Party of Australia these people want to come in here and destroy his reputation and destroy the careers of those people who work for Mr Textor's organisation—
—What's Textor's research telling you now?
—Just as Senator Conroy will come in here and seek to destroy the lives of business people in Victoria, people who would not have the opportunity to defend themselves in this place. As Senator Ray usually says, when you seek to attack someone on the Labor Party side or make comments about them, there are only 10 yards to walk to courage. Of course, Senator Faulkner will never walk those 10 yards. He will never say what he says in here about Mr Crosby or Mr Sinodinos or Mr Textor, because he is too gutless. Senator Ray will never walk the 10 yards to courage. He will never say outside this place what he says about Mr Textor. What I ask is that, when Senator Ray gets up to respond, he should walk outside and say outside this place what he is going to say. He should tell us the whole story about John Utting and how he got his start in life from Brian Burke, the disgraced former Premier of Western Australia. That is what I encourage him to do: tell the whole story in Chris Stewart's words; tell us the whole story about John Utting, tell us the whole story about Chris Stewart. Do not come in here and slander the reputations of fine upstanding Australians like Mark Textor and Lynton Crosby.
