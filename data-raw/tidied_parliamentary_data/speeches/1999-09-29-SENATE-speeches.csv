"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-09-29,"—I will take up and complete my contribution from yesterday to this debate. The second issue that Labor senators requested be fixed before passage of this bill was that some workers are being paid SG contributions on a low base, well below the surcharge threshold of $70,000, but are paying the surcharge because of allowances and overtime.
The AWU gave evidence to the committee of mineworkers at Pasminco sites around Australia suffering from this inequitable situation. It is not possible for the Senate to amend the SG legislation to fix this issue, hence the need to move a second reading amendment to urge the government to take action to correct this injustice, which my colleague Senator Sherry will do shortly. I hope the government will take up the Senate's invitation to fix this unjust and inequitable situation.
Labor supports the majority of the measures contained in this bill. They are sensible changes to a Keystone Cops tax which will go some way towards making it more manageable than it has been to date. However, Senator Kemp must have been watching the Keystone Cops when he considered the retrospective amendment which requires funds to recalculate their surcharge tax liabilities when they have already done so under the legislation that Senator Kemp described as sound.
—Did you really write this?
—If I were wearing that shirt, tie and suit combo, Senator Macdonald, I would just get back in my box. Despite repeatedly trying, Senator Kemp cannot have it both ways. The legislation is either sound or it is broken and needs to be fixed. Labor will be opposing the move to make this bill retrospective.
Finally, Labor will be moving a second reading amendment to urge the government to take action to ensure that workers around Australia are treated justly and equitably when it comes to the surcharge tax and the superannuation guarantee. Either these workers are paid SG on the amount of salary and wages they really earn, or their overtime and other penalty allowances earned as a result of a 12-hour shift are not included for surcharge tax purposes. It is the fair thing to do.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS AND TERMINATION PAYMENTS TAXES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-29,"—It is somewhat annoying that the Senate has to deal with this bill, which seeks to reduce the compliance costs of the superannuation surcharge tax. It addresses many of the issues that the Senate superannuation committee addressed prior to the surcharge laws taking effect in May 1997, issues which the government chose to ignore at that time. If the government had taken on board the advice of the committee—advice which was unanimous across unions, employers, ASFA and industry representatives appearing before the committee—it could have avoided the problems that this bill has to deal with by implementing a better, lower cost surcharge collection mechanism.
Need I say yet again that the Democrats support the principle of the surcharge. We believe it was unfair that high income earners received a tax break of 17 cents in the dollar on super contributions, while low income earners received only five cents in the dollar. The surcharge did not fix the issue, but at least it reduced the subsidies to high income earners by around $500 million a year. As such, it was a fine principle; it was just a very bad practice.
It was quite clear in 1997 that the government would dump the tax if its flawed collection mechanism was not accepted. So we reluctantly supported it, seeking assurances 
 from the government that it would respond to legitimate concerns raised by the industry. In November 1997 the first batch of amendments came to the Senate to fix problems with the original law. We raised 15 issues sought by industry to fix other anomalies, but failed to win government support for them. In this bill nearly two years later, the government concedes that the issues that we raised, the committee raised and the opposition raised were appropriate and that the compliance costs of the surcharge need to be reduced. The wheels of decision making in Senator Kemp's office turn very slowly, it seems, but at least the message is finally getting through.
The most significant issue in this bill is the removal of the advance payment system for the surcharge. This was first proposed by industry back in May 1997. Two years later the argument has finally been conceded. The bill also provides for a self-assessment regime for certain superannuation providers and clarifies the definition and calculation of surchargeable contributions. Concern has been raised that some of the amendments will apply retrospectively, arguably, the government says, to ensure equity between defined benefit and accumulation schemes. The retrospectivity concerns are centred on provisions to calculate the notional surcharge contributions factor for the last three financial years according to a ruling, rather than the previous method of following actuarial practice. This would require funds to even recalculate the surcharge for members who may have already left the fund. The government argues that trustees still have the option of having their actuarial practice approved by the ATO. However, trustees will need to show that their methodology is more appropriate than the methodology in ruling SCR97/1. The Institute of Actuaries has advised that the majority of funds would already comply with this ruling, the exceptions likely to be those funds who filed nil returns because they have been on contribution holidays.
Nevertheless, the provisions will add to clarity and certainty in dealing with this law. The Democrats will not be moving amendments to this bill in the committee stage. We acknowledge that the government has con 
 sulted with industry on the development of the bill. If that had happened with the original surcharge bill and more with the amending bills, many of the administrative problems could have been avoided. But this government continues to consult too much without listening. I find the provisions of this bill with regard to the retrospective operation unsatisfactory, yet they may be the best means of dealing with a significant problem.
The opposition is also to move a second reading amendment dealing with the issues of different bases for the calculation of superannuation guarantee payments and superannuation surcharges. The point that they raise is worth exploring. The Democrats will be supporting the second reading amendment asking the government to investigate how such a situation could come about whereby workers can be paid superannuation based on a lesser definition of salary, yet be charged surcharge based on a larger definition of salary.
—This is your favourite topic, Nick; get into it.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS AND TERMINATION PAYMENTS TAXES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-09-29,"—I have got lots of favourite topics, and this is one of them. We are dealing with the third set of amendments to the so-called superannuation surcharge, more appropriately known as a tax. It is worth reminding the Senate yet again that this government gave a commitment to the Australian people prior to the election in 1996 that there would be no increase in taxes, no new taxes, and no increase in existing taxes. Subsequent to the election of the Liberal-National Party government, we had in their first budget a so-called surcharge which applied supposedly to high income earners, implementing a new tax—up to 15 per cent additional tax—with respect to superannuation.
It is interesting to contrast the rhetoric with which the government surrounds its justification for this new tax. The government's arguments go that it is a fair tax because it applies to higher income earners—a new tax of up to 15 per cent—and that it will not adversely affect retirement savings, hence investment, hence employment. Of course, we look at those arguments in comparison to the 
 government's justification at the moment for reducing company tax and capital gains tax. The government argues the total reverse—that they are reducing taxes in those two areas in order to encourage investment, encourage savings and encourage employment.
So, on the one hand, when the government first took office, it broke its promise to the Australian people not to increase existing taxes and said that it was a fair tax and that it would not adversely affect investment, that it would not adversely affect saving. On the other hand, the government is now saying that the reduction in those two other taxes will be good for investment, good for saving and good for employment. I am just making the point that the government has a different argument with respect to particular taxes—and it is a contradictory argument.
As has been pointed out by Senator Conroy, and by Senator Allison from the Democrats, this is the third set of changes that we are making to the so-called surcharge tax. This legislation has been dealt with in some detail in the Economics Legislation Committee hearings. It is not that the government was not forewarned about the particular problems—many problems—with the superannuation tax. It was not just I who warned the government about the particular problems when this tax was first mooted. If we go back through not just the newspaper clippings but the various correspondence some two years ago from accountants, actuaries, economists and lawyers with respect to the administration, the collection mechanism, of this tax, you cannot find anyone who supported the administration and the collection mechanism of this tax. It is extremely cumbersome. It has failed to collect the revenues that were predicted, and it has been very expensive to collect those revenues. Yet the government claimed that the original bill that was presented to the parliament was sound. Here we are, more than two years later, dealing with the third set of amendments to try to correct the problems that the government was forewarned of at the time.
It is interesting that Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, in evidence to the committee hearings a couple of weeks ago, said, 
 `We still feel the original bill was sound.' If the original bill was still sound, why are we debating this in the Senate today? Why are we debating yet the third set of amendments to this legislation?
—That is a telling point, Nick!
—Senator Kemp, you continue to maintain that the original legislation was sound. Why do we continue to get successions of amendments to this legislation? I think that is a very important point to make. Part of the impact of this legislation is to reimburse the so-called advance instalment. The advance instalment involved the collection of $120 million in revenue. That is a major change of policy by any government. I would like to know from Senator Kemp the policy reason for the government not collecting the advance instalment. Where it has collected the advance instalment, it is being refunded, where it can be refunded. It is $120 million; it is a substantial amount of revenue. The government cannot have it both ways. Senator Kemp argues that the original bill was sound, the policy still stands, yet we have got a very substantial departure from the original policy—the abandonment of the advance instalment.
The second aspect of this legislation concerns what I think is a favourite phrase of Senator Kemp and certainly of the government—`technical amendments'. But of course technical amendments can often have profound impacts and influence, particularly with respect to this legislation and particularly with respect to tax legislation. The technical amendments to this bill relate to the notional surchargeable contribution factors in respect of defined benefit funds.
I do not want to blind people with jargon in respect of superannuation, but there are two types of superannuation funds—defined benefit funds and accumulation funds. Most Australians are in accumulation funds—in other words, the money that goes in plus the interest is the money they receive; it accumulates over time and they receive it at their appropriate retirement age. There are a significant number of defined benefit funds which, regardless of the contributions that go 
 in, if indeed any go in, define the level of benefit you would receive when you retire—defined benefit funds. Of course there have been significant problems—and the government was forewarned about this—about how you tax a benefit when you do not know what the benefit will be for possibly 20 or 30 years. That is a very important issue. It does affect a significant number of defined benefit funds in this country. The way in which the so-called surcharge applies to those funds is quite critical.
The government is trying to beef up the definition of the notional surcharge contribution factor by applying—and we will deal with this in more detail in the committee stage—a SCR 97/1. This application of SCR 97/1 is supposed to clarify the particular problems for defined benefit funds. I make this point: the government is attempting to clarify this particular issue, a very important issue, retrospectively. The government says, on the one hand, there are no problems with the original legislation but, on the other hand, it is applying this clarification back to the original date of the application of the so-called surcharge. It is doing this for one reason: the government faces court challenges to the application of the surcharge or tax to defined benefit funds. Some defined benefit funds, not knowing how the surcharge or tax is to apply, have indicated they will be taking court action. This was discussed again at the committee hearings.
I will just make a couple of points about SCR 97/1, which is supposedly going to make it clearer how the superannuation tax applies to defined benefit funds. The government is giving SCR 97/1 effectively the status of a law of the Commonwealth. Why the government did not do that in the first place some years ago is a question we would all like answered, Senator Kemp. So SCR 97/1 is being given effective status of law. I just make this point: if that is the case—and that is the case, that is what the government is attempting to do—why is it necessary for the Australian Government Actuary to issue a seven-page clarification about the meaning of SCR 97/1? What is the status of the clarification from the Australian Government Actua 
 ry? If this legislation is passed, does this clear up once and for all the particular problems for working out notional surcharge contribution factors?
The fact that a clarification is being issued by the Australian Government Actuary provides clear evidence that there are inherent difficulties with SCR 97/1. Why is the Government Actuary issuing a seven-page clarification? Is it appropriate to use SCR 97/1 when the government is attempting to collect tax revenue? This highlights the difficulties of coming up with a satisfactory definition of a notional surcharge contribution factor. If the superannuation tax is to be retained, if that is indeed desirable because of the administrative uncertainties and the particular problems surrounding this tax, do we gain any greater certainty by including SCR 97/1 as the basis for tax calculation, particularly when it is having to be clarified by the Australian Government Actuary? I think we may be coming back to deal with this issue again at some future time.
The other issue I want to touch on in respect of my contribution on the second reading concerns yet another problem that has arisen as a result of the new superannuation tax. The superannuation tax is based on almost all assessable income—that includes overtime and a range of other forms of income. That, at first glance, might seem reasonable. However, one of the difficulties with the new tax is that superannuation contributions in this country are not based on total assessable income; they are based on ordinary time earnings. In respect of the superannuation guarantee, ordinary time earnings for the purposes of superannuation payments by employers in respect of their employees do not include such incomes as overtime, various types of fringe benefits and certainly some other allowances. So we have two different calculation bases: one for the purposes of superannuation guarantee and one for the purposes of this particular tax that we are dealing with in this legislation.
This difficulty was highlighted by the Australian Workers Union in evidence they gave to the committee. They had a group of members in the mining industry who, in terms 
 of all-up income, were earning more than $72,000 in total. They received, under the government's legislation, their assessment notices for their superannuation tax. That seems reasonable on the face of it, but these particular workers were none too happy because they were receiving superannuation contributions based on an income far, far less than the then minimum $72,000 for the purposes of this tax.
In the case of these particular workers, there are groups of workers around Australia who entered into workplace agreements prior to the advent of the superannuation guarantee and who have their superannuation contribution levels based on a fixed figure which is considerably less than their average income and considerably less than their taxable income. I had the opportunity to meet and discuss this situation with this group of workers in Tasmania. To say that they were angry is an understatement.
Government senators interjecting—
—I did not have to stir them up, Senator Kemp. They were very, very angry about this situation because they were paying a tax on their correct income but were not getting the superannuation contributions. Effectively, their superannuation contributions were, in this case, about a third of their total income. This is an appalling situation. You pay a tax, but you do not get the superannuation contributions. The difficulties that these workers face is that the employer, in this case Pasminco, will not agree—without the employers' consent you cannot get agreement—to change the workplace agreements to ensure that their superannuation guarantee contributions are at least based on their ordinary time earnings. That is a very important issue which goes to our second reading amendment. They are some of the concerns that Labor has with this legislation.
I also point out that in the committee hearings we continued to hear from representatives of very reputable companies about the costs of collection of this new tax. The government did not want to call it a tax. They called it a surcharge because they did not want to be seen to be breaking their promise to the Australian people about not increasing 
 existing taxes or introducing new taxes. So they called it a surcharge. They have tried to hide the collection of the superannuation tax as much as possible but, in so doing, they have placed an administrative burden on superannuation funds who are required to do the paperwork and the extensive calculations. Mr Noel Davis of Clayton Utz said that in the first year of operation it cost $270 million to collect $340 million of additional tax revenue.
It is interesting to note that this was this government's first foray into tax reform. We hear ad nauseam arguments from this government about the need to simplify the tax system and reduce tax legislation. The tax bills are getting longer and longer and more complicated. Yet here we have the government's tax—their so-called surcharge—which cost $270 million to collect $340 million in revenue. I might say that that $340 million fell short by $160 million. It was supposed to collect close to half a billion dollars. I know Senator Kemp is fond of talking about the wholesale sales tax. There is no better example of an extraordinarily costly tax—$270 million to collect a $340 million tax. There is no better example of an extremely costly tax due to the inefficient administration of the so-called surcharge.
As I said earlier, this is the third set of amendments to the Liberal Party's new tax. We do not see any evidence of tax legislation getting any simpler. In fact, it is the reverse. It is getting more and more complex. I challenge Senator Kemp yet again, if he still maintains, as he did in the committee hearings, that the original bill was sound, to say why we are dealing with the third set of amendments. If everything is so hunky-dory and this is a great tax, why are we wasting the time of the Senate dealing with yet another set of amendments?
—That's a schoolboy debating point.
—It is a very important debating point. It is not schoolboy debating points when we are talking about this government's claims of so-called efficiency of the tax system when in fact the tax system is getting more complicated and the legislation is getting longer and more complex. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
""but the Senate:
(a)	 notes evidence given on the bill to the Economics Legislation Committee that certain workers in the mining and minerals processing industries are liable to pay superannuation surcharge because their adjusted taxable income exceeds the threshold, yet are only entitled to Superannuation Guarantee contributions calculated on a base rate of pay which is significantly lower than their adjusted taxable income; and
(b)	 urges the Government to initiate urgent legislative action to address this unfair anomaly"".",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS AND TERMINATION PAYMENTS TAXES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-09-29,"—I now respond to the points that have been raised in the speeches at the second reading stage. By way of introduction, I note and acknowledge the huge interest that Senator Sherry has in the superannuation surcharge. Certainly, he has more interest than Senator Conroy. I have to say that Senator Conroy, as will be revealed in my second reading speech, has made one of the biggest blunders I have seen in this chamber. I am sure that Senator Sherry would be interested to hear what that blunder is, as one of Senator Conroy's rivals.
Senator Sherry touched on the history of the surcharge. I think it is useful to look at the history of the surcharge. The Labor Party supported the surcharge in the original bill in the other place. Senator Sherry managed to persuade the Labor Party to oppose the surcharge in this chamber. So we had an immediate backflip between the two houses. Then, as time moved on, the Labor Party decided it would support the surcharge. So we had another backflip. Since then, the comments that have come out of the Labor Party have been excessively confusing. Let me take one of the points that the Labor Party constantly goes on about.
If I can summarise it, I think the Labor Party's current position is that it supports the surcharge, but it is worried about the collection mechanism. I point out to the Senate, to Kelvin Thomson, to Senator Conroy and to Senator Sherry that the Labor Party has had about three years to work out some alternative way of collecting the surcharge. Senator 
 Sherry will correct me if I am wrong, but he was originally going to move in this chamber some amendments about the way the surcharge was to be collected. In the end, Senator Sherry decided, for very good reasons, not to go down that road, so that brief flurry to try to change the collection device was abandoned. Of course, we have had only about three years for the Labor Party to come up with an alternative. It is true that there are people like Noel Davis in the industry who spend huge amounts of time on the surcharge and probably do quite well out of it. It is not that Senator Sherry would be lacking help or advice on this but, despite the Labor Party's relentless complaints about the surcharge, it has never been able to come up with any alternative.
The explanations could be twofold. One is that the government got it right—and I think that is the correct explanation. Another explanation is that the Labor Party is just too lazy to do the hard work. I think there is plenty of evidence in other areas of the lack of focus the Beazley Labor Party has on public policy issues. It is quite pointless for the Labor Party to go on and on about the collection and then refuse—after three years and with all the advice available to it—to come up with an alternative.
Senator Conroy reminded this chamber once that Senator Sherry spends about 96 per cent of his waking hours thinking about the surcharge. Senator Sherry, why not sit down, do some work and, if you want to relentlessly get up and complain, think of some alternative? But that is not the case. Senator Sherry, in trying to lead the Labor Party to oppose the surcharge, made some astonishing statements that there would be a lack of confidence in superannuation. In fact, I remember that famous quote from Senator Sherry. He was discussing superannuation with his hairdresser. Johann, Stefan or whatever his name was indicated to Senator Sherry that—
—Barry.
—Thank you for telling me that, Senator Sherry. Barry then advised Senator Sherry that he lacked confidence in the surcharge, so Senator Sherry came back into the chamber and said he was going to 
 oppose the bill. Senator Sherry, you have to widen your net of advice and recognise that the advice you gave the Labor Party that particular time was dead wrong. In fact, superannuation, as we all know, has continued to be one of Australia's fastest growing industries, as it should be. This attempt by Senator Sherry, and a whole range of other arguments that Senator Sherry put against the surcharge, fell over.
The government does not support the second reading amendment moved by the Labor Party. As I said, one of the effects of the amendments to be moved by the Labor Party in the committee stage will be that contributions of high income members of defined benefit funds, including every politician in Australia, will not be surchargeable for the 1997, 1998 and 1999 financial years, effectively giving these people a retrospective pay rise for each of those years. That is the effect of what the Labor Party will be moving today. It is an astonishing thing, because we have been seeking Labor Party amendments. I think my office was misadvised that the Labor Party amendments had been faxed through to our office for us to look at—of course they had not been—and now when we look closely at the amendments, which were thrown on the table overnight, we see what their true effect is.
As I said in the debate yesterday, Senator Conroy was doing a Nick Sherry—in other words, trying to defeat the surcharge. This is in essence exactly what these particular amendments do. They are the most appallingly drafted amendments. The explanation for the amendments that was given by Senator Conroy and touched on by Senator Sherry was extremely misleading to this chamber. I am sure that we can go through them in detail in the committee stage. Let no-one forget that the effect of these amendments is to get politicians out of paying the surcharge for the last three years. That is what Kelvin Thomson and Senator Conroy have done. In other words, they are proceeding exactly down the Nick Sherry road.
The bill that is before us contains amendments that the government has decided to 
 undertake after very extensive consultation with the industry.
Senator Quirke interjecting—
—Don't blame me. Your people drafted the amendments. Mr Kelvin Thomson drafted these amendments. They were presumably properly explained to your party room, but they were certainly not properly explained to this chamber. I think the Labor Party—
Senator Quirke interjecting—
—Senator Quirke, I know you probably feel offended because Mr Kelvin Thomson and Senator Conroy have put you into a very difficult position with these amendments. Believe me, I will not be allowing the Labor Party to forget this. I will constantly remind you of this particular effort. After all the nonsense we have had in this chamber in question time and all the rest of it and how much the Labor Party has reversed its position on the surcharge, it produces these particular amendments. It is an absolute disgrace.
We have consulted very extensively with the industry in the preparation of this bill, including bodies like the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Investment and Financial Services Association, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the Australian Taxpayers Association, the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and so on. All the feedback I have received on these consultations says that they were very successful.
The legislation before the Senate has benefited considerably from the many suggestions received from industry players. In particular, suggestions from the private sector on how the legislation could be made clearer have been taken on board. In short, the suggestions raised in the consultations about how the law could be made clearer or more effective were taken on board by the government. As I have often said in this chamber, we are a consultative government. Senator Sherry asks, `Why are you bringing this bill before this chamber?'  We are bringing this bill before the chamber because we are a government that 
 goes out and listens to people. We are a government that goes out and talks to people and, if we can sensibly respond to those consultations, we do. We make no apology for doing that.
Senator Watson interjecting—
—Senator Watson, unlike Senator Sherry, takes an exceedingly constructive role in relation to superannuation. Senator Watson is always interested in how the legislation governing superannuation can be improved. Senator Watson, unlike Senator Sherry, gets down, does the work and consults. The feedback from the industry on this bill—and this was at least acknowledged by the Labor Party—has been very positive. The suggestions raised in the consultations about how the law could be made clearer or more effective were taken on board by the government where we could.
As a result of these consultative processes, the  Superannuation Contributions and Termination Payments Taxes Legislation Amendment Bill 1999  was introduced into the parliament on 30 June 1999. The bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which reported on 15 September 1999—the same date that the ATO was advised by Arthur Robinson and Hedderwicks that they had been requested to commence proceedings as soon as possible on behalf of Rio Tinto. The government are concerned and disappointed that this action has been instituted in view of the very extensive consultations that we had with the industry and the types of assurances that were given to us as a result of those consultations. Some put forward the argument that the law needed to be clarified in certain areas. From the government's point of view, the legislation was sound; however, if it assisted the industry to make some amendments, then those amendments were made. That is precisely what the government did.
However, the government have always been of the view that the legislation is sound. The amendments before the Senate make the law even clearer. The ATO has advised the government that the Australian Government Solicitor agrees the legislation is sound. I am advised that the ATO would not accept the 
 contributions holiday argument, for example, as a basis for reporting nil contributions. The government are moving these amendments because the industry wants us to do so.
Let me now turn to the Labor Party amendments that change the commencement date. Senator Conroy's proposals—or are they Kelvin Thomson's; who knows—
—Senator Kemp, could you please refer to Mr Thomson as either Mr Thomson or the member for Wills.
—I thought I was referring to Mr Thomson as Mr Thomson or the member for Wills. I am not sure who is taking responsibility for these amendments, but someone had better take responsibility, because they are the most ill-conceived, illogical, unworkable and poorly drafted amendments that we have seen proposed to come before this chamber. They would create more uncertainty and confusion because they have not been formulated in the context of the legislation as a whole. The effect of Senator Conroy's proposals—or are they Mr Kelvin Thomson's proposals—is that the contributions of high income earning members of defined benefit funds will not be subject to the surcharge for the financial years 1997, 1998 and 1999.
Let me repeat: the amendment proposals drafted under the guise of removing perceived retrospective aspects of the bill ensure that the superannuation contributions of high income earning members of defined benefit funds—including every politician in Australia—are not surchargeable for the financial years 1997, 1998 and 1999. This effectively gives all these people, including politicians, a retrospective pay rise for each of those years. That is why I said that Senator Conroy has done a Nick Sherry. Nick Sherry wanted to defeat the surcharge.
—Please refer to Senator Sherry as Senator Sherry.
—Senator Conroy is heading down exactly the same road that Senator Sherry attempted to encourage the Labor Party to head down. Senator Conroy's—or are 
 they Mr Kelvin Thomson's—amendments would introduce great inequity into the surcharge. The proposals mean that the superannuation contributions of high income earning members of accumulation funds would be surchargeable from 20 August 1996 while the contributions of their peers in defined benefit funds would become surchargeable from only the 1999-2000 financial year. This is clearly inequitable, particularly for all those high income earning funds members who have been subject to the surcharge. This is the advice that I have received from the Taxation Office after a careful analysis of these amendments which were produced at the last moment before this bill came before the chamber.
The government is introducing the bill to provide certainty and clarity for trustees and to ensure that all high income earning members of superannuation schemes are treated the same for surchargeable purposes. The amendments proposed by the Labor Party would create more confusion and ensure that high income earning members of defined benefit funds get an advantage, and politicians are typically in defined benefit funds. This is what the Labor Party's amendments will do. This is the road that the Mr Kelvin Thomsons, the Senator Conroys and the Senator Sherrys are leading the Labor Party down.
How the Labor Party could get themselves into such a mess over this bill completely eludes me. As always, the government were happy to consult with the Labor Party, but we got the amendments at the last possible moment—probably in the hope that they could be flicked through before people could appreciate the full impact of these amendments. Fortunately for us, the debate ended last night, and officers from the Taxation Office were able to closely analyse the full consequences of this particular set of amendments.
So we will be opposing these proposed amendments for all the reasons I have indicated. I am appalled that these amendments are proposed to come before this chamber. As I said, they are incredibly poorly drafted and they are unworkable. I am perfectly aware 
 that there are people in the community who are opposed to the surcharge bill. I think it would be far better if the Labor Party consulted more widely, recognised that the surcharge is an equity measure, threw away this approach that was started off by Senator Sherry on the surcharge and worked with the government, as other parties are doing. Where the industry has particular concerns about the surcharge, the government will address those concerns—if they can be addressed. So we are certainly opposing the amendments that will be moved by the Labor Party.
In conclusion, the measures in this bill will improve the operation and overall efficiency of the superannuation surcharge. They will also significantly reduce the compliance costs on superannuation funds and provide greater certainty. We will be opposing the second reading amendment which has been proposed.
Senator Sherry interjecting—
—I am not aware that anybody else wishes to divide. I am aware that the second reading amendment is being supported by the Democrats, so I presume that the motion will be decided on the voices. In relation to the second reading amendment, the superannuation guarantee legislation requires employers to make compulsory contributions to a superannuation fund for their eligible employees at a certain level, calculated on the employees' earnings base. These contributions are generally based on the award earnings base for award employees. The earnings base for employees not covered under award arrangements would be the superannuation guarantee default earnings base. This is the ordinary time earnings as defined under the superannuation guarantee legislation.
The government does not see a need to change the existing arrangements, which a Labor government put in place. The surcharge applies in a proper manner to high income earners and the existing superannuation tax concessions for high income earners, such as those mentioned by the opposition, are more favourable than those applying to lower and middle income owners, reflecting the different marginal rates of income. The surcharge means that superannuation tax concessions 
 enjoyed by such workers are more comparable with those enjoyed by workers on lower incomes.
We urge the Senate to pass the bill. The government will be moving a number of amendments of a technical variety in the committee stage and we urge that the bill, as amended by the government, be passed.
Amendment agreed to.
Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-09-29,"—Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999  seek to appropriate moneys from consolidated revenue funds for initiatives flowing from the deal that the government made with the Australian Democrats to secure passage of the GST—known as `the dirty deal, done dirt cheap'. The measures are, firstly, for the Book Industry Assistance Plan and, secondly, for additional funding for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. These measures are contained in Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999. There are also a number of environment initiatives contained in Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999. I will deal with each of these in turn.
Appropriation bill (No. 1) provides $60 million for each of the four years from the 2000-01 financial year through to the 2003-04 financial year. The main aims of the plan are to provide financial assistance to those producing books in Australia, Australian creators of books and retailers of textbooks in Australia. I point out to the Senate that this is needed only because of the GST and the impact it will have on those involved in producing, creating and retailing books in Australia. We point this out, and we question the adequacy of the measure. The opposition are of the view that this is an inadequate response to what is, in the first place, a most unsatisfactory decision to impose a GST on books. We believe it has the potential to create an administrative nightmare for every bookshop in Australia. Indeed, bookshops will have the administrative problems that every small business will have with the GST, but now they will also have a whole new complex rebate to administer, which has not been properly worked through. This represents a potential nightmare for bookshops.
In our view, this measure represents small and inadequate compensation to the industry in general for a tax that will be a direct attack on what Australia needs to be—that is, a knowledge nation. This represents perhaps one step forward but certainly two steps back 
 for the knowledge nation. The government knows that the GST is bad for the book industry, for consumers of books, for bookshops and for education and knowledge in this country. It had to be embarrassed and shamed into a promise that it would do something in this regard and we now see it in the form of this legislation, which represents just a few crumbs off the table to the book industry when what we really needed to be saying was that we were not going to be imposing a GST on knowledge at all.
In our view, it is a totally inadequate measure. It would have been unnecessary but for the government's determination to impose a GST on books and the Democrats' capitulation on this issue, where they were quite happy to roll over and be done over by the government and that great Democrat negotiator Senator Lees. One of the core promises of the Democrats, when they went to the last election, was that they would not allow, in any way, shape or form, a GST to be imposed on books, but after the election we saw the Democrats caving in—capitulating to the government on this issue. Now they walk around saying, `We have done wonderful things for the book industry,' when in fact the opposite is true. They had it in their power to prevent a GST being imposed on books in this country and they did not do it. Who is keeping those bastards honest?
We have here legislation which effectively says to the book industry, `We have struck you a dreadful blow and you are bleeding, but here is a bandaid.' Certainly, the bandaid is better than nothing, and we will not be opposing it, but our view is that this is a small and inadequate response. Those book publishers who have indicated that they welcome the measure say it goes some way to compensating for the GST, but that that is the best you can say for it—that it does go some way to compensating them. Australians ought to be aware that this plan is not good news. Despite its meagre compensation, come 1 July 2000 people involved in this area—authors, bookshop owners, students, parents and Australians purchasing books—will be worse off. It would have been better, if we had to proceed down the path of a GST, to exempt books, as 
 the Democrats had pledged, rather than to introduce these complicated arrangements. I further point out to the Senate that it is quite hypocritical for the government to be talking about literacy—we have heard from the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, from time to time, on this front—when this tax will make books and therefore knowledge and learning more expensive.
The second provision in this legislation provides an additional $15 million for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program for each of the four years to the year 2003-04. The processes for distributing this money to the states are not clear, and we would like some more information about this. Indeed, in the lead-up to the renegotiation of the agreement of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, we would like to hear more from the government about how it intends to distribute this money to the states.
I should point out that we believe the government has failed to take real action to address homelessness issues. The government's negotiations with the Democrats have led to this $15 million per year being provided for youth homelessness. We think this is trying to solve a major national crisis once again, as with the books, with just a few crumbs from the table. The government failed in its budget to address Supported Accommodation Assistance Program funding at all. The $45 million over six years amounts to a meagre $7.5 million a year. It has been instituted merely to ensure that the staff employed in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program agencies have and enjoy award conditions. Not one dollar of that amount will actually go towards expanding the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program services to the needy.
Last year the government sponsored a review by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. That review recommended, at a minimum, a 25 per cent funding increase to the SAAP in order just to service current unmet demands. The national evaluation of the program, released by the Department of Family and Community Services some three weeks ago, concurred with that analysis and requested that recurrent funding for the first 
 year of the new agreement reach a total of $285 million. Against that background, the extra $15 million—which was reannounced by the government as part of this deal with the Democrats—is, frankly, nowhere near the 25 per cent increase recommended by the government's own review and by the government's own Department of Family and Community Services.
The demand for services for the homeless is ever growing. Figures which were released in budget week showed that the number of people accessing these services had risen from 110,000 in 1996-97 to 160,000—that is a 66 per cent increase—for the financial year 1997-98. This is a matter of considerable concern. The government said that it was a good thing it was providing more services, but we say that it is illogical for the government to be treating, as a sign of success, evidence that there are more and more homeless people in our society. We are concerned that what is proposed here simply will not address these problems in any serious way at all.
 Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999  provides for the environmental initiatives agreed with the Democrats, and I will go through those initiatives now. Those initiatives are: support conversions to compressed natural gas or liquid petroleum gas for commercial vehicles and buses that have a gross vehicle mass equal to or greater than 3.5 tonnes—and that also applies to trains and ferries; support a product stewardship system for the reuse and recycling of waste oil; support the utilisation of photovoltaic systems on residential buildings and community reuse buildings; support the development and commercialisation of renewable energy; support the use of renewable energy from remote power generation; support the development and implementation of in-service emissions testing capabilities for diesel patrol vehicles where the diesel emissions testing is in connection with the making and/or implementation of a diesel national environment protection measure; and, finally, provide for a greenhouse gas abatement program. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you can see, as far as they go, those initiatives are 
 welcome and we will certainly not be opposing them.
It is appropriate at this time to re-emphasise the environmental consequences of a goods and services tax, of which this legislation forms a consequence, and the reduction in economic incentives to use alternative environmentally friendly fuels and technologies. The overwhelming body of evidence presented to the Senate committee inquiry into the impacts of the GST on the environment reinforced the view that the government's package was ill-considered and fundamentally flawed. Indeed, the Senate committee's report highlighted negative impacts on a great number of areas which it examined in some detail, including impact on the urban environment, impact on public transport services, impact on emerging technologies and impact on exports. All the evidence that the Senate committee considered tended to point to disastrous and long-term damage to the environment which would occur through an increase in diesel fuel pollutants and greenhouse gases and a reduction in economic incentives to use alternative environmentally friendly fuels and technologies.
The diesel fuel excise cut will result in economic incentives to use diesel fuel transport—to switch from petrol to diesel fuel vehicles and to switch from more fuel efficient rail transport to less efficient and high polluting road transport—and a reduction in incentives to switch from diesel to gaseous fuels and to new technologies, such as solar. We want to continue to express the concern that the greatest environmental effects as a result of this measure will be in urban areas and that increased diesel fuel consumption will lead to an increase in highly dangerous particulates in our urban environments. We note that the Australian Medical Association has warned of the increased risk of lung cancer and a variety of respiratory disorders as a consequence.
The direct effect of the cut in the diesel fuel excise will be to make it difficult for the government to meet even those watered-down Kyoto greenhouse gas targets. One of the clear losers will be the emerging alternative energy sector; the impact on emerging tech 
 nologies could cost many jobs. Australia is currently a world leader in the development of new technology and the renewable energy sector, including solar energy. It is clear that the government's taxation package will be highly detrimental to this critical and developing industry; it will undermine the industry's huge export potential. The measures in this bill simply do not adequately address that issue.
Evidence to the Senate committee expressed deep concern that removal of the diesel fuel rebate would also impact on what I have to describe as the already fragile economics of the Alice Springs-Darwin and Melbourne-Darwin railway proposals. The evidence on the environment, as with the evidence on books, is that the GST will impact very adversely and that the government's compensation measures will not be adequate. It is worth pointing out that the Democrats went to the Australian people with a non-negotiable set of changes to the government's GST proposals. Looking at what they have achieved in this bill, we can see that they have achieved none of those changes at all. First, in relation to the diesel fuel rebate, they said that it would be payable only to trucks over 20 tonnes, except for those carrying farm produce. In the end, they gave it to all trucks over 4.5 tonnes.
Second, they said that they would not allow trips within cities to qualify for the grant. But when you see what they have ended up with, there is no apportionment at all for diesel used in the city. As long as a journey crosses a city boundary, wherever it is, then all the journey qualifies for a grant, even if the overwhelming proportion of the journey is within a capital city. So journeys commencing outside a metropolitan area but ending up in a metropolitan area and journeys commencing in a metropolitan area but ending up outside a metropolitan area will all qualify for a grant for the complete journey. What we will now see is the redesign of intracity transport routes to ensure that they briefly leave the metropolitan area in order to qualify for the rebate. Worse still, since there will be no way to ensure the integrity of the scheme, there will be claims based on fictitious routes which 
 involve a brief time outside the city. This will not discourage fossil fuel use; it will encourage fossil fuel use. No wonder the Democrats' expert environmental consultant, Dr Clive Hamilton, resigned in despair when he understood where the deal was going. These changes are, I think, a massive invitation for tax avoidance.
We can see from this legislation before the Senate that the Democrats have been absolutely naive in their negotiations with the government and have been played on a break. They have in fact achieved a system where a lot of the diesel fuel used in cities will qualify for the grant system. That is a most unsatisfactory situation, as is the situation where we do not have an indication of the boundaries for the metropolitan areas. We have the prospect of a plethora of anomalies and unfair outcomes depending on whether, in the Melbourne context for example, you describe Whittlesea or Werribee or Craigieburn or Kilmore or Seymour or somewhere else as being part of the urban area or part of the rural areas. We regard this as a very unsatisfactory situation.
We certainly do not think that what the government has put forward, with the support of the Democrats, in Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999  will address those problems. Having said that, as I indicated before, we are not proposing to oppose these measures. We note that there is some $60 million of expenditure for each of the four years in relation to the book industry assistance plan, and some $15 million of expenditure for each of the four years concerning supported accommodation assistance. We also note that the environmental measures are said to involve expenditure of $214 million in the first year, $222 million in the second year, $227 million in the third year and $233 million in the fourth year. On that basis we will be supporting these measures. But we certainly put the government on notice that we do not think that the measures are adequate to address the adverse effects that its GST package will cause in the area of books, in the area of housing and accommodation and in the area of environment protection. 
We will be monitoring very closely the impact of this legislation, as well as the impact of the government's GST proposals more broadly, as we proceed towards implementation. I will conclude on this point, Mr Acting Deputy President—it is nice to see you in the chair.
—Thank you, Senator Cook.
—It is obvious that the Democrats have once again been dudded. That great negotiator Senator Lees has, after a cup of tea and a biscuit, sold out the book industry, book consumers and the environment. But we know what the Democrats do support. They support a $10 million tax break for casino high rollers that goes straight into the pockets of the likes of Lloyd Williams and Ron Walker. Only last week we had Senator Allison crying crocodile tears over the evils of gambling. But when the going got tough she and her four colleagues got going. We now know about the infamous chicken run straight out the Senate doors, thus ensuring that the government's $10 million casino handout got up.
We also have heard in recent weeks in the chamber allegations about Democrat concern for youth wages. Indeed, they launched a motion in this chamber against the Australian Labor Party on that subject. Their arguments on that occasion were symbolic in their significance. A huge number of unpaid or low paid workers are found among the young. The imposition of a 10 per cent GST on almost everything young workers buy and almost every service they consume will impose on them higher material costs than anything the Democrats could ever have stood up for in their resolution on youth wages. That resolution was, as I said, symbolic. The net effect of the real impact of costs on young workers is that they will be worse off as a result of the Democrats, as a party, breaking their electoral commitment, not keeping themselves honest and ensuring that in this chamber we gave assent to a package of tax measures which impose a GST tax on Australia. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-29,"—I want to address the Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and particularly the book industry appropriations. This bill allocates $240 million to assist the Australian book industry to cope with the GST, and there is a further $60 million in extra funding for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program.
I have to say that the Democrats would have preferred that books were GST free, and we will continue to lobby for that position whenever the opportunity arises. But the government could not be brought to agree to that position. Rather than risk the substantial benefits which we had won on the social and environmental side of the tax package and the modest economic benefits flowing from tax reform, we agreed to support the package with an agreement on a compensation package for books.
The composition of the books industry assistance package has been agreed now between the government and the Democrats—just last month, in fact. The key measure was $117 million to provide an eight per cent subsidy on books for students. This scheme will be run through book stores and will provide a subsidy that is twice the Treasury estimate of the likely impact of the GST on textbooks. It represents an overall cost reduction for students. This is important, as research from Canada showed that the educational books sector was the most price sensitive to the GST.
The second measure is $48 million for an innovation, infrastructure and development fund and a skills development program to improve the competitiveness of the Australian printing industry. It provides a level of grants that is equivalent to the level of the former Labor books bounty scheme. The third measure is $38 million to establish the education lending right for Australian authors. This measure has been long sought after by the Australian Society of Authors and will provide royalties or compensation to authors for the use of their books held in Australian educational libraries. As the Senate will be aware, there is a similar scheme in place for public lending institutions. This extends that 
 program to libraries which are in schools and universities and so on.
The fourth measure is $28 million in grants to primary schools to increase their holdings of Australian books—that is, books which have been authored and published in Australia. This measure will boost the sale of Australian children's books and provide a great boost to child literacy by providing a wider range of books in school libraries. The fifth measure is an $8 million sum for books marketing initiatives to promote reading and literacy—this scheme has also been used successfully by the Blair government; it was called the Books Day marketing program, and it boosted book sales and interest in reading considerably in the United Kingdom—a scheme which has been promoted strongly by the Australian Booksellers Association. The final measure is $1.2 million to improve the collection by the Australian Bureau of Statistics of statistics on Australian publishing performance.
In summary, I think it is fair to say that we have achieved a good outcome. It is not perfect but, in terms of minimising the impact of the GST on literacy, learning and literature, we have developed a good plan. I wish to thank not just the government but the representatives of the Australian Publishers Association, in particular, the Australian Society of Authors, the Australian Booksellers Association and the Printing Industry Association, for their assistance in helping to get us to this point.
As a result of this package, around 40 per cent of all books sold to schools, colleges or businesses will be tax free, and the 16 per cent sold to students will receive an eight per cent rebate. So 56 per cent of books will be cheaper than they currently are. The direct grants to schools represent a five per cent increase in sales of children's books, so the negative effect on a further nine per cent of books has been reduced. That is a total of 65 per cent of book segments not adversely affected by the GST. The remaining 35 per cent will benefit from the book marketing initiative—which, as I said earlier, was very effective in the UK—and cheaper Australian printing costs. In short, whilst we might not 
 have got GST-free books, the consolation prize goes pretty close to achieving our original objective of promoting learning, literacy and literature that underpinned our call for GST-free books.
Finally, I want to deal with the $60 million of extra funding for supported accommodation won by the Democrats. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Program provides services to some of the most disadvantaged people in our society. People who benefit from SAAP services include homeless youth, women who are fleeing from abusive relationships and those who have lost their homes and other assets due to serious gambling problems, for instance. SAAP services provide a pathway out of homelessness for people who find themselves with no-one else to turn to. Sadly, the need for SAAP services has been increasing in recent years. However, SAAP funding has not increased in line with this growth in demand. This has resulted in SAAP services having to turn away people who are in urgent need of accommodation, people whose only other alternative is to go back to their abusive situation at home or to expose themselves to the dangers of living on the streets.
That is why the Democrats insisted on this $60 million increase in SAAP funding, which will significantly assist SAAP in meeting the growing demand for its services. I understand that it is the largest single increase in funding since SAAP began, and I hope that it reflects a new commitment on the part of the government to fully fund and support this important program.
The Democrats have also won a seven per cent increase in rent assistance payments and the exclusion of compensation from the formula for calculating public housing rents. These two measures combined are worth about $100 million a year. We have also insisted on $50 million of GST concessions for credit unions and mortgage providers to ensure that they remain competitive in the home mortgage market against the banks. That is on top of the $800 million first home owners grants scheme, which provides a $7,000 cash grant to first home buyers.
We are continuing to pursue the issue of the GST application to not-for-profit housing organisations through the charities committee which we have assisted in establishing within the Taxation Office, particularly focusing on the definition of non-commercial suppliers of residential accommodation by charities. The 50 per cent of cost rule is far too low and needs to be raised. These measures combined will alleviate much of the impact of the GST on the housing sector, particularly for low income earners and for first home buyers.
In conclusion, the  Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and the  Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999  are an important down payment on spreading the benefits of tax reform. They ensure that the environment, learning and low income earners are all clear winners from the tax package. We believe we have achieved that, and we are pleased to support these two bills.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-09-29,"—And now we come to the pay off. Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999  does not merely appropriate supplementary measures. It represents the crumbs that fell off the table when the Democrats were conned by the government to pass the goods and services tax package. It represents very much the Democrats switching constituency priorities and ditching the environmental movement for small business. It is not just a one-off; this deal has taken the Australian Democrats down a road which has meant almost a monogamous relationship with the government when it comes to doing deals in this place.
Time and time again, since the GST arrangement made between the Democrats and the government, we have seen the Democrats come in here—from time to time for some reasons but, quite often, without excuse or reason—and ditch long held positions protecting environmental issues, protecting the disabled, protecting long striven for and long fought for rights. We have a new coalition in this parliament. It is not a coalition between the Nationals and the Liberals, it is a three-way coalition—a tripartite arrangement. We will remind the public, day after day, once 
 they have to suffer the goods and services tax, that it is not just a Costello tax package, not just a Howard tax package, but a Howard-Lees tax package and a Costello-Allison tax package. We will remind them of that.
Senator Allison may sit there shaking her head but the reality is that those long cherished constituencies of yours do not understand what you are doing. They cannot understand what you are doing and they do not like what you are doing. They do not like at all the fact that you have passed into law an unfair tax, a goods and services tax, a tax that will apply not just to the things people expected but to so many other areas of services and goods that people were not expecting at the time this package went through. We will make sure that the public see this tax as the product—Senator Allison is leaving the chamber now, as the Democrats always do when they do not like being argued with—of a deal between Howard, Costello, Lees, Allison and Murray, and we will remind them of it.
There is no doubt that we are talking about an unfair tax but also, in this package, a bribe to try to buy off environmental concerns in our community. That is all it was; the Democrats were trying to con their constituency. To ensure that the constituency was conned, they have come up with this token trade-off against the diesel fuel rebate. This rebate, which is a huge subsidy, encourages greater use of fossil fuels which will directly increase our levels of greenhouse emissions, and impact on human health and the environment. It is not just the Labor Party that says that: time after time, day after day, Senator Allison, in a committee she chaired, made those points about the diesel fuel rebate. She made points sincerely to those witnesses who were before her, witnesses that she in fact orchestrated, in some instances, to come before the committee to give evidence. But, with one flick of a switch, with one push from Senator Murray, senators Allison, Bartlett, Stott Despoja and Woodley—the whole lot of them—were rolled in this quite historic shift of priorities for the Australian Democrats.
Even when you analyse the package before us, you can see that not only were the Demo 
 crats conned to support the goods and services tax but also the government has in effect pulled the wool over the Democrats' eyes on the so-called environmental GST package. It is becoming clear that what we have here is not just a package with an environmental objective but a package which does not in its essence, in its fundamentals, have spelt out the specific objectives. We have here bad public policy. We have here allocation of funds which are not being well directed nor well thought out.
In relation to the $400 million Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, the Australian Greenhouse Office has written to environmental groups and other organisations asking not for submissions under program headings, under particular objectives, but for ideas on how to spend the money. This is a reversal of the normal process. It is a debunking of the normal process. The usual process is that you develop the programs and the objectives and then seek ideas and submissions in accordance with those objectives. But what you have here is the government and the Democrats coming up with a token figure—and it is a token figure when you compare it with the enormous amount of subsidy going to the diesel fuel rebate—and then screaming out across the country for ideas about how to spend it.
I am sure the Auditor-General, at the appropriate time, will take an interest in the way that moneys are being allocated with respect to this deal. As I said, usually you have detailed proposals developed, then budgets allocated for programs and then submissions put in to fit in with those program objectives. What we have here is a concern, which will increase as this program develops, in the parliament that we do not have much confidence that the money will be well spent, that the taxpayer will get value for money or that the money will be properly accounted for.
We have a precedent in the environmental area under this government which gives us concern that this program will go the way of the National Heritage Trust. We are concerned that there is a lack of outcomes, that the objectives for which that trust was set up 
 are not being realised. Decisions are continually being made by the minister, over and above local committees and a more national structure. Basically, there is a distortion of the objectives of that trust and a lack of outcomes with respect to those objectives.
We are concerned that the money for this program will also be frittered away through a lack of any strategic plan or any genuine attempt by the government to address the greenhouse issue. The public must be concerned to have details as to how this money will be spent, how it will be allocated and who will make those decisions. Which departments will be administering each of the amounts appropriated? Will the Australian Greenhouse Office have a decision making role? If it does, for how much of the allocated funds will it be able to make decisions? Will any of this money be used on vegetation initiatives, initiatives that would effectively assist farmers rather than address a reduction in greenhouse emissions?
At this particular stage of this debate, we also see a greenhouse policy which in many ways is exposed as being in shambles. It has been exposed this week as being in shambles, and this government has been exposed as a government with no strategy or clearly identified priorities when we consider the Australian greenhouse inventory, which was released only in the last week. This inventory shows an 11 per cent increase in emissions between 1990 and 1997, excluding land use clearing. We are, therefore, nowhere near meeting our 108 per cent Kyoto target. There is no doubt now that, despite the government's massive allocation of funds in the Natural Heritage Trust and despite rhetoric and commitments from Senator Hill, our objectives with respect to the Kyoto target are not being met—in fact, we are going in the wrong direction.
These bills show the Democrats' naivety in negotiating with the government. As I said earlier, it is not a one-off; it is becoming consistent. I see Senator Brown is in the chamber and he, I am sure, has other points to make with respect to both the naivety and the sell-out nature of this deal. It is becoming more and more apparent that the Australian Democrats entered into their GST package 
 deal with the government with reckless indifference to its environmental impact. One could not be more generous to them than to argue that there was reckless indifference.
The more we look into this issue, the more evidence we find that the Democrats have been dudded by the government. They have agreed to a massive taxpayer funded price cut for diesel and they have got, as I say, this sort of package in return. They listed the environmental benefits at the time of the announcement of the package. They made great noise, great clamour, about how they were acting to protect the environment. They argued that they achieved tighter standards on emission controls, but we have now found out—as we found out then, and we are finding out more—that those controls, despite being presented as a breakthrough, were already being developed.
Much of what the government and the Democrats have agreed to was already in the pipeline. The moves, for instance, to phase in tighter standards to clean up dirty diesel engines that were announced as part of the agreement were already agreed to by the Commonwealth, states and even industry. The Democrats then talked about the abolition of the diesel fuel rebate as being a major gain for the environment, yet it has not been abolished.
The Prime Minister promised the Leader of the Democrats that the government would look at applying a greenhouse trigger within the government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill in relation to new projects that would be major emitters of greenhouse gases. Debate continued on the bill. A trigger was proposed by the opposition, supported by Senator Brown and rejected by the Australian Democrats. It was rejected on the basis that the Prime Minister promised that the government would look at a trigger in the context of that legislation. Twenty-four hours passed—maybe not even that—and the minister for environment then admitted that this trigger may be achieved by regulation but `only following consultation with the states, and only then if all the states agreed'. Within that same period, we had a message very 
 clear and direct from Premier Court in Western Australia that his state would not agree.
So the trigger will not be realised. The preconditions to achieving the trigger cannot be met—state Premier Court has made sure of that. That trigger will not be realised. The diesel fuel rebate has not been abolished, and the tighter emission standards that were being crowed about were going to take place in any event. In some respects, those standards have been brought forward from the timetable that was being talked about between government, industry and the states but, in some other respects, the timetable agreed to by the Democrats has been deferred.
So basically we have a deal done by the Australian Democrats to pass the GST, and three of the four achievements—tighter standards of emission controls, a diesel fuel rebate and a greenhouse trigger—are no more than a sham. With respect to the package for greenhouse emissions, we see a program that really has no structure, a program whose objectives are not being set and a program which will probably go down the road of the Natural Heritage Trust in not achieving what needs to be achieved.
These are just some examples of how the Democrats were dudded in this particular package, and this is the package reflected in this legislation. Since that day, we have seen a cementing of the relationship, a closing of the ranks, between the government and the Australian Democrats. The Democrats claim that they have not lost interest in their prior constituencies, but Senator Murray gave the whole show away on the Sunday program just a few weeks ago when he made it very clear that they had to move from one constituency to another and that the preferred constituency was in fact the business constituency. That is a bit of a shock to Democrat supporters.
It was interesting this morning that Newspoll showed concern for the environment as one of the important issues in the Australian public—I think it ranked third or fourth as an issue of concern. That poll was analysed in terms of who can be trusted with the environment and, when it came to the Australian Democrats, the letters `NA' appeared. Basically, Senator Brown, I think they have 
 vacated that left of centre environmental field and left it to you totally and exclusively, and their supporters have come to that realisation and conclusion as well. In speaking on these bills, I indicate to the Senate that they represent a package that will deserve and get greater scrutiny from this parliament as it is implemented—scrutiny through the estimates process and scrutiny through other forums of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-29,"—I want to concur with the speech Senator Bolkus has just given on the Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and the Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999 . This legislation is providing taxpayers' money for certain purposes, including the book subsidy deal which comes nowhere near meeting the Democrats' commitment that a GST would not be placed on books. A wide range of other financial arrangements are also coming out of the government's deal on the GST, which went through this place with the support of the Democrats to give us the Democrats-government GST package.
Firstly, on the books, it is important for those out there who believe it is a good result to be getting a subsidy from the government for the promotion of book sales and production in this country to realise that it only goes for four years for starters. Once the GST is in, that goes on forever. This is neatly tailored to give those people concerned in the book industry some succour through until after the next elections, and the Democrats bought that.
But the book industry will now have to depend on future governments for future subsidies. History ought to tell everybody in that industry that they are not going to have their wishes met further down the line, with competing interests being as they are. By abandoning the ironclad commitment to protecting books from the GST, the Democrats sold out that industry, education and the importance of the purveying of information in Australia by Australians to Australians. There will be no recovery from the economic impact of the GST as we go down the line. In fact, I predict things will get much worse as the subsidies are racked back in the future— 
particularly by governments who are not part of the current deal being made by the Democrats.
The Democrats are currently absent from the chamber, and I am sorry about that because one issue I want to concentrate on in the minutes available to me is the one Senator Bolkus referred to—that is, the environmental consequences of the package that the Democrats signed. In Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2), there is provision for certain remedial actions to be taken under the Lees-Howard deal, the Democrats-government deal, to push along some matters which will be seen to be helping the environment. Let me say at the outset that they go no way to redressing the environmental negatives of the GST package—in particular, the massive rebate, and therefore stimulus, to the burning of fossil fuels in this country, the so-called diesel fuel rebate.
Let us look at that for a moment. Estimates by ministers have been that the mining industry alone will benefit to the tune of more than $2 billion per annum. This is a massive sum. Listening to the radio this morning, I noted the warning to taxpayers and service providers in Australia that the nation, which has currently embarked on a massive effort to establish and structure East Timor, may be out of pocket for that help to our neighbour to the tune of somewhere between $500 million and $2 billion per annum. The comment is that the nation is going to have to find that money through new taxes or through cutting services, and those services include education, health, social welfare and hospitals—the whole range of services which Australian citizens depend upon. That is a pretty bleak prospect in an era in which government spending has already been cut.
But here we have a measure—the Democrats-government GST package—which hands $2 billion a year to the mining industry, the mining mates. That may sound like a trite term, but it is not. The mining industry has got this largesse from the Howard government and the Senator Meg Lees-led Democrats through the package we are incidentally dealing with here. It is a massive amount of taxpayers' money.
The estimate of $2 billion per annum going to the mining corporations is a conservative one. It is enough to pay for the maximum currently planned operations in East Timor but, with the passage of this legislation, we close the option of leaving the mining corporations with pre-existing taxation set-ups, the cost of diesel and inputs. They have been able to deal with that and make good profits.
Here we are asked by the Democrats to hand across to the mining corporations $2 billion per annum—well, we are not asked; we are being told that that is what we are going to have to fund. I am sure we are going to hear from the same people a lot in the coming years as we debate in this place how we are able to fund our peacekeeping operation in East Timor, let alone government measures coming down the line as a result of that operation to cut services to Australians. Those services are going to be cut because of the Democrats' compliance with the government's GST package. If that package did not include its attendant huge largesse to the mining corporations through the diesel fuel rebate, if that package had been trimmed to a GST package leaving out that rebate—that bag of goods to the big corporate sector—we would not be looking at massive cuts down the line in education, health and general service deliveries or, alternatively, increased taxation.
When we are talking about increased taxation here, we are not talking about increased taxation to the corporate sector. As we know, that sector is about to get a tax cut. It will get it because it is supported, I would presume, by the new players at the government table—the Democrats. If we look a little further into this, we see that there are measures in the second bill to cut back greenhouse gas emissions—a series of measures which are designed to aid the environment. I would ask the Democrat spokespeople to give to this chamber an estimate of the impact on the environment of their own GST package, particularly this massive subsidy to the burning of fossil fuels in this country.
I have just come from the National Youth Round Table, a presentation by young people in Australia—clear thinking futurists—which 
 is being held in the main committee room of this parliament. They have spoken about the demoralisation of young Australians, because they do not believe that those in power—that includes this government—are taking the environment seriously. How much more demoralising it must be for them when a party that has claimed for the last 20 years to have been at least light green becomes part of the problem. That is what has happened with the Democrats. I do not make this assessment of their role lightly, because it has tipped the balance in this country very heavily against the environment, with an anti-environmental government in office at a time when young Australians consistently show the environment to be at the top of their concerns. Their concerns are not only being ignored but are being uncleverly left out, because the government and now the Democrats are not giving the environment the priority that it deserves. It is their future that we are dealing with here.
When it comes to global warming, there is a growing sense of despair amongst young Australians and young people right around the world. This issue is being left on the sideboard. Senator Hill, our minister for the environment, went to Kyoto and signed off on Australia increasing pollution as far as global warming gases are concerned by eight per cent from the 1990 levels to 2010. The estimate of the people on the youth forum is that that target has already been overdone; there has been a nine per cent increase in global gas emissions already on 2010 figures, and there is no evidence of any national plan—this would require laws that have teeth in them—to implement the Kyoto target. The issue becomes all the more concerning when the scientific literature, written by people who have been thinking about the global warming issue for decades now, says that it is not a consistent output of global warming gases as of 1990 levels that is required, let alone an eight per cent increase; a 50 per cent plus decrease on 1990 levels is required if we are going to come anywhere near to achieving a sustainable environment. The figures keep coming in and keep being ignored.
It is interesting that in my home state of Tasmania, where we can expect there to be 16 
 winter days each year when the temperature does not reach 10 degrees, this year there were just four such days. That is not a one-off statistical aberration. As everybody listening to this debate knows, year after year, we are notching up world record high average temperatures—not just in our region but right around the globe. Since human recordings of weather began, at least 10 of the hottest years have occurred since 1979, last year being the hottest on record and this year looking very likely to overtake that.
As legislators we have a responsibility where we see unfolding a process which is enormously damaging not just to the environment but to the economic prospects of people around the globe in the future. The youth round table this morning, using very conservative figures, said that in the next century 20 million people will lose their places of living due to rising sea waters. That is an extraordinarily conservative figure. When we see this unfolding into the future, into the lifetimes of our present Australian young people, and we have before us in this Senate legislation which actually adds fuel to the fire, we can understand why young Australians get disillusioned.
You cannot bring tax legislation, appropriation legislation, into this place without debating the environment. Giving some dollars to programs like those that have been announced here in the second reading speech for the second bill pales into insignificance when you look at the diesel fuel rebate going to miners and others. It shows how short of the mark the government and the Democrats are in facing up to their responsibilities to meet the environmental concerns of young Australians who seem, on the whole, to have a lot better sense of the future with regard to the environment.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-09-29,"—I continue today a series of speeches I have been making on regional development in Australia and the key theme of these speeches is related to the role of government and, in particular, the need to shift from being a doer and a director to being a `change leader'. What we need very much for effective regional development in this country is to have an approach very much in line with what McKinsey suggested in his 1994 report on regional development—that is, a bottom up approach where government encourages leadership that is vital for regions and business at the local level.
The region of Australia that best exemplifies this is the Hunter region. This is a very historic week for the Hunter as it stands at the crossroads of its development with BHP, the major steel producer, shutting down steel smelting. Historically, BHP has been synonymous with Newcastle. So is the end of BHP the end of Newcastle? Is massive government assistance needed? If what is happening now happened back in the 1960s, then the answer to both these questions would be yes. But at the edge of the new millennium, Newcastle and the Hunter region are very different from what they were in the 1960s. The Hunter has a very bright future but it does need to shift gears. Government does have a role as a change leader, and the Hunter is a case study on how government's role in this process should be carried out.
First, let us put the problem in some perspective because there have been some wild figures thrown around about the scale of this problem. It is a big problem but it is not an insurmountable problem. The Hunter has a population of over 500,000 people, which is three per cent of the Australian population. But we certainly pull our weight in the Hunter, with that three per cent of the Australian population producing five per cent of the GDP. It is an economy larger than Tasmania's. The biggest employer in the Hunter—and this might surprise a lot of people—is the Hunter Area Health Service: the health industry is the biggest industry. The second biggest employer is the University of 
 Newcastle with over 14,000 students and over 3,000 staff. The third biggest employer is BHP—until tomorrow—which employs less than 3,000 people.
One per cent of the Hunter work force is employed by BHP and tomorrow 2,100 jobs will go in steel smelting. This is the filthy end of the steel making process—those jobs go tomorrow. But there will be no change in the product that comes out the gate. People are under the misapprehension that steel making is ceasing completely in Newcastle. That is not the case. Steel smelting is ceasing in Newcastle. The billets from Whyalla are being railed to Newcastle and the rolling operations, the rod and bar mill and the new wire mill, which employ over 1,000 people, will continue.
BHP have introduced world best practice in downsizing by case managing all 2,100 people who are going from steel smelting. They have set up a job employment centre and they have linked this to Centrelink. They have set up a transition committee to manage this downsize and they have created a Job Pathways Program. On these pathways, workers have been streamed into five different directions: the first path is internal redeployment within BHP; the second path is moving on to other businesses; the third path is starting their own business; the fourth path is further education and training; and the fifth path is retirement.
On BHP's estimates—and I was out there two weeks ago talking to senior management and their transition and employment people—900 people in the work force at BHP's plant who will lose their jobs have not yet worked out their future. BHP's estimate is that 300 of the 900 will probably find jobs. So the scale of the problem—and this is the important thing to get in our minds—is that 600 people will have difficulty finding employment.
In addition to the direct work force, there is also a subcontracted work force. There have been some wild figures thrown around about this, and I want to publicly correct particularly the ABC who, on their national TV two nights ago, said that 2,000 subcontractors were going to lose work. This is wrong. Even the local figures show that this 
 is a wild exaggeration. The University of Newcastle has done a modelling study which shows that probably 900 subcontractors are going to be affected. But this was modelling; it was not a count of actual people. So that is also probably an exaggeration.
But even assuming it is right, most of the subcontracted work is done by very large companies. Most of the subcontracting is done by groups like Brambles, Transfield and ABB. These are very big companies who have a variety of contracts and whose work force moves up and down over time: they move people internally across the organisation depending upon where the work is. They have seen this coming for 2½ years when BHP announced this, and they have made their adjustments.
Another group that will be affected are the small subcontractors, people who rely totally or almost exclusively on BHP at Newcastle for their work. Minister Abbott, the Minister for Employment Services, has identified all these firms—there are 25 of them. They employ, on average, four people. Therefore, that brings the total to 100. So the scale of the problem is: 600 jobs at the plant and 100 subcontractors—a total of 700. To put this in perspective, that figure of 700 is about what the Hunter economy generates in new jobs in a good month.
BHP, to their great credit, gave everyone a lot of notice of what was going to happen 2½ years ago. At that time, the Prime Minister came to Newcastle. He has returned three times since. That is a record for any Prime Minister of this country. I think it is more visits than all the other prime ministers put together.
—No black tie dinners for John Moore.
—It was a sign of maturity, Senator, of the work force in Newcastle that, at that time, there was not one placard and not one demonstration.
—They'd given up.
—No, they had not, Senator. They had a very mature reaction, much more mature than yours at the moment, to this event. They realised that the city 
 needed a cooperative arrangement with the federal government to bring about this change in a cooperative way. The Prime Minister set up a structural adjustment package of $10 million and established the Prime Minister's task force. He took a personal interest in this downsize. There are no politicians on this task force. It is all local community and business leaders. The Prime Minister has returned three times to meet personally with that task force—of course, he has had his ministers meet more often with them—and he always has his meetings in the boardroom of the Ironworkers Centre.
The Prime Minister has been in the region listening directly to the leaders of the community, which include the head of the Ironworkers Union, the head of the Hunter Business Chamber, the Bishop of Newcastle and a range of other concerned people operating in the area of welfare. They have also given us advice on the Hunter structural adjustment package. It is this package that we have been rolling out over 1999 in particular. The key projects that have been funded are basically infrastructure projects. We see the role of government in this sort of exercise as one of providing the basic infrastructure from which private enterprise can generate a range of new jobs. Each project has been assessed carefully in terms of the jobs it will create directly and indirectly.
For example, the Maitland transport hub was funded by the government to the tune of $1½ million. Already, Daimler/Chrysler, the old Mercedes Benz company, has set up its trucking operation in the area. It is going to become a centre for trucking in the whole of Australia with trucks being brought directly in from overseas. Blue Ribbon Coaches have also put their business there. There are a whole set of other related industries who service buses and trucks. That means new business for the Hunter Valley area.
Another example is the Hunter water pipeline. It is quite amazing, given that this is an area that produces the best wines in Australia, that it has not had a secure water supply in its 130 years of grape production. We have now provided that by seeding the funding for pumping stations. The rest of the 
 $10 million has been borrowed commercially. That will deliver a secure water supply to the Hunter, increase the yields in the vineyards and create more vineyards. Wineries will be created. Other tourist industries will then flow on, such as resorts, accommodation and restaurants. For the $1½ billion worth of projects already approved in the Lower Hunter Valley for this sort of thing, the secure water pipeline is the key bit of infrastructure which will give it the boost.
Another example is the Hunter Call Centre. With the new information age technology, call centres are one of the big developing industries of the information age. The Hunter Call Centre, which we have funded with $2.5 million, will add to the critical mass of call centres which already exists in the Hunter. That gives a new direction for Hunter business. Yet another example is the Hunter Stock Exchange. We have the opportunity with $600,000 of seeding funding to create a second board which will make it easier for businesses to set up a new business in the Hunter without the high charges of the Sydney Stock Exchange. We will be able to accumulate small amounts of capital and provide support for smaller businesses than those which usually list on the Sydney Stock Exchange. It will become the hub of regional finance not only in the Hunter but also right across the country as it will be the only regional board getting up and running in Australia.
 One of the big developing industries in the Hunter relates to air travel and aerospace industries. Yet another example is the $1½ million we have given for the Hunter regional airport. We have extended the terminal and the runway aprons and provided the necessary infrastructure to lead to the next boost in air travel. Usage at that airport has doubled in the last seven years. It is set to take off again. We have also given $1 million to business incubator projects like the Cycleway project at Lake Macquarie to again seed infrastructure which will then fund small business, and that of course is the hope of the future for the Hunter.
Over the next few weeks we will be announcing the rest of the projects which are 
 being rolled out under the Hunter structural adjustment package. All up, they are expected to generate 1,000 direct jobs and 4,000 indirect jobs. This is targeted assistance for the region—essential infrastructure that small business can build on and prosper from. It is an excellent example of government acting as a change leader and setting the stage for regional leaders and regional businesses to allow the Hunter economy to grow in new and diverse ways. No longer will the Hunter be so dependent on iron and steel. As well as the vineyards and resorts and related tourist industries, the Hunter has a very high-tech future with the development of the call centre, the development of the stock exchange and the growth of the high-tech aerospace cluster at Williamtown.
There are also exciting proposals in the Steel River project. This is BHP's legacy to Newcastle where they have taken old industrial land and redeveloped it, not for standard smokestack industry but for new high-tech information industries. Already the CSIRO have committed to moving a site to the region which will develop alternate energy resources. The university proposes to build a high-tech business incubator, turning the university's leading edge research into medical biotechnology, engineering and information technology business products. As the world moves from the smokestack age to the information age, and the biotechnology age beyond that, the Hunter will be one of the regions leading this change.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Regional Development: Hunter Region</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1

Additional Response to Questions by Senator Sue West
Senate Hansard  p 8122, 1 September 1999.
In relation to the table on page 3 of Child Care in Australia , it is true that prior to 1997 a number of community places were counted as non-profit places on the grounds that they did not attract operational subsidy.
When community centres had the operational subsidy removed from July 1997 it was more appropriate to record places within the services where they were provided—this small group of non-profit places was therefore included with places in community based centres. 

These places have always been counted in the total number of places. It is irrelevant to families accessing care how they were counted as it is the total number of places available which is important.
These numbers with a similar footnote were included in the Department of Health and Family Services Annual Report for 1997-98 (table 19, page 138).
The publication Child Care in Australia  was compiled by the Department of Family and Community Services with the aim of providing trend information against the Childcare Program objectives of affordability, access and quality. As is usual practice the final draft was forwarded to my office for clearance. There has been no attempt to `fudge the figures'—as indicated above, the figures relating to community places had already been published in a previous Annual Report.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child Care: Community Based Centres</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-29,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely, a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 309.
Madam Deputy President, I did not hear where the objection came from.
—It came from me.
—I think it is very unfortunate that this motion, which has been before the Senate for some time now, has received an objection. I will pursue the proper avenue now for us to debate the motion because it is an important one. Let me read the motion so that the Senate is very clear on what it involves. The motion states:
That the Senate—
(a)	 welcomes the progress made by the United Nations (UN) and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Western Sahara, through the organisation of a free and fair referendum to enable its people to exercise their right to self-determination, in July 2000;
(b)	 calls on Morocco—
which, by the way, invaded Western Sahara and took the country by force when the power of General Franco of Spain was waning two decades ago—
	 to abide by the UN-OAU peace plan and to fully cooperate with these organisations in their efforts to organise the referendum; and
(c)	 urges the Australian Government:
		 (i)	 to extend all due assistance to the UN mission in Western Sahara, and 

		 (ii)	 to establish official contacts with representatives of Polisario, the movement representing the people of Western Sahara.
Labor has blocked formality, and let me tell those people listening that that will ultimately mean this motion gets blocked as far as today is concerned. Those people listening will notice that all the other motions will be likely to receive formality, come to a vote and therefore be accepted or rejected—but not this one.
Labor is likely to get up and say that that is because this is a matter of foreign affairs where there may be some contention. But let me say that Labour parties elsewhere, particularly in Europe, have no trouble with this matter. The Blair government, for example, has consistently supported motions just like this, and right across the community of European nations not only is there support for motions like this—including those motions that have gone through the European parliament in Strasbourg—but also great assistance has been given to Polisario, the group representing the democratic aspirations of Western Sahara. This has also been the case for North America.
Because Western Sahara is on the other side of the world, we do not hear so much about it here in Australia, but the situation of the Western Saharans is very similar to that of the East Timorese. Their country was taken over by an armed invasion by Morocco when, as a former Spanish colony, the Spaniards withdrew—in much the same way as the Portuguese withdrew from East Timor. Since that violent takeover by Morocco, 100,000 Western Saharans have died. Moreover, the Moroccan military have built the world's modern `great wall', including ribbon wire and cement emplacements for thousands of kilometres across the Western Sahara, to divide the country as a so-called defensive tactic. A very cruel regime has been imposed on the people of Western Sahara.
Now we have the situation where the United Nations, together with the Organisation of African Unity, have set up the process for an act of self-determination in Western Sahara in July next year. There has been 
 world support for this, but here we are in the Senate and I cannot even get this matter brought to a vote. So where is the objection? This is too important a matter for Labor simply to say that it is another foreign affairs matter. They had a motion before the Senate last week which was clearly a matter of foreign affairs. Nobody else in this place had difficulty with that. Labor is aware of motions like this which have gone through parliaments right around the rest of world. But here in the Senate, because of an internal minute or a process which has been clamped on the Senate by a party which stands for democratic principles, this motion has been blocked today. I only wish that Senator O'Brien had informed me that this was going to happen.
—I made the comment at the whips meeting. Did you send someone there?
—He is ducking that because he did not inform me. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>UNITED NATIONS REFERENDUM: WESTERN SAHARA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-09-29,"—The government opposes the suspension. I heard Senator O'Brien—who can certainly speak for himself on these matters—say that the opposition's position on this was put at the whips meeting. Regardless of that, I do not think it is fair for Senator Brown to say that Senator O'Brien is ducking the issue. There are formal methods by which the parliament can be made to work and by which communication can be had between all parties in the Senate, and Senator O'Brien used those to communicate that position. We try as far as possible to use those forums as well; the whips meeting is the most regular one of those.
A point that I think should be made is that Senator Brown's motion for the most part is unobjectionable. In part (a) it `welcomes the progress made by the United Nations', then in part (b) it `calls on Morocco to abide by the UN-OAU peace plan and to fully cooperate with these organisations'—again, totally unobjectionable to the government. It urges the Australian government, in part (c)(i), `to extend all due assistance to the UN mission 
 in the Western Sahara'. Again, Senator Brown will probably be aware that Australia provided a contingent to that peacekeeping force in its earlier stages, as requested. The assistance to that force in the Western Sahara was specifically 45 signallers; they were withdrawn back in May 1994. But that Australian withdrawal in no way indicates any diminishing of Australian support for the UN operation. In fact, we have been a vigorous supporter of that operation and, as Senator Brown said in his proposal to suspend standing orders, Australian support for the referendum next year is well known.
The point I come to here is that, if Senator Brown had done what most senators do around this place—that is, to consult and discuss in relation to these motions and seek to find a consensus—there is little doubt that this motion could have gone through with unanimous support and probably could have assisted with the peace efforts in that region. The government is opposed to the motion really because of part (c)(ii). That goes against the foreign policy of this government and, as I understand it, the foreign policy pursued by most governments—that is, that the government recognises states, not governments, and that creating formal contact with the Polisario would therefore be inappropriate.
But we are hopeful that, with a range of developments in the region, peace can come there and that UN efforts will be successful. Senator Brown's motion certainly does not reflect the government's views because of the inclusion of (c)(ii), and we do not support the suspension.",SENATE,<title>UNITED NATIONS REFERENDUM: WESTERN SAHARA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-09-29,"—In relation to the proposal to suspend, I am reminded that on several occasions I have stood in this place to advise Senator Brown that, where a motion relating to foreign affairs does not have unanimous support, and certainly if it is not a simple proposition, the Labor Party will not simply support a motion going to a vote without debate. Consistent with that view, Senator Brown's request for formality today was denied by me on behalf of the Labor Party.
Having said that, my advice on this matter is that, having been advised of an amendment 
 to the original unacceptable motion, we can now support the motion. We are prepared to support the suspension on that basis so that our position and the position of all senators can be put in relation to this matter.
But let me say that it is not appropriate for Senator Brown to snipe about our position, firstly, because he knew it before he came in here today and, secondly, because it was set out at the whips meeting last night, which is always the case. On occasions Senator Brown has a representative at those meetings; on others he does not. But that is a matter for him. So the Labor Party's position is that we support the suspension to put our views in relation to the amended motion.",SENATE,<title>UNITED NATIONS REFERENDUM: WESTERN SAHARA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-09-29,"—Could I indicate first of all in my contribution on this suspension debate that I do not accept Senator Brown's interpretation of the statement that I made in the Senate in relation to the opposition's approach to foreign policy motions. I think I made that statement on 27 May 1998; it was one of those statements one makes in parliament that often is revisited by senators in the chamber.
But let me say that, while I do not accept Senator Brown's interpretation in this respect, I do think that we have come up here with what is best described in the circumstances as a process hiccup. Because we have a process hiccup, I think we might be able to deal with this matter outside the chamber—and cost the chamber a great deal less time—in a way that Senator Brown and other senators might be more comfortable with.
 I am going to suggest, through you, Madam Deputy President, if Senator Brown would be generous enough to consider by leave withdrawing his suspension motion and if senators in the chamber would be generous enough to give Senator Brown leave to defer this matter until the next day of sitting, then I suspect we can save a great deal of time in the chamber and probably get a substantive result that a majority of senators would be comfortable with. I think Senator Brown would be more comfortable in the inevitable defeat of his suspension motion if we proceed with it this way. I hope that might be accept 
 ed by Senator Brown and other senators in the chamber in the spirit that I am approaching the question.",SENATE,<title>UNITED NATIONS REFERENDUM: WESTERN SAHARA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-29,"—by leave—Senator Faulkner has spotted my generosity, and I am willing to even overlook any of the comments about whips meetings and so on.
—You always do.
—They stand as I said them.
—Nor do 70 other members of the chamber get there, Senator O'Brien. But the matter itself is far more important than our pursuing that level of debate. I hear what Senator Faulkner and Senator O'Brien have said. It looks like we can get a positive outcome from this, which would be the same outcome if we were now to proceed to a full debate. In view of that potential outcome, I seek leave to revert to having this made a notice of motion for tomorrow.
—You are seeking leave to withdraw the suspension of standing orders motion?
—Yes.
Leave granted.
—You are seeking leave to move a motion to postpone the consideration of this matter until tomorrow?
—Yes.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-29,"—I will conclude my remarks on the Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999  from before lunch. I just want to return to the subject of the GST package, which went through the Senate with the support of the Democrats. There are a couple of matters that I may raise in the committee stage but I would like to foreshadow them so that some answers may be forthcoming.
The first is the business of the adjustment assistance being given by the government to businesses preparing for the GST. There have been reports in various financial journals and elsewhere that some $500 million will be available to help for-profit businesses as they make this adjustment to the GST. But nowhere can I find any government commitment to giving specific assistance to the not-for-profit organisations. In other words, the government is saying, `If you are in a business to make a profit—if you are in private enterprise—we will help you out but if you are a charitable organisation or a sporting or other community based organisation we are putting you second.'
I am not saying the government is not going to help out; that is what I would like to know about in the committee stage. The 
 Democrats, including Senator Woodley, have made quite a feature of the need to support the not-for-profit organisations, including charities, in this major adjustment and therefore, I would have thought, would have been ensuring that the government would be, right at the outset, jumping in to make sure that community organisations are assisted to adjust to the GST and everything that comes with it—a major matter for many charitable and community organisations right across Australia.
I predict that quite a number of these will go to the wall—they will fold—over the GST. I want to say here and now to the government and to the Democrats that you have a responsibility to help these amateur organisations or professional non-profit organisations to meet the quite extraordinary demands that the GST will place upon those organisations. Remember that many of them involve large numbers of volunteers. I know that they will have to be sizeable organisations if they are going to really be in the business of restructuring according to the GST, but that is a major structural and financial burden for non-profit organisations, from surf lifesaving and little athletics through to scouts clubs and charitable organisations, big and small. There are thousands of these organisations across the country who do not know what the impact on them is going to be.
What is more, if you want to seek information from the tax office and you are a business, a profit business, you can get it. But if you are not-for-profit, you cannot. If you seek to get such information, you are told that it is coming down the line and will be available later this year. That is not good enough. These organisations need that assistance; they need to know where they stand, they need to know what the GST means for them, they need to be able to adjust now, because, after all, for example, they are going to be paying taxes on membership fees collected now that extend into the next financial year. They need to know how to do that and they need to be ready for it.
Finally, I turn to the business of forests. Senator Lees, you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, made a commitment that 
 the diesel fuel rebate would not apply to off-road uses as far as the forest industries were concerned. This was part of the environmental offset. Now we find that the government is moving to give that concession to the logging industry which is marauding our forests, not least the woodchip industry, which is in the business of bringing down forests all over this country.
In the 60 seconds I have left, I ask the Democrats to bring that pressure they have on the Howard government to stick to that commitment. I suspect what we are going to get is the government and Labor putting through a late measure—Mr Wilson Tuckey, the minister, has called for it—to extend this diesel fuel rebate largesse to the woodchippers, who are marauding forests right across this country. The Democrats alone can stop that happening. It was a commitment they made. They should see that it does not happen.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-09-29,"—This legislation provides for the appropriation of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the Book Industry Assistance Plan and additional funding for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. It must be noted that the government's tax plan was to place a 10 per cent GST on books. That is the government's preferred option. This bill deals with part of what is little more than a political buy-out plan. The Democrats claimed long and hard that books should not attract a GST. They said that they should not be taxed. But in the end their principles went to auction, and we are now dealing with the successful bid.
It is important to note that the book plan is a finite package. Assistance runs for four years, commencing in the tax year 2000-01. It has to be said, however, that the 10 per cent tax on books could last indefinitely. There is also doubt that the package will redress the decline in demand for books flowing from the GST induced increase in their price. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Program is part of the same bribe. This book plan amounts to little more than an attempt to paper over what is really bad 
 public policy and it is also an attempt to mask the real impact of the GST.
The reality of this tax was brought into sharp focus the day before yesterday, when both major airlines put out media releases announcing that the domestic airfares for travel after 1 July next year will increase by at least 7.5 per cent. I say `at least 7.5 per cent', because Ansett said that it expected a further GST related increase before that date and Qantas said that it would have to undertake a further review of costs closer to 1 July next year. I think that is code for yet another jump in airfares prior to GST day. Senator Abetz was quoted in the Advocate yesterday in relation to the announcement by the airlines, suggesting that they were announcing an increase now so that it would not be noticeable when the GST was introduced on 1 July. In fact, that is absolutely not the case. The increases were announced the day before yesterday to take effect from 1 July as a result of the GST.
The government claims that the impact of the GST on books will be negated by the package we have before us. It made a similar claim about the impact of the GST on air travel. In fact, we were told that overall prices for air travel would actually fall. This first round of airfare increases, with more to come, is an indication that the Australian community has been deceived.
Part of Senator Kemp's defence of the GST and its impact on airfares was that we were all going to enjoy substantial income tax cuts. There must now be some doubt about the state of the budget, as there is an overrun due to the cost of maintaining an appropriate presence in East Timor. We have been told that the cost would be $300 million, then $500 million, and now $1 billion. I suspect that even the $1 billion figure is a very conservative number.
No-one is suggesting that we should not be participating in the force in East Timor, but it is blatantly obvious that, if we had ensured the security of East Timor prior to the vote for independence, then we would be dealing with a very different problem. It is becoming increasingly obvious that this government has failed badly in its management of our defence 
 capability right from day one. So we are confronting a much tougher task than we should be and our ability to do the job rightly asked of us is significantly tougher than it should be. It appears that the cost of Australia fulfilling its obligations to the people of East Timor will be well above $1 billion. I understand that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, is absolutely committed to protecting the budget surplus, despite this dramatic increase in defence costs. So the government's ability to diminish the negative impact of the GST, which is the very matter we are dealing with here, is now clearly under threat.
Consideration of how the government has promoted its regional foreign affairs strategy but failed to underpin that rhetoric with an appropriate strategic defence capacity is instructive when one looks at the Costello tax plan. On 15 October 1996 the then Minister for Defence, Mr McLachlan, delivered a ministerial statement in the other place. Mr McLachlan announced two major initiatives in defence policy to `increase the combat capacity of the Army and the efficiency and effectiveness of the whole defence organisation'. This is the exact rhetoric we have heard from Mr Costello about Australia's taxation system and his new tax plan: `increase efficiency and effectiveness'—the same words.
The small business community are now coming to the realisation that the imposition of the GST will dramatically reduce their ability to run their business; that is, dramatically reduce their efficiency. And low and middle income earners are about to find out how ineffective the new tax system will be in ensuring that everyone pays their fair share. The lower your income, the more tax as a percentage of your income you will have to pay.
Mr McLachlan, in his ministerial statement, said that the Army lacked sufficient combat power to quickly end a conflict. He said, `By 2000, the Army's capacities will be significantly enhanced.' Mr McLachlan also announced the Defence Efficiency Review to cut expenditure in the overall defence budget and he identified a number of sectors as sources of potential savings. The savings target set by 
 the department was $500 million. The Australian Defence Force chiefs increased that target to $700 million, and the minister demanded savings of $1 billion. In pursuit of these savings, the government have progressively eroded the very defence capacity they claim they were enhancing. This defence plan has proved to be an absolute disaster, as will be the goods and services tax. I intend to pursue the government's failures in the Defence portfolio in some detail at a future time, but I want to touch on a couple of issues today.
There are a number of aspects in this failed attempt by the government to manage our defence effort, and again they parallel the GST debate and the evolution of this bill. I understand, and I am happy to be corrected, that the recruitment budget for the ADF in 1996-97 was around $25 million. And I am told that by 1999-2000 the appropriation for recruitment had been cut to only $12 million—a more than 50 per cent reduction. I understand that a further $2 million was cut from the recruitment budget at the end of the last calendar year—and all this in the name of greater efficiency. The result was obviously a significant shortfall in recruitment with targets being missed by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent.
The minister's response was innovative: he simply reduced the target. Now we have a major problem in ensuring that we can properly support a force of up to 4,500 troops in East Timor. I noted the Prime Minister had 2,000 Australian troops in East Timor at the beginning of question time today but by the end of question time that number had jumped to 3,077. Defence spokesman Colonel Duncan Lewis was quoted in the Canberra Times of 23 September as saying, `The recruitment drive will have to start soon because of the urgency of getting a rotation in place.' This is very much a problem of the government's own making, as the tax package is now proving to be, and on both counts it will be the Australian community who will have to foot the bill for the government's mismanagement.
The second defence matter I want to refer to today is the approach taken by this govern 
 ment to the provision of medical support for the Defence Force. A minute circulated by Major General J.C. Hartley, the Army's Land Commander, to other Army, Navy and Air Force commanders on 30 June this year said that urgent action is needed because of `the critical nature of shortages of specialist medical officers for surgical teams for operational deployments and training support'. Major General Hartley said that urgent action was necessary because the impact on Australia's Defence Force capability was immediate. The order given to Defence health was simple. Officers managing health services were directed to maintain only `minimum safe health standards'. Again the government has sought short-term savings, but they are savings that have come at a significant operational cost.
The third defence matter that I wish to refer to again goes to the competency of the government. The growing tension in East Timor prompted the government to increase our defence readiness in northern Australia. How did the government meet the increased costs? By raiding the fuel and oil budget of the Navy and the Air Force. This is no way to administer our defence forces. The failed structure and incompetent administration of our defence forces since March 1996 is now being exposed by the demands of East Timor. And this bill and the announcement that the GST will significantly drive up airfare costs is now exposing the flawed structure of the government's tax plan.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-09-29,"—In speaking this evening on the Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999 , I particularly want to concentrate on the book industry assistance plan. As we know, under the GST, books—which in the past have not been subject to the wholesale sales tax—will be subject to a 10 per cent GST. The proposed Book Industry Assistance Plan is the outcome of negotiations, as we know now, between the government and the Australian Democrats in return for their support in the Senate for the tax reform package. The Democrats have accepted the plan as compensation for the GST on books, and this bill is, in effect, putting that deal and that package into place.
The book compensation package is a $240 million program over four years. Under this package, the government intends to fund an eight per cent subsidy for educational textbooks from 1 July next year, costing $117 million. However, the subsidy is only for books which appear on designated reading lists. There is $48 million for an Innovation, Infrastructure and Development Fund and a skills development program; $38 million to extend the libraries' lending rights scheme for Australian authors from public libraries to cover educational libraries; $28 million in grants to primary schools to increase their collection of Australian books; $8 million for marketing books to promote reading and literacy; and $1.2 million to improve the collection of statistics concerning the Australian publishing industry.
So who supported a GST on books? From my involvement with the Senate inquiry earlier this year, no-one—no-one associated with the publishing industry anyway, neither booksellers and publishers nor authors; no-one represented by the Australian Booksellers Association, the Australian Publishers Association and the Australian Society of Authors. Educational institutions and libraries also opposed a GST on books and all the industry and other interest groups requested a zero rating for books.
The booksellers, publishers and authors represented by the various groups that appeared before us presented numerous submissions on their opposition to a GST on books. In fact they ran a campaign against the introduction of a GST on books. Educational institutions and libraries also expressed their concern. Issues raised have ranged from concerns about the potential adverse effects on education and literacy and the development of an information knowledge economy to concerns about the effects on the book industry—the creators, the producers, the artists, and even the sellers of books.
These concerns are largely based on overseas research, which suggests that the demand for books is highly price sensitive—that for every percentage point increase in the price there is an equivalent drop in demand. It has been argued that a drop in demand will affect 
 reading and learning; that Australian authors, already surviving on low incomes, will be further disadvantaged; that Australian printers and publishers, particularly smaller establishments, will be unable to compete; and that the profitability of booksellers will be affected.
In support of this line of argument, the point has often been made that the majority of the major industrial nations have either no tax on books or a reduced tax on books. During the GST inquiry it was interesting to note the argument from booksellers that research internationally has shown that, with the addition of a GST on books priced at $9.95 or $19.95, which would tip the price just over the edge of the $10 or $20 mark, there would be quite a significant drop in demand.
Despite their strong opposition to the introduction of the GST on books, the APA and the ASA have welcomed the compensation package. However, the APA believe that it will go only some way to alleviating the impact of the GST on the book industry, a GST that they never wanted anyway. The ASA have stated publicly that they are pleased with the introduction of the educational lending rights which they as an organisation have long advocated. While the ABA have welcomed the book marketing initiative, book retailers have been critical of the book subsidy on textbooks, arguing that it will introduce an added administrative burden on booksellers and that it will do little to compensate for the increase in the cost of the 70 per cent of book sales which are made to consumers rather than to educational institutions.
The package negotiated between the government and the Democrats is supposed to soften the impact of the introduction of the GST on books. However, there are concerns that the package will not significantly redress the expected reduction in the demand for books resulting from the price rises associated with the GST. For a start, it is questionable whether the subsidy will compensate for price rises. The subsidy is only for books, as I said earlier, which appear on designated reading lists. So there is no encouragement really for students to diversify their reading and go 
 outside the reading lists unless they are prepared to pay the extra price. The Australian Bureau of Statistics data appears to support the claim that over 70 per cent of book sales do not fit within the education category and are therefore unlikely to be covered by this subsidy.
Details regarding the implementation and administration of most of the initiatives have not been negotiated with the relevant groups. There are concerns about the administrative complexity for the book industry. Book retailers are critical of the book subsidy on textbooks, arguing that it will introduce an administrative burden on booksellers. They also argue that it will do little to compensate for the increase in cost. So why did the Democrats allow a GST on books to slip through? In a media release on 20 August this year, the Leader of the Democrats, Meg Lees, stated:
. . . the Democrats would have much preferred that books were GST-free, but that the $240 million negotiated package was a very good substitute.
Run that past us again. Why go belly-up and agree to a GST on books at all? Why not hold the line? I had thought that the Democrats opposed a GST on learning. That is what a GST on books is as far as I am concerned: it is a tax on learning.
So why shouldn't there be a GST on books? Concerns were expressed throughout the year about the impact on education and literacy and the development of the information knowledge economy. There were concerns expressed about the effects on the book industry and the effects it will have on creators, writers, artists, illustrators, producers and sellers of books. Overseas research suggests, as I have said before, that the demand for books is very sensitive to price rises. As a result of that, there is usually an equivalent drop in demand. Another reason why a GST should not be included on books is that books have never been subject to sales tax. Books are the major means by which individuals acquire education from a very early age to late in life.
In an age in which individuals have to acquire new skills several times in their lifetime, it is vital that books are easily and 
 cheaply available. A tax on books is a tax on education, a tax on learning and a tax on knowledge. Books promote general literacy, are essential for the maintenance and improvement of reading skills and are the major means by which individuals acquire education. Books are essential to the lives of all Australians. Books form an essential element in the proper working of a democratic society. They are essential even more to our culture and our identity.
One will remember that even the Treasurer, Peter Costello, acknowledged the unfairness of the GST on books. One cannot forget the advice he gave to a constituent some months back when he suggested that importing books by post from overseas in lots of less than $1,000 will allow the constituent to avoid paying the GST if they are purchased via the Internet. What about the impact of that suggestion, Mr Costello, on the Australian publishing industry? Of the 19 major industrial nations around the globe, 17 of them have either no tax on books or a reduced tax on books. So we are going to lead the world internationally by being one of the first countries to have a significant tax on books and to have very few of those books exempted under this arrangement.
The government has claimed that the price rises on books will not be significant, that the tax cuts offered in the tax package will mean that consumers have more money to spend on goods and services and that the price of books will not rise relative to other competing goods and services. If the increase in airfares we saw yesterday is any indication of what we are about to expect in the coming 12 months, we may well be in for a similar shock when it comes to books and book prices. The reality is that the government's tax cuts are not going to go very far at all.
In conclusion, the Labor Party is opposed to a GST and it is opposed to a GST on books. That has always been the case and it will remain the case. A GST on books is a tax on learning; a tax on knowledge. I believe it is a tax on the society we want to be in the future. While these measures go a small way to soften the impact of the GST on books, it will be an administrative nightmare. Finally, 
 the Book Industry Assistance Plan would not have been necessary at all if the Democrats had not agreed to the GST in this deal.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-29,"—I rise to speak to the Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and the Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999 . These bills are important bills which flow on from the adoption of the new tax system legislation and agreement reached between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Democrats in May. The bills lock in place the appropriation not just for this year but for the full four years of the forward estimates. I think that is an important point to emphasise: it is not just for the first year. Therefore, the programs will not have to rely on annual appropriations over the next four years. That will provide much greater certainty in relation to the issues covered by these bills—that is, books and the environment.
Briefly, on the issue of the application of a GST to books, I have made my own position clear in the chamber and in speeches in the past, but it is nonetheless important to emphasise and highlight the significant ameliorating measures represented in this appropriation bill which go a significant way towards addressing the impact the GST is likely to have on books. I also think it is important to emphasise that the Democrats will continue to campaign for and seek to achieve an eventual outcome of GST-free books.
In the area of the environment, there are very significant measures in the  Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999  which I believe must be highlighted. As the Democrats' environment spokesperson, I obviously have a particular interest in this area and in ensuring that the money is not just appropriated—it is obviously an essential and important start—but also spent effectively. There are ongoing discussions not just with the Democrats but also with the wider community and the government about the most effective ways to utilise the funding and the measures contained in the Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999 .
I would like to briefly highlight again all these measures and remind the Senate that the measures exist only because of the intervention of the Australian Democrats. Firstly, there will be $75 million over four years to support conversions to compressed natural gas or liquid petroleum gas for commercial vehicles and buses with a weight equal to, or greater than, 3½ tonnes. This applies to trains and ferries as well. Another measure is to develop a product stewardship system for the reuse and recycling of waste oil. That is $60 million over four years. This is a significant industry, and evidence given before the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee has shown that on 1996 figures approximately 540 million litres of new oil were sold in Australia, of which 149 million litres were collected for recycling. That is significantly less than would be available if full recycling were utilised. This incentive and this funding should provide significant assistance in improving Australia's performance in recycling and reusing oil.
Another measure supports the utilisation of photovoltaic systems on residential buildings and community use buildings. Photovoltaic systems convert sunlight into electricity, which is a very significant mechanism for not just reducing greenhouse emissions but developing sustainable energy industries. It is very important environmentally, but it is also an area where Australia has significant economic potential if we make use of that. The Democrats are very pleased that this measure exists which will go some way towards moving things in a more positive direction in that regard.
On top of that, there is extra funding to support the development and commercialisation of renewable energy, which is a vital area for the reasons I have just expressed. The extra funding will build on the Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program, almost doubling its expenditure. That will provide potential for significant economic as well as environmental benefits for Australia and for the world as a whole. Over $250 million is provided for the use of renewable energy for remote power generation, which is often a 
 viable alternative to diesel generated electricity in remote areas and those areas not served by a main electricity grid. The government has been lax in the past in not providing support and incentives for this area. It is a very significant component that the Democrats achieved that is represented in this bill. There are also measures to support the development and implementation of in-service emissions testing capabilities for diesel and petrol vehicles, which should assist significantly in reducing emissions and providing better air quality than would be the case if the measure were not there.
The measure which has perhaps had the most attention drawn to it is the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program—$400 million over four years. This is perhaps the biggest area where ongoing work is occurring on how best to utilise that funding and what specific measures will be put forward and developed under that initiative. It is specifically designed to reduce greenhouse emissions—an issue that the Democrats have campaigned on extremely vigorously for many years, and we will continue to do so. This government's record on supporting measures and adopting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is very poor, and it is one the Democrats have highlighted time and time again. It is an achievement that should not be dismissed—that the Democrats have managed to get significant movement from the government in this absolutely crucial and fundamental area.
There are often debates and surveys about the different priorities that people give to environmental issues. From my point of view, the issue of greenhouse emissions is perhaps up there at the top in terms of the importance of environmental issues. Indeed, the National Youth Roundtable is in Canberra at the moment, and I managed to see most of its presentation today on environmental issues and the survey it has done in recent times about the views and attitudes of young people in Australia towards the environment. According to its survey, the number one issue of concern for young people in Australia is air quality and emissions. I believe it is a significant measure and a significant gain by the Democrats which is represented in this bill. It 
 should go a significant way towards addressing the very issue that young people in Australia have indicated they are specifically concerned about.
There are major measures in this bill. It is, if you like, a major environmental package disguised as a benign appropriation bill. I believe that, amongst the differing arguments about the impacts of various components of the wide ranging tax agreement, the environmental measures which have been inserted as part of that, which were not there at all and were not even on the radar of the government with the initial package, are a major advance on what would otherwise have been the case.
I emphasise the importance of the involvement of community and environment groups in the ongoing development and expenditure of these measures. It is one thing to provide $400 million, for example, for a greenhouse gas abatement program; what that is spent on is going to be critical in terms of how much benefit it produces for the environment. It is crucial that as much thought, energy, effort and input as possible go into those decisions so that the absolute best possible environmental benefit is achieved not just in the short term but in an ongoing way. The Democrats will bring that focus to the ongoing work of the government in our consultations with them and also with the broader community, who are being encouraged to have input into that process through the Australian Greenhouse Office. I hope that we are able to achieve the best possible outcome in relation to that area, and I urge the many Australians who share our concerns about environmental issues to work with the process that has now been put in place to ensure the best possible outcome is achieved.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-09-29,"—The commencement of the Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and the Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999  is important because the legislation relating to the goods and services tax and the diesel grants scheme is contingent on these appropriation bills. The Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999  provides for the appropriation of money from 
 the consolidated revenue fund for the Book Industry Assistance Plan and additional funding for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. The Appropriation (Supplementary Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999  appropriates $896 million from the consolidated revenue fund for expenditure over four years on a range of environmental measures particularly relating to greenhouse gases, renewable energy and transport issues.
These are very important bills, and the government acknowledges the effort that the Democrats have put into working with the government to achieve a result that is good news for the environment. When you look at that $896 million over four years, you see a total of $70 million for the conversion of vehicles to gas; $60 million for product stewardship—for example, dealing with the recycling of oil; $31 million for rebates for people who convert solar power to electricity; $26 million for the commercialisation of renewable energy; $264 million for renewable energy for remote power generation; and $40 million for the development of diesel emission testing. There is also the large figure of $400 million for a greenhouse gas abatement program.
These are significant measures which are part and parcel of the new tax legislation and which go to meeting concerns in relation to the environment. As well as that, the first bill appropriates funds totalling $240 million for the Book Industry Assistance Plan, which addresses the effect that any tax change might have on the cost of books, particularly in relation to textbooks. The government rejects totally any allegation that this is a change which involves a tax on education. It is not so, and the Book Industry Assistance Plan will go to ensure that. There is also $60 million in assistance for those who are homeless. That is a pertinent issue in Australia today, and that money will be well spent.
The government has arrived at an agreement with the Democrats on these very important issues. This agreement is good for Australia and all Australians. As well as that, it will usher in the new tax system, where we will see tax cuts of $12 billion and whereby average men and women working in Australia 
 will see a reduction in their taxes. This will then give them the ability to spend their take-home pay on items of their choice. It will empower them to use their pay in a manner that they see fit, and that can only be good news for working Australians. There are also other aspects, such as the reduction in fuel prices and in the cost of transport. The new tax system spells good news for Australia. When you look at the new tax system and these measures, you can only wonder why the opposition has not seen its way clear to supporting this package of legislation which will advance Australia.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1999-09-29,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I am very pleased to see the third annual report of the Medical Training Review Panel. It arose out of a recommendation from an evaluation by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs of the changes which were made to medical provider code numbers at the end of 1996. Senator Knowles was the chairman of the committee involved, and Senator Helen Coonan and I were also on that committee. We were concerned at that time that there did not seem to be any specific information about the number of medical training programs available in Australia. We felt that it would be a good thing if a national body were set up to oversee medical postgraduate training in Australia and to quantify the number of training posts so that there was 
 hard data available as to how many training posts there were and where they were.
 We also thought that it was important that some attention be paid to the criteria for the selection of people going into medical postgraduate education and an appeal process be provided for people who felt that in some way the selection of candidates for postgraduate medical education training had not been fair or they had been unfairly dismissed from training programs. We thought an appeal mechanism should be set up.
The Medical Training Review Panel has addressed all of the issues that we thought were important very well. For example, in terms of medical training placements, it is now on the public record in this document that, as of June 1999, 5,645 medical vocational training positions in specialist training programs were available in Australia. That is a very specific figure. There were 1,478 trainees in general practice, representing 26.2 per cent of all medical trainees; 655 in emergency medicine; 652 in psychiatry; 559 in anaesthesia; 541 in surgery; 426 in adult medicine; and smaller numbers in various other specialist areas.
Previously, those kinds of specific figures would not have been able to be provided. This means that there is a much better idea of what is available in terms of postgraduate medical education in Australia. Planning can be undertaken as to the medical manpower needs of Australia and increases made in relevant training programs. Some states appear to have fewer training programs in certain areas than one would have expected, but I have no doubt that, with these statistics available, those deficiencies will be addressed and training numbers increased in the areas where specific training programs are rather light on.
One of the things the Medical Training Review Panel has done this year is produce a report on the basis upon which individuals should be selected for medical postgraduate training. That report is called the Brennan report, and it outlines a very clear series of principles for the selection of candidates for medical training. These principles include selecting the best possible candidate—with 
 the objective of producing the best possible practitioner—and having a legal and accountable process. As I said in my introduction, the panel has also set up an appeals process for people who feel they have not received natural justice in the selection or training process. The Medical Training Review Panel has proved to be a very useful and important body, and this report shows that.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Medical Training Review Panel</title>,Documents,22,1
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-09-29,"—I also rise to speak to this report because the training of medical personnel is very important. This issue raises in my mind a great deal of concern. We know there are shortages of doctors in areas, and the government has taken some measures in conjunction with the states to try to address this. But this gives the indication that there is a shortage of only doctors and trained specialists, when there is a shortage of personnel from the whole of the medical, paramedical or allied health area.
There is a very major shortage of nurses looming, and the government is going to have to address that at a national level. There is no point in one state undertaking work to overcome this problem only to find that, because it is providing extra training or extra assistance to the registered and enrolled nurses within that state, those nurses are being pinched by states that are not prepared to put in the same amount of work.
I am also concerned about the problems, particularly in relation to training issues, in attracting other health professionals—such as speech therapists, social workers, psychologists and physiotherapists—to rural and regional areas. This review panel is able to look at aspects of medical training—as in doctors—and look at where the problems are there, but we also need an organisation that looks at the problems with the training that is given to the other health professionals, which is not encouraging those professionals to move to rural areas.
Whilst doctors are vitally important as part of the health profession, they are only one part. If you are going to have a comprehensive, well-balanced health system, it is important to have adequately trained health professionals to support the activities of doctors. 
 Having the best trained surgeons in the world is fine but, if you cannot provide them with support staff trained to the same level, you may as well forget about having adequate numbers of doctors and training them to the highest of levels.
This is a major concern to me, and it definitely has to be addressed. We cannot think that health equals just doctors. It equals a whole range of specially qualified and experienced staff, and they have to work together in multidisciplinary teams. For some people, this may be an unusual approach but, from my experience in the health field, this is a way of driving the dollar better. It is a way of utilising each group's training to the maximum degree and therefore getting the best, and often quickest, results in the area of health. I note with interest the table in the document looking at the gender of trainees. It would appear that some of the specialty areas have upped their game in increasing the number of female doctors who are undertaking additional training. That is welcome, but there are some areas that are still dragging the chain.
It is also very hard to compare tables across the report. However, if I look at the number of people undertaking training with the college of anaesthetists, I can tell from that table how many of them are female. It is close to half, which is very good. I can do the same with the college of dermatologists—there are 50 positions and only 18 of those are filled by women—emergency medicine, general practitioners, medical administrators and obstetricians and gynaecologists. It is when I start to get to some of the more specialised areas within the college of physicians, with their speciality areas of occupational medicine and paediatrics, that it becomes a little more difficult. Maybe paediatrics has been left out; that might be my problem. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,1999-09-29,"—In recent weeks, most members of this chamber, and in fact most members of the Australian community, have placed an enormous focus on the ongoing situation in East Timor. We, like many people around the world, have been appalled at the overwhelming humanitarian crisis and serious human rights abuses which have faced many East Timorese—those who are still in East Timor and those who have been displaced. I touched on some of these issues during my comments in the debate in the chamber last week. Tonight, I wish to expand on some of those issues.
I will refer on a number of occasions this evening to the words of Mary Robinson, in her capacity as the UN Commissioner on Human Rights, and to her recent work in relation to some of the most significant of these issues. In her statement on 23 September to the special session of the Commission on Human Rights on East Timor, she said:
We do not yet know the total number of those who were killed, separated from their families, or deported, nor the full extent of property destroyed. Yet available information shows clearly that gross human rights violations were committed in East Timor affecting its entire population and territory.
Those words on the record from Mrs Robinson note that the activities certainly involved terror, killings and other violence, attacks on women and significant displacement of the East Timorese. 
In its press statement of 27 September, UNICEF noted that the provincial social affairs office were reporting an:
. . . estimated 236,424 displaced persons in 37 camps in 11 locations in West Timor and nearby islands. Some 33,099 are under five years old, 13,240 are under two years old and 6,362 are pregnant mothers. 

These are extraordinary figures when one considers the humanitarian crisis being faced by these people. I understand that the foreign minister of Indonesia, Ali Alatas, has indicated to Australia's foreign minister, Alexander Downer, that those people can now return to East Timor. I welcome that announcement and hope very much for its rapid implementation.
But we are also looking at extensive devastation of infrastructure. Just last week, the multinational humanitarian mission representing Japan, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States visited East and West Timor, and commented:
. . . we were shocked to observe the widespread physical destruction of homes, commercial facilities and public buildings.
We would note, from recent press reports, that that destruction appears to be continuing. 
That multinational mission also raised the important issue of preparing for the forthcoming planting season in East Timor. Unless some sort of order can be restored reasonably quickly, there will be a significant impact on the cycle of planting and harvesting, ensuring that questions of food supply continue for an extended period.
I understand that the city of Baucau is now being used as an eastern distribution base for humanitarian aid, but even in the last couple of days reports of further deaths in Baucau have been made public. Bishop Besilo Nascimento confirmed this week that seven people had been killed in Baucau, including a priest, two nuns and four church workers. That aspect of the process continues in some places, it would seem, unabated. A delegation of aid workers from Darwin was due to arrive in East Timor on Monday, but there is an enormous scarcity of resources on the ground. There are very few trucks to transport material. Anybody who saw the pictures of the destruction of UN vehicles in Baucau itself—an area which I visited with Senator Bourne—would not be surprised that that makes it so much harder to address these particular challenges.
An Antonov aircraft provided by Australia is now making twice daily runs between Darwin and Dili delivering United Nations 
 and NGO supplies. But the issue of returning people to anything that resembles their former lives is what is most difficult. `The difficulties of returning home'—that is such a simple sounding statement when in so many cases people's homes have been destroyed, as have the homes of their neighbours and the homes of the rest of their communities; and this would appear to be the case in area after area.
In my remarks last week, I spoke in particular about the village of Memo, near Maliana. Lower Memo was burnt to the ground on the Friday before the poll. What struck me most in that observation process was that those people still voted. I am still incredulous that one can face that level of intimidation and still be determined to exercise one's democratic right.
Julia Taft, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Population, who travelled to East and West Timor as part of the multinational mission to which I referred earlier, commented that:
. . . swift action must be taken to allow UNHCR to identify those seeking to repatriate to East Timor from those wishing to remain in Indonesia.
That is a very important aspect of this whole process. Those people who fled their homes, especially those who went to West Timor—some voluntarily, many forcibly—must have a choice in whether they remain where they are, relocate to another part of Indonesia or return to their communities, such as they remain. They must have `an opportunity to express their choices for the future', as Mary Robinson phrased it.
Several NGOs and their Australian operations in particular are playing key roles in the crisis in East Timor and with work in West Timor. Among those are CARITAS, the International Red Cross and UNICEF. 
In the last week, in my capacity as Chair of the Parliamentary UNICEF Association, I have circulated amongst members and senators information relating to the UNICEF East Timor Appeal. UNICEF's activities in East Timor are significant, important and ongoing. The agency has been working in East and West Timor for 18 years. In fact, it was not until shortly after the Popular Consultation 
 that its staff were finally forced to evacuate their East Timorese operations.
The total cost of UNICEF emergency relief efforts in East and West Timor has been estimated at $US5 million, covering activities in water and sanitation, health, nutrition, education and psychosocial services. UNICEF is also planning, of course, longer term work. Last week it delivered 1.2 metric tonnes of baby food over land from West Timor, followed by more deliveries over the weekend of aid vital for children. I am looking forward to an opportunity this Friday to meet with UNICEF and other NGOs in Darwin to learn more about the specific operations that they are undertaking in West and East Timor.
I want to refer briefly to the role of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The calling of the special session of this commission was only the fourth such time in the commission's 50-year history. The other occasions—twice to consider the former Yugoslavia and once to consider Rwanda—were also examples of extreme situations of human rights abuses. As Mary Robinson has said, this is not a matter of writing new laws but rather needing to implement in practice, on the ground, the international norms and standards that exist. On 23 September, in presenting the `Sounding the Century Lecture' in London, she said:
Failures of prevention shame us. Cambodia shamed us, Kosovo shamed us and now East Timor has shamed us. Are we going to be shamed again? Our failures to prevent the gross violations of the past do not relieve us of the responsibility to prevent their recurrence.
The announcement yesterday that the United Nations Human Rights Commission will set up an international inquiry into the atrocities in East Timor is, I think, a welcome one. The inquiry will investigate cases of torture, violence against women and executions. The resolution adopting that process also directed the investigative body to work in cooperation with a fact-finding body already appointed by Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission. It is crucial that those responsible for these actions be brought to justice. It is crucial that we emphasise in this process that our argument is not, as I have said before, with the vast body of the people of Indonesia 
 but rather with the perpetrators of these actions. If the norms and standards referred to by Mary Robinson are to be enforced, then punishment must be meted out for those actions.
I would like to refer just briefly to the work of the Australian legal professionals to participate in this inquiry, particularly the efforts of Mr Justice John Dowd of the International Commission of Jurists and Mr Nick Cowdrey QC, the New South Wales DPP. With some 200 other volunteers, they have begun the process of studying for the collection of evidence and preparation of prosecution briefs. 
Just as it is important to rebuild East Timor's infrastructure, so it is important to rebuild the rule of law and to re-establish a system of justice in which the East Timorese can place their faith. Australia can play an important role with the international community in this process. 
The work of reconstruction must recognise the urgent and fundamental importance of the early re-establishment of the rule of law in East Timor. The people need a system of land tenure and the development of civil, political and social systems to ensure that there is a framework on which the rebuilding can occur.
