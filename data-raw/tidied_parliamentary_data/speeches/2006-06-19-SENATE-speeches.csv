"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-06-19,"—I would like to make some brief remarks on the Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006. As a member of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee I participated in the committee’s inquiries into the excise bills. I initially place on record my thanks to the committee secretariat for the enormous effort they put into not only organising a public hearing but also producing a report in record time. I also thank the other members of the committee. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee, as is often the case at this time of year, found itself inquiring into these excise bills, the fuel tax bills and some others, which we will deal with this afternoon. The committee was under enormous pressure, having had a series of bills referred to it in one week which were to be reported on in the following week so that they could make their way through this chamber. Given the pressure that the committee found itself under, particular thanks need to made to the committee secretariat and to those whom we borrow from other committees.
When the committee inquired into the excise bills, we looked solely at the sections of those bills that deal with excise on alcohol. Since I have been in this place, the debate about excise on alcohol is something that has occurred every year or so. It is something that I knew very little, if anything, about until I joined the economics committee. I must say that, thanks particularly to the endeavours of Senator Murray, I now find I know a bit more about it. But I still see it as being an incredibly complicated regime. I must admit that I think I am much better at consuming alcohol than at understanding its taxation regime! Having said that, we focused purely on the parts of this regime that deal with alcohol. As is often the case when our committee in particular considers these matters, we agreed on a very important point of public policy and made some recommendations accordingly. They were recommendations that, having listened to Radio National this morning, I think will go down fairly well in the wider community.
There was a debate on the Health Report about funding by industry of public education campaigns and the like, and about different organisations that are formed to combat excessive alcohol consumption in our community. One of the concerns that was raised in that program this morning was that, when those bodies are funded largely by industry, their efforts seem to be focused more around public education than the need, if we are trying to change behaviour within our community, to change public policy and our approach. There was great noise made about the need to look at changing things like taxation regimes because, if we are concerned about the growing consumption, and binge consumption, by young people of things like alcohol, and the health effects that alcohol and tobacco have, there does now seem to be a body of work that says that, rather than solely relying on public education, there is a degree of price sensitivity when it comes to the consumption of those things. Therefore, perhaps we need to look at our models of taxation instead.
When the committee considered that very issue, we talked about the study of alcohol consumption and taxation. It would seem that there is now growing interest, not just amongst community activists but also amongst economists and policy makers. There are taxes on alcoholic beverages that are specific and complex, and they can be a major source of taxation revenue. We also think that such taxes—and we have a greater understanding now—can lead to providing a means of curbing excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages and some associated negative behaviour. Therefore, I think the organisations that appeared before us and those of us on the committee are of the view that there needs to be greater understanding of how price changes can bring about an effective change in behaviour.
It was mentioned on the Health Report this morning and in the evidence that the committee heard that, when you look at the differential taxation regimes between, say, low-alcohol beer and full-strength beer and the effect that that has had on changed behaviour and couple that with state laws about drinking and driving, it would seem that that is one of the things that perhaps leads to changed behaviour rather than public campaigns that tell you not to drink. I think you only have to look at tobacco to see that in fact it is a change of law and a change of price that will lead more effectively to a change of behaviour than just advertising and telling people not to smoke.
I think the committee went through a useful process in examining these things. The committee, in its report, which I am sure has been highlighted by others, has recommended that the bills be passed. But it has also gone out of its way to mention:
In terms of reform of the alcohol taxation regime, the Committee considers that in principle a volumetric tax for all alcohol products should in the long term be adopted. It considers that planning, research and consultation directed towards this goal should start soon. Any review of the taxation regime for alcohol needs to take into account complementary strategies to address alcohol related problems.
So it needs to be complementary rather than stand-alone, as it is at the moment. The report continues:
These strategies include education, treatment and rehabilitation, licensing and sales, enforcement and policing.
The report goes on to say:
In the meantime, the Committee considers that some immediate benefits can be achieved by way of incremental reform to the tax treatment of low and mid strength RTDs.
That is, ready-to-drinks. It continues:
These products should be placed on the same tax footing as comparable strength beers. Realigning the excise regime for lower strength RTDs promises to lower the relative price of these drinks, increase consumption of these products and reduce harmful drinking behaviour and related health and social costs. This would be an incremental low-risk step with minimal revenue implications.
This is step that has been called for by numerous community based bodies and academics who have spent a lifetime studying the linkages between price and altering behaviour. It is, in my mind, a recommendation that the government needs to take seriously if we are serious about intervening in the issues of binge drinking and increased alcohol consumption, particularly amongst young people. It is something I urge the government to consider.",SENATE,<title>EXCISE LAWS AMENDMENT (FUEL TAX REFORM AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-06-19,"—I would like to thank all senators who have taken part in the debate on these bills: the Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and the Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006. These bills, along with the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006, give effect to the government’s announcement in its energy white paper Securing Australia’s future, of 15 June 2004, that the current complex system of fuel tax concessions will be replaced by a single fuel tax credit system from 1 July 2006.
The Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 amends the Excise Act 1901 and makes consequential amendments to a number of other acts from 1 July 2006, implementing a number of measures to streamline existing excise arrangements, protect the revenue and promote best-practice regulation. It also amends the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Act 2004 so that fuel manufactured through a process of hydrogenating vegetable oils or animal fats receives the same tax treatment as biodiesel. The Excise Laws Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 also repeals a number of acts which are no longer required under the new system for providing fuel tax relief.
The Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to provide a mechanism of fuel tax relief for eligible users through the fuel tax credit system legislated through the Fuel Tax Bill rather than through the concessions within the excise system and amends the fuel items in the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 so that there are only two rates of duty—one for aviation fuel and one for other fuels. In conjunction with the fuel tax credit system, this will remove the effective excise on burner fuels and provide effective excise relief for a wide range of business users of fuel, including where fuel is used other than as fuel. This measure applies from 1 July 2006, but three items in schedule 1 relating to the validation of excise tariff proposals apply from 1 November 2005.
Presently fuel tax relief is provided in the form of remissions, refunds and rebates under the Excise Act 1901 and the Customs Act 1901 and energy grants under the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. These schemes have restrictive and complex eligibility criteria and apply to different fuels and fuel uses in different ways. The changes will lower compliance costs, reduce tax on business and remove fuel tax for thousands of businesses and households. When the fuel tax credit system is fully implemented, fuel tax will be effectively applied only to fuel used in private vehicles and for other certain private purposes, fuel used on road in light vehicles for business purposes and aviation fuels where tax is imposed for cost-recovery reasons.
The Customs Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Tax Reform and Other Measures) Bill 2006 make amendments to strengthen customs control over certain imported goods that are used in the manufacture of excisable goods; ensure that excise equivalent goods, certain alcohol, tobacco and petroleum products are subject to the same duty when imported as is applied under the Excise Tariff Act 1921 for the same products when manufactured or produced in Australia; repeal customs related provisions of the fuel penalty surcharge legislation; and replicate certain provisions of the Spirits Act 1906, which is to be repealed.
I would like to address an amendment the government wishes to move, which relates to amendments to expiry dates for excise licences. The government is amending the bill to change the date for when excise licences will expire. The bill currently provides that excise licences will have a common period of validity of three years. The common expiry date is 31 March. The initial period for a new licence will be two years after 31 March following the initial approval, so it could be for a period of less than three years. All existing licences will expire on 31 March 2007.
The validity period will remain three years with a common expiry date of 30 September. The initial period for a new licence will be two years after 30 September following the initial approval, so it could be for a period of less than three years. All existing licences will expire on 30 September 2006. This will provide an earlier opportunity for the Australian tax office to ensure that all parties in the excise system that are licensed can be formally assessed against the legislated criteria for holding such a licence. This is designed to encourage compliance and protect the revenue. This change ensures that the renewal process occurs during a period of lower activity for certain licence holders, particularly tobacco growers.
I would also like to address a couple of questions that were raised during the debate by Senator Stephens. The first question was: what is the cost of the reduction in excise and customs rates on aviation fuels? This amendment relates to a measure announced in the 2004-05 budget. Excise and customs duty were directed to funding a subsidy for location-specific pricing until 31 October 2005. This bill lowers the aviation rates as the subsidy is no longer required. As shown in the 2004-05 budget figures, the fact that this revenue is no longer expected means that in terms of the forward revenue estimates there is no further cost; it is already accounted for. The second question related to the definition of biodiesel. Biodiesel is already defined as a mono-alkyl ester derived from animal fats or vegetable oils. This is a technical change that removes the requirement that it be for use in an internal combustion engine. Biodiesel is highly unlikely to be used for other purposes, but, if it were, the provisions for fuel tax credits for use other than as fuel, to be legislated by the Fuel Tax Bill 2006, would apply. This change will not bring producers into the excise licensing system that were not already required to be licensed.
The third question was: what are the long-term excise and customs duty rates for biofuels? The current excise and customs duty rates for fuel, ethanol and biodiesel are 38.143c per litre. These bills do not change that. Long-term effective tax rates are delivered obviously by other mechanisms. I am informed that the minister, Mr Dutton, has written to Mr Fitzgibbon advising him of the government’s policy on effective rates. In conclusion, I suggest that the measures proposed in these bills contain positive improvements to the system for providing fuel tax relief and will modernise and simplify the fuel tax system. For these reasons and others outlined here I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question agreed to.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-06-19,"—I briefly commenced my contribution last week—and I will not detain the Senate for an extensive period of time today—and I had been touching upon what I believe to be a giant position of inconsistency being adopted by members of the government in relation to a number of aspects of this bill, particularly the way new enrollees are treated. I am reminded that on many occasions government members in this chamber have told us that this is a government which is friendly to the family, that this is a government which respects the bonds of family in the community and that this is a government which believes that those bonds should be encouraged. Yet, at the same time, this legislation contains provisions in relation to new enrollees which require, in some circumstances, that their applications for enrolment or variations to their enrolment be witnessed by any other person than someone who is related to them. Many young people who do not have a drivers licence will find themselves in a situation where they will need to enrol in the shortened time that the government now prescribes without recourse to people who have known them for all their lives or for a substantial period of their lives. Who would better know the identity of new enrollees than their relatives? Who would better know the person and that the details on the application were indeed factual than the relatives of the person seeking to be enrolled?
If an elector does not have a drivers licence or a prescribed identity document, they must have their enrolment application signed by two referees who are not related to the applicant and who have known the applicant for at least a month, and those people must provide their drivers licence number. There can only be one reason for that being prescribed—and no reason has been advanced by the government, I might say, as to why this provision is to be included as a result of this legislation—in regard to those seeking to enrol or to change their enrolment. The reason is that it is designed to make things more difficult. It cannot be because that gives greater certainty about the identity of the person seeking to be enrolled. How can it? How could it be that the relatives of a person would not be the best persons to attest to the accuracy of the application the elector is providing to the Electoral Commission in which they are seeking to enrol and exercise their democratic rights, perhaps for the first time, or to change their enrolment?
In relation to the issue of changing their enrolment, who indeed would be more likely to be seeking to alter their enrolment than a young person who may be in rental accommodation and moving from place to place, as is the wont of students, particularly those who are students at university for the first time and who may have to move away from home and may not have a strong network of friends and acquaintances to assist them to enrol? Who would be better placed to assist with such an application—for a young person seeking to enrol or alter their enrolment details due to a change of their place of residence—even remotely, than a relative? I cannot think of any person who would be better placed. Yet this piece of legislation seeks to, and will, rule out those people from attesting to the identity of the person registering for the electoral roll to be able to exercise their democratic right to vote for members of this parliament.
In addition, when one considers this in the context of remote Aboriginal communities, given that some of those communities are very small and that a number of them contain, substantially, people who have a familial relationship—perhaps extended, but a relationship nevertheless—I have no doubt that some young people without a drivers licence will find it extremely difficult to find a person who satisfies the test—that is, a person who is not a relative, who holds a drivers licence and who can be reached easily for the purposes of testing that the young person is who they claim to be on their application. In remote communities, how do you find someone who is not a relative, who has known the young person for at least a month and who has a drivers licence? In some cases I suspect that will be an impossibility. So the provisions of this bill, far from enhancing democracy, will actually deny young Australians in remote communities the opportunity to exercise a vote, let alone make it easier. As well, the three-day limit will place great time pressures on those young people to enrol to vote for the first time if an election is called and they have not sought to enrol earlier.
One has to say that the motivation for this must be to deny some people the opportunity to exercise their democratic rights, rights that I think all Australians believe are fundamental rights of members of our community. Some people, it might be said, take those rights quite lightly, but I do not think that this parliament should take any action which could be seen as a justification for members of the community taking lightly their rights and obligations in relation to exercising their democratic rights. Too many sacrifices have been made by Australians over the years for our democratic rights to be weakened in this way, for the rights of Australians to be subjugated to the political will of this government—to deny people the right to vote where it is thought that they might not vote for the government.
It also ought be said that a class of people who might find themselves in difficulty as a result of these provisions are those who rent their accommodation rather than live in a home they have purchased. I do not know of anything that justifies treating renters as lesser people in terms of their democratic rights, but that is what this bill will do. You see, if people rent their homes then they are more likely to change their place of residence more frequently. In changing their place of residence more frequently, they are more likely to move from one electorate to another. Then, upon the calling of an election, they will find themselves in the position of having to prove their identity when they turn up at the polling booth to exercise their democratic rights.
Another provision in this bill is clearly designed to make it more difficult for people to exercise a provisional vote, and we all know that there are quite a number of provisional votes made in every federal election. It has been said, and I think it is a valid suggestion, that the provisions of this legislation will actually impose a greater workload on the AEC in administering provisional voters’ rights. Now, I have never heard the AEC complain about the workload that they face in administering the current system of provisional voting—not once, and I have had some dealings with the Electoral Commission in relation to elections held in the state of Tasmania. I have not heard them complain once. I think that the Australian Electoral Commission take great pride in the fact that they administer what has been, at least up until now, one of the most democratic and well-respected electoral systems in the world.
It has been said in this debate, and I echo the statement, that Australian electoral officials are sought out for elections in all parts of the world, particularly the Third World, I might say, to assist in the conduct of those elections. And, in those areas where democracy has more recently been introduced, their assistance has proved to be invaluable. The AEC have never complained about the provisions that the government is changing. They have never highlighted that the system could be strengthened by reducing the time allowed for enrolment after the calling of elections, nor have they sought to change the identification provisions in the way that this bill suggests. Their views are clearly being swept aside by this government in its pursuit of political advantage via these changes.
Indeed, the coalition-dominated Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, following the 2004 election, did not suggest there were weaknesses in our system in relation to the enrolment period and the identification of those seeking to enrol—changes to which the government now seeks to give effect through this bill. The government’s own members, in reviewing the last election, did not find it to be a problem. I always thought the government’s view on matters of law was ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. The only way that this election system is ‘broke’ insofar as the government is concerned is that it may not necessarily deliver to the government the advantage that it would like it to deliver.
So let us see these changes in the light in which they should be seen. These changes are purely party partisan. They are designed not to enhance the democratic rights of Australians, they are designed not to give effect to the general principles of democracy that people of a certain age ought to have access to the right to vote; they are designed to limit the opportunity for people to exercise their democratic right in this country. When members opposite talk about their respect for the family and then say in legislation that a relative cannot verify that their relative is the person that they claim to be for the purpose of enrolling for an election, that smacks to me of an absolute double standard and reveals in its entirety the motivation for this change—that is, political advantage.
I will not detain the Senate any further on this matter. There have been some excellent contributions in this debate, and I think the opposition has clearly won the argument. The fact that coalition members have chosen not to stand up in this place and debate the principles that lie behind this bill indicates that they do not want to be on the record justifying this sort of sham legislation which will undermine our democracy, not strengthen it. Frankly, I can understand why they would not want to put their words on the record supporting this legislation, because it is shameful.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (ELECTORAL INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-19,"—I want to speak briefly on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2006. I was not able to do so last Friday when it was before the Senate because I was chairing a Senate committee. I want to put a few things on the record. I will not cover all aspects of what the bill deals with, because other speakers have done that quite adequately, but I do want to touch on a few components of the legislation. In particular, I am very concerned about the likely impact it will have on the ability of Indigenous Australians to engage with the electoral process. If you look at the extra hurdles that are being put in place through this legislation, you will see that it is quite clear that one group in the community that will almost certainly be most significantly affected is Indigenous Australians. The requirement to produce a drivers licence is obviously going to be harder for younger Australians and for many people in remote areas. The requirement to produce an alternative prescribed document, to find a couple of people to sign declarations verifying your identity and to then get that into the relevant authorities is going to be a hurdle that is much more difficult for Indigenous people to overcome.
The first thing that I want to emphasise in saying that is that it is not that Indigenous people are any less capable than anybody else of following requirements but that people in remote communities are far less likely to be readily reminded and far less likely to be able to do these sorts of things easily. The key aim in the Electoral Act is to make it as convenient as possible for people to get on the electoral roll. You always have to balance that with ensuring that the integrity of the electoral roll is such that it does not unduly or improperly affect the outcome of elections. We have to face up to the simple reality that there are always going to be flaws in the electoral roll. The key test for the parliament, for the Electoral Commission and, indeed, for the public more broadly is to ensure that the accuracy of the electoral roll is close enough to 100 per cent so as not to impede the accuracy of an election result. You can never get 100 per cent. The government is not suggesting that you will get 100 per cent with these changes. We could always do more to make it closer to 100 per cent, but the test is whether or not such extra actions will make a discernible difference with regard to an electoral outcome and whether or not there are adequate protections in place to detect any fraud or deliberate dodgy behaviour that impacts on the result of an election.
I have been a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in the past. I was a participant in the committee back in the days when it was chaired by Mr Pyne, the member for Sturt, when there was an inquiry focusing on the revelations about dishonest behaviour with regard to electoral enrolments by some members of the Labor Party in Queensland. Of course, the Shepardson inquiry looked into that matter. There was no doubt that some dishonesty was uncovered. Some people had to pay quite a high price when that dishonesty was uncovered, but the simple fact is that at no stage was any evidence provided, let alone proven, that that dishonesty affected the result of an election. No evidence of any substantial nature at all was provided to that inquiry, to any of the others that I sat on or at any other time that I am aware of that suggests any form of calculated, organised, deliberate widespread fraud with regard to electoral outcomes.
It is quite clear that, if significant fraud was conducted at election time by people wrongly enrolled, voting when they were not entitled to, voting in the name of dead people or all those sorts of urban myths that float around the place, it would be detected. Any election that is sufficiently close that there is the prospect of that sort of behaviour influencing the outcome would clearly be pursued by the losing party and would clearly be able to be detected. You might not be able to detect people voting that way on the day but, if a whole bunch of people busted in to vote unlawfully as is sometimes alleged, it would be detected after the fact and, if it affected the result in a particular seat, that result would be able to be challenged and, I would suggest, almost certainly overturned. The simple fact is that that has not been detected on any wide scale, and I believe the protections in place are adequate to assess whether or not it has happened.
In addition, we could put in extra requirements that would compromise people’s protections under privacy laws to ensure that they are enrolled where they are supposed to be enrolled, to ensure that people are not incorrectly enrolled at the wrong address and to ensure that the people who are enrolled are the people they say they are, but it would cost an enormous amount of money. It would improve the accuracy of the electoral roll marginally, but it would not be to any discernible benefit.
You also have to look at the flip side. It is unreasonable to spend millions and millions of extra dollars to just slightly improve the accuracy of the electoral roll. On top of that, you have to look at what the impact will be. If you make it too difficult, too much of an imposition, too much of an inconvenience or too much of a hassle for people to get on the roll then many people will not do it. We would all like to think that everybody would be charging down to get their name on the electoral roll the moment they turn 18—or I think you can get your name on the roll provisionally at age 17. We would all like to think that everybody in the country follows politics as closely as we in this chamber do, but the fact is that people do not. The fact is that enrolling is something that people usually do some time or other when they get around to it. We all know, or at least we should know, the enormous percentage of young people—particularly those who are just 18—who are not on the roll.
I recall that it was suggested during estimates a year or two ago that perhaps as many as 50 per cent of 18-year-olds are not on the electoral roll. The time when they do get on the roll is when an election is called or when an election is imminent. That is why the deliberate closing of the electoral roll on the day that writs are issued is a flagrant rort, and it will unquestionably lead to the disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of Australians. For those who want the history and the background of that, Senator Ray’s and Senator Faulkner’s speeches on Friday in this chamber give that detail quite accurately. We know what impact it will have because we have seen it. It has been done before. It was done in 1983 and we know what happened. Tens of thousands of people, mainly young people, will be disenfranchised, and many more will be forced to vote in an electorate in which they are no longer eligible.
I believe that this legislation is a perfect example of why it is tremendously dangerous to give any one political party control of both houses of parliament. We have seen that, at the first available opportunity, this government has introduced changes to the Electoral Act to try to rort the act in their favour. That is not only unconscionable; it also brings democracy into disrepute. Many people have criticised the way this government has followed the US in areas such as foreign policy. I am particularly disappointed to see them following the USA with regard to the partisan use of electoral laws. That is what this legislation is: it is blatantly party political and deliberately tilted to meet the interests of the governing party.
People have already noted that under this legislation it will be possible, in effect, to make anonymous donations of up to $90,000 to a particular political party. That can be done if you donate $10,000 to each division of a party in each state and territory, plus nationally. That is a disgrace. We have seen, of course, a significant jump in the level of tax deductibility for political donations. I remember when the Electoral Act was amended to allow donations up to $100 to be tax deductible. The Democrats supported that at the time because it was actually a clause specifically out of our party’s policy. That was back in the time of the former Labor government, more than 10 years ago.
My personal view is that it was probably an unwise thing to have in policy. We have public funding, and to have a second bite at the cherry through the tax deductibility of personal donations to political parties is, I think doubling up, and it is a less efficient method. If you are going to have public funding, where political parties are funded through election campaigns, I think that is a sufficient draw on the public purse. To have a second draw on the public purse through tax deductibility is, I think, unwise. I think we should reverse that policy and remove tax deductibility from the act altogether. We certainly should not be having that massive increase of up to $1,500.
The other aspect that I want to return to is the fact that the impact is likely to be greater on Indigenous Australians than on anyone else in the community. In the last few weeks we have been talking about the range of problems Indigenous Australians face in many areas, particularly in remote communities. It is particularly ironic and inappropriate to be changing the Electoral Act in a way that it will make it less likely that Indigenous people will be on the electoral roll. How much extra incentive will political parties have to ignore the needs of Aboriginal Australians if they know that more and more of them are not on the electoral roll? There would be even less motivation to address the views and needs of Indigenous Australians with fewer and fewer on the electoral roll—and there is already a higher than average proportion of Indigenous people who are not on the electoral roll.
Again reflecting back on the time when I was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, after the 1998 election—I think it was, but I might be mistaken—I spent three days at public hearings in the Northern Territory. At that time, the Northern Territory had just one House of Representatives seat. The Country Liberal Party was so obsessed with the fact that the Aboriginal population in the Territory were voting so much for the Labor Party that they figured there had to be a rort going on. We had hearings in Darwin, in Alice Springs and in Maningrida in Arnhem Land. All the hearings focused, in theory, on how the system could work better for people in remote communities and for Indigenous Australians. But I know, from things many people said on and off the record, that there was great frustration about the large percentage of Aboriginal people who did not vote for the Country Liberal Party.
It is no secret that a large proportion of Indigenous people in many areas vote disproportionately towards the Labor Party. That is not something I am pleased about. I do not know why they vote for the Labor Party, and I will not use this opportunity to go on at great length about the Labor Party’s failures on Indigenous affairs—in many respects I see them as not much better, and occasionally worse, than the coalition’s failures.
It is nonetheless a simple psephological fact that, broadly speaking, a large percentage of Indigenous people do vote for the Labor Party. I have on occasion heard coalition people basically accepting that that vote will go significantly in that direction and that there is not much they can do about it. However, it appears there is something they can do about it. They can change the Electoral Act to make it harder for Indigenous people to get on the roll and easier for them to get kicked off the roll—particularly when you add in the provision in this act which makes any person who is subject to a term of imprisonment of any length of time—not just a term of at least three years, as is currently the case—not eligible to vote. This is once again going down the US path, and that is a very dangerous path to go down. We all know, and this is another area that we should all be working on in a policy sense, that Indigenous people are disproportionately represented in this country’s jails. This will be another mechanism for significantly disenfranchising a greater number of Indigenous people.
We need to look at how this is used in other parts of the world. I will use the example of the United States of America. People have written a lot about the presidential election of 2000, in particular in the state of Florida. People talked about a range of things, such as hanging chads and whether or not certain things were counted or not counted, but to me the biggest thing that stood out in that state, and in different counties within that state, was the fact that one mechanism that was used by the Republicans—and they are not alone in using electoral law to this end—to disenfranchise a group in the community was to make not just felons but also former felons ineligible to be on the roll. Such people are disproportionately more represented in the black community in America and they are disproportionately more likely to vote Democrat in the US. It was a deliberate tactic to try and purge potential Democrat voters from the electoral roll in the United States, in a way that would potentially affect the outcome of a presidential election—and of course we all know some of the things that have happened since then—and potentially have an enormous impact on the direction of human history.
I am not suggesting that this bill goes that far. However simple the measure, if it is saying that it is appropriate to disenfranchise people because they are in jail, what is to say that the next step will not be to disenfranchise people because they were once in jail and so they are not of proper character and should lose their right to vote? Where does it stop once we accept that some people, who are citizens, should nonetheless have their right to vote removed from them? It is a very dangerous precedent that is being extended substantially in this legislation and it is, once again, by no coincidence whatsoever, occurring in a way that almost certainly will advantage the party that is currently in government.
As a number of speakers have noted in this debate, we also need to look at the form of this government. One of the first things they did when they got into power in 1996, under the guise of budget cutting that was necessary because of the budgetary situation at the time, was to cancel the Aboriginal Electoral Education Program, a program that was widely acknowledged, including by the Electoral Commission, as being enormously effective in improving the ability of Aboriginal people to engage in the electoral system, to understand how it worked and to participate more fully.
Many of us repeatedly bemoan the lack of Aboriginal participation and presence in the federal parliament. Only two people in this parliament in over 100 years have come from an Aboriginal background—they were in this Senate—and of course there are none at the moment. When we are deliberately cutting programs that allow Aboriginal people to be able to more effectively engage just with the voting process, it is no surprise that so few of them have made their way through the political processes and into the parliaments of this country.
While this government restored many of the programs they cut for budgetary reasons in 1996, they have never restored the AEEP. The clear intent of that was to not make it any easier for Indigenous people to vote or to understand the electoral process because they do not vote for this government. This government do not want to help them get on the roll or be able to vote; they want to make it easier to get them off the roll. That is a shameful thing at any time, but at a time when we have a public debate that is openly acknowledging that we need to do better as a political process and as a parliamentary system in assisting Indigenous Australians, it is particularly shameful.
I want to briefly correct one thing in Senator Ray’s otherwise very good speech. In speaking about the Democrats’ role in a previous amendment to the Electoral Act, he said that we supported what Labor called the ‘dash for cash’ legislation. That legislation did not cost the taxpayer one cent. It simply ensured that the Electoral Act clarified the way the administrative structure of the Liberal Party interacted with the public-funding requirements. It may or may not have been responsible for most state Liberal Party branches now being broke, as Senator Ray alleged—I do not know whether or not they are broke, and I do not know whether or not it is a consequence of that legislation—but that is not my business; how they organise their funds is a matter for the Liberal Party.
It was also incorrect to say, as Senator Ray did, that the Democrats were internally divided at the time and that most of the Democrat senators actually opposed it but went along with it because they did not want to rock the boat. That is simply wrong. I can categorically say that, as leader of the party at the time, I did not hear a single Democrat senator express any opposition to that change. It was a logical change. It did not cost the taxpayer one cent. There was no reason not to amend the Electoral Act in a way that enabled the public funding to go in the direction that the administrative arm of that party wanted it to go. I would make the same amendments for any other political party if it did not cost the taxpayer anything. I think that was a misrepresentation by Senator Ray of both the Democrats’ position at that time and the import of that bill.
Having said that, getting back to this legislation, this is a sign of what happens when a government has control of the Senate. There is the risk that they can rort the very act that gets people elected here and tilt it more in their favour. That is shameful and should be opposed, and I hope that at least one member of the coalition in the Senate has the courage to do so. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (ELECTORAL INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2006-06-19,"—The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2006 covers a wide range of subjects in the Electoral Act that need adjusting. I intend today to speak about only one or two of these subjects, which I believe are the essentials that need to be addressed.
I want to speak today on party registration and party names, because I saw one of my colleagues, Larry Anthony, the former member for Richmond, defeated by a subterfuge, deceit or misleading conduct by the liberals for forests, as they were called at the time. My colleague the former member for Richmond had had a reasonable hold on that seat and had worked particularly hard in it. Mr Anthony was a National and he ran under that banner. He was defeated, by 301 votes, by a candidate who ran under the registered party name ‘liberals for forests’.
There were 1,417 votes collected by the liberals for forests candidate and Mr Anthony was beaten by 301 votes. I have heard that their how-to-vote cards and shirts were identical to those of the Liberals and that the party logo was identical to that of the Liberal Party. There was an absolute plan to deceive. I believe they deceived a number of people—particularly elderly people, who became distressed when they found out what had been achieved. This bill takes on board and addresses that problem.
We in the National Party have lost a very good member of parliament—and probably a prospective leader—but if that is the will of the people then I accept it. In politics, there is always a winner and a loser; I accept that, as long as it is fair and reasonable. But this was not fair. This was designed to mislead. I understand that the people of Richmond are very annoyed about this. I have been told that they are determined that they will reverse this, because they see that unfair play succeeded. Someone who had worked very hard in his electorate for over three terms of parliament was defeated by the group of people who ran as liberals for forests. When we in the Liberal and National parties run against each other, we direct preferences to each other. However, the liberals for forests directed preferences away from the National Party—there was no Liberal candidate at the time, which was even more confusing, to direct preferences to Larry Anthony. He lost the seat by 301 votes.
If ever there was a wrong that needed to be addressed it is that one, and it has been addressed in this particular bill. This subterfuge should have been addressed long ago. You cannot have ‘labor for the dolphins’ or ‘nationals for the turtles’ or liberals for whatever—such names are designed to mislead. The name ‘liberals for forests’ was designed to mislead. And it did mislead people—particularly the older people in the electorate, who became confused. Our polling booth workers pointed out the distress that it caused some people. So I am very pleased to see that a part of this legislation addresses that.
I am also pleased to note that, for postal voting or provisional voting, people will have to provide some form of personal identification. It is very easy—and it does happen—to register as Mr or Mrs Bloggs and to give an address that does not even exist or that is the address for a vacant block of land or a boarding house or even a factory. Yes, there are checks. Sometimes those checks are made; sometimes those checks are not made. Surely it is not too much of a hardship for anyone to turn up with a driver’s licence, a rates notice, a pension card or some other form of identification. Everyone in Australia must have some identification. It is easy to do that. It is not done in the seats where big margins are held, but sometimes it is done in seats where the result is going to depend on a knife-edge margin—such as the seat of Richmond.
I have been in the business of politics for many years. Traditionally, provisional votes go to the Labor Party. Fair enough; that is part of the electoral process.
—That’s why you don’t like it.
—I do not object to people voting for the Labor Party, but I do object to people being able to register for any address and not come up with proof of identity. I observed that, in the results in the seat of Richmond, up to around 80 per cent—from memory—of those provisional votes went against the sitting candidate. We all accept that provisional votes do, traditionally, favour the Labor Party, but not to such a high degree. You might get 60 per cent; you might even get 65 or 70 per cent, but, when it starts to come in around 80 per cent, you need to start saying: ‘If this is the case then let’s make it certain, by asking people to provide proof of identity when they register for a provisional vote.’ So I think this piece of legislation goes a long way, with these two particular aspects, to making the Electoral Act more fair, more reasonable and more certain. It certainly has my support.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (ELECTORAL INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-06-19,"—Listening to a number of speakers on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2006 has drawn me to speak on it now. I have had the opportunity to hear what Senator Boswell has said about this bill, as well as Senator Mason, who is on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I will deal more broadly with the issues that the Labor Party finds offensive and I will reflect on the name itself—that is, the ‘electoral integrity and other measures’ bill. That reminds me of the government’s view on naming bills in the industrial relations field. I think they have done the same thing with this bill. They have effectively named a bill by using a title which is misleading in itself—‘electoral integrity and other measures’. The ‘other measures’ is probably closer to the truth.
When you look at electoral integrity, this bill is far from it. The Liberal Party have been seeking many of the measures contained within this bill—not all of them; some of them are an improvement—over the last four, five or more years. They are now serving them up again, because they have got the numbers in this chamber. That seems clear. It is a pity that neither Senator Boswell nor Senator Mason mentioned that point. In truth, they went on about self-serving issues. I think the central issue of this bill is that it is democracy diminished, not democracy enlarged or improved—and perhaps that should have been the name this bill was given.
The purpose of this bill as stated was to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act in order to implement the government’s policy on electoral reform—and there they go again using the phrase ‘electoral reform’. It is far from reform; in truth, it is a reduction in democracy and they should admit to it. It is far easier to at least admit to it and then move onto the substantive issues. The major issue in this bill is to increase the threshold for disclosing gifts to party candidates from $1,500 to a whopping $10,000. But they do not leave it at that. To makes sure that they do not have to revisit it and that we do not have to have this debate again, in what could only be described as an excessive exercise, they have decided to link it to the CPI index so it will continue to rise, probably at the rate of some two or three per cent per year. This could only be described as Liberal Party heaven, because the Liberal Party have been seeking this for some time and they will succeed unless some on the other side see the light. But I doubt that will happen. I suspect when you look at their speeches and you hear the summing-up speech by the minister, they will argue that it is one of those provisions that will be helpful.
Yes, it will be helpful, of course, to the Liberal Party but it will not be helpful for democracy. It will be a backward step for democracy. The Liberals have been trying to do to this since 1999. Section 314AB of the Commonwealth Electoral Act requires all parties to disclose donations, and the limit or threshold is currently $1,500. This brings with it substantial transparency—and that is a word that the Liberals cannot say, see or come to grips with. Transparency brings with it the ability for parties and people to understand where the revenue, where the source of income, comes from—from people to political parties. That creates a more transparent system. It ensures that there is integrity in our system of democracy. They argue that a $10,000 limit will not change things much at all. It will most likely encourage people to change their pattern of donation to the Liberal Party. That is exactly why they have been promoting it. It will ensure that those people who want to remain anonymous will find ways to ensure that they can donate $9,999 to the Liberal Party and not have the source of funding disclosed. They will not have transparency.
It was argued in the original 2004 report that this measure has no policy merit at all. It will only diminish transparency between donations and the source, and it will ensure that the people who want to remain anonymous will do so. Senator Abetz has argued that the amount has been eroded by inflation over time. He is not living in the same inflationary period that we have been in if he thinks that $1,500 has been eroded to that extent. It was set 20 years ago. It was probably much too low then, he argues. I think that argument does not have any policy merit at all and misses the point completely. It is a poor defence by this government to argue those matters. It completely misses the whole issue.
Will it make a difference? Of course it will make a difference: $9,999 will be able to be donated anonymously to eight Liberal branches. That is where they know the difference will come in. They have the ability to use family relationships, so a husband and wife can each donate $9,999 to the eight branches of the Liberal Party throughout Australia. That is precisely where they want to be. They want to be in a position to ensure that their sources are not transparent where they can move cash from one source to the next.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-06-19,"—Senator Evans asked me a question about delivery dates for the MRH90 helicopters. I have an answer which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
MRH-90 Aircraft Delivery Dates.
The announcement by the Government today was for an additional 34 MRH-90 helicopters. Together with the 12 aircraft already committed to under Project Air 9000 Phase 2, this will mean 46 new aircraft.
Today’s announcement means that both Army and Navy will be using the same aircraft.
This joint approach will allow the Government to allocate aircraft as they come off the production line to firstly establish the joint training and support environment, before aircraft are allocated to areas of most need. This initiative will allow both Army and Navy to gradually transition to the new MRH-90 squadrons without causing wholesale reduction in capability.
The first aircraft will be delivered by the end of 2007, with gradual deliveries allowing the Sea King to be retired by mid 2010 as Navy aircrew are trained. Army will commence replacing its Blackhawk Squadrons as trained aircrew become available from between 2011 and 2015.
This process allows the Government to continue to provide capable squadrons able to protect Australia and its interests in a cost effective and timely manner.
The first aircraft to be acquired by Australia will be the 51st aircraft off the production line. By this time the other participating nations will have qualified the aircraft for service in their own defence forces.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence: Helicopters</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,5,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-06-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.
What we had again today was a Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs seeking to ensure that a ludicrous proposition would come true. It is almost impossible to believe that we now have a situation where the immigration minister is a proponent of a bill which will discriminate between those who arrive by sea and those who arrive by air. We have a position now where those people who arrive by sea to claim asylum and who are regarded as unlawful noncitizens upon arrival will be taken to offshore processing in Nauru, Manus Island or wherever else the minister can argue for, with conditions that we do not yet know, where they will not be able to have a review by the RRT, and they will not be able to have all of the things that we provide onshore.
With respect to children in detention, the minister ensured some time ago, with the pushing of her backbench, that children and families in detention would be removed. Now the position is that all of that is to be swept aside. You could call that either disingenuous or mischievous, or say that she has tried to hoodwink the backbench to bring this one back. But let me give a salutary warning: they are not easily hoodwinked. I suspect that she is now in a pack with them, trying to negotiate her way out—and it is not going to be easy. What the minister agreed to last time, and what she has now completely ignored, is that they were assured that those asylum seekers would have Ombudsman oversight, they would be processed within 90 days, and women and children would be out of detention.
That is the criteria, that is the high-water mark, and this minister is not going to be able to meet it. We have heard in the media already today that there is some suggestion that time limits are going to be imposed. But what are they going to be? More importantly, what do you do with those people who are going to be left to languish in Nauru? Currently, there are still two people on Nauru who have received adverse security assessments. What is she going to do with them? Process them within 90 days and return them to Australia?
This minister is making policy on the run. The Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 is really all about the Prime Minister trying to substantiate his position in terms of Indonesia and the West Papuan issue. It is not about good policy, it is not about dealing with unlawful noncitizens arriving in this country, and it is not about dealing with refugees in any fair or sensible way under Australian law. It is all about trying to deal with a flawed domestic policy and with Indonesia’s complaints.
This bill does represent a flawed policy. It is wrong. There is no argument about that. The opposition know that, the minor parties know that and the government backbenchers know that. I suspect the minister is going to come back with a couple of bits to support the backbench. What they should be doing is pressuring her to throw out the bill, because it can be regarded by many as containing serious breaches of Australia’s obligations under international law, particularly under the refugee convention.
This bill also represents deficient foreign policy in terms of the perceived attempt to appease Indonesia over the situation in West Papua. There is no clearer message about this bill than a quote from the committee report that looked into it which said that the bill is ‘an inappropriate response to what is essentially a foreign policy issue’. If this government were serious, it would send its foreign policy minister to Indonesia to talk to them rather than come back with this failed attempt. The legislation is about seeking to pretend Australia has no border and dumping people in other countries. Labor will be voting no on this bill. We think that this bill is irredeemable, that this legislation is wrong in substance and that its motivation is unforgivable. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-06-19,"—I think that was an extraordinarily disappointing contribution from Senator Ludwig, with the greatest respect to him, to the taking note of answers. It just reinforced the point that Labor’s position in relation to this is pure political point scoring at its worst, at the expense of our international relationships. It is populist at best. The Labor Party are trying to wind back the clock. Their hypocrisy in relation to these matters today is breathtaking.
I will mention for Senator Ludwig names such as Ashmore and Cartier Islands and Christmas Island. What did the Labor Party do in 2001? They supported offshore processing. But, all of a sudden, because it is about somewhere else geographically, it is not supported. What gross hypocrisy. I will quote for you, Senator Ludwig, some comments by the member for Brand. I suspect that my senatorial colleague Senator McGauran will probably have some as well.
—I will repeat yours.
—Thank you! In 2001, the member for Brand, Kim Beazley, made his views known ad nauseam in relation to this. On 16 October the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, as he still is now, stated:
Australia can only stop the flood of boats by fixing our relationship with Indonesia. A real solution must be found in Jakarta.
Talking about border protection earlier that day on 6PR, he stated:
... in the end the only solution to the problem that we now confront resides around the relationship that we have with Indonesia and the attitudes that develop in this region to illegal people movement.
Exactly. So what are the Labor Party seeking to do now? They are using the international relationship that Mr Beazley said was so important for some political point scoring. It is gross hypocrisy. I am sure that Senator McGauran will mention the word ‘leadership’, which Mr Beazley mentioned as well. What a gross abrogation of his responsibilities as a leader to behave the way he is at the moment in relation to this matter.
What the Australian people are looking for from the Australian Labor Party, which they have not seen for 10 years, is some leadership in relation to any issue, and none can be more important than our relationship with Indonesia. It needs to be dealt with in a delicate way and leadership needs to be shown. For the Australian Labor Party to allege in the public domain that this matter is about Indonesia is absolutely and totally wrong, and they know it is wrong. As my colleague said, it is un-Australian. It is un-Australian to be using that relationship to score cheap political points.
The Labor Party’s views in relation to the issue of offshore processing, although they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to give them, are well known to every person in this chamber, to every person in the other place and to every member of the Australian community. They will see them, quite rightly, as being absolutely duplicitous in relation to this matter. I cannot believe that Senator Ludwig, in what was a very poor response to a very serious question, can still pursue the line that this is in some way kowtowing to Indonesia. This is about maintaining the integrity of a policy that the Australian Labor Party have themselves signed up to, with the greatest reluctance, because they were forced to do so by the Australian community, who can see the fallacy of what they were doing.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-06-19,"—Ever since the Prime Minister infamously declared that he would decide who would come to this country and the circumstances in which they would come, we as a country have lurched from one crisis to another when it comes to immigration policy. Is it any wonder at all that we face the problems that we currently do? The Howard government have a hardline approach that does not allow for any flexibility. Under their proposals, there will be no appeal to Australian law, because they are effectively going to put Australia outside of Australian law. This latest move is an attempt to remove the Australian mainland from our very own migration laws. How ridiculous is that?
—Is Tasmania part of Australia?
—As Senator Sterle says, we need to qualify for the Tasmanians whether Tasmania is going to be part of this ridiculous parade of folly. What have we had under this current government’s watch? We have had Tampa, we have had ‘children overboard’ and we have had the SIEVX. We have had Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez, and the scandal of six inmates with severe mental illnesses compulsorily detained in Baxter even though the government promised that that would no longer happen. It is an absolute outrage. Now the government complains when they have been hoisted with their own petard. They have given us their latest instalment of migration changes which pander or kowtow to the Indonesians over the West Papuans.
That is the essential dilemma that the government have. They have told us that they are tough on border security. They have told us that they are going to be tough on illegal arrivals—even though you must admit that it was not until talkback radio raised the issue that the government did anything. But they promised that they would be tough. They told us that they would decide who would come here and the circumstance under which they would come. We now see from evidence before Senate committees and from the Palmer report that they have not shared the full story with the parliament or the Australian public. We have lurched from one stuff-up to another, with bungles and overzealous applications of policies bringing us to this current fiasco—policies that allow a department to deport our own citizens.
Then the Indonesian government complained about 42 asylum seekers. So what do we have to do? We have to change our migration laws so Australia is no longer part of the Australian migration zone; so Australia does not have a migration zone—except perhaps if Tasmania is in it. This is a pathetic excuse for a system. The fact is that the government gagged debate in the other place last week. They are still struggling to cobble together a deal so that they can introduce the legislation in this place, because they cannot even convince their own members and senators to support this ludicrous, ideologically driven and crazy proposition.
It is now time for this government to front up for once and do the decent thing. They need to concede that after 10 long years the system is broken and they need to fix it. And fixing it does not mean excising Australia from its own migration zone; it means coming up with an immigration system that has decency and fairness at its core and then implementing it in a non-partisan, non-ideologically driven way. At the moment, all we have time and time again are examples of this government coming in here unable to explain exactly what is going on.
After this proposed legislation goes through—if it goes through; if you can ever get the numbers in the party room by making people compromise on their principles or by coming up with a decent set of proposals—there will be no more legislative excuses. You will have to front up to the fact that you cannot administer it and that you are not up to the job. This portfolio has always come in for its fair share of criticism over the years, but nothing like what we are seeing now. This is complete incompetence. It is a complete shambles when you have an administrative system that detains those with mental illness and deports Australian citizens, and then you want to excise Australia from its own migration zone.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-06-19,"—There is something very telling about the debate today in question time and, in fact, the debate we had all last week. As we know, question time all last week—and it looks like the same pattern will be followed this week—was focused on this issue of border protection. It has been a pretty weak but nevertheless concerted effort against Senator Vanstone. But there is something very telling about that. The Labor Party are making their centrepiece the industrial relations legislation, an issue that has been covered in the media week in and week out, and yet not one single question has been asked in relation to industrial relations—not one. Senator Abetz, the lonely minister, has sat there waiting for a question from the other side on the real issue of the day. We have already settled on border protection, and the other side know that. If they dare go to the next election on this issue rather than on industrial relations, we will settle it like we did in 2001.
The really telling issue here—

Senator Webber interjecting—

—Senator Webber, can I pick you up on an issue? Don’t you come into this parliament and hang the SIEVX on this government. That is an outrageous claim. That was a tragedy that all confess and admit was the doing of people smugglers. You ought to be ashamed of pointing the finger at this government. In fact, you ought to apologise about that SIEVX claim. What a disgrace; what an opportunist. What a pathetic debate you ran in relation to that. The real point—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—The two union men over there have not got the courage to defend the Labor position in the industrial relations debate. They have not got the courage to stand up in here and tell the public and the parliament why they are going to abolish the unfair dismissal laws and why they are going to abolish the secondary boycott laws. That is a hidden agenda. They are going to abolish the secondary boycott laws to give the Maritime Workers Union all that power back. Why are they going to abolish AWAs? There has been no debate on that in this parliament. How pathetic.
Instead, they rely on what they think is an old faithful—border protection. Let me tell you about border protection. In the national interest, the government is bringing in this legislation.

Senator Ronaldson interjecting—

—What my colleague invited me to do is to quote their own leader on this very issue to point out their utter opportunism in attacking this government for kowtowing to Indonesia—which is absolutely wrong and which has been rejected. I do not think that they have convinced anyone but their own side in regard to that. Let us quote what the Labor Party’s leader, Mr Beazley, the member for Brand, said in regard to relationships with Indonesia on this very issue. On 16 October, he said:
Australia can only stop the flood of boats by fixing our relationship with Indonesia. A real solution must be found in Jakarta.
In talking about border protection earlier in that same period, he stated:
In the end, the only solution to the problem we now confront resides around the relationship that we have with Indonesia and the attitudes that develop in this region to illegal people-smuggling.
He went on to say:
What we need to do is exercise a bit of leadership, because we want circumstances where people who come here illegally go back to the point they came from and get processed there.
He continued:
That is the true disincentive for people coming down in the way in which they have been doing. Everything else has been tried. Let’s try that.
In other words, his solution was to tow the boats back to West Papua, Indonesia or wherever they came from. That quote is an indication that he wanted to tow the boats back—but, of course, we all know that was an opportunist quote at the time. We all know that what you are running in here is also opportunist. We reject the flimsy arguments and the opportunism that the opposite side walk in here with with regard to border protection. We are acting in the national interest.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2006-06-19,"—I rise to take dispassionate note of Senator Vanstone’s answer to my question this afternoon in relation to the current debate on refugees. I would also like to comment on some of the statements made by Senator Ronaldson and just lately by Senator McGauran. I remind the chamber that we on this side of parliament had to hear ad nauseam only a few years ago the Prime Minister—and Senator Webber rightly quoted him—saying, ‘We will decide who comes to this country and we will decide the circumstances under which they come.’ Yet one could hardly not come to the conclusion in relation to the events over the last few months that, as a result of significant pressure from the Indonesian government, we are about to embark on a course that will change our migration/refugee policy.
Last week, you, of all people, Mr Deputy President Hogg, would be aware that there was significant lobbying done in relation to the Australian Capital Territory’s civil union legislation. Concern was expressed by a number of people who were uncomfortable with that legislation and about how to vote on the disallowance of it. During the lead-up to that debate, I received not one representation from a member of any particular church or faith. I never received a phone call from a bishop, a priest, a nun or a brother to lobby me one way or the other on that particular piece of legislation. However, since it became clear that the government was going to introduce this proposed migration legislation, I have been lobbied significantly by members of the clergy of all Christian denominations, not just my own faith of Catholicism, who are extremely concerned about the direction the government is taking with the proposed asylum seeker laws.
I would like to remind the chamber what the granting of asylum is about. It is meant to be a humanitarian act; it is not meant to be a political statement. If the government go back to that single premise, that is where they can probably extricate themselves from the difficulty that they have got into at the moment. We have all seen the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and its recommendations: unanimous in the position they are taking on this proposed migration legislation. They say that the proposal is irredeemable in its current form. Why wouldn’t it be?
As I have said, I have had representations from various church groups, let alone all the other groups in our Commonwealth, about this proposed legislation. The legislation places asylum seekers beyond the reach of Australian law. Once again, it puts women and children in detention. It allows for indefinite detention. There will no longer be, as I understand it, case-managed mental health. There will be no professional assistance available to those people. There will be no visitors or charitable or religious assistance available to them. The Commonwealth Ombudsman loses oversight when they are sent to these islands for processing. There is no access for these men, women and children to the Refugee Review Tribunal or Australian courts for a judicial review. The people who are processed offshore are treated differently.
We are signatories to the 1951 convention on the status of refugees. We are one of the countries who signed it in that period. Nauru is not a signatory to that protocol. We do not even know what visa conditions these people will be subject to when they go offshore to these islands. They are subject to those islands’ visa conditions, not anything that we put there. In fact, I think it was only reported last week in the Age that ASIO agents tried to go to Nauru and they were refused entry. (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-06-19,"—At the request of the Chair of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move that the following legislative instruments, a list of which I shall hand to the Clerk, be disallowed.
The list read as follows—

Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) (National Standards) Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 2), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 9 and made under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—

Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Instrument Fixing Charges No. 1 of 2006

This Instrument specifies charges payable on a voluntary basis by those general insurers who contribute data to and receive information from the National Claims and Policies Database during each of the 2004-05 and 2005-06 financial years.
The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on the following matters.
First, the instrument is dated 10 February 2005. It is not clear whether the date of signing of this instrument contains a typographical error (in that it should refer to 10 February 2006), or whether there has been a 12 month delay in registering the instrument.
Secondly, the instrument specifies charges for a period of time before it was made (whether that be February 2005 or 2006).
Thirdly, it is not clear in which sense the charge is voluntary. Clauses 4 and 5 of the Schedule to the instrument state that the charge is to be paid by an insurer within 28 days following receipt of a request and invoice from APRA.
Finally, the instrument contains three different definitions of the term ‘NCPD insurer’. One is found in the general interpretation section of the instrument. The second is found in clause 7 of the Schedule. The second definition varies from the first by adding the words ‘or Lloyd’s underwriter’ and ‘or reportable facility business’. The third definition is found in the Annexure A. The third definition varies from the second by referring to 1 January 2003, instead of 1 January 2006, the latter date being used in the first two definitions.

Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 40

These Regulations amend regulation 9.01 of the principal Regulations, concerning the making of threats regarding aviation security. The Explanatory Statement accompanying these Regulations does not contain a consultation statement in accordance with section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. The Minister advised that consultation was undertaken during the development of these Regulations and the Committee is seeking further advice on the nature of that consultation.

Fisheries Levy (Torres Strait Prawn Fishery) Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 3

These Regulations specify a levy for licences granted or renewed in the Torres Strait Prawn Fishery. The Explanatory Statement accompanying these Regulations does not contain a consultation statement in accordance with section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 200 The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on whether consultation was undertaken and, if so, the nature of that consultation.

Income Tax (Effective Life of Depreciating Assets) Amendment Determination 2006 (No. 1) made under subsection 40-100(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

This instrument amends the principal Determination concerning the effective life, for tax treatment purposes, of copyright in a feature film.
This instrument was made on 14 February 2006 and is expressed to commence retrospectively on 1 July 2004. The Explanatory Statement does not contain an assurance, in terms of subsection 12(2) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, that this retrospective operation does not adversely affect the rights or liabilities of any person other than the Commonwealth. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking an assurance that no person has been adversely affected.

Insurance (Prudential Standard) Determination No. 2 of 2006


Insurance (Prudential Standard) Determination No. 3 of 2006

These Determinations specify prudential standards for general insurers governing risk management, audit and actuarial reporting valuation.
Clause 4 of Determination No. 2 of 2006 permits certain requirements to be complied with on an insurance group basis, provided that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has been notified and has agreed. The clause does not specify that this notification, or APRA’s agreement should be in writing.
Clause 35 of Determination No. 3 of 2006 states that an approved auditor or actuary must not notify an insurer of certain matters where there is “a situation of mistrust” between the auditor or actuary and the board or senior manager of the insurer. The scope of the expression ‘a situation of mistrust’ is uncertain, and may cause difficulties for auditors or actuaries.
The Minister has responded to the Committee’s concerns with these instruments but the Committee has decided to seek further information on the above matters.

Migration Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 10

These Regulations amend the principal Regulations concerning the scope of certain powers of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the discretion of the Minister for Immigration in granting visas in certain circumstances.
Item [1] of Schedule 1 to these Regulations provides that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may determine, as a ground for cancellation of a visa, that the holder of a visa is a person whose presence in Australia is contrary to Australia’s foreign policy interests, or is directly or indirectly associated with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Minister for Foreign Affairs advised that the term ‘contrary to Australia’s foreign policy interests’ is to be given its ordinary meaning, with decisions on visa applications and/or visas made personally by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on a case-by-case basis. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking a briefing on this matter.

Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) (National Standards) Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 2), Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 9

These Regulations amend the principal Regulations to give effect to the national standard for the Storage and Handling of Workplace Dangerous Goods.
Regulation 8.15 imposes an obligation on an employer to identify hazards that are associated with the storage or handling of dangerous goods at the workplace. Subregulation 8.15(2) supplies a non-inclusive list of matters that are to be taken into account in identifying such hazards. Paragraph 8.15(2)(g) requires an employer to consider ‘the kind and characteristics of incidents associated with the dangerous goods’. The ambit of the word ‘incidents’ is unclear.
Subregulation 8.27(4) imposes an obligation on an employer to review an emergency plan at certain times. No offence is specified for a failure to comply with this obligation. It is not clear whether this is intended to be an offence-creating provision. Further, under subparagraph 8.27(4)(b) the obligation to review an emergency plan arises if there is a change in circumstances at the workplace. The ambit of the phrase ‘change in circumstances’ is unclear and is not defined.
The Minister advised that Comcare is developing a Code of Practice to support the Regulations that will provide further examples and circumstances of what should be considered dangerous goods incidents when identifying and assessing risks and that it was therefore not necessary to include such examples in the Regulations. The Committee has written again to the Minister seeking further advice as to why this information cannot be included in the Regulations.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-19,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for all political parties and all levels of government to make the long term commitment of working constructively together with Indigenous Australians and communities to address the completely unsatisfactory health and housing situations faced by many Indigenous people.
I have raised this urgency motion today because I believe it is very important for the Senate, and for the political process more broadly, to continually remind itself about the necessity of giving priority to the situation faced by Indigenous Australians. I believe from conversations I have had with many senators in this place over a number of years that the vast majority of us would and do very genuinely want to see an improvement in the situation faced by Indigenous Australians.
What I believe is the unavoidable truth is that, frankly, the political system itself—and most of us within it—really does not know how best to go about it. It is about time we looked at the evidence to back up that claim. There would not be another area of public policy where the political system has so comprehensively failed as in the area of Indigenous affairs. Over the 105 years since Federation there has been a litany of failure on the part of the political process, sometimes driven by malevolence, sometimes by disinterest and sometimes with genuine goodwill, but in almost all cases with unintended consequences. As a general result today we have reached the point where there is obviously still major inequality and a significant situation where the average Indigenous Australian has far fewer opportunities than other people in the country.
Nowhere is this more starkly and inexcusably reflected than in the basic statistic—a statistic that we should remember is reflected by living, breathing human beings—that the life expectancy of the average Indigenous Australian is at least 17 years shorter than the rest of us. What continues to frustrate me and many people is that we have such a stark health statistic, which states that a group of people in our community live 17 years less on average than the rest of us, and yet it is not a political scandal of the highest order and it is not priority No. 1 for all political parties and all parliaments—state, federal and territory. That, I believe, is simply because it is literally in the too hard basket. It is literally an issue which the political system as a whole does not know how to address so we lurch from crisis to crisis, from short-term solution to short-term solution, and the overall situation—whether it is health, housing or violence in communities—continues to be one that is totally unsatisfactory.
What I do not seek to do by this motion is to point fingers of blame at any particular party or level of government. The political system as a whole, as I have said, has plenty of blame to go around. I think we have all failed—all major parties, all levels of government and indeed I would be quite prepared to put smaller parties in that category of failing as well—because none of us, the smaller parties included, have given adequate priority to the need to overcome this single, most disgraceful inequality in modern Australia. We all know the statistics and the different stories and situations, whether in fundamentals such as health and housing or some other areas.
I want to point to one aspect that needs to be given more emphasis. We repeatedly hear that you will not solve the problem by throwing more money at it. Certainly, if you just throw money of any amount—small or large—at a problem without direction and without seeking to ensure that it is properly spent then, no, you will not help. But that should not be taken to mean that it does not need more resources, because clearly, in some of these areas, there is a need for more resources—in health and housing in particular. The Australian Medical Association has estimated that we are hundreds of millions of dollars short of what we need to address Indigenous health. Similar amounts of money are needed up-front, in large amounts, to deal with the ridiculous overcrowding in many Indigenous communities in housing. Whilst these are large sums of money they are also only the price of one or two of the latest high-tech fighter planes of which we are seeking to buy another 20 or 30. It is a matter of priority.
By this motion I do not seek to blame. I seek to put the pressure and obligation on all of us, on all sides of politics and all levels of government to give greater priority to this issue, to keep reminding ourselves of it day after day rather than just responding with the right sounding words whenever it hits the headlines. We need to be working on it when it is not in the headlines. We need to be working on it day after day, continually, and we need to be working on it with Indigenous communities. There is still too much of governments getting together—as we are seeing with the summit in the near future—and determining solutions that are once again going to be imposed on Indigenous communities. It is a long-term task—it will take 20 or 30 years. It will take all of us working together and it will take all of us having to work with and listen to Indigenous communities to find out what will work for them. (Time expired)

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-06-19,"—I rise to support this very important motion. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Senator Bartlett on using this time in the Senate today for something that is very, very important—not only to myself as a Territorian but to all Australians. It is vital that we work together constructively to address the lot of Indigenous Australians and particularly of those who are living, by and large, in Indigenous communities. I will be supporting you, Senator Bartlett, and the Democrats in this very important motion.
I am particularly proud to be part of a government that is showing leadership in almost every aspect of this particularly important policy area. I am not so sure that all jurisdictions are doing the same. I am not so sure that they will pay much attention to this motion for working together. I have been working very closely in the Northern Territory with Mal Brough over the last couple of months, and it has been well reported how Australians generally have responded to action in this area. It is disappointing that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Clare Martin, told us a number of things, the first of which was: ‘We need action, not words.’ That is what we need, Mr Deputy President—action.
—She is right about that.
—Thank you, Senator Carr. Action—I am glad you understand what that actually means. Of course, she changed her mind the next week. She said she was going to the summit and then she said she was not going to the summit. Suddenly she said, ‘No summit.’ So we have ‘Turnaround Martin’. It is all right, Senator Carr, you would understand this: let us have a 20-year plan, something that comes from the back blocks of Jurassic Park in the Soviet Union. That is where that sort of stuff comes from. Let us have a 20-year plan. Nothing changes in 20 years, Mr Deputy President, according to those on the other side, and that is why they are a completely policy-free area on Indigenous affairs.
Of course, we are not sure what the plan will consist of—probably more of what we have got from the other side—but I would hope not. They say: ‘If you break your house, if you don’t look after it, if you bash it, if you have a riot or you destroy it, we’ll just build you a new one.’ It is all part of the same welfare mentality that has brought Indigenous Australians to such terrible circumstances.
I can tell you that people are sick of listening to all of those arguments that we have from fundamentalists on the other side. We cannot go and do the same thing and expect a different outcome. Those days are over. This government is about action and about changing the lot of Indigenous Australians. Clare wants to discuss which way we want to go. We do not need a 20-year plan. We actually know what needs to be done now. What we need, Clare, is action. I know what Indigenous Territorians have told me throughout time. They are like every other Australian. There is no difference at all. They simply want to be able to buy their own homes and have a good education. They want some safety in their communities. They want some employment. Also, again, there is the fundamental issue of simply having a bit of hope.
—They will be disappointed then, won’t they!
—We continue to have interjections from the other side. I have to say that they should really focus on trying to get some answers to this issue because they are being substantially left behind. The principle that most Territorians and I know all Indigenous Australians want is equality in their communities. That is exactly what they are going to get under this government. We actually plan to make sure that people live in communities that work in exactly the way that every other community works. It is a very simple process. It is a process of normalisation.
Everybody accepts that not all of these communities are the same. I know I have a number of comparisons. If you go to one of the communities in my electorate, Daly River, you will find that it is quite a well functioning community. The houses are wonderful. When you look at it, it is no different from any other place in regional Australia. Yes, we need to go a long way, but I know that Miriam Rose Bowman and others will show the leadership that is necessary in that place to ensure that that goes forward.
I have to say that one of the principal concerns that I think we have—or most Australians do—is: why is it so different in Indigenous communities? It is that fundamental question that this government has focused very much on answering in the last few months. If we are going to have normalisation in these places, we have to accept that many of the Indigenous communities, particularly in my electorate, are communities where the demographic is such that they live in an area where there is not necessarily a whole range of resources. There are not the opportunities available in those areas that there would be in other places.
But, of course, they are trapped. They are trapped because of one issue: education. I am talking not only about learning to read and write but also about simply having sufficient education and confidence, as the leaders in those communities do—the older people in those communities have those skills—to be able to leave the communities and home towns where they were born and go out into the external community to work, as other Territorians and Australians do. If you look anywhere in regional Australia, you will find that there are plenty of demographics where the opportunities adjacent to where people live are small in number. They are not opportunities that will allow a population to grow and thrive without creating massive unemployment. That is simply because of the opportunities that are adjacent to those areas geographically.
Of course, we do not have that demographic reflected in Indigenous communities. Indigenous communities tend to remain static in their own country. Instead of having the confidence to move out and ensure that they can take opportunities in other areas, they cannot move. That is fundamentally about education. When you have an education, you have choice. The passport to freedom in an Indigenous sense is an education. In so many of the communities now, particularly in remote regional Australia, we have a centre hub. Around the centre hub we have what we call outstations. The outstation argument has been argued up and down. People need to be on country, but it has taken people away from those services.
A fundamental rule of the way forward would have to be that, if we are going to support places like outstations and homelands, we need to make sure that they are in fact connected in some way throughout the year to adequate education and health services. That is an absolute fundamental. It happens everywhere else in Australia. Without that building block of education, I think the circumstances we will find are that Indigenous housing and health in these communities are going to be again offset by the very small number of opportunities that present themselves.
This motion also goes specifically to housing. There are a couple of fundamentals on how we approach Indigenous housing. We have asked the states and territories to provide, effectively, housing. There are a number of mechanisms through which that is done. But I have to say that it is very sad that some jurisdictions around Australia—and it appears that it is in fact all jurisdictions around Australia—when it comes to Indigenous housing are failing miserably. That is not just a measure of what I think or a political statement based on the fact that they are all represented by the Labor Party. The fact of the matter is that $141 million less was spent on Indigenous housing in all of those states and territories than should have been the case. That is an outrage.
I think that people on the other side who are trying to take any sort of moral high ground need to rethink their position, talk to their state and territory colleagues, get on the program and ensure that they spend the funds that are appropriated directly on that housing. Actually, they need to perhaps take a little bit of advice from some of their leadership. I think it is about leadership. It is a fundamental aspect of this. The ALP national president, Warren Mundine, says that the ALP needs to make changes in its approach to Indigenous policy. Where were they for nine months when we were trying to cut off the head of the sacred cow, ATSIC? Where were they then? They were wasting time. We would not be having the debate if ATSIC were alive and well and standing in the way of good governance, leadership and progress in this matter. Again, there are delays. He goes on to say, referring to the ALP:
... the party had to look more favourably at the mutual obligation deals now being struck between Aboriginal communities and the Federal Government.
They fought that all of the way. Again, I implore those on the other side to have a little bit more of a progressive look at this issue. At the moment, as we speak here, we are now debating in the other place the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. As I understand it, those on the other side are in fact opposing it. They are opposing measures that would allow people to own their own homes—a fundamental right, I believe, of Australians. They will be able to own their own homes. They will not be able to own their own homes unless we get support from all people in this place. Yes, we will probably get it through because it is commonsense, but I appeal for a bit of commonsense from the other side. (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-06-19,"—I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Bartlett. I commend him for doing so, because he seeks to rise above the sort of contribution that Senator Scullion made. Senator Bartlett tried to focus on the needs of Indigenous people and the way forward, unlike the grandstanding, point-scoring and petty political attacks that characterised Senator Scullion’s performance and that of the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs—
—It is not a petty issue.
—No, it is not a petty issue. Senator, stick to abusing coppers.
—This is not a petty issue.
—This is not a petty issue, but your government’s performance has been petty—with everything being the state government’s fault and everybody else’s fault, and you taking no responsibility.
What I want to do is concentrate on the aspects of the motion that I think ought to be given support—for example, the long-term focus on plans that are not just driven by the latest media frenzy but fundamentally attack the causes of the disadvantages—and call for a bit of a bipartisan approach, to take some of this petty politics that we have just seen out of the debate, and to a focus on the disadvantage.
Minister Brough has very much focused on the symptoms. This motion seeks to focus on the causes. I suggest, Senator Bartlett, that your motion should have done both—because both need to be tackled. Mr Brough is right in saying that we have to tackle the symptoms by providing extra policing and measures that help prevent the violence and child abuse occurring in the first place. But we also have to recognise—as I think Minister Brough is coming around to recognise—that we have to focus on the housing needs, the employment needs, the education needs and the economic development needs. A lot of what occurs in terms of Indigenous disadvantage in this country is effectively caused by their poverty. These are fundamental issues of poverty, and the economic disadvantage is a root cause of a whole range of these other symptoms. So we have to address both the symptoms and the causes.
I think the issues about Indigenous disadvantage are well known. The bottom line is that there is nearly a 20-year gap in life expectancy between European Australians and Aboriginal Australians. That has not shifted for years. We have made no progress. If we look at all the indicators about progress—health statistics, employment statistics et cetera—we see that very little or no progress has been made over successive governments. I remind members of the government that they have been in power for 10 or 11 years. They have some responsibility for where we are at now. And changing the policy name from ‘practical reconciliation’ to ‘the quiet revolution’ does not address the fact that they have done nothing to significantly alter the life expectancy and conditions of Indigenous people. And I concede that the previous Labor government also made very little headway on that. So we have a joint responsibility.
In the House of Representatives today, Minister Brough was looking for the cheap political attack, looking for the cheap point scoring, looking to blame the state governments and looking to try to position Labor as being anti home ownership. We have been in favour of home ownership for 100 years. We were actually in favour of it for poor working European Australian citizens. We have always been in favour of it for all, including for Indigenous Australians. But that is not what this is about; it is about responding to the serious concerns of Indigenous violence and child abuse—which have been put on the agenda again recently.
I remind the government that the Prime Minister had a national summit in 2003. What happened? Nothing. Virtually nothing has occurred in the interim. There was also a national outcry in 1999. Both occurred while this government have been in power. But now the government come in and say, ‘Get on board; we’ve got the magic solution.’ Senator Scullion knows that there are no magic solutions or quick fixes. We need a national commitment from all sides of politics, from business, from the community and from Indigenous people. Unless we get that, we will just have another point-scoring debate, which will leave Aboriginal people worse off. I encourage the government to actually think about it.
Minister Brough was in the House of Representatives today talking about ‘communist enclaves’. He described Indigenous people’s communities as ‘communist enclaves’. Have you ever heard anything more politically charged and more designed to denigrate those people who live there and to provide a divisive debate? It is again all about the wedge and about the denigration of Indigenous people, and it is not about improving the way forward. When I offer bipartisanship to him and when I genuinely try to get some cooperation, I get back name-calling. I get ‘You’re wishy, washy’ or ‘You’ve got your head in the sand’—all that sort of stuff. That is the sort of statesmanlike leadership we are getting at the moment!
I believe Mr Brough was genuinely surprised—I do not know where he has been all his life—when he ran into the entrenched poverty, disadvantage and violence that exist in Indigenous communities. I give him that. But to think that he can rampage around the community, blaming people and thinking that somehow he is going to fix it all by pulling publicity stunts is just wrong. We know it is wrong. We know it has not worked before. We have had Labor ministers, Liberal ministers and Prime Ministers go out and do their publicity stunt in a remote community and come back to Canberra and say that it was a life-changing experience—and what changes? Nothing. Their life might have changed, but nothing changes for the Indigenous people living in those communities. I do not want to see that happen again.
I think if the government could pull back and think about it, they would realise that they need us. They need the state governments, they need federal Labor and they need people like the head of News Ltd—who made a very good contribution the other day. To overcome Indigenous disadvantage, we need everyone. If Mr Brough things that he can do it on his own, I have news for him: he will be another failed minister for Aboriginal affairs. There is a long list of them—mainly good people. Some of them are still working in the area. I met with Fred Chaney the other day. Twenty years on and he is still fighting to improve Indigenous people’s life experiences. There are good people who are committed to the cause who have not had a substantial impact because of the entrenched problems. There is no quick fix, and people ought to recognise it.
I do not want to see what is happening at the moment. Minister Brough is doing damage as he goes around the communities, because he is bringing disrespect on a lot of the Indigenous people. They have been calling for assistance to combat violence and abuse for years and years. A delegation of Aboriginal women from Queensland tried to spark the Prime Minister’s interest in 1999. They said, ‘We need action now.’ They were desperate. We are seven years on. In 2003, after the last outrage at the publicity concerning violence, the Prime Minister said that we would have a national framework to tackle it. Clearly, that has not worked. Clearly, the commitment somehow faded. Clearly, the resolve was not maintained.
I can blame the federal government for that, but where does that get us? Nowhere. It does not get us anywhere. If Minister Brough wants to debate what the states have not done, I will take him through what he has not done in Wadeye: the housing never turned up; the expenditure on housing has not occurred. I know it is always somebody else’s fault. What happened to the money that was supposed to be provided for the community patrol in the town? It never happened. It is three years on and it has still not happened. They promised a community patrol; they promised the money. It has not happened. They wanted a crime prevention grant in October to prevent the violence that occurred the other month—the violence that so shocked the minister. What happened? No funding. So do not come in here and say that it is all someone else’s fault. It is the fault of all of us. Until we all take responsibility, until we stop this stupid name-calling and blame, we are not going to make any progress. We all have to actually accept responsibility.
A point I want to make is that a senior Aboriginal man told me the other day that Mr Brough is like a willy-willy: he comes out of nowhere and he leaves a trail of destruction, but it is all just wind. Aboriginal people feel that the categorising of Indigenous people as child molesters and perpetrators of violence has disparaged them all. They feel that all their efforts to tackle those problems have been laid to waste; that the efforts that have been made by thousands of Indigenous people throughout the community are being discounted. Those are the sorts of issues that the minister has to address. He has to come to terms with those things.
At the very important summit that ANTaR ran this morning to discuss some of those issues, someone made the point that the government has to do things with Aboriginal people, not do things to them. There is a clear difference. Minister Brough’s approach is about doing things to them: telling them what they have done wrong and that he can fix it all. We all know that the solution is to do things with Indigenous people. All the international experience tells us that and all the experience in Australia tells us that. Minister Brough going around and telling them what they have to do, what they have done wrong and how he will fix it will not provide the solution. We all know that and I am sure that Senator Scullion knows that. Home ownership is part of the answer but it is not the whole answer. We have to actually build support for positive change to address these issues in a long-term way. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-06-19,"—We are all aware of the statistics on health and housing in Aboriginal communities: a 17-year gap in life expectancy, high levels of childhood mortality and morbidity and high levels of death and disablement from predictable diseases—for example, ear infections and trachea. You hear stories all the time about children going to school but that there is not much point because some of them have such severe ear infections that they cannot actually hear what they are being taught. It is no wonder that they get bored and do not want to be there. There are countless reports about housing conditions, where between 15 and 20 people live in a three-bedroom house with one bathroom.
There is also report upon report and strategy upon strategy. These issues have been around for a long time. They have not suddenly eventuated because Mr Brough has become the minister and has gone out to a few Aboriginal communities and because the media has suddenly decided, yet again, for a short space of time, that there is a crisis going on. That crisis has been going on for a very long time, as is articulated and is evident from the figures that I have just gone through, and they are just the tip of the iceberg. We have continued to have a cycle of knee-jerk reaction, crisis, piecemeal approach and extremely short term funding—funding cycles of 12 months, for example. Yet again, just today I heard about another example of a funding program that was proposed for 12 months. The difference is that the organisation that was being offered the money said: ‘No, we’re not going to do it any more. You think that we can fix this problem in 12 months.’ They cannot, so they refused to take the money. I say: good on them; send the government a message.
I was also at the ANTaR forum this morning and Tom Calma gave yet another excellent presentation. He talked about the strategy on violence that was released in 2004. That strategy was a good one. That strategy talked about the key things that need to be done. But, guess what? It is not being implemented. There is a bookshelf full of reports not being implemented. The reports talk about the bad statistics, but nothing is being done. The government has missed an opportunity yet again, this year, with the budget. It handed out billions of dollars of tax cuts without addressing housing. You only have to open up the latest report by Social Justice Commissioner Tom Calma to see how much funding is needed to address Aboriginal housing in this country. What is the figure? It is $2.1 billion. And what do they get? A measly amount in the budget.
It is the same with health. Even to bring Aboriginal communities up to the standards of non-Aboriginal communities, the estimate is half a million dollars a year. Money is given back as tax cuts to people who do not really need it. If they were asked, ‘Would you rather invest this money in Aboriginal communities so that we can close the mortality gap of 17 years?’ and if they had a true picture of what was going on and the impacts in those communities, I would bet that a lot of people would say, ‘Yes, we want that money spent in those communities.’ There is always this approach: ‘Let’s turn around and blame the service deliverers’; ‘Let’s blame ATSIC’; ‘Let’s get rid of ATSIC’. We all know ATSIC delivered only one-seventh of the money that was going to Aboriginal communities. And there is: ‘Let’s blame self-determination, community empowerment and capacity building. They just haven’t done it, so it’s not our fault that they’re still suffering from significant disadvantage.’ That was never the intention of self-determination, community empowerment and capacity building.
Of course, the proposal never was that everything would be handed over and heaped on the shoulders of Aboriginal communities for them to deal with it alone, without government support, without the support of the agencies and without delivering the services that every other Australian expects. Aboriginal communities expect, and have a right to, the same sort of service delivery. They have a right to equality of health and equality of housing conditions. I again turn to Tom Calma’s work as the Social Justice Commissioner. The plan he has put forward is for Aboriginal Australians to reach equality within a generation. His plan puts through a series of goals and benchmarks that we should be meeting over the next 25 years to ensure that an Aboriginal child born today has the same health and housing standards as non-Aboriginal Australians. But, let me tell you, if we do not start addressing that point now, today, Aboriginal Australians will still be suffering the 17-year mortality gap—or we might have narrowed it slightly; maybe it will be only 15 years. They will still be suffering that 17-year gap unless we start addressing the gap now. We are talking about generational change. (Time expired)

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2006-06-19,"—I was quite gratified when I read this urgency motion today because I agree that this is an issue above party politics. This is an issue that concerns every single member of this chamber. But Senator Evans did at least half of his speech as a bag job on the minister who is trying to make amends in this very difficult area. Senator Evans talked about a bipartisan approach, but he spent at least half of his time bagging the minister. We have just had another contribution, from Senator Siewert, which was full of bagging. So whilst I agree that a bipartisan approach is needed here—and I am disappointed that Senator Bartlett is not in the chamber to hear these contributions—I must say that I have yet to hear too much that is bipartisan in the contributions from those opposite. My contribution today is made as a former chair of the joint native title committee and as a former president of the Bennelong Society.
—Well done, Senator Bipartisanship.
—Senator Carr makes ridiculous remarks. He cannot control himself. I would like to think that he would listen to my contribution because I have some quite important words that might help him. I am very glad to see that both state and federal governments have been linked to this motion by Senator Bartlett today, because there would not be a person in this chamber who would not agree that this is an issue that should be a long way above any cheap political point scoring. Successive Australian governments and their state and territory counterparts have attempted in various ways to tackle issues of Aboriginal health and housing, but sadly they have had mixed results.
I would like to refer to one of the most thought-provoking contributions on this very vexatious and difficult issue that I have heard for a very long time. It was made at the 2005 Bennelong Society conference, which Senator Carr was bagging a few minutes ago. It was made by the now President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Warren Mundine. However, he made the comments as an individual, an Aboriginal man extremely concerned about these issues. I would urge Senator Carr, Senator Marshall and any of those opposite who happen to be watching this debate to listen carefully to the passionate speech that Mr Mundine made to our Bennelong conference on Indigenous freedom and his very thoughtful speech about Indigenous issues in today’s society.
—You are going to bag him now?
—Senator Carr could read the speech if he cared to go to the Bennelong Society website. Mr Mundine argued very clearly and strongly that land in Indigenous communities should be used for socioeconomic development. He urged governments, both state and federal, to look at the privatisation of some lands for housing and development.

Senator Marshall interjecting—

 (Senator Troeth)—Order! I must ask opposition senators to refrain from interjecting.
—Mr Mundine’s speech, which was a particularly thought-provoking and well-delivered speech, raised a number of very important points in relation to the role of private housing and the impacts that these changes could have on Aboriginal people in various communities, both regional communities and remote communities. I would urge senators with an interest in this topic to take the time to read his speech. It is very worth while. I must say that, at the recent funeral of my good and old friend Rick Farley, I spoke to Warren Mundine and commended him again on that speech and suggested to him that he might now try to implement some of these issues as policy in the Labor Party. His comments that were shared with so many people at the conference on that day can be encapsulated by this quote from his speech: ‘The youth of our communities are crying out for a better future and to give them that future that they want and need, I would suggest the following’. And, interestingly enough, none of these issues were raised by Senator Evans in his contribution. I will include just a few of the issues in my contribution today:
Ensure our hard fought gains in Native Title, ILUA’s and State Land Rights legislation ... be protected so that they can be used for the direct benefit of everyone. ...
Create more efficient management and corporate governance practices.
Provide specific outcomes and be outcomes driven.
Provide clear socio-economic benefits to everyone—not just the few.
I thought it was interesting that Senator Evans said today that poverty was one of the driving forces in Aboriginal communities. Let me say what else is a driving force—that is substance abuse. Let us get that on the table. There is no point skating around what is a substantial cause of the difficulties facing particularly women and children in rural and remote Aboriginal communities. I say that very sadly and reluctantly, but as someone who has travelled widely in rural and remote communities and as someone who has gone out with Indigenous night patrols in a number of rural and remote centres in both the Northern Territory and my home state of South Australia and seen first-hand the tragic circumstances facing women at the hands of drunken Aboriginal men in their homes. Unless we get substance abuse on the table, unless it is addressed by the state government and unless the police and the Aboriginal workers in that area take on this topic, we are never going to get to the bottom of the problem. I commend Mal Brough for the issues he is taking on. I said to Warren Mundine, ‘Please, stick with your speech—move forward,’ and he said, ‘This is not easy.’ I know it is not easy. It is not easy for anybody.
—How touching!
—It is certainly not easy for Senator Carr as he sits there and denigrates the president of his own party—an Aboriginal man who had the courage to lay on the table at a non-party-political conference the issues that need to be tackled for the youth of Aboriginal communities. In his view, the issues that need to be tackled as policy, and again I refer to his speech, are: the development of Indigenous private enterprises and home and property ownership as the basis for building a future in those communities for families, as in the rest of Australia; and working with Indigenous youth by putting them into trades and/or university programs where they can—as his sons are—become self-employed and run their own enterprises. These policies must be put in place.
Minister Brough is moving to do these things. Educational programs, scholarships and private home ownership are issues that we need to tackle. Chief Minister Clare Martin’s housing minister, Elliot McAdam, said that, without decent housing, efforts to end the sexual violence and substance abuse are futile. What confusion is this man suffering from? We all know that, but what is the Northern Territory government doing to address the problem? (Time expired)

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-06-19,"—We have heard a couple of speakers from the Liberal Party and, of course, the doormats from the National Party on this issue. We have claimed that this is in the spirit of bipartisanship.
 (Senator Troeth)—Order! Senator Carr, I ask you to withdraw your reference to the National Party.
—Why is that unparliamentary, Madam Acting Deputy President?
—Because it is a lie.
—That is a reference to the National Party. It is not unparliamentary.
—Senator Carr, I ask you to withdraw. Senator Ferris, I also ask you to withdraw your comment.
—I withdraw, but it is an untruth to say what Senator Carr said.
—Senator Carr, I ask you to withdraw your comment on the National Party.
—I withdraw if you request me to withdraw but I can see nothing unparliamentary about describing the National Party as a bunch of doormats.
—Senator Carr, I ask you to withdraw.
—I withdraw. This motion here is presented on the basis of a call for bipartisanship. What have we heard from the two government senators? Abuse. We had pitiful and patronising quotations from the President of the Labor Party and an attempt to associate him with the racist and reactionary views of the Bennelong Society. What an outrageous slur, what a shocking thing to say, what a terrible thing for a senator to do in this chamber.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Carr is casting slurs on a very well-established public body and I would ask that he cease doing so.
—There is no point of order. However, Senator Carr, I ask you to moderate your language.
—Clearly, we have a spurious point of order now being made in an attempt to slur the Labor Party and leading members of the Labor Party. We have heard from Senator Scullion. He asked: why is it so different for Indigenous communities? Why is it so different, he asks! What an extraordinary question for a senator representing the Northern Territory. I put it to you very simply; it is poverty. It is simple—it is poverty. You ask what is so different. Think about the difference between the community on Wadeye—from what I understand, a town of a little under 3,000—and a town down the road, say, Tennant Creek, also a town of about 3,000. One has a number of doctors, one has none. One has numerous telecommunication systems, one does not have a public telephone. One has a high school, one does not. One has a garbage service, one does not. One has basic fire services, one does not. You will be surprised to hear that the one that does not have those things in those examples is the Indigenous town of Wadeye.
So Senator Scullion asks: what is the difference? The fundamental difference is the inherent racism that we have seen being spread throughout this country for generations. Why is it that we have a situation where a town of 3,000 people does not enjoy these basic services? What do we hear from the minister for Aboriginal affairs? We hear that this is a problem created by the government of the Northern Territory. What a load of nonsense. That is a government that has been in office for a couple of years; these are problems that go back a generation, two generations and to the formation of white settlement in the Northern Territory.
So you ask yourself why is it that such circumstances are allowed to continue in this country. Why is it that we have a situation where, in Indigenous communities, there is overcrowding of one house for 17 people? Where else in the country is that sort of situation tolerated? What are the consequences of having overcrowding of that dimension in Indigenous housing? What are the consequences for educational achievement? What are the consequences for the health of the people who live in conditions such as that? What are the consequences for the social development of those communities? I ask a simple question: how is it that we allow those situations to continue?
Senator Scullion asked the question: why is there such a difference? We have a simple proposition here—the figures are very, very clear: Indigenous Australians make up 2.4 per cent of the Australian population but Indigenous people make up 8.5 per cent of the homeless, and 19 per cent of all the people in Australia sleeping rough are Indigenous people. That is 19 per cent for a population that makes up 2.4 per cent of the total population of Australia. ATSIC estimated $2.2 billion is required just to deal with the housing problem, not to mention all the other matters such as education. A recent housing ministers conference—of white housing ministers from across the country—identified the figure as being $3 billion. It is a very rare circumstance where an organisation that was set up and organised to directly assist black people would come up with an estimate less than the estimate made by a mainstream organisation. But that is the situation here.
What is the government talking about? They are talking about providing $6 million for a trial of innovative housing options in Indigenous communities and a budget for services of $150,000 per house. It is a known fact that, for the 18,000 dwellings that we are short in this country for Indigenous people, the cost of providing that would be at least $2.7 billion—on the minister’s own figures. But what does he do? He provides $6 million. So Senator Bartlett is quite right. What we need is constructive engagement. We need a situation where the Commonwealth addresses these issues in a genuine way and does not seek to pass the buck to other levels of government. We have to see that the Commonwealth government—

Senator Johnston interjecting—

—Senator Johnston laughs. The Commonwealth government itself has acknowledged that its education programs were underspent by $126 million in 2004-05. What do we see on the weekend? A massive assault on the states, run in every newspaper in the country and based on the housing ministers conference on Friday, with regard to the states’ performance on underspending. It is really the pot calling the kettle black. We have a situation here where the underspend on Indigenous programs is totally unjustified. It is unjustified for the states and it is unjustified for the Commonwealth. This Commonwealth government has a pitiful record in that regard. Senator Scullion likes to blame the Labor government of the Northern Territory. I can recall that it was only a few years ago that here in this chamber and in Senate estimates I was able to highlight that the amount of money that the Liberal-National Party government, the doormats in the National Party, were actually arguing for 48—
—Senator Carr, resume your seat. I ask you again to withdraw the comment you have just made.
—I will withdraw whatever comment you want, but we had a situation—
—Senator Carr, I ask you to withdraw your comment unreservedly.
—I unreservedly withdraw any comment you want me to. There was a 48 per cent fee collected by the government of the Northern Territory under your party—a 48 per cent administrative charge for Indigenous programs in the Northern Territory. What sort of nonsense was that? They were claiming that there were administrative costs in education which totalled 48 per cent of the budget. So we have a situation here where there is a long and sorry record of abuse. Inherent in that abuse is a notion that somehow or another Indigenous people are not up to it. They are not up to having the same level of services that the rest of the country is entitled to. They are not up to enjoying medical services, housing and education on the same basis as every other Australian in the country. We do not seem to have a view that equality of opportunity extends to all our citizens—particularly if they are Aboriginal and live in towns such as Wadeye. There are 3,000 people without a doctor or a public telephone booth. How can we possibly justify that in a country of this wealth?
I ask a simple question: what do we expect from a government that seeks to use this as a political device to attack Labor governments? That is what is going on here now. We have a new minister trying to make a name for himself by seeking to criminalise an entire community and seeking to avoid his responsibilities and the fact that there has been a massive underinvestment for 10 long years. We have a situation where Minister Andrews pointed out a simple fact a few months ago. He said that Indigenous people have an average income of between $12,000 and $16,000 per year. Compare that to what the rest of the country enjoys, and you will find a very simple proposition: you cannot fund a private mortgage on an income between $12,000 and $16,000 a year. We have a situation where in Tasmania 52 per cent of Indigenous people own their own home. In the Northern Territory it is only 15 per cent. It is not a question of whether or not you are for or against home ownership. There are statements that are clear facts that this government is seeking to avoid. There are simple propositions here. If you have an income between $12,000 and $16,000 a year, the Commonwealth Bank is not going to rush down and offer you a mortgage. (Time expired)

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2006-06-19,"—I want to commence by congratulating Senator Bartlett. I say to all senators in this chamber, and particularly Senator Bartlett, that when any member of the Senate wants to raise an issue in the tenor that he has used then I for one want to speak on the subject and participate in the debate, because it is a vitally important subject.
But the fact is that Senator Bartlett only got halfway. We had the hand-wringing of Senator Bartlett, and we just heard Senator Carr. But the problem is that when you have young children being violently physically and sexually abused, you cannot sit back and say, ‘Let’s have a bipartisan approach.’ There has to be action. Under our Constitution there is only one organisation responsible for the administration of Aboriginal communities in the states, and that is state governments. Police, health, alcohol abuse, petrol sniffing and drugs are matters for the states. Every time I go home to Western Australia I get belted up by the state government saying I am not standing up for WA. The fact is that the WA government—and I will have the proof here in one moment—has lost the plot when it comes to the administration of Aboriginal affairs inside its state boundaries. Let us look at towns and communities. Blackstone, Wingellina, Warburton, Meekatharra, Leonora, Laverton, Kalgoorlie, Coolgardie, Norseman, Carnarvon, Geraldton—all these towns are administered by state governments. The people on the ground are employed by state governments.
In the very short time I have I want to put one issue to the Senate. In 2002 a very learned jurist, an Aboriginal woman, Mrs Gordon, handed down an inquiry. It showed:
Endemic family violence and sexual abuse in Western Australian Aboriginal communities was a “human tragedy that was nothing short of a national disaster”.
And those are the words of the then premier, Geoff Gallop.
A landmark $1 million, six-month inquiry has found the incidence of violence and child abuse in WA Aboriginal communities is “shocking and difficult to comprehend”.
I quote those words.
Tabled in the State Parliament—
the day before 16 August—
the 640-page Gordon inquiry report into how WA government agencies handled complaints of child sex abuse and family violence includes 197 findings and recommendations.
It recommended more coordination between government agencies, more training for staff, including cross-cultural education, and more services, particularly in remote areas. It said a lack of trust between Aboriginal communities and government agencies, especially police, hindered the reporting and follow-up of violence and abuse.
That was the situation back in 2002, when the report was handed down. Senator Carr says it is not the states’ fault. I would have to say I do not know where Senator Carr has been. He displays all of the understanding of most Victorians about what is going on out in the bush in Western Australia. I will quote from an Auditor-General’s report reviewing what happened to the Gordon inquiry. It says:
Three years on from the Gordon Inquiry little is known about the progress of an action plan (with initial funding of $66.5 million and more than 120 initiatives) developed to address the Inquiry’s findings.
‘Little is known about the progress’. This was about child sexual abuse. There were 197 recommendations, and in WA, in November of last year, the Auditor-General said, ‘Little is known about whether we’ve progressed and done anything about this report.’ It continues:
A report by WA Auditor General Des Pearson tabled in Parliament today—
23 November 2005—
reveals that an authoritative account of the progress in implementing the initiatives and the action plan overall does not exist.
This is the level of commitment we have in terms of things like petrol sniffing. To see a two- or three-year-old child walking around with a can of petrol strapped with a piece of wire over its neck so that it sniffs is the most sad, tragic thing any person who has had an education can ever see—and I have seen it. They do not just sniff it; they sip it. It is absolutely unbelievable. Here was a report in 2002 laying out an action plan for what Western Australia needed to do to try to arrest this sort of thing. What has happened? Last year the Auditor-General said, ‘Nothing is happening.’
Do we sit on our hands? Do we sit around saying, ‘We can’t blame the state governments because it’s above politics’? Of course we don’t! We have to do something, Senator Carr. I will quote further what the review says:
The result is that groups formed to monitor and oversight the plan do not have available such basic information as:
The number of initiatives and how many have been implemented.
How many are behind schedule.
Expenditure against budget—
The basic fundamental of good government is expenditure against budget. In other words, you appropriate money to do these things. The state government in Western Australia did not do it. The review continues:
Estimates on final expenditure and anticipated final completion.
A summary of the actions taken to resolve delays and barriers to timely implementation.
This is just disgraceful. This is maladministration by a Labor government. It is a blue-ribbon example. It is a gold-medal candidate. They sit there on the other side wringing their hands and saying: ‘This is terrible. You shouldn’t beat up the state governments.’ My goodness! People are dying. Children are dying. How much more do we have to carry on to get through to you people that Mal Brough is doing something in utter desperation? You have sat there wringing your hands. He comes out in utter desperation and you defend the state governments. They are indefensible.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Communities</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-06-19,"—This week I celebrate eight years since being sworn in to the Senate. When I look back over that time, I think that not a month has gone by when we have not debated something about Indigenous Australians in this chamber. I pride myself in saying that by now I have got around to most, if not all, of the communities in the Northern Territory at least more than a couple of times. But unlike some of my colleagues from both sides of this chamber I am a bit tired of screaming and yelling about the plight of Indigenous Australians. I am a bit tired of getting angry about it. I have lived with and worked with Indigenous Australians for 25 years in the Northern Territory. My first speech reflects what I think of those people.
For a long time I have said that this country has failed to enhance the talents of Indigenous people. We have failed to capitalise on the strengths of Indigenous people. I am glad that we have a federal minister who now wants to make some noises about this, but I am saddened at the way that he is going about it. Mal Brough behaves like a rabbit in a spotlight. He has suddenly discovered the plight of Indigenous Australians but he is treating it and acting upon it in such a negative way. I was shocked this morning when, on ABC radio in Darwin, preceding my interview, Mal Brough referred to Aboriginal communities as ‘communist enclaves’. What an indictment of Indigenous people! What an outstanding insult to the old and trusted traditional owners of those communities. It also shows a complete lack of understanding of the role of traditional owners—their competence, the faith in and respect for those men that communities have, the many years of learned culture and belief that they carry on behalf of the people and their absolute connection with the land, of which they are the custodians.
I could not have thought of anything more insulting to Indigenous people than what Mal Brough said this morning. I was deeply offended and shocked by his comments this morning. This should not be what we hear from a minister who is seeking to rectify what is happening in Indigenous affairs. This is such a wrong way to go about it. There is no doubt that the plight of Indigenous Australians now has national attention—probably more than it ever has had. But we need to work with these people. We do not need to bully these people. We do not need to back them into a corner and say to them, ‘You’re not going to get basic services unless you give me your land for 99 years.’ That is not the way to treat Indigenous people. It is not the way we treat non-Indigenous people, and Indigenous people should not be treated any differently.
I think governments on both sides of the fence have failed in years gone past. In 27 years of the CLP in the Northern Territory not one secondary school was built in remote communities. Also, under the Hawke-Keating government, every time a state government took Indigenous money off the Commonwealth they took 48c in the dollar and stuck it in their pocket. I have to say that David Kemp, to his credit, along with the work that Bob Collins and I did, got the Commonwealth government to make sure that the states and territories take only 10c of every education dollar for their own pockets.
There is failure across the spectrum. Juvenile diversionary programs were not funded last year by this federal government, and they were a success in the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister promised the people of Port Keats $50,000 for a community patrol, and it has not been delivered. So there are faults everywhere when it comes to underfunding and underservicing.
But there are some wins. In estimates I heard about, the OATSIH are making progress on getting asthma puffers for Indigenous communities. People on CDEP, thanks to the work that some of us have done, can now get access to hearing aids. But there is not a holistic approach. There is not a national plan. There is no concept of walking together. There is no suggestion from Mal Brough that he might take the people in this federal parliament like Senator Scullion and I who talk to these people day in and day out and have a joint bipartisan parliamentary committee that advises and gives input to this government about what is really happening out there. Senator Scullion wants to see as many changes in those communities as I do. I am sick of the blame game, I am sick of the anger and I am sick of the yelling. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Communities</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2006-06-19,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Republic of South Africa and the 114th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly in Nairobi, which took place from 28 April to 12 May 2006. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I will speak very briefly to the motion because the report of the delegation and the bilateral visit to the Republic of South Africa and the 114th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly in Nairobi is a detailed and comprehensive one and speaks for itself. I just want to highlight a couple of the issues, the first one in relation to the South African bilateral visit where the delegation went to visit the BHP Billiton aluminium smelter site located the north of the Republic of South Africa in KwaZulu Natal in the town of Richards Bay.
As the delegation arrived at the airport we were met by a protest that had been organised by the local union movement in Richards Bay, protesting against the repressive and extreme industrial relations changes being initiated at the time in Australia by the Howard government. It took us somewhat by surprise that these laws had gained international attention, and the delegation—both members of the government and members of the opposition—had an opportunity to speak to the protesters. I was quite surprised at their knowledge of the industrial relations changes and the impact they would have.
As a much younger man I had been involved in opposing the apartheid regime in South Africa and I had also been involved with the union movement when the union movement in Australia took a very proactive and quite decisive role in many respects in opposing that abominable regime that was an affront to civilisation. South Africa is considered a developing country, but even as a developing country in the new post-apartheid regime they have laws that give people a fair go, that give rights to workers to collectively bargain and opportunities for workers to also share in the growing wealth of the Republic of South Africa where there is quite a substantial growth rate and, by all comparisons, a booming economy.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—The sorts of extreme laws that this government is putting in place in a so-called developed country are making us international pariahs in respect of equality and fairness in industrial relations. They were aware that individual contracts do strip away the basic bargaining power or any semblance of equity of bargaining power for workers when negotiating with employers. It was somewhat amusing—Senator Abetz, you may be interested to hear this—that one of the government members of the delegation, whom I will not name, went to explain to the protesters that really nothing was going to change because the awards are still there and all those conditions are protected and that if the workers did not want to enter into any workplace agreements they would not have to. But on our return we have actually seen the initial impact of Australia’s extreme industrial relations laws and we have seen that there is no choice, no bargaining and no negotiation. Workers are simply given a contract in a take it or leave it approach. People at the lower end with the inability to negotiate or those whose skills are not in high demand or who do not have high education levels are simply in no position to bargain effectively and equitably with their employers.
On the Office of the Employment Advocate’s own figures, out of all the AWAs registered with it since the Work Choices legislation came into being, 100 per cent excluded at least one so-called protected award condition; 64 per cent removed so-called protected annual leave loadings; 63 per cent removed so-called protected penalty rates; 52 per cent removed so-called protected shiftwork loadings; 40 per cent of agreements would appear to have lost gazetted public holidays; and 16 per cent actually excluded all of the so-called protected award conditions. I found it somewhat amusing that even the government members at the time had no understanding of the impact of this legislation, and they now should. It would appear that unionists in South Africa had a better understanding of the legislation than the members of this government, who were voting for it. But it was good to see that there is some international solidarity and some genuine concern across the worldwide union movement against this extreme government.
But there is one other issue that I wish to talk about, and it is an issue that I took up with a number of politicians at the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Nairobi. It is the case of Mr Crispin Beltran, a member of the House of Representatives of the Philippines. He was the subject of a study in a report of the Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians, which is a subcommittee of the IPU, and he is the subject of representations I made while I was at the IPU conference. It is worth detailing some of those issues for the public record here, and there are more details contained in the report being presented today. The report states:
On 25 February 2006, Mr. Crispin Beltran, a well-known and outspoken opposition member of the House of Representatives, “was invited” for questioning by police belonging to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group …
At that interview:
... he was shown an arrest warrant on a rebellion charge dating back to 1985; although the police were told by his lawyer that the warrant, which stemmed from an inciting-to-rebellion case filed by the Marcos regime, has long been quashed, the police refused to release him; later that day, a case was filed against him for allegedly inciting to rebellion at a rally held on 24 February 2006 in commemoration of the ousting of the Marcos regime; counter-affidavits were issued stating that this was untrue and that Mr. Beltran had never given any such speech; on 27 February and 4 March 2006, two new charges of rebellion were brought against him, one of conspiring with an army officer involved in a coup d’etat attempt in 2003 and another one linking him with the Communist Party of the Philippines; on 23 March 2006, the Quezon City Metropolitan Court, which was handling the inciting-to-sedition case, ordered his release;
On 3 April 2006, Mr. Beltran and his counsel filed a motion for quashing the incitement to sedition charge, and the relevant hearing is reportedly set for 29 May 2006; with regard to the rebellion charges, in response to the judge’s decision to resolve within 30 days the motion for the judicial determination of probable cause and urgent motion to release Mr. Beltran or alternatively allow him to attend parliamentary sessions, Mr. Beltran and his counsel have filed a motion to set for hearing and/or resolve the pending urgent motion and to allow the accused to be transferred to a hospital with adequate facilities; however, no decision appears so far to have been taken in this respect and Mr. Beltran remains—
and it would appear from my best information that he remains today—
in detention without a valid arrest warrant.
Regarding the rights of parliamentarians across the world, it is of significant concern when parliamentarians promote significant opposition in their own country and then have the apparatus of the state used against them, in what appears to be purely an attempt to quash that opposition.
The IPU has expressed deep concern at the arrest and continuing detention of Mr Beltran and at the charges brought against him. It observes many points that I do not have time to go into, but it requests that the committee continue examining this case and report to its next session, to be held during the 115th assembly, in October 2006. I will certainly continue to make representations to the IPU on this matter until there is a successful outcome. I recommend the delegation report to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-06-19,"—When I left off on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2006 before question time, I was talking about democracy diminished, in that the so-called integrity measures are far from that. Earlier I dealt with the issue of gifts and party donations and the increase from $1,500 to $10,000. Before we broke for question time today, I also referred to how the Liberal Party can use anonymous sources under the $10,000 regime, if people donate $9,999 to the eight Liberal branches. If you were to use family relationships, you could also multiply that by two and get to some extraordinary numbers. What is important with these things is that there is transparency. It is good to see Senator Abetz here in the chamber because some of the matters he went to in respect of that, as a defence, do not stand up. I dealt with some of those before, but let me reiterate: there is no policy merit in this change.
The other area where there is no policy merit is the early closure of the rolls. Notwithstanding the spirited defence of it by the Australian Electoral Commission, the early closure of the rolls will cause a huge group of people to be disenfranchised from their votes, because it will effectively mean that the rolls will close from 8 pm on the day the writs are issued. There is no longer a period of grace where people are reminded they need to get on the rolls and sort out their enrolment. What Senator Abetz has argued in the past—if I verbal him, I am sure he will correct the record—is that people should take advantage of the issue and keep up to speed on their enrolment and deal with it as they go. That would be terrific in a perfect world, but we do not live in a perfect world. The grace period of seven days acts almost like a reminder, and it is a very focused reminder. When the writs are issued, people take note and turn their minds to an election that is going to occur and deal with it accordingly. This will result in people—people who would have otherwise been able to enrol and vote—not being able to change their particulars and they may be excluded from the roll. In a democracy, if we are talking about ensuring that all people who can vote are able to vote and not disenfranchising groups who we could otherwise deal with, it is wrong to have an early closure, as proposed in this bill.
The guiding principle in this area is that there should be the ability for people to express their will in an election. I am concerned about that ability being changed for new citizens and 17- to 18-year-olds, and not only, as might be argued, that the Liberal Party will seek to gain a benefit. I cannot clearly see how it will transpire, but I think you could make the reasonable guess that the early closure of the rolls will not disadvantage the Liberal Party. I think you could say it is more likely to advantage the Liberal Party and their constituency. The National Party probably have not turned their minds to how it will affect regional and rural Australians—whether their ability to use the seven days that currently exist to sort out their enrolment will be diminished. I suspect it will. I suspect they will also suffer under this integrity measure, so-called. It is surprising that the National Party have not really addressed it in any broad way, but that is a matter for them. It is, of course, still a great concern to the Labor Party.
I will turn to a couple of other issues. Senator Boswell provided some commentary on an old issue that I think has long been a thorn in the side of the Nationals—that is, Liberals for Forests, an issue which has focused them and which took up the majority of Senator Boswell’s speech. The minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report says:
Several electorates on polling day 2004 saw the distribution of how-to-vote cards which were clearly designed to mislead voters into voting for a party they did not intend to vote for. This was particularly obvious when the manner in which these cards were distributed is taken into account. The Government members of the Committee devoted a great deal of time to expounding their view—
and Senator Boswell took the opportunity during the second reading debate to do that again—
that the Government candidate in the Division of Richmond was defeated …
It goes on to say that the government members tried to have it both ways on this question by condemning what they saw as the misleading distribution of the Liberals for Forests cards in Richmond, while condoning a clearly well-orchestrated campaign by the Liberal Party to deceive Australian Greens voters in the division of Melbourne Ports by the blatantly misleading distribution of green coloured how-to-vote cards. The minority report concluded:
We support the recommendation that the AEC conduct a review of the relevant sections of the Act, which are clearly inadequate for the purpose of preventing the misuse of how-to-vote cards to deceive voters. We believe that the practice of some state electoral authorities …
And it goes on. What we have there, of course, is an argument for another day. But I think the minority report does provide a better position than the one argued by the majority in this area. The majority report argued poorly, I think, to try to substantiate the reasons for the earlier closure of the rolls. I think it failed to address some of the more relevant issues. Of recommendation 4, the minority report said:
This is the most radical recommendation in the entire report. It will have the effect of disenfranchising anyone who has not enrolled by the time the writs for an election are issued, and potentially disenfranchising all voters who are not enrolled at their correct address by depriving them of an opportunity to correct their enrolment details.
That is the position that is likely to occur. The government have failed to take heed of what the minority pointed out. They have steamrolled over those issues and in doing so they have steamrolled over democracy. The pretext for this proposal is that the enrolment during the five working days increases electoral fraud because the AEC does not have time to verify the information given by the enrollees. That is the argument that seems to be put, but there was no evidence in support of that contention presented to the inquiry, nor has any been presented to previous inquiries.
If there is evidence out there, it should be tabled. It should be brought forward. The AEC has never said that it cannot handle the volume of applications received, so I think it is disingenuous to say that the AEC would be swamped during this period and not able to cope. If there is that view then it is a matter of ensuring that the AEC does have that flexibility, and the government have the ability to ensure that. The AEC continues to check into the integrity of the rolls in the period following their closure to ensure that people are eligible to vote, so I think that argument is broadly disingenuous. We also heard from an AEC employee, appearing in a private capacity, about the early closure of the rolls. The early closure of the rolls, in his words:
... would disenfranchise a lot of people. We would have had to go to a lot of expense and advertising to ensure that the rolls were as up-to-date as possible and do that on a continuing basis.
That evidence was presented to the committee on 12 August 2005. But the AEC said:
The AEC is firmly of the view that, in the absence of any evidence to suggest that the opportunity to enrol or correct enrolment details in the week prior to the close of the rolls is being significantly abused, the procedure introduced on the Committee’s recommendation after the 1983 election must be judged a success.
But we are still debating these issues in this chamber. The recommendation will also cause, as I have said, particular problems for electors in remote or regional Australia. The Liberals’ partners in the coalition, the National Party, have certainly not twigged to the fact that it is also part of the Liberal Party armoury to ensure that The Nationals are disadvantaged as a consequence. To not have adequate access to appropriate communication facilities would, as the Western Australian government at the time indicated in their submission, cause difficulties and might lead to disenfranchisement of electors.
We have also heard from Senator Mason. Curiously, Senator Mason was the only coalition senator—save, I suspect, Senator Abetz in his summing up—to even attempt a straight-faced justification of the changes. And perhaps Senator Abetz may not even do that. Senator Mason stated that these changes to enrolment awareness campaigns ‘will go a long way to countering any possible unintended consequences of an early closure of the roll’. It is not the unintended consequences that Labor is worried about but the many intended consequences of this bill. When you go to the two major issues that I have talked about today—the donations and the early closure of the rolls—this bill should not be proceeded with. The government know what they are doing. They are seeking to commit another rort. These are not integrity measures. They have again carted out the wheelbarrow of old wish lists that they always want to bring forward. When you look at the broader issue of whether democracy will be diminished as a consequence, it can be safely said that it will be by the passing of these integrity measures. I am going to run out of time now but I will have the opportunity in the committee stage to ask a range of questions about some of these matters and particularly the issues that surround the political financial disclosures under the proposed changes to the thresholds.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (ELECTORAL INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-06-19,"—The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2006 will enhance Australia’s electoral system. We have a very good electoral system in this country, but that does not mean that it cannot be enhanced. Indeed, these measures are about making it more robust, fair and rigorous. As a result, people will be able to have even greater confidence in our electoral system. Confidence in our electoral system is vital to the acceptance by the people of the electoral outcomes. What problems does this bill address? It addresses a number of them. I will go through them in some sort of order. I will also try and glean from the contributions of various senators what the themes were.
First of all, in relation to tightening up the electoral roll, Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Deputy Leader of the Democrats, told us that the key aim of the Commonwealth Electoral Act is to make it as easy as possible for people to get on the electoral roll. No; wrong. The Commonwealth Electoral Act should make it as easy as possible for people to get onto the electoral roll, subject to the appropriate tests being in place to ensure that the roll cannot be rorted.
I was absolutely astounded to hear and read in some of the speeches by opposition senators the suggestion that electoral fraud does not exist in this country. Senator Carr made the mistake; Senator Webber did. Every—
—Seventy-one cases since 1990; one in a million.
—He now admits that fraud does exist, and he has offered the number 71. Karen Ehrmann went to jail because of electoral fraud perpetrated within the Australian Labor Party. Tony Mooney, Andrew Keogh, Lee Birmingham, Jim Elder, Mike Kaiser, Grant Musgrove, Bill Ludwig, Joan Budd and David Barbagallo are all names that have come up in relation to electoral fraud. It is disingenuous in the extreme for those opposite to suggest that electoral fraud is not a problem. Tell Karen Ehrmann, who served a period of imprisonment, that electoral fraud does not exist.
—What about that cat that voted twice in a marginal seat?
—And we have the case of ‘Curacao Fischer Catt’, who was enrolled in the seat of Macquarie. The cat was able to get onto the electoral roll through fraud and misrepresentation. And, if somebody can get a cat onto the electoral roll, you cannot have confidence in the electoral system. But, for the roll rorters, that is fantastic news. If you can get a cat onto the electoral roll, chances are you can get anybody on the electoral roll, and then you can rort the system. Tell Karen Ehrmann, who served a period of imprisonment courtesy of Labor Party roll rorting, that roll rorting does not exist. It exists, and you know it. Thank goodness it is at a minimum. But we need laws to ensure that that cannot occur again.
The Liberals for Forests campaign was a disgraceful campaign, and the Labor Party support of it tells us why the current Labor member for Richmond refused to come before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, because she would have been asked this question: ‘Were you aware of what was happening with Liberals for Forests?’ Because there was not a Liberal candidate running in that electorate, the Liberals for Forests wore blue t-shirts with ‘Liberal’ emblazoned on the front. They put their thumbs over the ‘for Forests’ on the how-to-vote cards and accosted people coming into the polling booths saying, ‘Vote Liberal,’ not ‘Vote Liberals for Forests.’ Unfortunately, a lot of people were misled. Disingenuously, the how-to-vote card for Liberals for Forests had only their own candidate’s party listed, next to ‘vote 1’. All the other people on the how-to-vote card did not have their party listed next to them. There was clearly a stunt being pulled. Unfortunately, it worked. We say that that is not good enough.
We then have the situation of Labor trying to defend the changes made in 1984 by the Australian Labor Party in the current Commonwealth Electoral Act. You do not have to listen to me in relation to what motivated these changes. Listening to Senator Ray’s speech, I was nearly convinced. He nearly convinced me how outrageous this was—until the good former senator Graham Richardson reminded me what Senator Ray and he had been up to in changing the rules. This is what Senator Richardson said about these changes. They were made so:
... that Labor could embrace power as a right and make the task of anyone trying to take it from us as difficult as we could.
What shameful cynicism! Then Senator Ray has the audacity to come into this place, having been part and parcel of that, to try to pretend that somehow his hands are clean!
—So that is what you are up to? Is that your confession?
—The confession in fact comes later because Senator Sterle foolishly said, ‘If it happens to have suited Labor and it is good for the nation then so be it and let the cards fall where they will.’ Unfortunately, Senator Sterle’s researcher did not read further on in the Graham Richardson chapter because Senator Richardson made a confession. It is very interesting that you should talk about confessions, Senator Carr. This is what Senator Richardson said:
It is hard to argue that we have a better country for it.
Senator Richardson is willing to say that, with all of those changes that the Labor Party forced through, it is hard to argue that we have a better country for it. We now move onto the issue of people’s votes being accepted which are not able to be substantiated. At the last federal election 27,000 provisional votes were accepted into the count. There were more than 27,000 votes in total; but, of those provisional votes that were taken into the count, the Electoral Commission was unable to follow up on 27,000 of them to verify that they actually lived where they had asserted. When you divide that by the number of seats we have in this country, noting that some seats are won by 100 or so votes, that becomes a very serious concern.

Senator Carr interjecting—

—Would you mind, Senator Carr? We actually listened to you guys and your very pathetic contributions for a while. Let me turn to prisoner voting. There are those who are now suggesting that everybody should be entitled to vote, including prisoners, and that this is somehow a fundamental right. It has long been the case in Australia, especially in state jurisdictions, that, if you are serving a period of imprisonment, you do not get the vote. We as a government happen to believe that if through the judicial system you have been sentenced to a period of incarceration—in other words, you have been removed from society by society through the judicial system—then, during that period of your removal from society, you forfeit the right to vote.
Senator Nettle and others are trying to justify the right to vote for these people. She says it is an important part of their rehabilitation. Can I say that I acted in the criminal law jurisdiction for quite some time. Not once did a person likely to go to jail say to me: ‘Eric, whatever you do, just give me the right to vote. Send me to jail by all means, just as long as I keep the right to vote.’ Not once was that said.
Let us get a grip on reality with this. The concern of citizens is their removal from society by the judicial system because they have so offended against the rules and laws of our society that they are deemed to be unworthy to walk the streets. I know some academic said that I put it deliciously simply by saying that chances are that, if you are unfit to walk the streets, you are unfit to vote. I suppose the reason they say that it is deliciously simple is because there is no argument in principle against that proposition. If you are removed from society then chances are that you should not be entitled to vote.
Allow me to go through some of the contributions of honourable senators in relation to the threshold in particular. What I seek to do is put on the record and repeat into the Hansard that which was said nearly a quarter of a century ago. Who said this, Senator Marshall? This person said:
People should be protected, if they want to be protected, by not having their names associated with a particular political party. What we are saying is that people who make these donations to political parties should be allowed to remain anonymous. We say that any donation—
and this will give you the hint, especially Senator Murray, I trust—
over $2,000, which we would regard as significant, should be capable of public disclosure.
That, of course, was the former leader of the Australian Democrats, speaking in this place some 24 years ago, saying that $2,000 was the appropriate threshold. If you then go to the Parliamentary Library and ask them to apply the inflation factor to that, you now have a figure well in excess of $5,000. So if the principle of Senator Don Chipp at the time remained and if you were to forward it to 2006, a quarter of a century later, you would have a figure in excess of $5,000. But he does make this point:
I would be sympathetic to the view that if persons because of altruism want to give a certain amount of money they should be protected if they want to be protected.
—They need protection.
—Senator Cory Bernardi has quite rightly interjected that they need protection. They need protection from those people who would seek to intimidate them because of their donations. That is quite right. Senator Don Chipp a quarter of a century ago recognised that important point. We as a government, in fact, have had the view that the threshold should be $10,000 for the last 20-plus years. So there are no surprises here. We have remained consistent in that regard.
The important thing about this is that 88 per cent of all donations disclosed by both Labor and the Liberal Party were donated in amounts of $10,000 or more in the 2003-04 year. So, really, only 12 per cent of current donations might not be disclosed. If people are saying that that 12 per cent is going to somehow create undue influence on the body politic of Australia, I would say with great respect that I do not think you are right. What that 12 per cent—the rats and mice of the donations—is doing is putting untold pressure on political parties, especially small political parties, that have difficulty in coming to grips with the current system. And the Australian Electoral Commission spends far too much time on those figures for no real benefit. I would point out that on 9 March 2006, Karen Cassidy, the Tasmanian Greens convenor, said:
The Tasmanian Greens have two part-time employees, one of whom is our adminstrator. She basically has a full-time job in a part-time capacity trying to comply with the current regime for reporting of donations.
So even the Greens are complaining about the amount of work involved with these small amounts—and I am sure that is why Senators Brown and Milne are very quiet in relation to this point.
Those opposite have the absolute audacity, Senator Bernardi, to complain about the new threshold of $10,000. Coming from the state of South Australia, you will undoubtedly recall the stunt pulled by Senator Nick Bolkus—as he then was—for the campaign for Steve Georganas, who is now the member for Hindmarsh. He ran a $10,000 raffle. The one donor bought all the raffle tickets and there was no raffle prize—and it was not disclosed until he was flushed out. Senator Bolkus, a former minister responsible for the Commonwealth Electoral Act, engaged in this sort of behaviour.
It shows that the Labor Party will window-dress and assert themselves as being cleaner than the driven snow and then engage in the practice of trying to get donations and hiding them through the guise of a false raffle. It is the same when they talk about electoral roll rorting—‘It doesn’t exist; we don’t need to tighten up the provisions’—when they are the ones who have had people going to jail for roll rorting. I indicate to honourable senators that the electoral roll is used not only for electoral purposes but also for social security and other fraud related matters. Therefore, it makes good sense for the electoral roll to be robust.
I say to my good friend Senator Fielding that I disagree with his unfortunate reflection on political parties. In his contribution, he told us that community groups and lobby groups that push political agendas are not eligible for tax deductibility status. I say to Senator Fielding, yes they are, unfortunately. There is the Wilderness Society, the RSPCA and a number of organisations. What we are saying is: ‘Let’s level the playing field. Rather than taking tax deducibility status off some of these organisations, we ought to level the playing field.’
Senator Fielding said that he was opposed to the electoral roll being used for the purposes of the Financial Transaction Reports Act. I would be happy to give Senator Fielding a private brief on that. Basically, as a result of Commonwealth legislation, we require banking institutions to undertake checks for which we allow the electoral roll to be used—and they have now outsourced that to a third party. As I understand it, there is, at least on this issue, unanimity between Liberal and Labor and, I think, the Australian Democrats. So, if I have the opportunity to explain things to Senator Fielding later on, hopefully there will be agreement from him on that issue.
Unfortunately, time is short. Suffice it to say that those who are seeking to assert that there is somehow a conspiracy involved in relation to the thresholds et cetera conveniently overlook their own behaviour as a political party—for example, the raffle that I indicated earlier—and what Labour governments around the world do. In New Zealand, the threshold is $NZ10,000 and in the United Kingdom it is ₤5,000, which in very rough terms translates to $A10,000. Nobody has asserted that there is a democratic deficit in New Zealand or the United Kingdom because of those thresholds. They have had Labour governments for some considerable period of time and they have seen no need to change the laws. Nobody is asserting that there is a democratic deficit in those countries, and there is no basis to assert that there would be a democratic deficit if we were to have the $10,000 threshold in this country.
I thank honourable senators for their contributions. I look forward to the committee stage and I recommend the bill as printed.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Carr’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (ELECTORAL INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-06-19,"—In politics it is said that if you excite the interest of your opponents then you must be actually achieving something. From the events of the last few days, it appears that the Member for Bass, Mr Michael Ferguson, must be doing very well as a local representative. Why? Because the Australian Labor Party has slowly wheeled out all its big guns to mount a baseless political attack on him. First, we had Senator O’Brien, in the late adjournment last week, dredging up completely false allegations that Mr Ferguson had somehow breached the provisions of the Companies Act and spreading sufficient innuendo to make it look as though Mr Ferguson had some case to answer. Then we had the same senator, Senator O’Brien, making totally baseless allegations about Mr Ferguson’s personal website. Now we see that Senator O’Brien has put on notice questions designed to attack the church—churches are under a lot of attacks lately—to which Mr Ferguson and many of his, my and Senator O’Brien’s constituents belong: a big church in Launceston.
Then in the other place the member for Denison, Mr Kerr—a colleague of mine—was prodded by his colleagues into asking a question of the Speaker to make a totally specious claim about Mr Ferguson. I repeat: if you throw enough mud, some of it will stick. This is obviously the motto of the ALP dirty tricks campaign department. They slander and defame someone under the cloak of parliamentary privilege and hope that something will stick—however baseless the allegations.
Let me deal with these dirty tricks in order. The first assertion was that Mr Ferguson had somehow breached the Corporations Act 2001 because ASIC had not been notified of his resignation as a director of a public company. Senator O’Brien was very careful in what he said in this place, as he spread the mud, because if he had read the act itself he would know Mr Ferguson had done nothing wrong whatsoever. Yes, section 205A of the act provides that a director may—and I emphasise ‘may’—advise ASIC of their resignation as a director. However, that same section goes on to say that any action by a director does not affect the company’s obligations to advise ASIC under section 205B. As anyone who knows even a small amount about corporations knows, it is the obligation of the company secretary, not the directors themselves, to advise ASIC about appointments and resignations of directors. Indeed, section 5 of the act, which amongst other provisions sets out the duties of company secretaries, says that the first duty of a secretary is that he or she:
... notifies ASIC about changes to the identities, names and addresses of the company’s directors ...
Therefore, it was not Mr Ferguson’s responsibility to notify ASIC of his resignation—it was the secretary’s obligation. So we can dismiss that baseless allegation.
Now we address the next baseless allegation made by Senator O’Brien under privilege. Senator O’Brien’s allegation is that Mr Ferguson’s personal website said that he was awarded the ‘order of the British empire award for community service’ in 2000 and that this claim is somehow untrue. As someone familiar with the Order of the British Empire Association, which has chapters in every state, I know that Mr Ferguson was indeed the recipient of an award before he entered parliament. There is no such honour as the ‘order of the British empire’ in any case. How could Labor claim that the member for Bass had been untruthful? They are making, whether deliberately or not, the common error of confusing the order of the British empire with the separate honour of Officer of the Order of the British Empire, which entitles a person to the letters ‘OBE’ after his or her name. That is a monumental mistake. Michael Ferguson has never claimed that he received this honour. All he claimed was the truth: that he was proud that a non-political organisation of eminent people in Tasmania had seen fit to give him an award for community service—an award quite consistent with Mr Ferguson’s hard work in the Northern Tasmanian community both before and after his election to the House of Representatives.
—Hear, hear! Exactly.
—Thank you, Senator Abetz. So much for that baseless allegation. Finally, the member for Denison, Mr Duncan Kerr, has been roped in to this dirty tricks effort. I say ‘roped in’ because I cannot believe that someone who is a senior counsel in the Supreme Court of Tasmania could actually for a moment believe what he has alleged or be completely comfortable in making those allegations, whether in parliament or not. Mr Kerr raised the matter of the website with the Speaker, alleging a contempt of parliament. Again, that was a totally baseless, muckraking exercise and it was beneath the character that I know the member for Denison possesses. The contents of any senator’s or member’s personal website are the personal responsibility of the senator or member concerned and theirs alone. When any person clicks on the link after the APH official biography for any member to go to the member’s website, the following caution appears:
You are now leaving the Parliament of Australia Web site. We have no control or responsibility for external sites.
Therefore, the member for Denison—or the people who forced the question on him—knew, or should have known, that it was nothing to do with the Speaker, just as any claims made by any senator or member on their websites are nothing to do with the Speaker or even you, Mr President. The Speaker has advised Mr Kerr that Mr Ferguson has no case to answer whatsoever. It is just more mud. It is just baseless mud. I am sure the decent Tasmanians who make up the Order of the British Empire Association—many of whom I know personally—know exactly why Mr Ferguson was awarded their service award. I am equally sure they would be unimpressed to be drawn into this political attack.
Finally, Senator O’Brien has put down a series of questions on notice about a particular church. He of course knows that counted among the large congregation of this church is the member for Bass. Because of that, Senator O’Brien unfortunately decided to proceed on an ill-advised witch-hunt about federal government funding the church may or may not have received. I do not know whether that particular church has received any federal grant. What would be wrong if they had? Quite frankly, I cannot see why Senator O’Brien, having never in his parliamentary career shown an interest in this area, suddenly decided to pursue this matter—except of course for the broader attack on Mr Ferguson. How unpleasant can you get—attacking any church purely because an MP might happen to attend it?
If this is their approach so far, I can imagine that Labor will ensure that things will get very nasty in the forthcoming Bass campaign. I think that is unfortunate. The electorate does not like these baseless personal attacks on a person’s integrity. Labor know that the previous federal member has decided on a state career and has been successfully elected to the state House of Assembly. I congratulate Michelle O’Byrne on that. However, without any high-profile candidate for Bass, Labor have reverted to the oldest trick in the political book: if you cannot beat your political opponent in a fair fight then raise as much smear, dirt and innuendo as you can. It does not of course matter to Labor whether it is true. They have the umbrella of parliamentary privilege to protect them from that. They will just be satisfied if they can smear the reputation of an exceptionally talented and hard-working politician. I know that, whatever Senator O’Brien and others do, Michael Ferguson will not be distracted. He will continue to fight for the people of Bass, in their interests and for their betterment. Tasmanians like robust political debate. They dislike like mud-slinging. On election day, I am quite confident the judgment of the electors of Bass will reflect that.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mr Michael Ferguson MP</title>,Adjournment,22,1
