"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2010-09-29,"—I move:
That the following address–in–reply be agreed to:

To Her Excellency the Governor–General

MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY–
We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.
I welcome this opportunity to move the address in reply to Her Excellency the Governor-General’s speech at the opening of this—
Opposition senators interjecting—
 (Senator Crossin)—Senator Pratt, before you continue I would remind senators that everyone will get an opportunity to reply to the address that was given yesterday.
—I welcome this opportunity to move that the speech given by Her Excellency the Governor-General at the opening of the 43rd Parliament be agreed to. History was made yesterday as our first female Governor-General marked the opening of the Australian parliament with an address that outlined our new government’s plans for the future, a government headed by Australia’s first female Prime Minister.
Like our Prime Minister, Australia’s first female political candidate, Catherine Helen Spence, hailed from South Australia. Spence ran for the Australasian Federal Convention in 1897. Today she is better known as an advocate of women’s suffrage, but in her own day she was best known as an advocate for effective voting, or what we call ‘proportional representation’. Spence wrote:
The fundamental principle of proportional representation is that majorities must rule but that minorities shall be adequately represented. An intelligent minority of representatives has great weight and influence. Its voice can be heard. It can fully and truly express the views of the voters it represents.
Spence hoped that more effective representation would reduce the bitterness of party strife and strengthen independent thought and the integrity of our electoral system. She said:
The minority represented is the true sharpener of the wits of the ruling powers, the educator of the people and the animator of the press.
She looked for an end to ‘war by election’, where the winner takes all no matter how slim its majority. She wanted to restore to representation ‘its true meaning, that the elected body, the parliament, should be the mirror of the convictions and aspirations of the whole people’.
In this place we have some experience of what the weight and influence of an intelligent minority of representatives can mean in practice—more experience, I venture to say, than many of those in the other place. It sharpens the wits of the ruling powers, as any government without a majority in the Senate and any minister who has been grilled at estimates can attest. It can engage the public in parliamentary processes, as evidenced by the Senate committees’ robust system of public inquiries. And when the fourth estate deigns to focus on our proceedings, the result is often more issues based reporting and less obsession with personalities and political conflict.
In this place, we also know that effective representation of minorities is compatible with stable and effective government. We know that about 85 per cent of legislation is passed in this place with bipartisan support. Why is this the case? It is largely because many matters that come before the parliament are not controversial; they do not divide the nation or its major parties to any significant degree. On these matters, it is appropriate that the view of the overwhelming majority should prevail—and it does. It always has prevailed in this chamber and in the other place, and will prevail in this parliament—provided that ‘Her Majesty’s loyal opposition’ acts in good faith.
Where bipartisan support is lacking or unstable, and where public opinion is unclear or divided, the adequate representation of minorities becomes important. It is then that genuine consultation and good faith negotiation becomes critical if a way forward is to be found. It is then that the nation most needs a parliament that is a mirror of the convictions and aspirations of the people. On many such matters in the last parliament, the Labor government was able to negotiate with a diverse crossbench in the Senate to secure important reforms and gain support for vital in-itiatives. Where such negotiations failed, this more often than not reflected a lack of any deep lasting consensus in the community.
Those who maintain that strong minority representation is incompatible with effective government simply fail to comprehend what Spence grasped over a century ago—namely, that the effective representation of minorities can work to enhance majority rule, not undermine it. As a Labor government senator, I look forward to the continuing opportunity to work with all my parliamentary colleagues to this end.
It is ironic to say the least that some of those who seek to portray the current parliament as unworkable and the new government as unstable and impotent are the very same people whose government was fatally weakened when it mistook a majority in both houses for a mandate to act with impunity. The fate of the Howard government and its Work Choices legislation in 2007 illustrates just what happens when ruling powers mistake a majority for a mandate, ride roughshod over dissent and institute radical chan-ges without community support. Neither the gov-ernment nor the legislation survived. There is no stability, and no real potency, in making changes that are swiftly reversed because they lack real support. That is not strong leadership; it is simply a waste of time at best and dangerously destabilising at worst.
On the other hand, there are many examples of minority governments that have worked. And, reassuringly, some of the best examples are drawn from jurisdictions that share our political culture. We have seen such governments work in our own states. For a national example, we need only look across the Tasman. New Zealand’s first elected female Prime Minister led minority Labor governments for almost a decade, becoming the fifth-longest-serving Prime Minister in her nation’s history.
I am proud to be part of a government led by Australia’s first female Prime Minister—a government that welcomes the opportunities which this finely balanced parliament presents to be more open and more accountable, to build bridges, to think laterally and to lead by virtue of the power of our ideas and the persuasiveness of our arguments, not by weight of numbers alone. That is why it was so gratifying yesterday to hear the new government’s plans outlined by Her Excellency the Governor-General. Our plans for this parliamentary term make clear the strength of our vision for this country’s future—a vision founded squarely on Labor values that have broad appeal and wide application. Our plans offer a firm foundation for reform. They offer a sound basis on which to build the bridges necessary to bring real and lasting reforms to fruition.
The cornerstone of these plans is the sound management of our economy. Sound economic management will secure our prosperity by providing for sustainable growth—growth that endures, growth that is compatible with the preservation of our planet and our continent’s natural assets rich and rare, growth that delivers benefits for all Australians regardless of the circumstances of their birth or where they now live. This is not just because this outcome is more equitable, but also because it is more efficient.
A modern nation like ours, which competes in the global economy, cannot afford to waste the talents of its people. Such wastage breeds frustration, marginalisation and social dysfunction; more specifically, it breeds unemployment, poverty, crime, child abuse and neglect. We want the opposite. We want all shoulders to the wheel. And if we want all our citizens to take real responsibility for building a better future we must give everyone a real stake in the outcome—a real chance to benefit from the rewards that flow from hard work, initiative and innovation. Entrenched inequality and opportunity curtailed are incompatible with a peaceful and prosperous nation. That is why Labor is committed to a high-productivity high-participation economy that engages all our citizens in the economic life of the nation, develops their potential, fully utilises their talents, maximises reward for effort and minimises barriers to innovation, initiative and achievement.
This is why we are committed to a prudent fiscal strategy. It is a strategy that will see us returning to surplus in three years—long before most of the rest of the developed world—so that public sector debt does not become a drag on our economy. As the recovery picks up speed and the private sector expands, the strategy is about creating new businesses and new jobs. It is why we are committed to further micro-economic reform and deregulation—a process begun under the Hawke-Keating government and continued through our COAG reforms. These reforms are designed to create a seamless national economy and drive competition so that private sector initiative and enterprise is rewarded rather than stymied by arbitrary or unnecessary regulation.
Our commitment to sustainable prosperity is also why we support a price on carbon. A carbon price will not only help save the planet but will also keep us ahead of the game when it comes to investing in the infrastructure, skills and technologies needed to secure the jobs of the future so that Australians win rather than lose as the world shifts to a low-carbon economy. Our belief in a high-productivity high-participation economy is fundamental to our passion for health reform. It is unjust that the burden of ill health falls unevenly on Australians and it is a human tragedy that so many in our community suffer from preventable illnesses. It is also a colossal waste of human potential—a waste that costs our economy very dearly in terms of both medical expenditure and lost productivity. That is why when we weigh up the worth of the NBN we must take into account the benefits of the e-health services it can deliver—economic as well as social benefits that are no less great for being hard to calculate.
Our commitment to sustainable prosperity is why we believe we should accept the extra tax that our most successful mining companies say they can pay. That extra revenue will help fund much-needed infrastructure, especially in our mining regions. It will help fund tax cuts for all businesses and tax breaks targeted at small business—tax relief that will maximise rewards for enterprise and help drive private sector job creation and innovation.
Furthermore, the minerals resource rent tax will help support improvements to superannuation. Improvements in super will help secure better retirement incomes for working Australians and reduce public expenditure on income support as the population ages. They will also increase the pool of national savings, reduce reliance on foreign capital and facilitate further investments in our economic capacity. These investments are critical to both maximising the rewards of this mining boom and to minimising its risks—risks that threaten to divide us into winners and losers, not just between the boom states and others but also within the states that generate our mining wealth.
In many ways the risks posed by the mining boom are greatest in states like my own state of Western Australia. It is there that skills shortages will be most acute if we do not act decisively, and it is there that such shortages are most likely to put upward pressure on wages. Such pressure feeds inflation and can undermine the viability of businesses in the non-mining sectors, where most people are employed, even in Western Australia. Anyone who lived through the last mining boom in WA can testify to its impact on housing affordability throughout the state. That is why we must invest in the infrastructure and the corporate tax relief that will help ensure that all our industries, all our regions and all our citizens can prosper. That is why we must act decisively to confront looming skills shortages.
Above all, our belief in a high-prod-uc-tivity high-participation economy necessitates a commitment to continuing the education revolution and building first-class facilities for our schools and tertiary institutions so that they are equipped to prepare the next generation for life and work in a highly competitive 21st century globalised economy; a commitment to greater transparency and a focus on quality in our schools and uni-versities so that failures can be addressed and success recognised and rewarded; and a commitment to training and immigration strategies that more tightly target current and emerging skills shortages. We should give preference to equipping our own citizens for the jobs of today and tomorrow wherever possible. This is the best way to ensure that more of the jobs created by the mining boom benefit all Australians. It is about ensuring that we stand ready to take advantage of new opportunities as they emerge over the long term.
If we get the management of the economy right, more of our citizens will enjoy the benefits and dignity of work, and we will be able to spend less on the social ills that unemployment and poverty bring. It will leave more room for further tax reform and further investment in all those things that enrich Australians’ lives and lighten the burdens of our neighbours. As a nation we can invest in sport and culture and in being good global citizens while making our fair contribution to peace and prosperity in our region and beyond.
I conclude by reiterating how much I welcome and appreciate this opportunity to move the address-in-reply and how proud I am to be part of a government that stands ready to lead through the strength of its values, the quality of its ideas, the persuasiveness of its arguments and the inclusiveness and integrity of its processes.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-09-29,"—I congratulate Senator Pratt on being chosen by her colleagues to move the address-in-reply. Her Excellency’s address to this place yesterday highlighted the ongoing deficiencies of this ongoing Labor government—a government that failed when it had an absolute majority in the House of Representatives and is already continuing to fail without a majority. In the speech yesterday there was no mention of what the government was going to do for the thousands of Australians who still have electrified roofs and are living in danger of their houses burning down because of Labor’s bungled pink batt and insulation scheme. It has been simply airbrushed out of the pages of history. That is what Labor thought. But it is not so, because we as a coalition will continue to make the government accountable.
Similarly, there was no mention in the speech about the green loans scandal. It has been simply airbrushed out. But no way: we will put it back onto the agenda. Similarly with the waste we saw with Building the Education Revolution. On the ‘quality buildings’ that Senator Pratt referred to, I recall campaigning in the seat of Riverina during the election campaign and seeing one of these quality structures absolutely and utterly collapsed. It was an absolute debacle. But, according to Labor, this is a quality building of which they stand proud. I wonder which Labor minister is going to be opening that one!
The speech provided to Her Excellency by the government was full of spin, not substance. Indeed, at the very beginning we were told:
... the remarkable circumstance of our nation having its first female Governor-General and first female Prime Minister.
This historic conjunction should be an inspiration not only to the women and girls of our nation but to all Australians.
Great words, great inspirational stuff, but what did Ms Gillard do as soon as she left this chamber? She went to the House of Representatives with a deliberate ploy to sack the female Labor Deputy Speaker in favour of a male coalition Deputy Speaker. There you have it: absolute gender equality with the Labor Party! Why did they do this? Because it was worth a political stunt. As a result, by a deliberate decision of Ms Gillard and Labor to remove the existing female Labor Deputy Speaker from her position, the three speakers in the House of Representatives are all male. Where is Ms Kirner, where is EMILY’S List, where is the Women’s Electoral Lobby—indeed, where is Senator Kate Lundy—on this issue? They are deathly silent because, when it comes to Labor Party political stunts or looking after women in the Australian parliament, it will always be Labor Party political stunts that come first. Very early on in the Governor-General’s speech we had an indication that this Labor government is just a continuation from Mr Rudd: all spin and no substance. When the acid test is applied are they going to live up to being an inspiration to the young women and girls of this country? What they will have to point to is one very, very disappointed Ms Anna Burke, who yesterday, with virtually no notice—in fact, some would say an unfair dismissal claim could be lodged here—was dumped as Labor’s Deputy Speaker. So we had spin above substance.
Then we were told about transparency, a new paradigm, and that everything would be open for the Australian people to examine. Well, Ms Gillard has another test today. As I understand it, Graham Richardson—no friend of the coalition—has indicated that two ministers refused to be sacked by Ms Gillard. Ms Gillard says that she chooses her own ministers. But, according to Mr Richardson, one minister said to her: ‘Dare to sack me! If you do, we’ll resign from the parliament and we’ll create by-elections for you, which you might lose, and as a result deliver government to the coalition. So you’ve got no choice but to reappoint us.’ I make this claim today. The chances are that it might have been the Attorney-General and the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. But I fully accept I might be wrong.
—Mr Garrett.
—Mr Garrett, by the way.

Senator Lundy interjecting—

—But, of course, Ms Gillard can get rid of all that by levelling with the Australian people and telling them exactly what happened. Let us see if this new era of transparency applies to her government and to ministerial appointments.
—Tony Abbott’s new world of made-ups!
—Senator Lundy has finally found her tonsils again. But she was not able to defend the decision on Anna Burke, what she? Very interesting. This government started breaking its promises before it was sworn in. It was already dealing with the Australian Greens, making a deal in the vexed area of whether or not this nation should have a carbon tax. Let us just recall for history how Ms Gillard and her deputy, Mr Swan, ran the last election campaign. On 15 August Mr Swan said this:
... what we rejected is this hysterical—
mark the word ‘hysterical’—
allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax ...
That was six days before the last federal election. Five days before the last federal election Ms Gillard said:
There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
Then on the day before the election—and this is how hot a topic this was during the campaign—on the very last day of the campaign, on 20 August, Ms Gillard said:
I rule out a carbon tax.
Where is that promise today, given the grubby deal that they have made with their new alliance partners, the Australian Greens? Now, after the election, after having been sworn in again, Ms Gillard was asked by a journalist:
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you ruling out a carbon tax? Is that something you will look at?
PM: Look, we’ve said we would work through options in good faith at the committee that I have formed involving, of course, the Greens, and it’s my understanding that Mr Windsor will also seek to participate in that committee. We want to work through options, have the discussions at that committee in good faith.
JOURNALIST: So you’re not ruling it out then?
PM: Well, look, you know, I just think the rule-in, rule-out games are a little bit silly.
Well, if ruling in and ruling out was ‘a little bit silly’ after the election, why did she specifically rule it out before the election? If it was a silly game after the election, it was a silly game before the election. But she knew that she was headed to electoral oblivion unless she gave that rock-solid guarantee that there would be no carbon tax—a carbon tax which will inflict even higher prices on the cost of electricity and the cost of living for each and every Australian, inflate food prices and, if Australia goes it alone, have the perverse impact of making the world’s carbon dioxide emissions even greater. Why? Because, as we price out our manufacturing industry with a carbon tax, they will simply move from Australia to those countries without a carbon tax. Indeed, in my home state of Tasmania we have a zinc works—I use this example on a regular basis—producing one tonne of zinc for two tonnes of CO2. In China they create that same tonne of zinc for six tonnes of CO2. So if you price our manufacturing sector out of the world marketplace, the world will start buying their zinc from China—no longer from Tasmania and South Australia—and, as a result, the carbon footprint on the world will be even greater. That is the perverse outcome of Australia going it alone with a carbon tax. Ms Gillard knew that. She knew the threat to jobs in all these manufacturing sectors, and that is why she specifically ruled it out. Six days before the election, five days before the election—on the day before the election, she ruled it out. And yet now it is a silly game to play, asking her to rule it in or out.
What it means is that Labor thinks they can break every solemn promise they made to the Australian people by virtue of the fact that they had to sell their political soul and their principles to cobble together a government of such diverse colours, from the extreme left of the Australian Greens to country conservatives. They try to sell it as a rainbow coalition. Yes, it is a rainbow coalition. Rainbows, as we all know, look pretty—but they are illusory. If you try to touch them they are not there. The closer you get to them, the further away they get.

Senator Cash interjecting—

—And, Senator Cash, at the end of this one there is definitely no pot of gold. In fact, there will be one huge deficit, the exact opposite, at the end of this particular so-called rainbow.
So, Madam Acting Deputy President, what we have is a government that said one thing to squeak its way back into office and is now doing the exact opposite. It is nearly doing the opposite of a Kevin—a ‘Nivek’, I suppose we will have to call it. Remember the ‘greatest moral challenge of our time’? Nothing was more important. We needed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. I must say that Nivek nearly has a nice Russian sound about it—but we will not go there. Anyway, that was the big moral issue of our time, and then—
 (Senator Crossin)—Senator Abetz, I want to remind you that, if you are referring to people in the other place, they do have a correct title other than their Christian name.
—You are right, Madam Acting Deputy President, but it would spoil it somewhat. But you are quite right.
—And you could address your remarks through the chair occasionally. That would be useful, thank you.
—I do not think I was addressing any senator directly, Madam Acting Deputy President, but if you want to hear ‘Madam Acting Deputy President’ scattered a few times in my remarks I am more than happy to oblige.
—She’d like eye contact.
—Yes, exactly.
—What I was saying was that the Labor Party under then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that climate change was the greatest moral challenge of our time. Then, all of a sudden, it could be dumped. Now Ms Gillard has done the exact opposite. She went to an election saying, ‘I specifically rule out a carbon tax,’ and now, after the election, all of a sudden she is going to bring it back in, so she is doing the exact reverse of that which the honourable member for Griffith undertook.
Madam Acting Deputy President, we were also told about a stronger economy in this speech. We recall that, when Ms Gillard took over from Mr Rudd, she was also going to become a converted economic conservative. She promised the Australian people that there would be spending cuts—a very wise policy move, one which we endorsed. During the election campaign, can anybody recall any spending cuts that were announced? Were any spending cuts announced in Her Excellency’s address to the parliament setting out the government’s agenda? Not one. But there were expenditure announcements relating to the $10 billion deal that Ms Gillard did with the country Independents. There we have it: before the election, Ms Gillard promising cuts so that we could have fiscal responsibility; straight after the election, delivering a further $10 billion completely and utterly unfunded.
Talking about things unfunded, we have the celebration in this speech of the National Broadband Network. What were we told about that? We were told, amongst other things, that it would be affordable. What is the price? What is the cost? There has been no business case presented. There is no price on it, yet they just make this bold claim, the spin, that it is affordable. But, when you ask Senator Conroy, who usually sits opposite, what the price will be for a connection and the monthly rental, he is unable to answer. So how can they make the assertion that it is somehow affordable?
If you want another insight into this government, all you need to do is read about the minerals resource rent tax. Do you know what is celebrated in the speech? That it was agreed with our nation’s biggest miners. What about the country’s small miners—
—That’s 99 per cent of the industry.
—and medium-sized miners who make up—as Senator Cormann quite rightly interjects—make up 99 per cent of the mining companies in this country. They are completely and utterly discarded and considered irrelevant, because this government does deals with big business and big unions and they love big government. We on the coalition side do not subscribe to that. We think a better outcome would have been to get a consensus with the other 99 per cent, not with the one per cent and trumpeting that as a triumph. But, no; for Ms Gillard and Labor the spin always has to be with the big companies; do a quick deal and the rights of small business can simply be trampled on and forgotten. It is not so on this side. We will continue to fight against that tax, which will impact on every Australian. Make no mistake: mining is a world activity these days. People will decide where to invest, and Australia has now slid ‘something chronic’ as a place for investment in the resources sector. The sovereign risk is now so great that many South American companies outdo us, courtesy of the economic genius of Mr Rudd and now Ms Gillard.
There are many other matters that I could canvass in relation to this speech. One thing I am pleased about is that on our side of politics disabilities is now looked after by a genuine shadow minister. It has been elevated in our thinking. It is the appropriate thing to do. The Labor Party talks about an inclusive society but disabilities remains with a parliamentary secretary. If Labor genuinely wants to call itself an inclusive government, let it follow our example in that regard. There are many things wrong with this government. I move the following amendment to the Governor-General’s address-in-reply:
“, but the Senate:
regrets that the Gillard Government has already broken its promises to the Australian people by, among other things:
announcing a carbon tax, contrary to the Prime Minister’s express assurances both during the election campaign and immediately afterward that there would be no carbon tax,
instead of seeking a consensus on measures to deal with climate change, instituting a committee, the conclusions of which are predetermined,
failing to announce any measures to deal with the influx of asylum seekers arriving by sea,
failing to provide for a dedicated Minister for Education,
failing to provide for a dedicated Minister for Disability Services,
failing to clarify its position on the private health insurance rebate,
failing to announce economically responsible measures to deal with housing affordability, and
announcing to the Australian people that the Government would not be bound by the promises it made to voters during the election campaign; and
further notes that the Government has outlined no credible plan to:
bring the budget into surplus,
cut waste,
pay off the debt,
stop the boats, and
stop new taxes, such as the mining tax”.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-09-29,"—I take great pleasure in supporting the motion on the address given to us by Her Excellency the Governor-General. May I say at the outset that she is a most impressive Governor-General and her work as the most senior Australian under our constitution has gained great admiration around the country. I thank her for the job she is doing. The speech she delivered yesterday we all know was effectively written by the government—that is a part of the Westminster system, and we understand that—but we congratulate her on her presentation and thank her for opening this 43rd parliament.
She noted at the outset of the speech that she was the first female Governor-General at the same time that we have the first elected female Prime Minister. I would add to that that I am very pleased to be the leader of a party which has a predominance of females in its ranks, and that will become even more so when the senators elect join us in this House on 1 July next year. The honourable senator in moving this motion referred to Catherine Helen Spence, who I call the ‘mother of Federation’. She hailed from South Australia. She was a great worker for suffrage, including ensuring that females got the vote in federal parliament right from the outset, way ahead of what was then called the ‘mother country’ of the United Kingdom. But we have work to do yet, right across this country, to ensure that—not only in this parliament but in business and in decision making wherever it might be—there is proper representation for females. It is something we have not achieved yet and it is an area in which other countries similar to ours are way ahead—for example, Norway. Better female representation in the business sector is something where Australia lags right behind.
I note Senator Abetz’s rather negative response. He moved right at the end of his speech, almost as a desultory add-on, an amendment condemning the Gillard government for broken promises to the Australian people. I would be surprised if during this debate another amendment does not enter this place which condemns the opposition— the coalition, led by Mr Abbott—for the first egregious breach of a written commitment in the parliament. We are not talking about election commitments here; we are talking about commitments post election to ensure pairing of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker in the House of Representatives. There was a very public breach of a promise on a written agreement in order to try to gain political advantage, and it should be condemned.
The opposition is saying that the Prime Minister has changed at least some commitments made in the run-up to the election. It is time that the opposition understood that this is a minority government and that in the establishment of a minority government there has to be give and take and that this is something highly appreciated by the Australian people. I am very clearly aware that, without breaching unnecessarily any confidences, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, was well prepared to make commitments in the post-election period—if necessary contrary to his pre-election promises—if it was going to help him become the leader of government. It is a case of, at best, the pot calling the kettle black for the coalition to move this amendment.
I move on in my speech on the address-in-reply to the much more positive outcomes that we are seeing unfold in our Australian democracy in the wake of the vote of the people of Australia on 21 August. That vote, amongst other things, went to the Australian Greens to the tune of 12 per cent in the House and 13 per cent in the Senate. It has meant a stronger complement of Greens coming into this parliament, though I hasten to add that that figure of, I think, 11.3 per cent in the House would translate to 15 to 17 Greens members in the House of Representatives if the principle of proportional representation were applied. Proportional representation or the simple dictum of one person, one vote, one value—if Greens voters were to be given equality with voters for Labor and Liberal—would mean 15 or more Greens members in the House of Representatives at the moment.
This is a question which is going to be dealt with increasingly in public discourse in the coming years. Democracy is based on one person, one vote, one value and our single member electorate system in the House, which has been in place for more than a hundred years, fails to deliver that outcome. Many other countries have moved to proportional representation. That does deliver a much greater equality of vote, and it needs to be fixed in our parliamentary system. It does not require a constitutional change. In fact, it was Katherine Helen Spence along with Tasmanian Attorney-General Clark who fought strongly to ensure that in the Constitution it was up to the parliament to determine the voting system for both houses. That enabled the Senate to become proportionally representative, at least at state level. There is an inequality, as we know, between the populations of the various states which leads to a weighting of the votes cast in them, but it was a necessary component of the coming together of the colonies to create the great Commonwealth that we have. However, it was not until the 1940s that proportional representation was applied to voting for the Senate. It is time that we looked at proportional representation being brought into the House to give us a fairer democracy and to give all voters greater equality in their vote.
Consequent to the election, I and my colleagues spoke with people on both sides of the two-party system which formerly ruled in the House. Of course, central to our deliberation was the election of Adam Bandt as the member for Melbourne and the first Greens MP elected to the House of Representatives at a full parliamentary election. We previously had Michael Organ elected at a by-election for Cunningham, which is in Wollongong, but this is the first time that in a full election a Greens candidate has been elected to the House of Representatives, despite the weight against it in the parliamentary system. We have seen three or four other seats in which, if you look at the two-party preferred outcome, it is a contest between the Greens and a candidate from another party. In each case it happens to be a candidate from the Labor Party, but in the future we are going to see Greens versus the coalition in seats around the country. The Greens will be moving to get a greater representation in the House and indeed in the Senate in the coming years. What we have seen here is that those people who voted Green know that they are getting value for their vote and that no longer can it be said that a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote. Quite to the contrary, a vote for the Greens is now a vote for a powerful voice in the national parliament.
In my dealings with the Hon. Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, I have encountered a frank, honest, intelligent person. She has at all times lent me a courteous and listening ear as well as giving me a very correct presentation of her position as leader of the Australian Labor Party as she moved towards establishing the numbers, if you like, to become Prime Minister. I thank her for that.
We will have between the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party in the coming three years a very businesslike working relationship, and there will be sniping from the sidelines—it is from the opposition; we are used to that—because it is clear that Mr Abbott’s and the coalition’s position is to try to wreck this period of governance by being negative as we have just heard in that delivery from Senator Abetz. There is not much positive about it at all. That is the old—to use the new word—paradigm, the much overused word paradigm, but things will change. I, like the Prime Minister, invite the opposition to be positive and to take part in the establishment of policy as we go down the line. I will be talking about a couple of those things in the eight minutes left here, and my colleagues will expand on this in the debate in coming days.
Firstly, a climate change committee has been established and that has been well publicised. It involves people who believe that there should be a carbon price and who want to genuinely tackle climate change. One or two opposition people are shaking their heads at this moment because they feel excluded. They are very welcome to set up a climate sceptics’ committee and bring a report into the parliament as to why we should take no action in establishing a carbon price and why business should be—
—You would support a committee like that.
—No, I will not, Senator, support a committee like that because I believe that lets down the nation. Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I think we have to accept our responsibility in tackling the enormous threat to our economy, employment, the lifestyle of the future of this nation’s great assets like the Great Barrier Reef, our biodiversity generally, the snowfields and the Murray-Darling Basin which are not just threatened by climate change but are already affected by climate change and face—the Great Barrier Reef for one—death by mid-century through climate change and acidification through this stacking of the polluting of the atmosphere with coal. It is our responsibility to tackle this responsibly and which the opposition chose no proclivity to act upon in our time.
That committee will be working hard to achieve an outcome, and we are committed to it and we are committed to climate change action as best this parliament can arrange in the coming years. My colleague Senator Christine Milne is vice-chair of that committee. She has an enormous knowledge of not just climate change but the best way forward for us to not just see it as a challenge but as an opportunity as we green our economy and take full advantage of a new technological age in which we can tackle climate change while boosting the economy, the job outcome and the advantages of massive export income that comes with that. One only has to look at the success of, for example, Germany to understand that that is the direction this sunny country of ours should be going in.
Amongst other things that have been established in this agreement with the government is that there will be a leaders’ debate commission set up so that we do not get the farce of jockeying between the two old parties on how leaders’ debates in the run to future elections should go. An independent commission will look at all matters to ensure that the public sees a reasonable debate between parliamentary leaders—and I do not exclude future Greens leaders from that; they should be included.
—Present ones as well.
—Yes, Senator Humphries, the present leader—that is me—was very willing to be involved in the debate but neither side wanted that in the run to the last election.
I think Senator Faulkner can take a lot of credit for moves to lower the donation disclosure threshold to political parties from the $11,500 as has come to us from the Howard era to $1,000 and truth in advertising to be instituted under changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The Greens have been pursuing that very strongly. It is noted in the agreement that the Greens are predisposed to a system of full public funding for elections as in Canada. We will also be moving for a private member’s bill for above-the-line preferential voting in the Senate.
The other matters that are encompassed in the agreement involve the establishment of an information commissioner to help ensure that matters involving government are disclosed to the public. Importantly, Senator Siewert and I spoke with the honourable minister Jenny Macklin this morning about progress towards the referenda which we hope will be held, if not during this period of governance then at the next election, to recognise Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. I can assure everybody that there will be wide-ranging public consultation, not least with First Australians, in the move towards that referendum as well as a referendum on recognising local government. It is missing from the Constitution, and the Local Government Authority and the local governments across this country—500 or so of them—have been wanting that recognition. It is something I believe, if we get cross-party support, will be adopted by the people of Australia, given the opportunity at the next election.
We will also be exploring ways to ensure we get three-year terms of government. One of the things the Greens are committed to is stability in this period of government, whatever the opposition may throw at it. We will be moving to see what can be done under the constitutional arrangement, which is for three-year government—you need a referendum if you are going to four-year governments—and to ensure three-year terms of parliament are as far as possible guaranteed. The improvements to question time in the House taken from this Senate—and there is nothing like a successful change to standing orders in one place for strength in argument that it be adopted in another place—are now being taken up.
Also important is the consideration of private members’ legislation, which is something that I have been working hard on. We brought it before the Senate in the last three years but it got nowhere. The breakthrough with this new arrangement with the Gillard government is that now we will see a change of rules—and I hope the opposition will be amenable to this; I believe they will be—to get at least 2½ hours per week private members’ debate in each chamber.
I have flagged, amongst the many bills which I have moved to now be restored to the Notice Paper, the restoration of the democratic right of the parliaments in Darwin and in Canberra, the assemblies, to be able to legislate on the matter of euthanasia. I note, by the way, that there is an attack on me again in the Australian, from Paul Kelly, editor-at-large, on that matter today. When you get to the heart of it, he says this:
But what, exactly, are people supporting? The 1996-97 debate provides the answer …
He is referring to polls of 80 per cent showing support for euthanasia. He goes on:
… most people think that turning off life-support machines and discontinuing life-preserving treatment is euthanasia.
This is, again, the patronising attitude from the Australian that the Australian people cannot think for themselves, are not informed and do not know what it is that they are saying they want when they support euthanasia. It is time the Australian levelled a bit more and instead of dictating to the Australian people reflected a little more on the fact that people are intelligent enough to think for themselves. There will be much more in this debate. I am very excited about the coming three years. I commit to the debate being handled responsibly. I thank the chamber for listening so courteously.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-09-29,"—I rise today to reply to the Governor-General’s speech, which was delivered on the first day of sitting of the Gillard Labor government in this 43rd Parliament. It was with honour and pride this morning that I was able to second the motion on the Governor-General’s speech. I wish to use this opportunity to reflect on the achievements of the Labor government over the past three years, given that many of the outcomes will come to fruition over the next period of government. These will be the outcomes from significant changes to our industrial sector, our education system, our economy and the election of our first female Prime Minister.
When the Australian Labor Party took up government, there were many items on the agenda. We set out to abolish Work Choices, the legislation which compelled me to run for office and the very thing which took away our workers’ rights. As representatives of working families, we knew that they deserved a fairer system of industrial law. On 19 March 2008, the Australian parliament passed the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, which prevents employers from making Australian workplace agreements and introduced a no disadvantage test for new collective agreements. We passed the Fair Work Bill 2009 to ensure that Australians had fair, relevant and enforceable minimum terms and conditions which could not be pushed aside for individual employment agreements.
We have ensured that workers cannot be dismissed unfairly in workplaces of fewer than 100 employees, like they could under Work Choices, the initiative of the previous Howard coalition government. We introduced Fair Work Australia, an independent body to handle workplace issues such as a safety net for minimum wages and employment conditions, enterprise bargaining, industrial action, dispute resolution and the termination of employment. We also introduced the Fair Work Australia Ombudsman to promote harmonious and cooperative workplace relations and compliance by providing education, assistance and advice.
Prime Minister Gillard, who was then Minister for Workplace Relations, said in her second reading speech that these changes were exactly what the Australian public wanted. She said:
… Australians voted for a workplace relations system that delivers a fair go, the benefits of mateship at work, a decent safety net and a fair way of striking a bargain.
That is what this bill does.
We set out to say sorry to our Indigenous Australians. On 13 February 2008 Kevin Rudd, as Prime Minister, delivered the apology. For many years the treatment of our Indigenous Australians was pushed under the rug and no-one spoke about it. If no-one mentioned it then we could pretend it did not happen, but that was wrong. After years of silence it was time to end this denial and to acknowledge the ill-treatment received by our Indigenous Australians.
We set out to apologise to our forgotten Australians. On 16 November 2009 we acknowledged the hurt and suffering half a million children raised in institutions and orphanages had experienced. We said sorry.
During our first term we faced the biggest economic challenge of our time, the global financial crisis. It threatened our economy, our jobs, our working families, our businesses and our livelihoods. To keep Australia afloat, the Labor government introduced our $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan to stimulate the economy and to make sure Australians stayed employed. That economic initiative has become the envy of leaders of every country. That economic stimulus package targeted infrastructure, education, small business, social housing, defence housing, renewable energy, roads and, of course, our working families.
One of the major aspects of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan was the Building the Education Revolution. The $16.2 billion project was implemented to deliver 24,000 projects across Australia, to modernise our schools with 21st century facilities, to keep the local construction business afloat, to keep workers employed and to stimulate investment. Already many of those projects have been officially opened and are being utilised by enthusiastic students, grateful teachers and the wider community.
I have been privileged to visit many schools in Queensland and will continue to do so over the months to come. All the feedback I have received has been extremely positive. There have been comments from principals, teachers, parents, students and parents and citizens association members who are overwhelmed by the very existence of the initiatives. In fact, the most profound comments came from Dayboro State School Principal Mrs Glynnis Gartside, whose school received a multipurpose hall and a library resource centre. She said she had not seen anything like it before. At the opening of the BER facilities on 14 July she went on to say:
Firstly, we are happy. These new facilities, that we wouldn’t have even dared to dream of two years ago, are well built, appropriate to our needs and will serve the Dayboro community well into the future. Secondly, in my long career as a teacher with Education Queensland, this is my 39th year, I have never seen first class facilities like these made available to primary schools unless the pressure of growth or sheer decay of existing facilities has made it absolutely necessary. It just goes to show that if you stay around long enough anything can happen.
Schools now have multipurpose halls where, for the first time, they can fit the entire student body in a building for an assembly. They have new resource centres and libraries with innovative furniture, creating the perfect learning environment.
Benowa State School on the Gold Coast has a new I Centre, full of chairs which with the flick of a lever become desks. This allows classes to study in the library. And, if they are having a seminar or speeches, the I Centre instantly doubles the number of chairs. Through a door of the I Centre you enter a dance studio. A full of mirrors and a ballet bar greet you. It is extraordinary to see this type of facility available in a school. The wider community also benefits, with local groups able to utilise these new buildings.
But it does not stop there. Chevallum State School on the Sunshine Coast were finally able to get the multipurpose hall in which they wanted to put a fully functional kitchen. The school has been involved in the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden national program, where students grow, harvest and cook their own food. This initiative hopes to educate students on how to prepare and eat healthy foods and to tackle the levels of childhood obesity.
About 9,500 schools have benefited from this initiative, which has not only given schools new halls and libraries but also given students the opportunity to keep active and play sport in wet weather while being sheltered from the elements. It has been disappointing, however, to hear from those opposite, who have called these fantastic facilities ‘glorified garden sheds’. Rather, I have witnessed rooms full of computers, new halls open to community groups and the opportunity for our future generations to move forward with 21st century facilities.
We have also developed a national curriculum which is currently being tested around the country. The program, which is being delivered online, will ensure that children who move interstate are not disadvantaged. It currently focuses on English, maths, science and history, and the new phase will concentrate on languages, geography and the arts.
Another initiative of National Building and Jobs Plan was the boost to the First Home Owner Grant. The scheme helped 250,000 Australians break into the housing market and buy their own homes. The first home owner boost provided an additional $7,000 to the already existing $7,000 first home owners grant, and those who chose to purchase or build a brand new home received $14,000 on top of the grant. This has supported thousands of jobs in the housing supply industry, including electricians, plumbers, builders and tradespersons.
Strong economic management is another achievement the Labor government can add to its belt, with the economic stimulus package keeping Australia strong. We have the lowest debt and deficit of all major advanced economies. We have the lowest unemployment rate of all major advanced economies. We were the only major advanced economy to avoid recession and we maintained our AAA credit rating. If the Labor government had not been decisive in our action during the global financial crisis, about 200,000 jobs would have been lost. That is 200,000 working families that would have been affected. Instead, more than 350,000 jobs have been created in the past year. Interest rates are still lower than they were when John Howard left office, and we have delivered tax cuts for our working families and low-income earners: someone who earns $50,000 a year is now paying $1,750 less than in 2007.
During our first term we overhauled the pension system to make it adequate for more than four million Australians who depend on their social security benefits. We looked after pensioners with significant increases, along with indexation resulting in contemporary amounts of about $115 a fortnight for singles and $97 a fortnight for couples on the age pension.
Our working families will also benefit from Australia’s first paid parental leave scheme, which was passed in the Senate earlier this year and comes into effect on 1 January 2011. I was honoured to be part of the inquiry into the scheme and to hear from the witnesses about the benefits of this particular scheme. Primary carers who meet the paid parental leave work-test case before the baby is born, have an income of less than $150,000 a year and meet residency requirements will be eligible for 18 weeks leave paid at the national minimum wage, currently $569.90. This leave can be taken at the same time, before or after employer provided maternity leave. The Paid Parental Leave scheme enables a woman to stay connected to the workforce. Continuing ties with the employee also provides a benefit to the employer, who will be able to retain skilled staff. It gives mothers time to stay home with the baby to improve child development outcomes, it helps support breastfeeding and it gives mothers a reasonable period to recover from childbirth. To benefit new fathers, the Gillard government will also move to implement paid paternity leave of two weeks at the national minimum wage, to allow both parents quality time at home after the birth of their child.
In a few short years, the Labor government has added many achievements to its name, and it will work to build on those foundations to make a difference in this nation. Already we are preparing to tackle one of the biggest issues and one that affects every single person in this country: health. Our National Health and Hospitals Network aims to deliver better hospitals and health care for all Australians, including those who live in remote areas. If implemented, it will be the biggest reform to the healthcare system since the introduction of Medicare. It will be funded nationally and run locally.
The Commonwealth will fund 60 per cent of every public hospital service provided to public patients; 60 per cent of recurrent expenditure on research and training functions undertaken in public hospitals; 60 per cent of block funding paid against a COAG-agreed funding model, including for agreed functions, services and community service obligations required to support small regional and rural public hospitals; and 60 per cent of capital expenditure, on a ‘user cost of capital’ basis where possible. The Commonwealth will also take on full policy and funding responsibility for primary health care and aged care.
These reforms will allow for more training places for doctors and nurses, improve waiting times in emergency departments and ensure elective surgeries are performed within recommended access times. On 20 April 2010 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG—with the exception of the Western Australian government—agreed to support the National Health and Hospitals Network.
Additionally, to tackle health concerns at a local level, the Labor government established the GP superclinic program to strengthen primary health care. We promised 36 new GP superclinics in our 2007 election commitment and we will be delivering another 23. Another 425 existing clinics will be expanded. One of these clinics was built in my duty electorate of Dickson and opened in January this year—two months ahead of schedule. Local residents now have better access to healthcare services thanks to the Strathpine GP Superclinic, which is in the heart of Strathpine, just five minutes from my office.
The Strathpine GP Superclinic provides primary health care and allied health services all under the same roof, and all Medicare rebateable services are bulkbilled. Along with general practitioners, the clinic offers a physiotherapist, chiropractor, dietician and diabetes educator, psychologist, audiologist, exercise physiologist and podiatrist. It also has fully trained nurses, including an Indigenous health nurse to help close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous health and life expectancy. The GP superclinic’s health professionals work in multidisciplinary teams to provide patients with integrated, patient centred care. The clinic has a focus on providing preventative and chronic disease management services. It will also help to train and expand the future health workforce and it is working with the University of Queensland to provide clinical experience to medical, nursing and allied health students.
About 100,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year, which is why the Labor government is committed to better treatment, prevention and research of this insidious disease. We have already invested $2.3 billion to fight cancer, including providing $526 million in infrastructure funding to build two integrated cancer centres in Sydney and Melbourne that will provide state-of-the-art cancer treatment combined with cutting-edge research and establishing a network of 20 new and enhanced regional cancer centres across Australia as part of a $560 million investment to improve access to vital cancer services, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, much closer to home. We are upgrading BreastScreen Australia’s national network to state-of-the-art digital mammography equipment to screen women for breast cancer; investing $70 million to expand the Garvan St Vincent’s Cancer Centre in Sydney, which will focus on research excellence in cancer care; and supporting up to two dedicated prostate cancer research centres in Melbourne and Brisbane and a children’s cancer centre in Adelaide. We are also funding the McGrath Foundation with $12 million to train, recruit and employ 44 breast cancer nurses and providing financial support for women who require external breast prostheses as a result of breast cancer.
Since taking office the Labor Government have increased funding to the Australian health system by 50 per cent. We will have doubled the amount of GP training places to 1,200 a year by 2014. We are funding 1,000 new training places for nurses every year. We are investing in more hospital beds. We have upgraded more than 35 emergency departments in public hospitals. We have provided more than 850,000 dental checks under the Medicare Teen Dental Plan. We have increased aged-care places by more than 10,000, including 838 new transition care places to help more than 6,200 older Australians leave hospitals sooner each year. This is just a glimpse of our health achievements and we hope to grow and build on these over the next three years for the betterment of all Australians.
Another key achievement of the Labor government and one which is in the midst of being rolled out is the National Broadband Network. We have established the National Broadband Network Company to invest and deliver the $43 billion initiative to deliver faster broadband to 90 per cent of homes and workplaces. The new network will be built on fibre, supplemented by next generation wireless and satellite technology. Australians will experience faster internet of 100 mbps, with the network having a fibre-optic cable connection directly to people’s homes and businesses. This is 100 times faster than speeds many people currently use. The NBN will reach out to those who cannot currently access the internet and will allow an extra 35,000 existing premises attain high-speed broadband. This initiative will not only upgrade our internet infrastructure but will support employment for 25,000 people over the eight years of the project. Stage 1 of the NBN has already been rolled out in Scottsdale, Smithton and Midway Point in Tasmania.
The Labor government has accomplished much since it came into power in November 2007. It will continue to do this and is now preparing to take Australia forward. With a strong economy and a debt which is set to be paid back three years ahead of schedule, a plan for health reform and a boost to internet infrastructure, Australia’s future is prosperous and in good hands.
In conclusion, the writs have now been returned from the Australian Electoral Commission to the Governor-General clearly demonstrating a victory on a two-party preferred outcome to the Australian Labor Party. Of course forming government would not have been possible without the support of Independents Mr Wilkie, Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor and Greens MP Mr Bandt. As a government, we have our first elected female Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. One good thing about those four people I mentioned that helped to form government is they are committed to maintaining their agreement—an agreement that shall not be broken and ripped up like the example that was provided just yesterday when the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, tore up an agreement that was about delivering an outcome.

Senator Conroy interjecting—


Senator Brandis interjecting—

 (Senator Ludlam)—Order, Minister and Senator Brandis! You will have an opportunity to speak. Senator Furner, you have another 43 seconds on the clock.
—Once again, it was an agreement that was torn up; it was disingenuous from the outset as a commitment to parliamentary reform which was not delivered as a result of the opposition leader withdrawing from that particular agreement. So we look forward to working with those Independents and those that are genuine about forming a government that is able to deliver on the back of our reforms and outcomes from 2007. We look forward to continuing our past performance to serve this great nation to the best of our ability.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-09-29,"—I rise to support the amendment to the address-in-reply moved by my leader, Senator Abetz. Mr Acting Deputy President Ludlam, if early indications are any guide—and I fear they will be—this period of minority government, the first minority government Australia has seen in 70 years, will be characterised by three things: by broken promises, by the delegitimisation of the role of the parliament and by a pretence that the last three years of failed Labor government just did not happen.
Most people in this country, I think, are used to the idea that politicians break promises. It is almost a part of the folklore of Australian popular culture. People are quite cynical about us politicians, perhaps more cynical than they should be. But the allegation against all sides of politics—including, if I may say so, Mr Acting Deputy President, the side that you represent, the Greens—that all political parties on occasions break promises is well entrenched in the Australian psyche. It feeds the healthy cynicism that Australians have about politicians in our robust democracy. But I daresay there has never been an occasion even in that somewhat cynical environment in which we have had a Prime Minister recently sworn in by the Governor-General, within days of being sworn in by the Governor-General, announce, as the current Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, announced on the weekend before last, that no promises will necessarily be kept. That is what Ms Gillard said in an interview with the Fairfax papers reported on the weekend before last. Because of what she chose to call the ‘new political environment’, all bets were off.
Mr Acting Deputy President, can you ever remember a time when the first utterance, the first pronouncement, of a newly-com-mis-sioned Prime Minister was to announce in advance before she faced the parliament on the first sitting day of the new session that the government would not consider itself to be bound by any of its promises because of what she chose to call the ‘new political environment’? The new political environment is, of course, the environment where a government lost its majority—the first time a first-term Australian government had lost its majority in the House of Representatives since 1931—because it was so hopeless in its first term. No government in living memory, not excluding the Whitlam government, was so wasteful, so profligate with public money. No government in living memory, not excluding the Whitlam government, was responsible for more gross policy failure than the Rudd government with scandals of public administration such as the BER scandal and the pink batts scandal. No government in living memory, not excluding the Whitlam government, was so incompetent in service delivery that it actually put lives and property at risk because of its incompetence. Leaving aside policy courage, it did not even have the moral courage to accept responsibility for its failures.
The government lost its majority. In the words of the member for Lyne, the now famous Mr Rob Oakeshott, it ‘lost its mandate’ and it ‘lost its authority to govern’. If there was ever any doubt about that, it was seen in the Prime Minister’s announcement of a laundry list of essentially housekeeping legislation, legislation largely left over from the 42nd Parliament, which constituted the government’s legislative agenda for the first sittings of the 43rd Parliament.
Newly-elected or re-elected governments are expected to come to the parliament with a series of impressive commitments, with an agenda, with a program. They are expected to say to the Australian people: having been chosen by you, albeit very narrowly, in this minority situation, this is where we want to take Australia. Where does Ms Gillard want to take Australia? It is not to be found in the laundry list of quotidian legislation that she announced last week.
So we looked to the Governor-General’s speech from the chair of the Senate yesterday afternoon to see where the government wants to take Australia, and with all due respect to Her Excellency the Governor-General, who of course is not the author of that speech, it was just another Hawker Britton script. It had no substance, no hard commitments, no vision, no program, no agenda. So that is where this government is heading. It is heading forward blindly, not sure where it wants to take the country, but sure of one thing: any promises that were made during the election are considered by the Prime Minister no longer to apply because of the so-called new political environment.
But there is one thing that we do know for sure about this government: the one solemn commitment that was made by the Prime Minister that there would be no carbon tax has already been broken. It has already been vacated. Mr Acting Deputy President Ludlam, I know that you and the political party whom you represent have always been believers in a form of carbon tax. We can have a principled difference of opinion about that, as we did in the last parliament. But at least you have to say about the Greens that they do not walk one side of the street before the election and walk on the other side of the street after the election, as the Australian Labor Party has done.
Let me put on the record some of the unequivocal commitments that the Prime Minister gave—and I can see Senator Conroy hanging his head in shame. On the Friday before the election Ms Gillard said:
I rule out a carbon tax.
It was unequivocal. There were no ifs, buts or maybes. There were no qualifications or weasel words. She said:
I rule out a carbon tax.
On The 7.30 Report on 12 August the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Wayne Swan, was equally unequivocal and equally emphatic. In answer to a question from Kerry O’Brien about whether there would be a carbon tax, he said:
We have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out.
On 16 August, five days before the election, on Channel 10 Ms Gillard stated:
There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
There is no nuance there or qualifications. It is emphatic. It is unambiguous. Those commitments were made by the Prime Minister and by the Deputy Prime Minister in the weeks and days before the election.
In all the miasma of spin, that was one of the few sharp points of clarity. There was a lot of woolly language and a lot of waffle, but that was something the Prime Minister was prepared to nail her colours to the mast on loud and clear: ‘There will be no carbon tax.’ Even after the election the Prime Minister said in the period when she was negotiating with the Independents: ‘There will be no carbon tax.’ So this is not just a pre-election promise; it is a post-election promise. Ms Gillard will go down in the history books for many reasons—the first female Prime Minister and the first Prime Minister to ascend to office having stabbed in the back a newly elected Prime Minister chosen by the people. All the various markers Ms Gillard has established in the history books will be supplemented by another. Ms Gillard will become the first Prime Minister not just to break a pre-election promise but to break a pre-election promise and a post-election promise in one fell swoop.
Since the deal with some of the Independents in the House of Representatives was struck and since the Labor-Greens alliance was struck Ms Gillard and her ministers have busied themselves inoculating public opinion against the objection to a carbon tax. They have been trying to soften public opinion so that these sharp, unequivocal, firm commitments are forgotten about. Down the memory hole they go, as George Orwell wrote in 1984. It will next be a thought crime to suggest for a moment that Ms Gillard ever promised there would not be a carbon tax. She said to Phillip Coorey in an interview with the Fairfax press the weekend before last: ‘In the new political environment all bets are off.’
Anybody who heard Mr Combet, for example, the person who has been given ministerial responsibility for this area, in his interview on the AM program on Monday this week would have smelt the rat. They would have heard Mr Combet trying to soften public opinion for what is now described as a carbon price. When you hear the Labor Party talk about a carbon price you know what they are talking about; they are talking about a carbon tax.
Mr Acting Deputy President Ludlam, you may possess more knowledge of these matters than any humble member of the opposition. You of course are a member of the political party that negotiated this secret deal with the government. We do not know what the secret covenants are of this treaty between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens but we do know that your political party has always and in a principled way committed itself to a carbon tax. We also know that the taxation of carbon was one of the issues that were the subject of the Labor-Greens alliance. We are now seeing Labor politicians—for example, Mr Combet, on the AM program on Monday morning—starting to inoculate public opinion to get them ready for the idea that there will be a carbon tax.
The Prime Minister is an artful politician. Our Prime Minister is very deft with the dagger, as the member for Chisholm discovered only yesterday, as the member for Griffith discovered on the evening of 23 June and as no doubt the bodies of other Labor Party operatives littered throughout the western suburbs of Melbourne discovered over the years. Our Prime Minister is a very deft and ruthless political operator. She has the excuse ready. We heard it the weekend before last: this is a new political environment and all bets are off. There can be no assurance that any promise will be kept.
Let us look at other areas. During the election campaign the Prime Minister committed herself to taking effective measures to stop the influx of asylum seekers arriving by boat. I know Senator Cash is very interested in this area because she has shadow ministerial responsibility now for this area. I beg the indulgence of the Senate to interpolate my congratulations to her on her recent promotion.
—The poor refugees now.
—You will keep, Senator Cameron. The commitment during the election campaign was to establish a regional processing centre in East Timor. We then learned that at the time that that announcement was made there had been no discussion with the Prime Minister or any member of the government of East Timor at all. There had been a glancing reference to the possibility in a telephone conversation with the ceremonial head of state of East Timor. That was exposed. It was then exposed that there had been no planning or preparation for such a regional processing centre and it dawned on the Australian people very swiftly that this was just another political slogan, another piece of political spin.
I waited in vain yesterday as I sat through the Governor-General’s speech from the chair for some reference to a policy to deal with asylum seekers—a problem that the Labor government created and which Ms Gillard promised during the election campaign to fix—and I heard one sentence which addressed the issue. This is the government’s policy to stop the influx of asylum seekers penetrating our maritime borders:
On the issue of border protection, the government seeks to remove the incentive for asylum seekers to undertake dangerous sea voyages to Australia while promoting an approach to assessing refugee claims that is efficient, timely and fair.
That is the plan. You could almost hear those people smugglers shuddering in their boots all the way across in Sumatra as they heard the announcement of the government’s plan to destroy their business, to destroy their livelihood—this traffic in human misery that puts lives at risk. What does the record show? The record shows this: since the election itself—and let us remember the election was only a mere month or so ago, on 21 August—there have been another 510 unlawful arrivals in Australia on 10 vessels. To put that into context, in the seven years between the time when the Howard government tightened the policies and eliminated the problem in 2001 and the time in 2008 when the Labor government weakened the policies and reinvented the problem there were 441 arrivals. There were 441 arrivals in seven years. There have been 510 arrivals in four weeks. So much for the promise to address this issue.
I want to close on what was bound to be one of the themes, one of the mantras, of this government. It is again, in Orwellian language, an attempt to delegitimise the role of the parliament. We have heard it from Mr Combet. We have heard it from the Prime Minister. We heard it only this morning from Dr Craig Emerson on the ABC radio show with Madonna King I debate him on every Wednesday morning. The allegation is that the coalition is opposing a consensus. This word ‘consensus’ is the new weasel word, because if you have a consensus then what it means is that everybody agrees with everybody else. Well, Mr Acting Deputy President, let me tell you: we do not agree with many of the government’s proposals. We do not agree with maintaining a weak asylum seeker policy. We do not agree with a carbon tax. We do not agree with a mining tax. These are sharp and distinct differences. There is no consensus and there should not be a consensus.
We are not going to be wreckers in this new parliament; we are going to oppose what we regard as being inimical to the national interest. I am going to let you in on a secret, Mr Acting Deputy President: we have a cunning plan. We have a very cunning strategy, and it is this: where we agree with the government’s bills we will vote for them and where we disagree with the government’s bills we will vote against them. That is the plan. In the meantime the Prime Minister and her ministers and her talking heads like Senator Conroy over there—after an election in which almost exactly 50 per cent of the country voted one way and almost exactly 50 per cent of the country voted the other way—seek to delegitimise a difference of principle and a difference of policy. It is our role in this parliament—it is our role in the House of Representatives no less than it is our role in the Senate—for the opposition to oppose measures where we consider that to be in the national interest. No genuine democrat is afraid of a vigorous parliament, but this government is already foreshadowing its extreme sensitivity to vigorous parliamentary debate.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2010-09-29,"—I would like to take this opportunity in my first contribution to the 43rd Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land, the Ngunawal people, their elders past and present. I am pleased and honoured to be a member of the 43rd Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia and a member of the Gillard government. It is good to be back to hear Senator Brandis giving his political analysis in nearly the same poor way and with the same lack of substance as his legal analysis that he gave to his party—
—To himself.
—To himself, yes, he gave it to himself. The Governor-General outlined an ambitious program for the 43rd Parliament, including parliamentary reform, building a stronger economy, continuing to build our education systems, developing a fair and resilient society, building regional Australia, dealing with climate change and sustainability and ensuring a whole-of-government approach to national security and international relations. This is a program that is designed to deliver a fairer society, a better society and a good society. This program builds on the responsible and effective work undertaken by Labor in government during the 42nd Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. Many significant achievements contributed to moving on from over a decade of lost opportunities under the Howard government.
The Labor government met the challenge of the global financial crisis head on and avoided a recession by underpinning 210,000 jobs with expansionary fiscal policies. This was at a time when Tony Abbott was saying, ‘Do nothing. We shouldn’t move. We should wait and see what happens.’ What did we end up doing? We created half a million jobs, while the other 23 countries in the OECD shed 60 million jobs. We successfully implemented the nation’s biggest school-building program. We provided $800 million for community infrastructure projects around regional and local communities. We implemented a $5.6 billion social housing initiative—the biggest commitment by any government in Australia to social housing. We delivered tax relief to families worth $46.7 billion. We introduced Australia’s first paid parental leave scheme. We invested $4.4 billion over four years to increase the child care tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We set the budget on track to be back to surplus by 2013, a year sooner than expected, keeping the economy strong and spending under control. We have funded 3,000 new nurse training places every year and will have an additional 1,300 GPs qualified or in training by 2015. We started rolling out trade training centres to deal with the skill shortages that the Howard government could never deal with.
Despite setbacks, we kept working to address climate change, with major investments in renewable energy technologies. We increased the age pension by more than $100 a fortnight for singles and $76 for couples. We invested in new cancer research and treatment centres around the country. We set in train investment in much needed public infrastructure like highways, rails and ports—the area of infrastructure that was ignored by the Howard government. We commenced building a national broadband network to make Australian businesses more competitive and provide domestic consumers with access to world-class broadband. Senator Conroy, you are to be congratulated on that approach, which clearly exposed the opposition for their failure to bring this country into the 21st century on broadband. We moved to create 130,000 new education training places and 50,000 university places. We developed a single national school curriculum and we stood up for Australians to ensure that the powerful mining companies paid a fair price for access to our resources. We will have $10.5 billion to fund cuts to company tax, increases in superannuation and increased investment in infrastructure.
The Labor government achieved this while maintaining our national debt at amongst the lowest of advanced countries. Our debt is the equivalent of earning $100,000 a year and borrowing $6,000. Interest rates continue to be 2.25 per cent lower than when John Howard left office. We currently have interest rates of 4.5 per cent, compared to 6.75 per cent at the end of the Howard government. Despite these achievements, we failed to articulate effectively the benefits of our policies to the Australian public. In addition, we were not prepared for a breakdown in the political consensus on climate change and the failure of the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, to take on the extremists in his party and take them with him on the need to act on global warming and climate change. We paid a heavy political price for these failures. We now have an opportunity and an obligation to redress these issues.
Before I move to the specifics of the government’s legislative program, it is important to understand that the myth of coalition economic superiority is simply that—a myth. Very late in the election campaign we learnt that the coalition had fudged its costings to the tune of $11 billion. Was it any wonder that they did not want anyone in the bureaucracy to subject their promises to any scrutiny? There are a few journalists who work in this building who are widely respected. One of them is Laura Tingle of the Australian Financial Review. On 3 September, in an unkind but very accurate assessment of the coalition’s economic competency under the headline ‘Liars and clunkheads fail budget test’ Ms Tingle concluded that the coalition, whatever the reasons behind the $11 billion hole in its election commitments, ‘are not fit to govern’. How right she was. The day before the article appeared, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, described the appearance of evidence about the coalition’s fudged election costings as, ‘an arcane argument about costings’, as if it had absolutely nothing to do with the coalition’s credibility—or lack of it—on economic management. We have now seen the result of that. We have seen the Robb-Hockey split. We have seen that under that veneer of the coalition binding together it is really like a volcano ready to blow apart. The Robb-Hockey split is one indication of that.
During the decade of lost opportunities under Howard Australia, Australia became the victim of many failures of the Liberal economic program. There was a failure of investment, with business reinvesting less than two-thirds of their profits. Business investment fell significantly under the Howard government and, as we all know, investment is essential to increase profitability and employment opportunities. There was a failure of innovation, with Australia ranking extremely low in research and development investment compared to other OECD countries. There was a failure of productivity. Despite the extremist attack on workers’ wages and conditions through Work Choices productivity declined, as the real drivers of improved productive performance are not about ripping away workers’ rights. There was a failure of development, with elaborately transformed manufacturing exports declining from approximately 23.5 per cent in 1996 to 17.5 per cent in 2007. There was a failure of competitiveness, with our net foreign investment deficit as a percent of GDP increasing from around 42 per cent in 1990 to 57 per cent in 2006.
There was a failure of balance, with Work Choices designed to deliberately skew national income from workers to business. Under Howard and Abbott, workers’ wage share declined by $30 billion per year while profits increased by $42 billion per year. There was a failure of balance. Despite the surpluses created by the mining boom, the public sector did not meet its long-term investment needs. Public fixed investment as a percentage of GDP declined from just over six per cent in 1990 to under four per cent in 2006. This resulted in an underinvestment in public facilities and infrastructure that Labor is determined to fix.
The biggest failure was a failure of sustainability. The resource-intensive nature of Australian development cannot last forever. This is now recognised by business and some in the Liberal Party, including Mr Turnbull. These are issues of economic failure from the Howard government that constrained the real capacities of the Australian economy. The Howard-Abbott government squandered the mining boom jackpot by failing to address the long-term growth and investment issues that create demand, build jobs and improve technology and productivity. The transformation of our economy demands improved competitiveness, increased balance and sustainability, and government involvement to deal with market failure and conservative government incompetence. The government’s policies are designed to improve private fixed investment, increase research and development and innovation, build public infrastructure, improve human capital through increased skills and knowledge and deal with the issues of environmental sustainability.
The Labor government have demonstrated that we have met the challenge of the global financial crisis; we must now meet the sustainability challenge. We must set about providing investment certainty in Australia and encourage the mass of private and public investment that is required to ensure that we are not left behind when the world moves to a smaller carbon footprint. The coalition has demonstrated that they are not prepared to act in the national interest and deal effectively with the economic and environmental challenges faced by this country.
Labor will continue to meet the economic challenges outlined by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz in his recent visit to Australia. These include recovering from the global financial crisis, addressing global imbalances, creating a more stable global financial system, creating a new global reserve system, creating a new global financial regulatory system, addressing the problems of global warming and devising a better system of global governance. If we do not deal with these issues, it will not be the billionaires and millionaires in Australia who will suffer the consequences; it will be ordinary working families battling to put food on the table and educate their kids who will face the problems of further global financial crisis. So it is absolutely essential that we deal with that. Professor Stiglitz identified some of the key problems in the international economy. He argued that before the crisis global growth was supported by bubbles, the largest in the United States. Financial innovation had allowed the bubbles to grow bigger and bad assets to be spread around the world.
For all the financial innovation that we read about, this crisis is much like how the crisis of capitalism has played out throughout history—except in the short period after World War II when most countries adopted good financial regulation. There was a mistaken view that markets were self-correcting. Markets were working at first because of good regulation, but then after deregulation it was because governments repeatedly bailed the markets out. This led to a view that regulations were not needed. Appointments were made of regulators who did not believe in regulation. The bubbles allowed everyone to live beyond their means. Governments have become used to spending fee income generated by the bubble.
It is clear that the Australian Labor government acted in a timely, targeted and temporary manner that has resulted in an economy and a view of our economic management that is the envy of the world. Despite the impacts of the global recession, Australia’s economy remains in a much stronger position than the economies of comparable countries. Faced with a choice between protecting jobs and businesses or slashing services and cutting taxes that would entrench a structural deficit, the government made the decision to put jobs first. The global recession had a big impact on economies and budgets around the world, and the final budget outcome recently announced by the Treasurer reflects that, but, thanks to the successful and timely delivery of Labor policies during the global financial crisis and the consequent recession and thanks to the fact that the government has stuck to its strict spending limits, we are on track to get the budget back to surplus in 2012-13, well ahead of every other major advanced economy.
It is a very different story in the United States—the United States that we were told for years by the coalition is the model that we should follow. They continue to face high unemployment. On 20 October the National Bureau of Economic Research Business Cycle Dating Committee officially declared the US recession the longest in the post-war period. The US recession lasted 18 months and saw GDP contract by 4.1 per cent, making it not only the longest but also the deepest post-war recession. US unemployment continued to rise even after economic growth turned the corner, as tends to be the practice during recessions. The unemployment rate peaked in October at 10.1 per cent and in the 10 months since has only fallen 0.5 of a percentage point.
It could get even worse for America due to the emergence of the Tea Party movement, whose leaders are now advising the coalition in this country. The Tea Party, or at least those who seek to lead it, is made up of dangerous right-wing radicals whose leaders have deep roots in American fascism. It is a movement dedicated to disabling the democratic state and replacing it with an undemocratic corporate plutocracy. Mr. Grover Norquist, a leader of the Tea Party movement—or at least a senior advisor to them—and President of Americans for Tax Reform, a front group for the wealthy elite in the US, has come here arguing that we should seek exemption from paying taxes. He was in Canberra on Monday for meetings with members of the Liberal Party. If Mr Norquist’s interview with Leigh Sales on Lateline the other evening is anything to go by, we can expect the coalition to take on board advice to cut income and capital gains taxes for the super rich, privatise Australia Post and a host of other government services, and dismantle Australia’s superannuation system and turn it over to the merchant bankers and stockbrokers, placing at risk the retirement savings of working people. And that would just be the start for a Tea Party type coalition in this country. Here in Australia, while we face challenges of our own, we do not need an antipodean tea party to help us along.
In addition to the economic challenges, we still face the implications of man-made carbon pollution. The overwhelming view of climate scientists, including the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, is that human-induced global warming is real and presents huge challenges to the sustainability of our planet. I am sure we will hear from Senator Joyce all the fear campaigns and all the nonsense that he is famous for in politics in this country.
—Unlike you, Douggie!
—And we will hear him ranting and raving about a big new tax. But what we will not hear Senator Joyce talking about is the future for our kids and our country, because Senator Joyce does not care about the future of our kids, our economy and our environment. Senator Joyce wants simply to be a mouth in the media running all the fear campaigns and tactics for the coalition. That is what Senator Joyce is about, and you will hear him go on and on in an almost incomprehensible manner, I guarantee. (Time expired).",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-09-29,"—I am going to reflect on what the Governor-General actually said the other day, rather than go on with some spurious rant as my good friend and colleague Senator Cameron just did, and try to transcribe the reality of what was handed to the Governor-General to read out and what is actually happening.

Senator Cameron interjecting—

—The first place we should start while you are still in the chamber is with the wondrous event where Australia is going to go down the path of investing part of $43 billion to roll out a program that did not even start with a cost-benefit analysis. I note that the key placement of the speech was the NBN. The NBN is a wondrous thing—the largest infrastructure program in Australia—but the first question one has to ask is: what price are we prepared to pay for this? Everybody would love broadband, but at what price? What price do you want to put on it? How much more money do you want this crowd to borrow from the Chinese? How much more money do you want this crowd to borrow from the people of the Middle East? How much more money do you want our nation to borrow so that we can build something that a lot of people do not even really want, already have or have to a lesser degree? This is a complete indulgence. They invested $43 billion without doing a cost-benefit analysis—that is, for those who want further information, they did not work out whether it pays for itself.
Why would they worry about that? After all, it is the Australian people who have to pay the money back. But the cornerstone of the Governor-General’s speech was the money that is going to be spent—money that will be borrowed from overseas and then spent on a dubious project which has the possibility of being out of date before it is even finished. People say that we will have fibre to every house. No, you will not. You are going to have fibre to houses and areas where there is fibre already. They talk about fibre to schools and fibre to hospitals. We do not need to spend $43 billion on that. There is a complete paucity of involvement in crucial decisions and a lack of financial discipline. Any discussion about coalition costings will pale into insignificance compared with where this debacle is going to end up.
You have to remember that the government that sits behind the building of the NBN is the same government that gave you the Building the Education Revolution for school halls. That is the acumen that will be behind this. They are the same people who managed to burn down 190 houses. They are the same people who gave you a record deficit. They are the same people who now give you record debt. These are the people who are going to build the NBN, and this apparently is the cornerstone of Labor Party policy. In fact, it is the cornerstone that apparently attracted the Independents. So this is it. This is the litmus test, and we will see where this nation goes. Many people ask, ‘Why should we spend $43 billion to download movies more quickly? Is that what we are going to get? What is the actual benefit in my life and in my house of borrowing this money? Even if we do get fibre into my house, what is the actual benefit?’
We read in the paper that people have said, ‘Build me a railway line. Build me a road. Build me something that has a real outcome in my life, an outcome for the aggregate capacity of our nation to produce goods.’ If we build lines to the coalfields, if we build lines to deliver wheat, if we build lines for greater intercapital connectivity by rail and by road, we increase the productive capacity of this nation. But you have to ask a serious question: what is this $43 billion investment in upgrading a telephone line going to do for the country? What is the involvement of the incremental increase in speed in the economy?
The other question you have to ask is: why are you putting in this request for the Christmas tree when you do not have the money, when you actually have to go overseas and borrow it? The final question you have to ask yourself is: how much more money do you want to owe to the Chinese? You have to pay it back. They are not giving it to you. How much more money do you want to owe to people in the Middle East? You have to pay them back. God help you if you cannot pay them back. If you had a bad bank manager, that would pale into insignificance compared to not being able to pay back the people that this nation is borrowing this money from.
That was one of the cornerstones and we also heard about this new Parramatta to Epping railway line. I am always fascinated about the Parramatta to Epping railway line because I found out that the first time that they promised it was in 1823. They have been promising it ever since and back out it has come. When in doubt, promise the Parramatta to Epping railway line. Will it get built? No, it will not. What we have to do in this term of parliament is actually put the Labor Party’s hands on the hot plate and see whether they actually do any of these things that they are supposed to do.

Senator Nash interjecting—

—They promised the inland rail. It sounds great. That is definitely coalition policy. We want the inland rail to go from Gladstone right down to Melbourne but then it comes down to reading the fine print at the bottom. It will be built—wait for it—by 2030. The reality is that there will be many people in this chamber not only who will not be in politics but whose mortal coil will have descended the pearly vale to the choir invisible by the time that railway line is built. These are the sorts of promises that you get from the Labor Party. We have an NBN that is the biggest infrastructure project so that you can download movies more quickly—that is not even costed. We have a promise for a railway line first promised in 1823 and a promise for another railway line that they are not going to build until 2030. These people have a job coming their way at a second-hand car dealership on the Parramatta Road. I can see it. Cash for clunkers—they have evolved into that game. These are the sorts of experiences that we are going to have in this term of the Labor government.
They also talked about building regional Australia. I have the greatest respect for the Governor-General, but I do have a sense that these are not her words—they might have been handed to her. They talked about developing a housing policy for regional Australia but then we have to read the fine print—it is only for cities of over 30,000 people. In Queensland there is not one city of 30,000 people off the coast. They were going to develop a regional housing program in one of their regional cities which was called the Gold Coast. Five hundred thousand people live in this regional town called the Gold Coast and Minister Burke said it was to help fly-in fly-out workers. Where were they flying in and flying out from?
—Bribie Island.
—Bribie Island to the Gold Coast. The other depressed regional town that they were helping out was called the Sunshine Coast. So we have the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast and it just goes on because part of their regional policy at this moment is the redevelopment of an airstrip in this depressed little regional town called Perth. Four hundred and eighty million dollars is coming out of their regional development budget to develop an airport in Perth. That airport well may need to be developed, but I think you have a little bit of a hide to call Perth a regional town. I think it has probably evolved a little bit beyond bucolic kitsch. I think it would be fair enough to say that Perth is a substantial city and should be nominated as such. But these are the sorts of intricacies that we have and examples of the duplicitous nature that the Labor Party will purvey in this parliament. What we must do is to hold them to these ridiculous promises and really shine a light on them. We want to say to the Australian people—especially, to be honest, to those who supported the Labor Party in attaining government—that if we get to the end of this term and the inland rail has not been built, did they keep their promise? If we get to the end of this term and see what has happened to the NBN—how did that promise go?
The promise that I am really fascinated with is the one that says you will bring the budget into surplus. I have to see it to believe this one. It is going to be a ripper. Just in the last week, your gross debt went up by $4 billion. You now owe $160.9 billion at a federal government level. We read in the papers that the states, which have predominantly state Labor governments—Western Australia has been good, but the state Labor governments are hopeless—are going to get to $240 billion in debt. This peak debt is marching on its way. Even under your own estimates—and you are always wrong—you say it is going to peak at $210 billion. You have your $210 billion that you owe to the Chinese and to the people in the Middle East—people all around the world that have to be repaid. You have the debt that the state Labor governments owe to people all around the world and you have to start adding these numbers up. Because the state Labor governments in their many guises are absolutely hopeless with money they are saying to the local governments, ‘If you want something, you have to borrow the money.’ Now we are seeing the local governments’ debts marching ahead. This is all a house of cards that the Labor Party has created and does so every time.
They are hopeless when it comes to managing the books. Then they try with the guile, cunning and sleekness that would be splendid in any flying carpet salesman to say that they are good economic managers. We have a party who, to be honest, started with $58 billion in gross debt and who have now taken it to $160.9 billion in gross debt and whose state governments are marching out to $240 billion in gross debt, which they have to repay, and they say that this apparently is good economic management. We will take this government back to core themes about their capacity, when they talk about a surplus, to actually deliver it.
I will tell you why I am sceptical about it. The year that just passed was supposed to have a $17 billion surplus. We actually had a $57 billion deficit, so they kind of missed the mark just a fraction. The second biggest deficit in our nation’s history is the one we are in right now. You have to remember that, even if we did get to a surplus, a surplus does not mean you have paid back your debt; it just means that you have a little bit of money available to pay back your debt. For instance, if they talk about a billion-dollar surplus—or maybe it is a $2 billion surplus, but let us say we have a billion-dollar surplus—and we still have our $210 billion in gross debt, how many hundreds of years do you want to hang around to pay it off?
They say, ‘You’ve got to talk about net debt.’ It is always about net debt. They never actually explain to you exactly how they get to their net debt number. They can say, ‘Even though our gross debt will be $210 billion, our net debt’s only going to be $90 billion.’ That is splendid. Explain to me the difference between the two numbers. Explain to me how you have got from $210 billion back down to $90 billion—a difference of $120 billion. How did you do it? It becomes very difficult. They say, ‘You plough your way through Senate estimates and you find out that there’s $30 billion in cash reserves in the Future Fund.’ We always thought that the cash reserves in the Future Fund were to cover the liability that is out there for public servants’ superannuation—$120 billion in liabilities there. But no: apparently they are saying that if needed it will pay off the debt. Then we have the $16 billion in HECS. Good luck collecting that! You will be going up every gully around Nimbin and around every pub trying to get the money out of the students to pay back their loans. I do not think you will get it overnight. It might take a while, and you would have to put a contingency on whether you get it at all, or at least a large portion of it.
Then there is the big one, a question put on notice at the last estimates and still not answered. We found that, in going from $210 billion—it was actually larger at that point, $220 billion—back down to $90 billion, they had $75 billion nominated as—wait for it—‘other’. There was $75 billion worth of ‘others’. I always get worried about ‘others’. As an accountant, I have found rats, mice and all sorts of pests in ‘other’. But they have $75 billion stacked up in there. I will bet you London to a brick that the day the light really shines on the Labor Party books there is going to be a massive hole in the finances of this nation. Anyway, there is their financial management.
Then, of course, we have come down to the great wonder of our times, climate change. This is the plan where the Labor Party cools the planet from a room in Canberra. It has to be seen to be believed. Yes, it can do it! Penny Wong tried; she had a go at cooling the planet from a room in Canberra. She was there for a little while. She has disappeared now; she is the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. She has evolved to a higher species. ‘We are going to cool this planet from a room in Canberra, and it will be a shared responsibility.’ So look to the heavens and realise that that is about to change, because the Labor Party is going to do it. The way it is going to change the temperature of the globe is with a new tax, because that is how you cool things down. If taxes made things cooler, the place would be an icebox.
—It’d be freezing.
—It will be freezing. If Labor Party taxes were going to cool things, this place would be a very frigid chamber indeed. But apparently that is how they are going to cool it this time: it is a new tax. And we have to believe this, because they are very believable people. They are just up the Parramatta Road from Baulkham Hills, and they have a deal for you: they are going to change the temperature of the globe by a new tax.
One might suggest, however crude it is, that they are trying to bring this on because they are trying to dummy up the books. One could suggest that they might be trying to bring this tax in to dummy up the books so that every time you turn on a light you pay the tax to pay for the Labor Party’s paucity of capacity in balancing the nation’s books. That is why you are going to do it. It is not going to cool the globe; it is just because they are desperately in need of a new flow of funds to dummy up their dodgy books. This is the reality we live in.
So we will be engaging with you fervently on making sure that this nation is not going to have this swiftie pulled on it again by the Labor Party. If we have to once more melt down the phones in this building in letting them know which people are going to vote for this ridiculous tax then we will do it. We will go back into action to try and protect Australia from this deceit. I want one person from the Labor Party to stand up and tell me, or tell Australia, how much they intend the temperature of the globe to cool by reason of their new tax. Just tell me that. Is it a degree? Is it part of a degree? Is it 10 degrees? How much is the world going to cool because of the Labor Party’s new tax? This is the premise of the argument: that this is the problem that they are about to solve.
We are going to look at dodgy promises—the fine print about promises that will never be delivered. We are going to look at the absolute stuff-up that the books are in at the moment, which will reflect exactly where our nation is. If you want to know where our nation is, you should go to the Australian Office of Financial Management website, look up ‘Australian government securities outstanding’ and rate them yourself every week. Every week, have a look at how much bigger our debt gets and then ask yourself how you—because it is the Australian people—are going to pay this money back. The way they are going to try and do it is by banging new taxes on you.
We will take the Labor government directly back to where we were prior to this election, with their lack of detail on their finances, their lack of delivery on their promises and the lack of believability in the omens that they put forward. Once more we will be reminding the Australian people that these are the ones who came up with a plan where they were not trying to cool the planet. They were just going to cool your houses, and in the process they did not cool them; they burnt down 190 of them. These are the people who decided that apparently a new school hall at three times the price at the back of your local state school, whether you wanted it or not, was somehow going to bring the world economy back into gear. These are the people who believed that the purchase of a flat screen from South Korea was somehow going to stimulate the Australian economy. These are the people who told you that the reason Australia avoided recession was not the iron ore exports from Western Australia, the coal exports from Queensland or the wheat exports from New South Wales. No, it was the $900 cheques. That is what did it. That is what saved the world. Remember, they said at the start, ‘Go hard, go household, go early.’ They left a couple of things off there. They went hard, they certainly went household, they went early and then they went off their heads and now they are going broke.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2010-09-29,"—I certainly appreciate the opportunity of speaking in this address-in-reply debate to the Governor-General’s opening speech. I particularly wanted to focus on one aspect of the Governor-General’s speech, which was national security. The Governor-General reinforced the government’s most immediate national security priority as being Afghanistan. The Governor-General also pointed out that our nation’s engagement has come at a high price and mentioned that all members of this parliament and government, and Australians, honour the memory of the 21 Australians who lost their lives in Afghanistan.
I was also very pleased to see in the Governor-General’s speech that the government will be introducing a new support scheme, the Simpson program, which of course is named after Australia’s Gallipoli hero John Simpson Kirkpatrick. That program will provide increased assistance, training and access to specialist rehabilitation for our ADF members who have been wounded. I think this increased support for wounded personnel is critically important given that the men and women of Australia’s defence forces face such significant dangers as they go about their critically important work in defence of our nation and national interest.
What I wanted to do in this address-in-reply debate was acknowledge some work that is undertaken by some unsung heroes in the Australian Defence Force, personnel who do their duty for their country in the most sensitive and difficult of circumstances. I have said on many occasions now in this chamber that it has been a privilege to have had the opportunity to serve as Minister for Defence in this country. One of the most important and fulfilling aspects of being Minister for Defence was that I was able to meet so many of our defence personnel who work tirelessly for the nation’s interest. As I said in this chamber yesterday, I have found almost without exception that they conduct themselves with professionalism, dedication and good humour. They do the jobs given to them, without complaint. They endure separation from family. They step into, without complaint, dangerous operations. And they work hard to protect our country’s national interests. But the job also has some sobering aspects. As Minister for Defence, one thing you dread is receiving a call informing you that the life of a soldier has been lost in the course of operations. For a minister, such calls are, as you can imagine, very difficult. But just compare that to the devastating impact on the families of our deployed soldiers. For them, that call, that knock on the door, will be life changing. So the responsibility that any of us feel on such occasions can never match the sorrow and loss felt by the families and friends of those killed in action.
As all senators know, we have recently gone through a very difficult period in Defence. We have now lost 21 soldiers in Afghanistan, 10 of them just in the last few months. As Minister for Defence during that recent period, I have seen Defence carrying out the distressing duty of informing the families of these men and then offering and providing support to those families throughout that difficult period. After yesterday’s condolence motion, I want to take some time today to acknowledge the work of ADF personnel in this area of Defence.
Those men and women who inform the families of our fallen soldiers of the death of their loved one, and who assist the families to cope with the news as best they can, deserve recognition. So today I wanted to place on the record my respect for the work of the notification and bereavement support teams in Defence. These teams are there to provide compassionate support to the next of kin during these difficult and devastating times. Someone from the team is there from the moment the family is informed, and others remain at hand through the periods of grief that every family goes through.
Have no doubt, these must be amongst the most difficult jobs in Defence. Notification teams usually include the soldier’s commanding officer and an Australian Defence Force chaplain, as well as a representative of the member’s unit or workplace if they are able to assist. I am sure that every senator can imagine how difficult it must be to tell someone that a loved one has died. These teams are trained for that task, trained to ensure that they see this difficult process through appropriately. After the first contact from a notification team to the relatives of a deceased ADF member, the ADF provides comprehensive follow-up and ongoing support to the family. With the support of the Defence Community Organisation, the ADF’s bereavement support teams begin to work with the families, providing support for as long as it is needed.
For every family in this terribly difficult position, the time following the death of their loved one, as you can imagine, is just so stressful, just so devastating, just so distressing. Defence social workers help to manage the provision of support, assistance and guidance to the partners and families of our fallen soldiers. These dedicated individuals act as a primary point of contact for the next of kin and family members and help the family in managing their grief and loss.
Defence also provides a uniformed military support officer as part of the team. That officer assists the family on all military aspects of this challenging time, including contact with the soldier’s home unit, assisting with the military funeral and managing the ongoing financial support that families require. They are crucial to providing assistance to families and maintaining their strong connections with Defence during these difficult circumstances.
The work done by the notification and bereavement support teams in Defence deserves our recognition and it deserves our respect. It reminds us that it is not only the ADF personnel out in the field who are performing difficult jobs in support of our operational efforts. I suppose it remains only for me to say that, despite all their good work and all the support and assistance they provide, they of course remain a team we would rather have on perpetual stand-by, rarely, if ever, becoming operational. I am sure I can say this on behalf of all senators: I want to commend them and I want to thank them for their work.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-09-29,"—The Rudd government got into trouble because it was a bad government. The Gillard government nearly lost the election because Australians were not sure whether it would actually be a better government. The Rudd government was a high-spending, high-taxing, high-borrowing, secretive government full of dishonest spin. Listening to members on the other side this morning when they patted themselves on the back about how wonderful the government was over the last three years, you really wonder why it was that ultimately the Labor caucus came to the conclusion that the government was so bad that they had to execute a first-term Prime Minister. At the end of June, when we last sat, in came Julia Gillard. She conceded that the government had lost its way and said that things would change for the better. But have they? And, more importantly, now that Julia Gillard has scraped back into government, will things change for the better, moving forward?
Let us remind ourselves where the Rudd government lost its way. Having promised that he would lead a government of economic conservatives, Kevin Rudd’s government turned out to be a bad, old-fashioned, old Labor style government. It was a big spending, big taxing and big borrowing government. If it moved, Labor taxed it. This big spending and big taxing agenda did not just start when the global economic downturn hit us; it started right from the word go. Remember the alcopops tax in April 2008, even before Labor’s first budget? There was a 70 per cent hike in the tax on ready-to-drinks. It was dishonestly sold to us as a health measure. It was going to stop binge-drinking. There was a binge-drinking epidemic out there and this tax was going to fix it. With any problem, any challenge, the only way this Labor government thinks it can fix it is through another tax. That was a $3.1 billion tax, and the evidence is now in: it did not work.
We told the government at the time that there was no evidence that this would help reduce at-risk levels of drinking and that in other parts of the world where taxes like this had been tried they had not worked. In fact, Treasury conceded at the time that they were actually assuming that, rather than reducing consumption of alcopops, it would increase, moving forward—which it now has. At-risk levels of drinking of alcopops have continued to increase and Treasury are raking in the benefits, because, of course, this alcopops tax was nothing but a lazy, bad, old-fashioned tax grab.
The next month was Labor’s first budget, in May 2008. We had a $2½ billion tax grab on the North West Shelf gas project in Western Australia; we had the half a billion dollar tax grab on so-called luxury cars—all taxes where Labor thought that politically they could run a line which would make them acceptable to the Australian people. In Labor’s first budget, long before anybody had heard of a GFC, taxes went up by a staggering $20 billion and spending went up by $15 billion in net terms. Yet, despite all that additional revenue, massive reckless spending and waste and mismanagement meant that Labor did not deliver a single surplus budget in the financial years in which they were solely responsible for the management of the books.
Indeed, the last surplus that was delivered at a national level was for the 2007-08 financial year, the year that Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan took over from John Howard and Peter Costello halfway through the financial year. That year, we had a surplus of $19.7 billion. What has happened since? There was a $27.1 billion deficit in 2008-09 and a $54.8 billion deficit in 2009-10, with the government patting themselves on the back, saying that this was not a bad deficit to have—the worst deficit we have ever had in the history of the Commonwealth, $54.8 billion. At present we are on track for a projected deficit of $40.7 billion this financial year. It has nothing to do with any significant decline in revenue either, which is one of the lines that those on the other side have been trying to run. Revenue declined by only about $7 billion between 2008-09 and 2009-10. It was all driven by reckless spending, by waste and mismanagement, by things like the school halls fiasco and the handouts, by not properly managing government programs that were running completely out of control.
Then there are the many broken promises we had in the Rudd government era. Private health insurance rebates—remember them? Back in the lead-up to the election, the government promised that they would retain the existing private health insurance rebates. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, in the middle of their term, at a time when she was working with her department and Treasury to get rid of the rebate for millions of Australians, was still pretending publicly and telling the Australian people that the Rudd government was committed to retaining those rebates.
Now we have had the student taxes—yet another tax. That was another tax that, before the election, the then Rudd government promised not to impose. Since then, we have seen Labor, true to form, introduce yet another tax, trying to take choice away from students across Australia who do not want to be forced into paying taxes and fees for services they do not need. The government are at it again: they are now in the process of reintroducing that same tax.
There is failure and incompetence everywhere you look: the failure to protect our borders and the changes in government policy which led to an instant and dramatic increase in the number of boat arrivals at our borders; the home insulation fiasco; the school halls fiasco—you name it; wherever you look you see failure and incompetence.
That brings us to, you guessed it, yet another tax: the mining tax. This was of course what got the government into trouble. Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan were faced with a political problem in the lead-up to the last election. They had deficit after deficit, and debt was running out of control. Clearly, the levels of deficit were continuing to put upward pressure on our interest rates, so they needed a political fix as they approached the election. They came up with what they described as a $12 billion mining tax—the resource super profits tax. There was no consultation with anyone in the mining industry and no engagement with the states and territories, some of whom were being asked to give away their own revenue streams under the state royalty arrangements. There was no proper process followed at all. It was just a quick political fix which did immediate and incredible damage to our economy, to jobs and, in particular, to states like Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales, where things stopped. Even the government realised they had done things wrong. Poor Kevin Rudd has since lost his job. Yet the guy who actually drove the tax, the guy who came up with the scheme, the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, not only still has his job; he got promoted. He got promoted to the point where he is now just one execution away from being the next Prime Minister.
I am going to dwell a little on this mining tax, because Her Excellency the Governor-General said in her speech:
 … the government will pursue plans … to obtain a more equitable distribution of the nation’s natural wealth through the minerals resource rent tax agreed with our nation’s biggest miners and now the subject of wider consultation.
I regret to advise Her Excellency that the government are not conducting wider consultation in relation to the minerals resource rent tax. Yes, they have negotiated, in secret, a deal with the three biggest mining companies—who were given the opportunity to directly influence the design of that tax, who were able to put their data into the process to help shape the design of that tax and who were given access to government assumptions and government thinking about that tax, which gives them a clear competitive advantage. But 99 per cent of the mining industry was excluded from any of those discussions. To this day, the government are keeping secret and are protecting from public disclosure, as if it were the most important national security related state secret, some very basic information which is critically important for us to be able to scrutinise the actual impact of this mining tax proposal.
I just remind people that after Julia Gillard announced a new mining tax deal on 2 July she said, ‘Oh well, we have reduced the rate, we have increased the threshold at which it will kick in and we have made a whole series of other changes, but the impact on the budget bottom line is just going to be $1½ billion.’ Everybody was surprised—how can that be? Very, very dishonestly, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister failed to advise the Australian people that they had made a whole series of changes in underlying assumptions to achieve that particular outcome.
In fact, if the same assumptions were used for the original resources super profits tax as were used to assess the revenue for the mineral resource rent tax and expanded petroleum resource rent tax, then Kevin Rudd’s original tax would have raised $24 billion rather than $12 billion. Yet the government to this day has not publicly released very basic information in relation to the commodity price assumptions it has used, in relation to the production volume assumptions it has used or in relation to the exchange rate assumptions it has used—information which the state government in Western Australia publishes in its budget papers as a matter of course. This secretive government is refusing to release that information, which is absolutely necessary if we are to properly scrutinise the impact of this massive new tax on mining on the budget, on the economy, on jobs, on investment, on the cost of living and on states like my home state of Western Australia and states like Queensland and New South Wales.
After Julia Gillard became Prime Minister two or three weeks after the election, she asserted how this was going to be a new era of openness and transparency. Because of the new paradigm we were in and given the circumstances in the House of Representatives, she said there would be this new ‘operation sunlight’. In fact, I have heard some of the Independent members of the House of Representatives who are supporting the government use the term ‘operation sunlight’ quite frequently in recent weeks. I had heard that term before. I thought, ‘I am sure I have heard about “operation sunlight” before.’ Madam Deputy President, I am sure you would have heard that term before, too, because the then Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner, released this document here in December 2008. Do you know what its title is? You guessed it: Operation Sunlight: enhancing budget transparency. That was in December 2008. It was all talk and no action then and it is all talk and no action now, because if the Gillard government were serious about openness and transparency it would be releasing today information about the assumptions it has used to estimate revenue from the mining tax going forward.
Without the $10½ billion mining tax revenue estimate, the budget would never get into surplus. We have already heard from Access Economics that, at best, there would be one year when the budget goes into surplus. We have already heard that. If the mining tax revenue estimates are not credible, if they are wrong—and we have got a very serious question here as to whether they are credible at all—then there will be no surplus. This whole budget has been built on a house of cards and serious doubt has been raised as to whether this tax would actually raise $10½ billion over the forward estimates. If the government has nothing to hide, why would it not just come clean? Rather than just having all this talk and no action, why would it not come out and release some very basic information that would enable us to assess whether there is any credibility at all in those mining tax revenue estimates. I suggest that, rather than ‘operation sunlight mark 2’, we probably need ‘operation x-ray’. I think we need a different name. We need to move on a bit in the world.
Her Excellency also spoke about the government’s promise to increase the superannuation guarantee levy from nine to 12 per cent, saying that this is to ensure working Australians enjoy greater security in retirement and to considerably boost the nation’s pool of savings. You might recall the government commissioned the Henry tax review. The Henry tax review made a whole series of recommendations in relation to super and it made one specific observation on the proposed increase of the superannuation guarantee levy from nine to 12 per cent, saying that it would hurt low-income working families. We want to know why it is that the Henry tax review came to that conclusion. We want to see the underlying modelling, we want to see the assessments, we want to see the briefing notes that were prepared in order to help the Henry tax review come to that conclusion and we want to see what work the government has done, what Treasury has done, to come up with a different view. We do not think it is right for the government to go ahead with a policy that will hurt low-income working families. Again, if the government has nothing to hide, why does it not release that information? Why does it not come into this chamber today and table all of the modelling and all of the assessments that have been done to assess the impact on low-income working families of the super changes that it is proposing, which are contrary to what was recommended by the Henry tax review?
The Henry tax review was supposed to be this root-and-branch reform of our tax system, making it a fairer and simpler tax system. Really, all we got out of it was just another tax, the mining tax. I say to the Australian people that this is a government that is addicted to tax, to more taxes and to increased taxes because it is addicted to spending, because debt is out of control and because it has lost complete control of our country’s finances. That is why it is looking for yet another opportunity to whack on another tax.
I mentioned earlier how we have had this track record of failure and incompetence over the last three years, and it is well demonstrated. Now we have got former senator Graham Richardson out there today in the Australian telling us that the Prime Minister wanted to sack two ministers because they were incompetent.
—Only two?
—I was surprised myself—Senator Bernardi, that is a very insightful interjection. Even the Prime Minister could see that there were two ministers who deserved to be sacked. But when it came down to making the tough decision they just turned around and blackmailed her. They said, ‘If you sack me, I am leaving the parliament.’
—By-election!
—By-election indeed. This is the one word that puts shivers down Julia Gillard’s spine. It is the one word that will have her drop everything—by-election. Here we have the Prime Minister who, faced with two incompetent ministers she wanted to sack, did not have the courage, the guts, to make the right decision in the national interest. If the Prime Minister cannot have confidence in two of her ministers, how can the Australian people have confidence in those ministers? I dare to make a guess that one of those ministers she wanted to sack would have been Peter Garrett. I am prepared to guess that one of the ministers that she wanted to sack, based on his incompetent handling of the home insulation fiasco, was Peter Garrett, but instead of going ahead with that original decision she gives him control of our schools. I would like to think that on behalf of the Australian people this government will perform better over the next three years than it has done in the past. But looking at the track record so far I do not have a lot of confidence that it will, and this opposition will hold this government to account every single step of the way.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-09-29,"—There are many ways in which people can judge a government. Some will consider flowery rhetoric as sufficient substitute for meaningful policy. Others will see the appearance of action through reviews, committees and endless paper-shuffling as indications of actually moving forward. Still others will only look at the government’s spend to determine whether the government is doing enough.

Senator Feeney interjecting—

—Strangely, this third group, which Senator Feeney clearly endorses, never seems to consider that the government is actually doing too much, and yet if a government has ever done too much it was the previous government, because the ALP government have made a complete mess of everything they have touched.
However, all of these assessments are subjective. Any criticisms of government on such a basis are easily deflected through political spin and the sheer power of the government PR machine. In considering the agenda of the Gillard government and its previous incarnation as the Rudd-Gillard government, I would prefer to assess its approach and impact on what I would consider to be the foundation pillars of our nation, our first principles, if you will, the values that have shaped our nation and provided us with stability, security and prosperity. These principles can be summarised, I believe, into four key areas.
The first of these is faith. Our nation was established upon the bedrock of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Our laws have codified these ancient texts and the tenets of the Ten Commandments, and our societal expectations are based around the golden rule of ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you’.
The second of our foundation pillars, I consider, is respect for our flag and what it represents. It is a representation of our sovereignty, our history, our commitment to Federation, our independence and our Constitution, which places clear limits on the power of government, and the encouragement and fostering of the national identity. Indeed it was our founding fathers that sought to encourage patriotism and independence and a national identity for Australians. Alfred Deakin, speaking at the Constitutional Conference in 1890, acknowledged the importance of fostering our national patriotism when he said:
This sentiment of our nationality is one which, I believe, we shall see increasing in its intensity year by year, and it will count for much more than it does now when the people of these colonies have become a people sprung from the soil, a people the vast majority of whom will know no other home than the soil of Australia. I believe that this passion of nationality will widen and deepen and strengthen its tides until they will far more than suffice to float all the burdens that may be placed upon their bosom.
The third of the great pillars of our foundation is family. Strong families build a stronger Australia, and through countless generations the traditional family unit of a father and mother bonded through a commitment to their marriage and to the welfare of their children has proved to be the best and most enduring of all our social institutions. Evidence supports the notion that children raised in strong families go on to be more successful by every measure and also making a strong contribution to the strength of their communities.
The fourth pillar of our foundation is that of free enterprise. Through the commitment to property rights, and through reward for effort and acceptance of the consequence of failure, we have established a nation rich in ideas, effort and innovation. We can no more afford to stifle that enterprise and expect enduring wealth creation than cease to breathe and expect to stay alive. These four pillars represent the foundation of modern Australia. Without an ongoing commitment to their preservation, the freedom of our citizens and the future of our nation are at risk.
It is in these key areas that the Gillard government’s policy agenda is left wanting, devoid of any commitment to the things that matter, preferring instead to deal in an ideological agenda more suited to Cold War central planning than to a free, vibrant and modern nation. While it may be unfashionable in some quarters, I believe that as leaders in our community we have a responsibility not only to foster a strong national economy but also to protect and defend our culture and our national identity.
As I mentioned earlier, a great deal of this cultural identity arises from the Judeo-Christian tradition that lies at the very heart of our nation. While we are a secular country, our laws, our customs and our societal expectations arise from this great tradition and the wise boundaries it places on the human condition. I regret that the Gillard government threatens to undermine this tradition. I am not referring to a lack of personal religious belief by the Prime Minister, although I do make a personal observation that the absence of belief in a greater being is generally replaced by something less than beneficent.
The threat that the Gillard government poses to Christian tradition is in the opening of the door to sharia or Islamic law in Australia. The government and its representatives have repeatedly stated their intention to change the regulations to ensure that there is no restriction or disadvantage to sharia-compliant finance being conducted in Australia. Minister Sherry even launched the demystifying Islamic finance booklet in May this year. During the launch Senator Sherry maintained:
This is not about special treatment but about a fair and level playing field that is not prejudiced against the provision of Shariah compliant products.
Minister, I would suggest we already have a fair and level playing field for all Australians based on our laws and traditions, which are not built on sharia law. Whilst the proposals put forward by the government may not at first glance seem to be truly significant, should they be allowed, the process of legitimising a fundamentalist sharia law as an alternative legal or business system in this country would commence. I believe this simply cannot be allowed to happen.
Whatever the advocates may say, followers cannot simply pick and choose the parts of sharia law that they want to follow. If followers are prepared to ignore some of the less palatable aspects of sharia then certainly they should be expected to ignore the more innocuous ones too. But if the advocates of sharia law truly believe it is the path of righteousness, then the introductory changes like concessions of sharia finance are simply a stepping stone to a greater embrace of this archaic system. That is why we should not entertain any thought of introducing any aspect of sharia law into Australia. At best it is unnecessary; at worst it is a step in a direction that is incompatible with western life and values.
The government’s record and future agenda also threatens to concentrate power in Canberra, while outsourcing aspects of our national sovereignty to unaccountable foreign organisations like the United Nations. This was highlighted by the government’s commitment to a climate change treaty prior to the Copenhagen conference in December last year, which would have seen billions of dollars of Australian taxpayer funds disappear into that fiscal black hole of bureaucracy known as the United Nations.
Our part-time foreign minister—our part-time United Nations climate change advocate and former Prime Minister—is central to the belief that a grand global plan is better than defending our national interest. The Gillard government continues in this vein because it also has plans to concentrate power in Canberra, at the expense of the states, contravening the essence of our Federation that is enshrined in our Constitution and its wise advocacy for the separation of powers.
While I have a personal and philosophical aversion to such a concentration of power, one may be able to apply some justification if the government demonstrated competence in any area of its administration. Regrettably for the Australian people, this is not the case. Yet such a record of failure does not discourage the government from trying to interfere in the lives of more Australians. While the government professes support for the family, its rhetoric simply does not match its practice. Rather than offer practical measures that would strengthen families—like income-tax splitting or incentives for one parent to stay at home with their children for the preschool years—the government is giving incentives for institutionalised child care and undermining the traditional family unit.
It is alarming that the government’s alliance partners, the Greens, have already introduced motions to undermine traditional marriage and further erode the culture of life that should logically elevate humans above all other species. To the Greens, humans are just another one species among many. Their beliefs see their adherents advocating human rights for orangutans but not for unborn children—a clear indication that their moral compass is lost in a Bermuda Triangle of policy extremism. The government’s formal alliance with advocates of such a policy agenda reflects very poorly on it and, unfortunately, legitimises such extremism in our parliament.
The government’s policies will also have a very poor impact on the purses of every family. Not satisfied with blowing the national accounts with excessive spending and imprudent policy formulation and implementation, it now wants to blow the budget of Australian families. Its promise to break its election promise and introduce a carbon tax will see the price of everything rise. Utilities will dramatically increase in cost. Transport costs will rise. The cost of construction materials will rise. In fact, virtually everything we need will increase in price—thanks to a massive new tax.
What makes it worse is that this approach is completely unnecessary. It is based on flawed science and a religious-like fervour that carbon dioxide is somehow the new Lucifer. As I mentioned earlier, the absence of God in one’s life is often replaced by something less beneficial. There can scarcely be any clearer example than the cult-like worship of the Earth Mother practised by the advocates of this great green tax with all its negative implications for our nation.
Unfortunately, the negative consequences for our nation continue with the government’s commitment to undermine free enterprise and a competitive market place. Its punitive mining tax—which was the result of a secretive negotiation excluding 99 per cent of resource companies—changes the game for many Australian mining enterprises and reduces the attractiveness of investing in Australia. It further undermines the rights of our state governments, who actually own the resources, to profit from their extraction and invest the proceeds as they see fit, accountable to their own electorates.
The government’s decision to reinstate a nationalised telecommunications monopoly in the form of the National Broadband Network—a $43 billion expenditure without a business plan—is an example of the reckless misuse of taxpayer funds. There are clear alternatives to the government’s plan that could be implemented more quickly, provide a comparable service and cost a great deal less. Yet Labor persists with a solution that exceeds the requirements of most of us. Of course, such trifling issues as the estimated $5,000 per household connection cost are not as important to Labor and the government as having a big plan that will cost a whole lot of taxpayers’ money—no matter how flawed the cost-benefit analysis.
Like many Australians, I am concerned about the direction that this government is taking. It has a track record of reckless spending and record debt. It cares little for our traditions and enduring values. It cares little for our constitutional protections, national interest and Australian sovereignty. It cares little for strengthening the family culture of life and traditional marriage. It cares little for defending property rights and state rights and fostering a competitive economy built on free enterprise. In short, the government cares little for the pillars that have forged such a great nation—and one can only conclude that it cares little for the people of Australia. And I say to the government that the people will tender their verdict—when they are given the opportunity to do so in the not too distant future—on how little this government cares about the founding principles of our nation.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2010-09-29,"—I rise to support the amendment that has been moved by Senator Abetz in relation to the speech by the Governor-General, who yesterday in this chamber outlined the plan for the Gillard Labor government in the future. How much can we believe? How much will be delivered? How much will be true? If we look at history we can go back to Mr Rudd. In the 2007 election campaign he said: ‘I’ll fix our hospitals. The buck stops with me and they’ll be fixed by 30 June 2009.’ I could take you around a lot of hospitals in regional New South Wales and the last thing they would say is that all the problems are fixed. We have seen the problems in the Greater Western Area Health Service, from problems with paying accounts to many problems where, unfortunately, regional areas in New South Wales seem to be neglected. That is sad in itself. We seem to have two standards in this nation: one for the urban areas and one for the regional areas. Of course, there are many problems with the health system in urban areas as well. I will not go into detail or my whole speech here will simply be on that.
Mr Rudd said that he would put downward pressure on grocery prices and he introduced Grocery Watch. What a failure that was! It was laughable. A couple of towns I know were mentioned. I looked at the Grocery Watch site for northern New South Wales, where I live. There were some grocery prices for Tamworth and Grafton. Tamworth is about 2½ hours drive from where I live and Grafton is three hours, so what about the places in between? We know Grocery Watch was a waste of millions of dollars. There is no need to expand on that.
We also had the downward pressure on fuel prices, with Fuel Watch. It was the same. It was a farce. And we had the CPRS, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—the greatest moral challenge of our time! Carbon is not a pollutant. You can google a list of pollutants. I challenge anyone listening to go to the web and google ‘list of pollutants’. Carbon is not listed. Why do we have so many people around this place who list carbon as a pollutant? Seventy per cent of the food we eat is carbon; 18 per cent of our body weight is carbon. Everything around us contains carbon! We seem to have this idea that carbon is a pollutant.
In the election of 2007 we heard many promises. Another one from Mr Rudd was: ‘I’ll turn back the boats.’ Have a look at the legacy of those promises and the actions of the government on asylum seekers coming to Australia. This financial year it will cost the taxpayers of Australia more than one billion dollars—a billion dollars that could be going into our aged-care facilities or our health system, our roads or infrastructure, looking after those people who are getting home care through EACH and CACP packages. That is where the billion dollars could be going and should be going—not into asylum seekers, who are sponsors of a boat travel industry run by people overseas. They collect the money from people who pay to come here. This is an industry that has got to be wiped out. But the government has failed dismally when it comes to asylum seekers in this nation.
Then there were the promises of ‘me too’ in the 2007 election campaign. But Mr Rudd was not at the forefront of the 2010 campaign. The so-called faceless men did away with him as Prime Minister. Perhaps that is why many of those people now sit on the front bench of this chamber—so that they cannot put knives in the backs of others. It is safer to have them up the front! It is ironic that those who backed Ms Gillard are seated on the front bench these days. The Prime Minister said, ‘I have more chance of playing full-forward for the Western Bulldogs than challenging Kevin Rudd for the Prime Ministership.’ Well, when the Western Bulldogs beat the Sydney Swans just recently, which was a sad occasion, I did not see Ms Gillard playing full-forward for the Western Bulldogs; I actually saw Barry Hall there.
We can go on about the plans of the government, but let’s look at the track record of what this government has done. Let’s look at the waste of money in Building the Education Revolution. They called it Building the Education Revolution but it was quickly dubbed ‘the builders’ early retirement fund’. There was $16 billion supposedly poured into school projects, but much of it found its way into the pockets of managing contractors and the New South Wales government. The BER task force found that the New South Wales government had the highest overall total percentage of management and design fees in Australia. It was taking out 1.3 per cent in fees. This is in addition to all the other fees being ripped out. Schools were getting halls when they really needed classrooms. They were getting classrooms when they could have done with a canteen. Yet the Catholic and independent schools that managed their own projects got value for money.
On election day I called into Kingstown. Many of you would probably not know where Kingstown is. It is a little town situated between Tamworth and Inverell. There was a school building of about 10 metres by eight metres with a small kitchen in it. It cost $330,000, when $300,000 will build you a very good, large four-bedroom brick veneer home. That is what my son tells me.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-09-29,"—Today I would like to speak on the story of Blessed Mary MacKillop. We are all hearing a lot about what will happen in Rome on 17 October. Australians are rightly very proud of Blessed Mary MacKillop, who will be canonised on that day as a saint. Already almost 10,000 Australians have registered to travel to Rome for the occasion, to share in the celebrations, because the lives of Australians over many generations have been significantly shaped by the Sisters of St Joseph carrying out the work begun by their foundress, Mother Mary MacKillop.
So who is this person, why is she so important and why is she being celebrated as such an important Australian? I think it is timely to tell her story in this place. Mary MacKillop was born in 1842 in Melbourne, just a few hundred yards from where St Patrick’s Cathedral now stands. There is actually a plaque in the footpath marking the place of her birth in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy. Her parents were immigrants from the highlands of Scotland and were married in Australia by Victoria’s first priest.
Mary was the eldest of seven children. While she had little formal schooling, her father, who had studied for the priesthood, educated her to a standard of religious and literary knowledge that was unavailable at any colonial school of the period. The discovery of gold at Ballarat in August 1851 brought a dramatic change to the settlement of Port Phillip, as Melbourne was then known. In the roaring fifties, more gold was produced in Australia than in any other decade of the 19th century, and Melbourne became a boom town. Ships swung idly at anchor in Port Phillip Bay, deserted by their crews to join the mad rush of clerks and shopkeepers, government servants and farmers to the spreading goldfields. All this actually resulted in a scarcity of commodities which, paralleled by the use of gold nuggets as currency, triggered wild inflation.
This was the atmosphere in which Mary MacKillop grew up. In 1854, when she was not quite 13, unrest came to a head at Eureka, near Ballarat. The star-crossed flag of the Republic of Victoria flew over the stockade, to be dragged in sad defeat at the heels of a trooper’s horse just three days later. And yet for the last eight years of her life, Mary was to know that same flag as the honoured symbol of one nation, one people, one Commonwealth—Australia.
Mary was what must have been a rarity in the mid-19th century: a business girl. She gained work as a clerk with a printing and stationery firm, receiving the wages of a forewoman, which she used to support her family when her father’s business failed. Later, she worked as a governess in several places in the Western District. While acting as a governess at a homestead near Penola, in South Australia, Mary met Father Julian Tenison Woods, who, with a parish of 22,000 square miles, asked her to help in the religious education of children in the outback.
Early in the 1860s she became a teacher in the Catholic Denominational School at Portland in Victoria, receiving a small salary from the government, and soon afterwards she established there the Bay View House Seminary for Young Ladies in a rented house. It was a curious kind of enterprise—we would call it a ‘social enterprise’ today. It was part private school and part community supported. Here, Father Tenison Woods came into her life for the second time. He was a man with a remarkable and creative mind—a distinguished explorer and scientist as well as one of Australia’s great frontier missionaries. Among other works, he pioneered the geological study of Northern Australia. In 1865 he asked Mary to undertake teaching at a school which he proposed to open in Penola. Early in 1866 she crossed the border into South Australia with her two sisters and her brother John. In Penola a disused stable had been rented and, by dint of some hard work by John MacKillop, it was soon presentable enough to be the beginnings of a school.
All the adventures of these years are documented in Mary’s wonderful letters to her mother, which have been published by the Sisters of St Joseph. Young women came to join Mary, and the congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph was begun. Within five years the tiny community had grown to a body of 120 nuns. Mary met with opposition from people outside the church and even from some within it. In 1867, Mary was asked by Bishop Shiel to come to Adelaide to start a school. South Australia had been founded only 30 years before, with the expressed stipulation that ‘no Irish or Papists need apply’, so the enmity of those outside the church was understandable enough. What was harder for her to bear was, of course, the opposition within the church—opposition along the lines of ecclesiastical authority.
Mary wanted an Australia-wide congregation with a unified direction and common training for all her sisters. The church in Australia—or, more accurately, the churches in the various colonies which were eventually to become Australia—was not yet prepared for such unity of government and unity of purpose. So, in 1874, when she was 32 years of age, Mary decided to go to Rome to seek the approval of the Pope. She travelled in lay dress, partly to cause a minimum of fuss but also to save the expense of a travelling companion. She was certainly a very independent spirit.
Women with the courage of their convictions have made a considerable contribution to the history of this nation, and it is interesting to speculate on what influence Caroline Chisholm had on the vocation of Mary MacKillop. After her return from England in 1854, Mrs Chisholm spent some three years in Melbourne and was a frequent visitor to the MacKillop home in Darebin. Caroline Chisholm was a convert to Catholicism. She spent her early married years as the wife of an officer of the East India Company. In the 1830s they moved to Australia. A woman of strong and fearless character, a brilliant practical mind and simple personal piety, Caroline combined a conservative manner with a social radicalism that challenged the colonial governments and wealthy interests of the day. The story of her journeys on the Australian frontier, riding her white horse Captain and leading her armies of immigrants, caught the imagination of England. The London Punch called her a ‘second Moses in bonnet and shawl’. Perhaps Caroline Chisholm’s greatest and most lasting achievement was the establishment of the dignity of womanhood after the degradation of the convict era. Without rank or wealth, and with very meagre support, Caroline Chisholm settled some 11,000 women in security and independence, and, from the day she dedicated her ‘talents to the God that gave them’, she steadfastly refused any reward for her work.
Caroline Chisholm would have been a greatly honoured guest in the MacKillop home at Darebin. Her greatest achievements were in the process of development. For the young Mary, then in her early teens, the personality and burning enthusiasm of the visitor must have made a lasting impression—particularly about the needs of immigrants. In Sydney, Mary visited immigrant ships and offered what help she and her sisters could. Later, at Mackay in Queensland, she taught catechism to the children of the Kanaka workers—indentured labourers from the islands of the Pacific—in the plantations.
Mary travelled around in a buggy, collecting the children of immigrants to teach them the truths of their faith. This commitment continues in the work that the Sisters of St Joseph are doing today for the migrants—not only for the thousands of migrant children in their city schools, but also those in hostels and detention centres. And, like Caroline Chisholm, Mary MacKillop maintained her spirit of determination and unselfish commitment in the face of fierce opposition, willingly forgiving those who misjudged her. In the most difficult of times, when she was excommunicated from the church, she consistently refused to attack those who wrongly accused her and undermined her work, but continued in the way she believed God was calling her.
Mary and the early sisters, together with other religious orders and lay teachers of the time, had a profound influence on the forming of Catholic education as we have come to know and experience it in Australia today. Over her 40 years of active leadership Mary founded 160 Josephite houses, including 117 schools, 12 homes to care for orphans and the homeless and destitute, and refuges for ex-prisoners and ex-prostitutes who wished to make a fresh start in life. At her death the family she had founded in Christ numbered 1,000 sisters—an extraordinary record.
Throughout her life Mary suffered ill health. Her last years were spent in a wheelchair and she died in 1909. Since then the congregation has grown. It now numbers some 2,500, working mainly in Australia and New Zealand but also scattered singly or in small groups around the world—in Peru, Brazil and in refugee camps in Uganda and Thailand. Most recently, the Sisters of St Joseph have been sending their nuns back to Ireland. The ‘Brown Joeys’ can be seen in big city schools, on dusty bush tracks, in modern hospitals and in caravans working with homeless people, new migrants, Indigenous communities and with the lonely and the unwanted in direct care and advocacy—standing with and speaking with them. In their respect for human dignity and their commitment to social justice, the sisters continue the work that Mary MacKillop began. This feisty Australian woman inspired great dedication to God’s work in the then new colonies.
In today’s world, Mary MacKillop stands as an example of extraordinary courage and trust in her living out of God’s loving and compassionate care of those in need. I know that we will be hearing many local stories of devotion to this wonderful woman—whose prayerful intercessions brought about amazing healings of mind, body and spirit—in the lead-up to the canonisation in just 18 days time.
This is the background to the woman who will be canonised in Rome. Canonisation is the act by which the Pope declares in a definitive and solemn way that the person is actually in the glory of heaven interceding for us before the Lord and is to be publicly venerated by the whole church. There is a complex series of requirements before somebody can be canonised. Without going into the details of the examination of miracles—that is a story for another day—let me explain that the church does not make a saint, it recognises a saint.
Canonisation is actually a double statement: it is about the life of the person but it is also about the faith of the people who are alive at this moment. So while this canonisation recognises Mary MacKillop, it also recognises that we are a part of it. For those who will have the honour of being in Rome for this occasion it will be an extraordinary experience of the faith that is alive in the modern world.
I would like to place on record my appreciation for the fact that the government is supporting the canonisation of Mary MacKillop. The Prime Minister attended a fundraising event in Sydney during the election campaign and made a commitment of $1.5 million to help meet the costs of the canonisation and to contribute to the work of the Mary MacKillop Foundation, which works with rural and remote communities, particularly in supporting disadvantaged families. That commitment was supported by Mr Hockey, representing the opposition. I know that all sides of the parliament and all sides of politics understand that, with the canonisation of Blessed Mary MacKillop, we are honouring a great Australian.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Blessed Mary MacKillop</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-09-29,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Abetz today, relating to the Gillard government
I am waiting with great interest under the new paradigm for Senator Conroy and Senator Carr to actually give answers to questions without reading them. I want to see the new paradigm in relation to that matter.

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—Order! Senator Conroy, you know it is disorderly to speak when you are not in your seat.
—He leaves with the quotes from Senator Carr in his little satchel in case he needs them further down the track. Senator Chris Evans said, ‘We will be providing stable and effective government.’ I think Richo blew the cover on that today. He absolutely blew the cover on stable and effective government because guess how the Prime Minister got to put her ministry together? With threats from two of the cabinet ministers who said they were going to leave unless they were kept there. I do not think it is appropriate to name names except to mention—
—Oh, please do it. Come on.
—No, except to mention the member for Kingsford Smith and the member for Barton, otherwise there would be totally inappropriate conjecture about who those ministers might have been.
In the very brief time available to me I want to look at this new paradigm. One would have thought that a new paradigm would involve a couple of very simple things: that you would be honest with the Australian people and surely that you would keep your election promises. There is no new paradigm. In the space of a week and a half we have seen the new paradigm slip back to the old paradigm very quickly. I am sure some of my colleagues will refer to this as well.
—I think the new paradigm has disappeared up its own fundament.
—Yes, that is right. Thank you, Senator Brandis, for that description of what has happened. That is a very horrifying thought. Having said that, I want to talk about two issues: firstly, the carbon tax and, secondly, the fraud that has been perpetrated on the Australian people by this incoming Gillard government. I still think of it as the Gillard-Rudd government but I suppose that is the old paradigm and not the new one. They are going to commit exactly the same sins of the dynamic duo that we saw before the last election. We are seeing back in place immediately after the election this doubletalk driven by the spin doctors. This is not a new paradigm; this is a repetition of the dishonesty that we saw before the election.
I just want to refer to the Prime Minister’s comments in relation to the carbon tax. Everyone knows that she ruled this out before the election. Why did she move to rule this out before the election? Because she knows, everyone in this chamber knows, everyone in the other place knows and the community knows that only one outcome will flow from a carbon tax or a price on carbon—that is, increased electricity prices. That is why, to avoid the coalition and the opposition telling the Australian people what the outcomes were going to be, she made the comment in public during the campaign that there would be no tax on carbon.
We now know that to be completely and utterly untrue, because the grubby alliance between this Prime Minister and Senator Bob Brown will wreak havoc upon this community and will lead to the repetition of further broken promises. Hang on and wait until this mob get another three or four senators to have control of the Senate from next July. The only interesting dynamic about that will be whether we get the red greens running the Greens party or whether we get the green greens running the party. Hang on for the ride with that as well.
I just want to refer, in the seconds left to me, to the Prime Minister’s comment when asked by the media on 16 September whether she would rule out a carbon tax, which she had ruled out before. She said:
PM: Look, we’ve said we would work through options in good faith at the committee that I have formed involving, of course, the Greens … We want to work through options, have the discussions at that committee in good faith.
JOURNALIST: So you’re not ruling it out then?
PM: Well, look, you know, I just think the rule-in, rule-out games are a little bit silly.
She categorically ruled out a carbon tax, and the Australian community is just about to get one. (Time expired)

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2010-09-29,"—I rise to contribute to this debate to take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, to the question asked by Senator Abetz. While it might be that the winter of discontent has turned into glorious summer in the House of Representatives and a new paradigm, it is clear to all and sundry that the old paradigm continues to prevail here in the Senate. There could have been no clearer demonstration of that given than today’s question time, because of course in today’s question time we have seen the coalition concert comprised of a denial of the existence of climate change, a continuing determination to raise a fear in the community of refugees and a continued determination to rail against the stimulus package. And all of that of course is wrapped up in a farrago of nonsense about breaking promises. So let me take this issue and confront it head on. I should say that in my summary of the opposition’s performance in question time I have done Senator Fifield an injustice. The sight of watching him put on Bill Shorten’s shoes and then fall over at the first hurdle was indeed a delight.
So what we have to do here today is to take a look at what this opposition attack is all about. It is a matter of fact that the Labor Party in the election campaign articulated, and articulated strongly, its position in terms of our approach on climate change. That approach is well known to this chamber and well known to those senators opposite because on two occasions we put a bill before this parliament and on two occasions those opposite rejected it. Some of you rejected it because you do not believe climate change is real; some of you rejected it because you saw it as a great political opportunity. But there are two things that we can be certain of. The first thing we can be certain of is that those opposite continue to obstruct and wreck when the government puts forward propositions to deal with climate change. The second thing we can be certain of is that those opposite now have a perfect record with respect to their agreement making, because whether it was their agreement for a new paradigm or whether it was their agreement to implement an amended CPRS, on both occasions their word was worth nothing. Despite the Leader of the Opposition insisting that we could at the very least trust his word when it was in writing, we now know that to be false as well.
What is clear to us is that at the election the Labor Party did not secure a majority in the House of Representatives. That is a cause of celebration for those opposite, and fair cop. I would certainly prefer that we had a majority and of course they are delighted that we do not have one. But in the event, of course, we have formed a minority government; and that means there is a new practical reality on the government. That new practical reality is this: in the event that we are to successfully achieve action on climate change and in the event that we are able to get legislation through the House of Representatives and the Senate we require a consensus, at least a consensus that exists amongst a majority of members in both houses. How is it that those opposite can claim and insist that we are breaking our word because we have set up an all-party committee to deal with this issue because we are resolved to, again, rebuild a community consensus on climate change? That proposition is a nonsense and a deliberate distortion of the facts.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Senator Abetz, if you can restrain yourself for at least a moment, the facts are that we are resolved to take action on climate change just as you are equally resolved to make sure there is none. We have formed an all-party committee to work through these issues. There will be two empty seats at that committee, Senator Abetz; perhaps one of them was intended for you. But that does not change or avert the fact that it is now clearly a practical issue of getting the numbers in the House of Representatives. This is a proposition that must get a majority in the House of Representatives for it to pass.
—What about this place?
—Senator Fifield, I will take that interjection. This place continues to be a challenge for the government, and I have no doubt that you will do your very best to make sure that continues to be the case, because you are not in the business of creating effective legislation in this place, you are not in the business of helping build a successful— (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-09-29,"—It is clear, after listening to Senator Feeney’s contribution, that the first broken promise of the Gillard government was that the Prime Minister would choose her ministry on merit—that she would not reward the plotters and the factional backstabbers who did Kevin Rudd in. Senator Feeney and the rest of his gang of four who trooped down to knife Kevin Rudd—Senator Farrell, Senator Arbib and Mr Shorten—have all been promoted, irrespective of their credentials or their talents and in contravention of the Prime Minister’s promise to only assess the ministry on merit.

Senator Feeney interjecting—

—Senator Feeney might think I am being unkind, but if that is the best defence he can make, it is a challenge for this government for them to break their promises. Senator Feeney is the man who was the architect of a successful South Australian Labor Party election after which the Treasurer said to the opposition, ‘You don’t have the character to break your promises’ as he reneged on promise after promise after promise that was put forward during the campaign. The dirty fingerprints of the Sussex Street mob and their comrades right around Australia are at work in this government, and we have a Prime Minister who said and did anything that she was told to say and do by the faceless factional men of which Senator Feeney is one.
Unfortunately, they carried it off, but they have carried it off to the detriment of the Australian people. Now, the Australian people are going to face electricity hikes, price hikes of 50 per cent or more, because of the unholy alliance that has been created between the Greens and the left of the Labor Party. Make no mistake, the left are on the march in the Labor Party. Whilst it may be the right wing that control the numbers, the left are getting the spoils. They are having influence in the policy, because that is where Julia Gillard is taking them. It is a problem for Australia. Not only will families suffer because we have a government that does not care about families—it only cares about taxes and being able to spend taxpayers’ money flippantly—but we also know that this is a government that does not hold to high standards of ministerial accountability. If there is a truth teller in the government’s ministerial ranks—and I will not besmirch him—it is Minister Garrett. Remember, Minister Garrett, before the 2007 election, said, ‘It’s all right; we’ll change it all when we get in.’ He was the only man to tell the truth. What has his reward been for getting in and changing policies, destroying houses and placing people’s lives in jeopardy? Was there any accountability for it? No. Was there any demotion for it? No. What has actually happened? He has maintained his ministerial rank, and one can only surmise that he has greenmailed the government—just like the Greens party he has greenmailed the Prime Minister—to keep his spot in cabinet.
This is a great tragedy, because we have a government that are only interested in power for power’s sake. They are not governing for the important long-term benefits for the country. They are not governing for the restoration of some fiscal sanity into our national accounts. It is not for restoring some faith in the parliamentary process. They promised sweetness and light and transparency—operation sunlight. They promised a whole range of reforms, but they cannot deliver on any of them because they do not really want to deliver on them. The problem we have is that in their platitudes, in their soothsaying and in their prepared speech that they gave to the Governor-General yesterday—which really did not outline a national vision—they have said, ‘We’re not fair dinkum.’ They have broken their promise to the Australian people. The Prime Minister, halfway through an election campaign, ruled out a carbon tax and a few weeks later brought it back in. She said that she had changed her mind on immigration and detention policies for people coming here and for offshore processing, and yet got in and has not put serious effort into honouring her commitment. She has a part-time foreign minister representing Australia’s international interests. He is part-time because he is also working for the climate change committee of the United Nations—on a road down which he nearly sent us. This is a government that really have no idea what their intention is and where they are going. It is a great disappointment to me that this government is in power, and I know it is a great disappointment to the Australian people. It is a government that will not come clean with the Australian people. They will say and do anything to keep in power, and the Australian people will come to and recognise that.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Gillard Government</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2010-09-29,"—The one promise I make at the start of this contribution is that I will not use the word ‘paradigm’ at any stage during the next five minutes—
—You just have!
—From this point on, I will not use that word. One thing that has remained clear in the debate that we had in this place around question time and afterwards is that the major resource that seems to be used often by those on the other side continues to be the media, particularly the Australian newspaper. We heard this afternoon when Senator Ronaldson began his contribution, which I believe was supposed to be on the questions that were asked in this place, that he immediately quoted from a recent article in the Australian and went straight down that path of quoting on the issue of the day. In the following contributions we have heard so far in this debate we have had a series of attacks—attacks on individuals and on process. The one thing that has become clear and that I think has been the leitmotif of the contributions we have heard so far is that those on the other side are extremely disappointed at the result of the election. I think I can take it as a clear understanding that they are disappointed. What they have actually said is that they do not like the result. As a result of that they are throwing abuse at the people on this side, and they also keep going with this really sad personal attack on what they describe as the ‘unholy alliance’ between two parties who have made an agreement to work together in the process of forming government. It is not an ‘unholy’ alliance.
One of the very good things about the recent election is that the people of Australia actually found out about the process and what it takes to form government in the House of Representatives. I do not think anyone, apart from the parties, who understood that you need to have 76 seats, actually understood the importance of the figure of 76. Now the community knows that, and there seems to be some sense that there was something wrong and unholy about the way that a government has been formed by taking a number of votes from different areas to actually come to the number of 76. It was a process that was being gone through by both sides of the chamber. Both sides were trying to seek alliances to come to 76, and the end result is that we now have a government that will have a great deal of scrutiny—and that scrutiny is important. On the issue of the carbon tax, what has happened is that the Prime Minister has now, in terms of working in government, instituted a process which will go through the chambers of parliament. We do know that there is concern about getting the advisory committee together and it will not, at this stage, include all parliamentary contributors because there seems to be some trouble with people in the opposition taking their role in that committee.
The process will be that there will be clear debate around all the issues to do with climate change, including the issue of carbon tax, which has been in the community and in discussion. We had Senator Boswell today quoting from the business groups that put that there. We will have a process in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, and it probably would not be too far to claim that there could well be some committees on this process. We will look very closely again at all of these issues.
All of that is the way our democracy operates. We have the process, we have people contributing, we have the chance for debate and then it goes to a vote—a vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate which will determine the result which will determine the future of our policy and what will happen in our community. Then the people of Australia will have the chance at the next round of the electoral cycle to see whether they support that process or not. It is not going to be such a different process; all it will be will be allowing the democratic practices of our parliament to proceed, and that is a good thing. We might not always like the result—we have had some disappointment about the result of the election already expressed this afternoon. I expressed some disappointment at the results of some of the votes in this place at the last parliament. Nonetheless, the procedures continue and the final people who will have the say will be the community and the people of this country, because they will see how our parliamentary processes operate and how any alliance between any groups will function to benefit them. That is not such a hard concept, and we must continue to play our role in that whole process. (Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2010-09-29,"—The ever-lengthening list of broken promises from this government is nothing short of appalling, and what is really sad is that the Australian people are almost starting to become immune. They are almost immune to the seemingly almost daily broken promises from this government. I say to the Australian people—every single person across this country who is listening right now—do not let that happen. Stop the immunity, start paying attention and start noticing every single time this government breaks a promise, because it is going to keep happening.
This is a government that should be called the BP government, because they are slick as oil when it comes to breaking their promises. They have form. Forget about all the things that are happening at the moment; let’s have a quick walk down memory lane to the last term of government. What did they say before the last election? ‘We will fix hospitals. If there hasn’t been an improvement by the middle of 2009, we will move to take over the hospital system.’ Guess what, colleagues? As you all well know, nothing has happened. We still walk into our hospitals in our regional areas and know that there has been absolutely no improvement.
And the list of broken promises goes on. Remember computers to every secondary school student in years nine to 12? Those are gone—completely gone. What is it now—every second child and only if all the parents in the schools are actually going to pay for all the associated costs? Remember GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch? They promised to put downward pressure on grocery and fuel prices. That is another broken promise. I particularly like this next one. What about retaining the private health insurance rebates? They promised they would retain them. What do we see now? A government that is planning to do exactly the opposite. It is appalling. The Australian people deserve better than this. They deserve better than a government that is going to break its promise at every turn.
But isn’t it interesting now? We have seen over the last term those broken promises throughout the term. Now we have a situation where the Prime Minister is telling us before she even breaks them that she is going to break her promises. Maybe that is just to harden up the electorate so that when they all come, as inevitably they will, the electorate is a little bit more immune to the broken promises from the government. What is it that she said? The Age on 17 September said:
JULIA Gillard has declared that climate change and some other election promises will not be kept to the letter by her minority government - and “people are going to have to get used to it'”.
I think that if she could not form a government that was going to allow her to deliver on her election promises then she probably should not have formed that government at all, because those people across this country who voted for her on her promises deserve to believe that those promises will be honoured, and they simply are not.
One of the worst broken promises, of course, is on the carbon tax—and isn’t that a beauty? Let’s have a look at a couple of those quotes from the government—prior to the election, mind you. On Meet the Press of 15 August, Wayne Swan said:
… what we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax …
He also said:
We have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out.
Julia Gillard claimed ‘There will be no carbon tax—’
—Order! You must refer to the Prime Minister by her proper title.
—I do apologise. The Prime Minister again claimed:
There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.
How can the Australian people believe anything at all that this government says? We know that this government now wants a carbon tax, and there are two very simple things that the Australian people need to understand. This is going to be a massive new tax that is going to hurt Australian people from one coast to the other. It is going to increase the cost of electricity; all of the costs that are going to be incurred are going to be passed on down to you, the Australian people, and guess what? If the rest of the world is not on board, it is not going to make the slightest bit of difference to the climate. So here we go again on this merry-go-round—down this fairyland path—the same way we did with the ETS: with the government trying to convince people it is going to change the climate. As my very good colleague in front of me, Senator Joyce, says: if taxes were going to cool the climate, this place would be freezing. It is not going to do what the government says it is going to do. The best climate change we have seen recently—the coolest the planet was—was probably in the office on the other side of this place when they had a change of leadership in the Labor Party. This government will not stop breaking their promises, and the Australian people need to know it.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2010-09-29,"—This is Australia’s 43rd Parliament in our federal history, but some things never change. What has not changed since Federation is this: Labor governments always get Australia further into debt. Every Labor government spends more money than it brings in, every one of them since 1901.
I note that my friend and colleague Senator Fifield’s matter of public importance relates to the Gillard government’s failed budget strategy of debt and deficit, or should I say today the Gillard-Bob Brown government, the red-green coalition. This MPI would have been as relevant in 1995 under Mr Keating. This MPI would have been just as relevant in 1975 under Mr Whitlam. This MPI would have been just as relevant in 1945 under Mr Curtin or Mr Chifley. This MPI would have been just as relevant in 1905 in the aftermath of the first Labor government of John Christian Watson. The one thing that remains the same is debt. Remember this, there is an iron law of Australian politics and it is this: when Labor leaves office, Australia is further in debt. In good times, in bad times, in peace or in war, Labor sends Australia further into debt. It never, ever, ever changes.
—We won the war, didn’t we?
—In good times or bad, war or peace, it is always the same, Senator Cameron—more debt. Eleven Labor prime ministers and always more debt. The only common element in Labor Party politics from 1901 is more debt. Sometimes Labor are socialist, sometimes they are social democratic, sometimes they say they are economic conservatives. Sometimes they play up to blue-collar conservative constituencies. Sometimes they play up to the inner-city swingers. They change a bit, but what is the one constant: they always leave more debt. That never changes.
Under Labor, no matter what the era, no matter how trendy, no matter what leader they have, no matter what faction, no matter what gender, no matter what agenda, no matter whether they are committed to the White Australia policy or multiculturalism, no matter whether they are committed to protectionism or to free trade, no matter whether they are pro-Soviet or pro-American, it is always the same with Labor—more debt. That is the one constant in 110 years.
What are the consequences of debt? The cost of money goes up; debt places upward pressure on interest rates. That is the one constant in 110 years of federal government. We will hear this afternoon the Labor Party say: ‘Don’t worry, because this time we promise the debt really is necessary. It has to be done. Going into debt $100 million a day this time really is worth it. This time we have got it right. This time it has to be done.’
So what did Labor do? They had two flagship programs to stop the recession: putting pink batts into the roofs of Australian homes and building school halls. That was their plan to stop the recession. In the end some buildings burned down and others were built. That was what Labor’s policies to stop us from going into recession came down to. That was Labor’s failed recipe to stop us going into recession. We now know that the pink batts program was an absolute fiasco. There were four deaths, 200 house fires, 1,000 electrified roofs and dodgy insulation that is going to cost a further $1 billion to fix. It has also left a trail of ruined businesses throughout Australia. This was their good idea to save Australia from going into recession—putting pink batts into the roofs of Australian homes. Even poor Ms Gillard, the Prime Minister, said there were issues with that program—there were issues, indeed. It was an embarrassing failure and it is going to cost another $1 billion of Australian taxpayers’ money to fix it.
Then of course there was the Building the Education Revolution, one of the greatest infrastructure projects in Australia’s history. It was worth $16 billion. What did it amount to in the end? It amounted to overpriced school halls. They were somewhere between 40 and 60 per cent overpriced. Why? Because the government did not have the oversight mechanisms to determine how much those buildings should have cost. When they asked state governments to spend the money they did not have the oversight mechanisms to determine what was good value for money. As a result, for $16 billion, taxpayers got about $8 billion worth of value; $8 billion was wasted. These were the great projects to save us from recession.
It had nothing to do apparently with having one of the soundest banking systems in the world, courtesy of the Howard-Costello government. It had nothing at all to do with having one of the soundest prudential and financial regulatory systems in the world? It had nothing to do with the fact that we ran surplus budgets for 10 consecutive years? It had nothing to do with the fact that there was no government debt? It had nothing to do with the fact that we had a AAA credit rating? No, it had nothing to do with any of that. The government thinks it kept us out of recession by putting pink batts into the ceilings of Australian homes and building overpriced school halls. It had nothing to do with the fundamental soundness of the Australian economy, which is totally due to the Howard-Costello government?
It was an absolutely embarrassing shambles. If only it were so simple then all President Obama would have had to do was put insulation in roofs and spend some money on school halls and America would not have gone into recession. It would have been the same for Gordon Brown in Britain. This is a joke, an embarrassment and a fiasco. Those schemes are indefensible.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,38,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2010-09-29,"—Net debt roughly comprises two things: income and expenditure. Income, generally speaking, for the government is a matter of tax. In the last term of the Labor government in response to a campaign promise there was a very significant tax reduction for many Australians. At the same time there was also an increase in the single pension rate. That substantial increase in the single pension rate was much overdue. There was also an increase in the utilities allowance for pensioners. There were some tax increases by the previous government as well. Significantly, there was the alcopops tax and the lifting of a tax exemption for offshore gas industries.
In bringing forward this matter of public importance about the budget strategies and debt I presume the coalition are not proposing to take away the tax reductions that were given to ordinary Australians last term and are not proposing to take back the increase in the pension rate. So what would the coalition have done if they had actually won? They talked much during the election and in the short time since we have been back about tax increases in a Labor government, but what would the coalition actually have done? In the election and subsequently their election promises were shown to be poorly thought out and unable to sustain reasonable analysis. I think Laura Tingle in the Australian Financial Review on 3 September 2010 said it better than I could. She said:
There are two possible explanations for how an opposition presenting itself as an alternative government could end up with an $11 billion hole in the cost of its election commitments.
One is that they are liars, the other is that they are clunkheads. Actually, there is a third explanation: they are liars and clunkheads.
But whatever the combination, they are not fit to govern.
And I think the debate that we have had subsequent to the election illustrates that very well. The opposition policies would not have stood up if they had won the election. They have opposed Labor’s proposed mining tax right from the beginning. They have denied any discussion on it. We have to ask now, when we are discussing the matter of income and expenditure, whether it is reasonable that income from Australia’s non-renewable resources should be used to fund critical nation-building infrastructure and in developing our skills base. Those on the Labor side, and now that is the government side, say, ‘Yes, they should be in some form or another.’ The mining tax as proposed by the former government will be changed significantly after consultation, I suspect. I think the mining industry was indeed expecting a change in the mining tax regime. It does make sense, particularly in the two-speed economy that is so much talked about now, that we do get some return from our non-renewable resources and that we do use that to boost the income side of the equation when we are talking about net debt.
But I will move on to the expenditure side of things. Here again we have the opposition waxing very passionately and long about reducing expenditure. One of their key platforms, apparently, is to freeze the Public Service, so if people leave the Public Service then there is a freeze on that number. That would dramatically reduce services and our skills base in the Public Service.
What are the proposals from the government? What are the actual, real policies that are proposed by the government and that the opposition opposes? We have, principally, the National Broadband Network. We heard Senator Joyce earlier repeat one of the accusations the opposition make about this—that the National Broadband Network is not useful; that it would merely help people to download movies faster. This betrays a very serious lack of understanding of many aspects of the way that the digital system works in our economy. It also betrays from those opposite, who often come in here and lecture this side of politics about their business acumen and experience, a very poor understanding of how business operates in the modern world. My husband is involved in the IT business. I know how important both download and upload speeds are to his business.
The opposition seem to have failed to understand this despite the fact that many of them represent regional areas. We have seen in the recent past many small businesses start to operate from regional bases because they have a reasonable broadband speed that allows them to sell globally on the internet and to download information. Farmers are doing it and small business people are doing it in regional cities and small regional towns. This is why the Independents are supporting a national broadband network and why they believe that that expenditure is worth it. It is critically important in a modern world; and Australia, as I understand, wants to be part of the modern world—even the opposition do.
The second major aspect of criticism is in the area of infrastructure. The inland rail network is coalition policy. The Nationals have made promises, saying, ‘We will invest in critical road and rail infrastructure and stimulate private investment in major infrastructure projects around regional Australia to reduce the burden on the taxpayer.’ That is just the sort of lack of rigorous policy and costings that we have come to expect from the opposition. They speak vaguely about bringing in private investment, and this at a time when private investment is only just starting to recover around the world. By and large this scale of investment, if we are talking about critical road and rail infrastructure, is not able to be supported by Australian investment. Here in this place earlier today Senator Joyce complained about investment coming in from China and the Middle East and having to pay back that money; and yet his party are promising major infrastructure investment from private investors. Does he seriously expect that private investment to come from within Australia? I do not think so. This is fudging and an example of doublespeak from the Nationals.
Again, Senator Joyce said earlier today: ‘You have to pay back that debt. God help you if you can’t pay them back.’ And again that illustrates his lack of understanding about the way that government economies work. I have sat in estimates with Senator Joyce and in other hearings of the Senate Economics Committee and seen Treasury officials and other economists patiently, time after time, try to take him through exactly how the economy works and why the Australian economy has a AAA rating and most of the states have a AAA rating. The net debt that he is talking about does not operate the way a small business does. We are not in danger of imminent default, as he and many others in the opposition keep saying and keep trying to scaremonger on. It is nonsense and this motion is nonsense. I have been in many meetings and had this patiently explained to me, and to others from the opposition. There is now a Treasury paper reconsidering the link between fiscal policy and interest rates in Australia which answers this motion precisely. I will just read from the abstract:
This paper examines the empirical relationship between government debt and the real interest rate margin between Australian and US 10-year government bond yields. Results for the period 1990 to 2009 suggest that Australian general government net debt has no impact on the short-run real interest margin, and has only a small effect on the long run. Further, the estimates suggest that movements in US general government net debt have a considerably larger effect than Australian general government net debt—implying that US influences take greater prominence in explaining the real interest margin.
I know that if he really tries Senator Joyce, and others in the opposition, will understand that. I have no economic background; my interest is limited. But that seems pretty clear to me and should be pretty clear to those in the opposition. I would like to see those in the opposition focus on a genuine debate. God knows, in these difficult economic times there are enough genuine issues of economic policy to focus on, without spurious and deliberately misleading motions like this one.
Let us have a look back, in the couple of minutes I have left, on the coalition record on interest rates. There were 12 consecutive interest rate rises in a row between 2002 and 2008 under the previous Liberal government—interest rate rises that occurred in the teeth of Reserve Bank warnings about an overheating economy and inflation. That is the legacy of the Liberal government: 12 consecutive interest rate rises in that six-year period. And they come in here and try to lecture this government, which has seen Australia safely through a global financial crisis, about interest rates and deliberately ignore Treasury advice. The last Liberal government did not leave us a budget deficit, and senior ministers and Prime Ministers in this government have acknowledged that and have given due credit to the previous government for that.
What the last Liberal government did leave were two very important deficits. They were a skills deficit and an infrastructure deficit. Despite the global financial crisis, this government has decided that those twin deficits cannot be left any longer. They must be addressed, even at the risk of a short-term government deficit, because it is now urgent. If Australia is to take itself out of the boom-bust of renewable resources and set itself up as a modern, productive economy which is lined in with the digital economy, we must take urgent steps now to deal with those infrastructure deficits and skills deficits. That is what this government has been focused on since it has got in and I hope that, despite our minority status, we will be able to take it up with renewed vigour in this new term of government. I hope that we will get some practical support from those opposite and from the other parties and independents in this place.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,38,1
"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2010-09-29,"—I join my colleagues in speaking to the matter of public importance—that is, that the Gillard government’s failed budget strategy of debt and deficit is putting upward pressure on interest rates. I want to use this opportunity to highlight the fact that it is the coalition that truly understands the correlation between strong economic management and the vitality of the small business sector. It is this sector that is the engine room of the Australian economy and it deserves our practical support and incentive to grow, prosper and employ more people. This is in strong contrast to the platitudes and the rhetoric we continually hear from the government about their so-called management of the Australian economy, and which we have just listened to another mind-numbing 15 minutes of. In fact, it is those on the ground, the small business people who invest their family’s interest and, in so many instances, mortgage their homes to bankroll their businesses, who know otherwise.
Labor offers only more of the same indifference and disinterest that has seen a loss of 300,000 small business jobs since Labor was elected to government. Why is this? It is because on this side of the chamber we know and understand that out of control and escalating spending means increased interest rates. The more any government spends—and in the case of this government, it is expenditure where there is no idea of how to ensure value for money—the more it equates to significant upward pressure on monetary policy, directly impacting the bottom line for small business. It is small business that delivers just under half of the jobs in the Australian workforce—about 40 per cent of private sector economic output and more than one-third of Australia’s exports. Only the coalition recognises that a thriving small business sector is a key contributor to a prosperous Australia, to sustainable economic growth and to community vitality.
The ABS, in June 2006, estimated that there were 1,646,344 small business operators. Of these, 67 per cent worked full-time hours—full time, a definition that those in the union movement do not understand. For those of us who have worked in small business, the notion of a 35-hour week is laughable. I would suggest that those small business operators would work double that time.

Senator Cameron interjecting—

—That is because the financial security of families running small businesses is at stake. They are at the coalface, and any significant economic changes will be immediately felt by these operators. Yet Labor is still making life more expensive for small business. Only this week the Prime Minister has formed a committee for sycophants—or should I call them ‘believers’—who are determined to bring forward a carbon tax and legislate it in this parliament. With energy being a significant input cost, this will immediately increase real costs without any productivity gains for those operators.
The bottom line is the chime of the cash register will be an endangered sound. In fact, small business will become an endangered species under the disgraceful and inept management of this Gillard government—a government that has runs on the board in this regard. The irresponsible approach taken by the government should be no surprise; as of the last government, only 12 senators on their side had any experience in small business. That compares to 50 per cent of them who have union backgrounds and are here through the grace of their factional allies and factional mates. They are here because of their affiliation with the union movement. In the interest of the country, the Gillard government should focus on the real issues concerning Australians rather than spend time on petty political point scoring in the other place.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,38,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-09-29,"—I note with interest that Senator Cameron was interjecting on Senator Kroger. Senator Kroger said that Senator Cameron had no experience with small business. That is not true. He has a lot of experience with small business: he used to get big ones and make them considerably smaller! That was his contribution to employment in this country. I noted with interest, as well, that Senator Cameron was again interjecting on Senator Kroger. Where were the likes of Senator Cameron during the debacles surrounding the BER program, the pink batts program and the remarkable waste involved with those programs, which have not single-handedly put upward pressure on interest rats but have been an enormous contributor to it? Where was the Australian Labor Party backbench when they had the opportunity to have some input into this wanton expenditure driven by a political agenda for which there was no excuse?
Where was Senator Cameron? Where were the rest of the backbench when their government was out spending the funds of Australians on building education programs and pink batt programs for which there was no excuse? Senator Cameron knows full well that the figures of waste in relation to those two programs alone were absolutely mind-blowing. Did the government, having been warned about this, do anything—make any attempt to reduce that spending? No, they did not. From recollection, the BER was at least identified as having $1½ billion in wastage and $5 million in overexpenditure—or the other way around.
It is clear that in the Australian Labor Party, if you muck up, you get promoted. The member for Kingsford Smith has been promoted—or was he promoted because he made a mess of this or, as reported by former Senator Richardson, because he said he was going to create a by-election if he was not retained in the cabinet? It is one of two things. You will either get rewarded for economic failure which puts upward pressure on interest rates—you get a boot up the cabinet tree if you make a debacle of a program like this—or you are too precious to sack because, if you get sacked and go to a by-election, there is a very fair chance that in the seat of Kingsford Smith the Australian Labor Party would get rolled. This was a threat. One of those two things has happened.
I want to refer to some articles in today’s paper. I will preface these comments with this comment—
—Was it the Australian?
—It was theCanberra Times, actually—unless you are opposed to them as well! Where do they fit? Are they good? You have just attacked the Australian. How does theCanberra Times rate? Give me a hint. We know you hate the Australian. How about the Canberra Times? I am sure a few of them are listening. How do you rate them? Are they good or bad? Are they like the Australian according to you or are they different? I rather suspect that you are a very keen supporter of the Canberra Times, so you will be a little shocked when I read this. But before I get to that I want to say this. Not in some 50 minutes of a speech that, in the defence of the Governor-General, was not written by her—we all know that—was there one word about cutting government expenditure. There was not one single word in a 50-minute government prepared speech about cutting expenditure to ensure that we do not keep this upward pressure on interest rates. Clearly this government has no intention at all of doing anything about reducing the potential impact on Australian families.
Senator Cameron comes, like I do, from a state which is completely different from Western Australia and Queensland. Senator Cameron knows as well as I do that the small business community in New South Wales and Victoria is under enormous pressure. Those in retail in particular are under enormous pressure. I defy anyone in this chamber or the other place to go into a small business, particularly a retail based small business, in Victoria, New South Wales or Tasmania—Senator Barnett is here—and say that that business is not under enormous pressure. They will be under even greater pressure if we see a surge in interest rates on the back of a failure of this government to cut government expenditure.
I notice in the gallery that there is a family with two young children. This family will potentially be the losers, with higher interest rates. I do not know the couple I am looking at with their children; I do not know their circumstances, but I rather suspect that they are probably average Australians, like the people in this chamber, who will be unduly impacted by an increase in interest rates if it is not backed by the sort of economic growth that we should hope to see to try to counter some of those impacts.
I will read from the Canberra Times some comments in an article by David McLennan. He said:
The Government has rejected—
and I am being quite open and transparent with what I am quoting—
a respected forecaster’s prediction that the budget will only briefly return to surplus, but the Opposition has seized on the finding as proof “Australia is facing years and years of budget deficits”.
Access Economics’ latest Budget Monitor predicted the nation’s accounts would fall back into deficit after a brief return to surplus in 2010-13 because of declining commodity prices.
The article goes on:
Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey said the report showed the budget was built on quicksand.
“It’s undeniable now that because the Government is spending all of the proceeds of the mining boom, Australia is facing years and years of budget deficits, which means more and more debt from Labor that will never be repaid,” he said. “Unless Labor pulls back on its spending, Australians are facing higher interest rates and higher taxes.”
Indeed, if you go through all the economic commentary in the last week, you will see another article from David McLennan yesterday titled ‘Commodity boom ‘house of cards’’ and an article from David Uren today in the Australian. I know that Senator Cameron has a passionate hatred of the Australian but I am sure he is not indicating that that is a personal attack on the bona fides of Mr Uren, because I would have thought David Uren is viewed by most people as being a good economic commentator and a reasonable economic commentator—a very reasonable economic commentator. He has indicated the very things that we are talking about. We are just about to venture down a path that this Prime Minister will have no control over. This Prime Minister will have no control over it because this is the same Prime Minister who drove the Building the Education Revolution fiasco. This is the same Prime Minister who was incapable of addressing the pink batts debacle. This is a Prime Minister who quite frankly, I suspect, does not care what the impact of higher interest rates is because this is a Prime Minister who gave to the Governor-General yesterday a 50-minute speech that made no mention of it whatsoever.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2010-09-29,"—I must congratulate Senator Ronaldson, the previous speaker, for clearing the gallery. That family with the two kids he mentioned in his speech could not stand the hypocrisy for one minute longer, so off they went. It was a fantastic clearing of the gallery. Well done, Senator Ronaldson.
Let me talk about the budget approach of the government. The budget approach of this government is to make sure that we build the economy, have a strong economy and build a fair society. It is pretty simple. It is about building a fair society. It is about understanding that the market cannot deliver on its own, that there is market failure and that government needs to intervene in the market. That is exactly what the government has done.
If you go back and have a look at the so-called great economic record of the Howard government, what you will see is a record of abject failure. Business investment collapsed under the Howard government. International investment was not made here under the Howard government. There was a failure of innovation that is so important to our economy. We were amongst the lowest spenders on research and development in advanced economies. That is the record of the Howard government: a failure of productivity. Productivity declined under the Howard government. We hear all these lectures about productivity and yet under the Howard government productivity declined. We were amongst the lowest in OECD countries in productivity. And what was their answer to low productivity? It was Work Choices. That was the answer to low productivity. Cut workers’ penalty rates, cut family standards of living, get rid of annual leave loading, get rid of rights on the job and get rid of penalty rates. That was the record of the Howard government. That was your economic policy, an economic policy based on attacking working families in this country. There was a failure of development, a total reliance on the minerals and mining sector for this economy.
Under the Howard government the export share of elaborately transformed manufactures fell from 23½ per cent to 17½ per cent, so the knowledge industry, the manufacturing industry, declined under the Howard government. There was a failure of competitiveness. Our current account deficit continued to rise. There was a failure of balance and what you did with Work Choices was to transfer $30 billion a year of workers’ wages to profits that were then not reinvested. That is what you did. Those profits went into the back pockets of the billionaires and millionaires, and you stood back and applauded that approach.
Your biggest failure was to fail to deal with the issue of long-term sustainability not only of the economy but of the environment. Now we know why you failed to deal with it because all the extremists, the climate change deniers and the climate change sceptics that dominate the Liberal party would not even let John Howard deal with the issue of climate change. Now you have the wrecker in charge—your leader, Mr Tony Abbott, is nothing but a wrecker. That is what you have in your leadership now. He would wreck the economy, he would wreck our chances to try and deal with climate change and he would wreck workers’ rights. You know that is the position because that is where you fundamentally come from. You fundamentally come from a position that says that workers will sacrifice to improve productivity and workers will sacrifice to increase profitability for business. That is where the wreckers are. You are the wreckers.
You demonstrated your total lack of economic competence. In the period that you were in government there was over a decade of lost opportunities when the money was flowing in from the mining boom but the coalition were incapable as a government of actually making the investment for the future. You did not invest in education, you did not invest in skills and you did not invest in the industries that built the knowledge for the future. You were an abject economic failure, an absolute rabble masquerading as competent economic managers. But the game was up for you. There were 10 interest rate rises in a row. You know that you were never competent to run the economy.
We have a coalition that is incapable of actually framing an independent economic agenda. If the Australian ever goes belly up and closes down, you will have no economic agenda because your agenda relies on the commentators in the Australian. This resolution before us today is straight off the front page of the Australian newspaper. That is where it is from. Every question you ask on economics, every position you adopt in economics is straight out of the Australian playbook. That is where you come from. You are incapable of developing decent economic policy for this country. The Australian front page is really the proxy for your economic competence. If you want to know what the Liberals and the coalition are going to be up to, read the front page of the Australian and that is what you get in this place all the time. You do not get any innovation, there are no policies that would support working families.
The proposition that you have put up in this resolution goes to the fundamental difference between Labor and the coalition. You are the wreckers in this parliament. You are clearly the wreckers. We are about building for the future. Your position is to let the market rip. How else could you justify the position that you adopted when we were facing the global financial crisis and your economic spokesperson was saying, ‘We should just wait and see what happens.’ When the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and governments around the world were saying that you must intervene in the economy and take steps to maintain economic activity, what did the coalition do? The coalition said, ‘We should wait and see what happens.’ What an abject failure of economic leadership from this so-called economically brilliant opposition. You are absolute economic phoneys and you know it because you could not deliver on the key factors that build the economy.
You have the cheek to come in here and criticise a Labor government that has underpinned 210,000 jobs and created half a million jobs. When countries around the world are looking to put more investment in to try and create jobs, we are seen as the economy that delivered, the government that delivered. We are the government that made this economy absolutely clear of recession. There was no recession in Australia and recessions in almost every other country in the world. What you wanted to do was to run the line that you got from the economic radicals in New York—the Tea Party. You had the ‘tea party’ out here telling you how you should take up your next political position. You know it is true. You had them out here and you are all about cutting government expenditure. It does not matter if government expenditure is—
Opposition senators interjecting—
 (Senator Barnett)—Order! Senator Cameron, I would remind you to address your remarks through the chair. I would also ask senators on my left to abide by standing orders and stop interjecting so that we can have an orderly debate.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. That is a very fair ruling, and I will definitely address the issue through the chair. What the opposition say is that government borrowing is bad, private borrowing is good and the market should just be left to get on and do the job. That is what the tea party extremists are here in Australia telling the Liberals and the coalition now. The tea party message to the Liberals is that government debt is bad, private debt is good and income tax cuts should simply be the answer to everything. That is the proposition that these guys from the coalition are dealing with now. They act as if there was no global financial crisis ever. They are trying to pretend there was no global financial crisis.
—There was a North Atlantic crisis.
—You never hear them talking about the global financial crisis. You never hear them having any sympathy or empathy for Australian families who would have had no job and would have been confined to long-term unemployment. You never hear them talk about the industries that would have gone under if the government had not put its fiscal stimulus package in place. You do not hear any of this. They do not have any idea about what a government should do when faced with a global financial crisis. They keep coming up with the same arguments, yet they do not understand how the financial bubbles created this economic crisis. They really do stick to the old adage that greed is good. That is where they come from. They think greed is good. They do not really care about working families. That has clearly been their position over the years.
The budget strategy that the Labor government put in place was dealing with debt in an appropriate way—a timely, targeted and temporary way. We have debt levels that are dramatically lower than in any other advanced country in the world. We have a deficit that is lower than in any other advanced country in the world. All your fear campaigns will be addressed. We will confront your fear campaigns, because the days of you running fear campaigns and getting away with it are over. You have no other strategy than fear. That is the approach you take. The coalition are the economic fundamentalists who are running fear campaigns and are the wreckers of the economy. That is really the position you are in.
It is Labor that will build a strong economy and a good society. It is Labor that cares about working families. You see, we understand that, if government does not step in when the private sector steps out of investment, it is ordinary workers in this country that suffer. It is workers that are made redundant. You see, I actually know what it is like to be made redundant. I have been made redundant as a fitter working in ordinary business. I do not think there are too many on the other side that would know what it is like to come home and tell your family that you have been made redundant and that you have no job, no income and very little chance of getting a job. I do know what that is like. I have been there. You do not know what it is like, because clearly your economic policies would make it worse for ordinary Australians. When you end up in a recession and you have families being wrecked by this laissez-faire economic policy of the coalition, you do not think about the jobs that are lost and the impact that that has on ordinary Australians.
You come here and lecture us about small business. Let me tell you: we are the ones that want to cut tax for small business. We are the ones that want to increase the wealth of ordinary Australians by increasing superannuation. We are the ones that want to increase infrastructure in this country, and you have no plan and no strategy for that. All you want to do is have your mates in the mining industry continue to operate as billionaires and not pay their fair share of taxes. That is not what we are about. We are about making sure that Australians get their fair share, that we have a strong economy and that we have a fair society in this country. That is the difference between Labor and the coalition.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,38,1
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2010-09-29,"—As always, it has been nothing short of an extraordinary contribution from Senator Cameron. I find it difficult to sit here with a straight face and be told by a member of the Labor Party how bad it would be for workers to be made redundant and how terrible a recession would be, because the last time Australia had one of those it was the one we had to have, where farmers, businesses and homeowners around Australia lost their homes, their businesses and their livelihoods directly because of the actions of that Labor Party. Then the Treasurer had the gall to stand up and say to the Australian people, ‘This is the recession we had to have.’ So much for the million unemployed people! So much for the $90 billion of debt that was built up in those four short years of the nightmare that was Paul Keating! What we did over 11 years was to fix the wreckage that you left the Australian economy in. What Labor is doing today is the same thing.
We could go back through treasurers through 30 years. It could be Costello, Keating, Howard or Hayden. They all spoke about the need to reduce government spending and, in Labor days, to reduce the deficit so as to reduce pressure upon interest rates, because we all know—it is basic economics—that there is a trade-off between the level of government deficit and borrowings and the pressure put on monetary policy. This is a basic principle of economics. This is the challenge that this government has not been able to address, as the previous government did, in its response to what it termed the global financial crisis. As it always does, it tried to contrive and confect some greater excuse, as Senator Bushby interjected earlier when he referred to this as being primarily a North Atlantic crisis. What this government did was to introduce a so-called stimulus that was too much, too quick and way too messy. It was too poorly targeted. You were warned at the Senate inquiries into the stimulus package that the pink batts program would be a fiasco. You were warned throughout the BER program that the system was being rorted, that money was being wasted and that the government, the taxpayers of Australia and the children in those school halls—who are going to have to pay for them for 20 or 30 years—were being overcharged by the system you set up.
The point here is that this government has no claim to economic credibility. As for Senator Cameron’s claims about the 11 years of the Howard government, I only say that the Australian people would look forward to another 11 years of economic management of that quality: unemployment that was among the lowest we had seen in 40 years—the lowest in my lifetime—government debt paid off, and money put in the bank through the Future Fund to pay for the deficits and the liabilities built up under the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. The country could do with a fair bit more of that, so if Senator Cameron is saying that the country could have a bit more of that then I am sure we would agree.
Senator Cameron likes to talk about the last financial crisis. I notice he did not mention the current one. What we are seeing, particularly in Europe and, worryingly, in other parts of the world, is the second one coming. This second one is much more dangerous because it is a sovereign debt crisis. We have countries in Europe that cannot borrow. We have the European Union trying to set up a $500 billion stabilisation fund that the financial press has been reporting in the past few weeks is not succeeding. What is that driven by? It is driven by governments borrowing too much money. Every time the government borrows a dollar, it is asking a future Australian to pay it back with interest. This government inherited a $20 billion surplus. Last week it claimed that somehow the small $2 billion improvement in the deficit, from $56 billion to $54 billion, was a measure of the government’s success. God knows the country cannot afford any more success like that, nor can the children, the future taxpayers of Australia.
We heard in the Senate inquiries into the stimulus—held before and afterwards—from eminent economists that the government borrowing increasing amounts of money, a lot of it offshore, some of it domestically, is putting upward pressure on interest rates. They are higher than they would otherwise be. For a while the government’s excuse was that they were returning to their normal level. But the truth is that now they are going above the normal level. The senior economist at HSBC, a former senior economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia, lifted the veil—and the truth on this government has been exposed—when he predicted last week that we are going to see a 1.25 per cent increase in interest rates by the end of next year. Expectations in the markets are that interest rates are going up. Expectations are in the order of a per cent. This person has predicted 1.25 per cent. That is going to mean hundreds of dollars a month for the average mortgage holder—and many Australians hold mortgages larger than the average—and it is going to mean a significant burden upon small business. I want to turn to this in my last couple of minutes.
It was a great pleasure to be appointed one of the coalition spokespeople in this portfolio last week, because this is the heart and soul not only of our side of politics but of the Australian economy. Senator Cameron was up here talking about how the Labor Party cares about small business. At the moment they are launching an attack on unincorporated small businesses and personal services income to try and drag them into the unionised employee net. Their attacks on small business finance have been numerous. The government guarantee destroyed the non-bank lending to small businesses and medium businesses around Australia. The government guarantee put an end to a lot of the competition in the banking sector. What we see now is that more than ever it is hard for small business to access the finance they need to run and manage their business. With these interest rate increases that are coming, it is going to become not only harder to get but one hell of a lot more expensive.
The truth about this government’s impact on interest rates was made clear by the Treasury itself in the so-called red book when they said that ‘there is also scope for the government to improve the quality of its own spending programs in a way that takes pressure off interest rates and the exchange rate’. There we have it: the Treasury the government so often likes to refer to making it clear what everyone else knows is a basic principle of economics. If the government keeps borrowing and keeps running up debt, we will see higher interest rates than there otherwise needs to be. Just like in 1996, this government is going to pay for increasing this interest rate burden on Australian people and small businesses.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,38,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-09-29,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Senate will recall that on 4 February this year I wrote to the Auditor-General asking for an immediate and comprehensive investigation into the gross mismanagement of the Green Loans scheme by the then minister, Mr Peter Garrett, and the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. I pointed out at the time that the Green Loans scheme was an excellent idea but had turned into an utter debacle through gross mismanagement by the department. I pointed out that the Greens had been and remained the strongest advocates in the parliament for household energy efficiency upgrades and that the Green Loans scheme was based in part on something that the Greens had taken to the election campaign in 2007. Tragically, the way that the Green Loans scheme was administered turned into a nightmare for the people who became assessors and for many householders who sought an assessment and energy efficiency technologies put in their houses.
I wrote to the Auditor-General and pointed out in the letter that the program had gone so badly wrong at every single level. It was not as if one thing happened and the whole thing went as a domino effect after that; every aspect of this program had been mismanaged from the start. I pointed out to the Auditor-General that there had been failure to adhere to the promised 1,000 to 2,000 limit on the number of assessors, failure to deliver on the online booking mechanism, failure to provide or oversee the interim call centre booking process, failure to administer the conditions the federal government placed on its own program regarding conflicts of interest and probity in terms of procurement, and failure to exercise quality control and due diligence in relation to the standard of training provided to prospective assessors and the quality of the assessments provided to consumers. I also asked the Auditor-General to report on the failure to implement an audit facility in the program and on favouritism and discriminatory practices relating to access to work through the program. The Senate will recall that I asked the minister representing the minister at the time, Minister Wong, about how it was that Fieldforce were able to book assessments over the summer when the system was down and the independent assessors were not able to get that work.
Now the Auditor-General has reported, and his report confirms largely all of the criticism that had previously been made by the other assessments of the Green Loans Program, including the Faulkner report. The Auditor-General has said that the problems besetting the scheme were largely due to ‘an absence of effective governance’ in the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. I will say that again: ‘an absence of effective governance’. This was not just one person. This was systemic lack of effective governance in the department.
What is even more worrying is that there was clearly no oversight in the department at the highest levels; and what I am sure is shocking to people aware of this program is that the former minister—and I quote from the report—‘received incomplete, inaccurate and untimely briefings on program design, features and implementation progress, challenges and risks’. In other words, when the minister sat down to find out from the department how the Green Loans program was going, he was given inaccurate, incomplete and untimely briefings.
My question is: who is to be held responsible here? Clearly, there are real problems with procurement and that goes to the issue of Fieldforce, which I raised in the Senate previously. The Auditor-General finds that Fieldforce did gain market advantage due to the way this program was designed. He also acknowledges that Fieldforce did not seek that market advantage but got it nevertheless by virtue of the failure of a range of things—from the booking program and the failure to have an online booking system and the failure to adhere to proper processes throughout the program.
The Auditor-General’s report goes absolutely into all the problems, as I indicated. It points out the failure to have proper budget oversight of the program. It points out that at the executive level they seemed not to know what was going on and did not take much notice at all. But where I am disappointed with the report is that there was a lack of probity on procurement processes. There is even prima facie evidence of contract-splitting to avoid the mandated requirements of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines—if you split the contract you did not have to go through that. A whole lot of these procurements were poorly planned and recorded. There was poor management of requests for quotes. The majority, 96 per cent, of the procurements examined were procured through direct source—that is, without open competition. This is in complete breach of all of the Commonwealth requirements and is very serious.
One of the heartbreaking parts of the Green Loans program is that a lot of people embraced it and thought this was their opportunity to become part of the new green economy. This was their opportunity to get a career path in energy efficiency, recognising that energy efficiency was going to be a growth industry this century—as it ought to be—in the demand management of energy. However, as the Auditor-General says, the majority of assessors have been trained by unregistered training providers. That is the Commonwealth’s fault, because it did not set down that there had to be registered providers training the assessors. There was also the issue of the number of assessors. The assessors were led to believe there would be somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 assessors. It turned out that almost 10,000 people had either been trained and accredited or trained and then got contracts and so on in the course of all that. Part of the whole debacle here has been: how do you rationalise that many people when clearly there is not that much work for them?
The assessors ended up complaining that the tools they were using to assess energy efficiency were not right. There were real problems with the calibration of these tools. Nothing happened about that. The Auditor-General agrees in the end that these problems occurred for the assessors. But right on the death knell of the election the government requested expressions of interest for the Green Start program. When it abolished Green Loans it went to Green Start, which is being unkindly referred to in the community as ‘Newstart’ because it is not giving any real assistance to a lot of the assessors other than just directing them to income support. The issue here is that the closing date for expressions of interest was the day before the election. I called for that to be extended because it was really unfair on assessors who were submitting expressions of interest not to know what the situation was going to be. However, the government did not extend the period of the Green Start program.
I really want to see this situation followed up because it is an issue of natural justice. The Auditor-General has stopped short of saying there should be compensation. I think there should be compensation and I intend to take this matter up with the new Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mr Dreyfus, who has been given responsibility for this area of government administration.
I thank the Auditor-General for his comprehensive report. He has found all the problems that we identified some months ago to be valid concerns. He has pointed to systemic governance failure in the department and has said that the department is now taking steps to fix it. But the issue is: who is going to be held to account? If the minister was not given the information he needed, who in the department was responsible? Why did senior management not oversee this? How were the procurement guidelines so easily sidestepped?
There is a real problem in this department and it has to be fixed. I do not think it is enough to just say that it is being fixed. We want to know how it is being fixed. Not only do we want to know which individuals in the Green Loans management sector might now be examined in relation to this matter, but also the systemic failure of the department needs to be explained. The assessors need to know that there is going to be natural justice—that there will be upgraded training for some and compensation for some. Something has to be done about what I believe is a large group of people in Australia who were seriously let down by the government of the day with the Green Loans program.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 9 of 2010-11</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,39,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-09-29,"—I too rise to take note of the ANAO report into the government’s Green Loans program. Here we are in a new parliament and the Labor government’s failures of the previous parliament continue to dog them. There continue to be hangovers from the previous parliament. Of all the hangovers that the government faces—including the Building the Education Revolution, the home insulation scandal and, in due course, the National Broadband Network—there is no hangover greater than the Green Loans program. The Green Loans program is a great big hangover for this government. It will hang over their heads for the life of the parliament as many thousands of people continue to suffer as a direct result of the Labor government’s mismanagement of this program.
Let us be under no illusions. The government try to explain away the home insulation and BER programs as being rushed because of the global financial crisis. But the Green Loans program was a 2007 Labor election promise. It was conceived before they came into office, and still they totally mismanaged it at every step of the way. This is just the latest damning report—a report into their mismanagement of the Green Loans program. The ANAO has found:
The primary cause for the administration problems encountered by the program was, to a very large extent, an absence of effective governance by DEWHA during the program’s design and early implementation.
That’s right, the flaws in this program were there from day one, from the very moment the new government came into office. They received the brief: ‘Here are your policies. Here’s what we have to implement.’ The flaws were evident from day one as the department started to implement this program. And yet they were unable to identify or fix the problems at any stage during the process. It was a $300 million program and there were flaws from day one1 but still they could not identify them.
As Senator Milne alluded to, the problems within the department were systemic—so systemic that the Audit Office has found:
Procurement activity in the Green Loans program over a period of approximately 18 months was poorly managed and involved extensive non-compliance with government and departmental procurement requirements (including multiple breaches of the Financial Management Regulations related to the approval of spending proposals and contracts ...
The report found multiple breaches of government financial regulations. That’s right, what we are essentially talking about here are breaches of the law. The program was so maladministered by the former minister Peter Garrett and by that department that it led to breaches of the government’s own financial management regulations tabled and passed through this chamber and the other place. That was the extent of the maladministration in the Green Loans program. The report went on:
Key program management plans, including in relation to risk management, procurement, IT and communications, were never finalised and endorsed by executive management.
That’s right, risk management plans were never finalised for this program. Procurement plans were never finalised. It is no wonder they were breaking the government’s own financial management guidelines. They had not even finalised procurement plans before they went out and spent millions and millions of Australian taxpayer dollars in this wasteful manner that we have come to see so often from the Labor government.
ANAO went out and surveyed some of those who were involved—the householders who participated and the assessors who undertook the assessments and the home sustainability audits as part of the Green Loans program. What did ANAO find? They identified poor assessment conduct practices. That is hardly surprising. As Senator Milne said, there was no registered or recognised training program that the assessors had to undertake. It was all done on a wing and a prayer, with the government setting up a program that did not give them some type of lasting qualifications that might help them in the future. It left the government totally exposed to the waste and failure of this program.
Respondents to the assessors’ survey also expressed a general lack of confidence in the accuracy of the assessment tool. So the assessors were not trained properly and the tool they were using to assess people’s homes from a home sustainability perspective was not up to scratch. They found that some reports contained anonymous results and incomplete cost and savings information. So the whole program, which was based around the idea that a trained assessor would go into your home, undertake an assessment and provide accurate information on how you could reduce your energy usage and make your home more energy efficient, was flawed at every step of the way. The assessors were not trained appropriately and the tool they used for assessment was so flawed that it provided false data.
I come back to the fact that millions of taxpayer dollars went into this program but it has delivered a disastrous, terrible outcome. There has been a terrible human toll for the hundreds of thousands of Australian households who participated, or wanted to get an audit done on their homes and considered taking out a Green Loan. Also, financial institutions were stuffed around and dragged into something which very few people ever cleared enough hurdles to manage to take up. Eventually the axe fell on the financial institutions’ involvement, with no warning from the government.
In particular, there was a toll for the thousands of ordinary Australians who were passionate about the environment and saw an opportunity to help the environment by becoming home sustainability assessors. They signed up for this program believing it would provide them with skills and work. They believed that they would be able to build, in many cases, a small business or an independent contractor operation that was sustainable into the future. What has the Audit Office found? They found:
The number of contracted assessors ... quickly grew to levels significantly beyond what DEWHA had anticipated.
That’s right, they were all contracted to the government, and the department was just contracting all of those who trained. They never set any clear targets or caps, but just signed up far more than they expected. As a result, their entire bookings process and the entire process for considering assessments broke down. But most importantly, the report found that the government’s decisions and mismanagement ultimately ‘left thousands of assessors, who had each invested their time and around $3,000 on training, insurance and registration, with unfulfilled work expectations’.
‘Unfulfilled work expectations’ is the polite way of saying that thousands of assessors were without any work. Many more were underemployed. On a con from this government, these had invested thousands of dollars of their own money, not to mention their own time, in training for this program. They were left with nothing at the end of it—nothing at all—because this government and this minister could not manage to administer this program correctly. The program has been shifted, stripped, from Minister Garrett as so many things have been.
We discovered in the other place today that, even though Mr Garrett is the minister for schools, he has no responsibility for the Building the Education Revolution Program—not just no direct responsibility, not even representational responsibility. The government does not trust him—so much so that they will not let him answer questions on behalf of Senator Evans. No, they now consider it to be part of the jobs area and shunt it off to somebody other than the schools minister. It has been shifted to a different department. But even that different department has yet to determine a methodology for measuring the performance of the Green Loans program against its objective. We have a new parliament and theoretically—as we keep being told—a new government; and the new department does not even know how to measure the success of what everybody knows is a failed program. It really has been a great disaster by this government. The Audit Office report shows systemic failures—from the program design right through to the implementation. It says:
… the former Minister received incomplete, inaccurate and untimely briefings on program design features and implementation progress, challenges and risks—
and that he ‘was not well served by his department’. We live under a Westminster system—or so we are told—so the buck is meant to stop with the minister. Sadly, in this case it has not, and it is a disgrace that the former minister still sits around the cabinet table.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 9 of 2010-11</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,39,1
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2010-09-29,"—I too rise to take note of the ANAO report, and I thank the senators who have contributed. I seek to make on behalf of the government a few remarks pertaining to this report. The government welcomes the release of the ANAO report into the Green Loans program and accepts its findings. It has been my privilege in recent times to have served on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, so I am familiar with the work of the ANAO. It is always of the highest standard, so of course we accept this report and its findings.
The opposition, perhaps naturally enough, have tried to use this report to mount an attack on the government and, in particular, on the minister responsible for the program at the time, Minister Garrett. That is to be expected. But, from a careful reading of the report, I do not think it provides the ammunition that the senators opposite seem to think it does to attack the government and the minister.
The report makes it clear that the Green Loans program suffered significant failings in its design and implementation. The government accepts that, and those failings are to be regretted. The report is clear that the failings in the design and implementation of the Green Loans program resulted from deficiencies in the work of the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Ministers are of course responsible for the work of government departments, and I am not seeking to blame public servants for the deficiencies that the report identified in the Green Loans program. But I think fairness to Mr Garrett requires that the facts as noted in this report be placed on the record. Both Senator Milne and Senator Birmingham have touched upon a quote which I think will do this debate well if it is used in total. The report says:
… the former Minister received incomplete, inaccurate and untimely briefings on program design features and implementation progress, challenges and risks … the former Minister was not well served by his department in this respect … due to the poor quality briefings he received.
I think it is worth repeating that last line:
… the former Minister was not well served by his department in this respect … due to the poor quality briefings he received.
It should also be noted that the findings of the report largely relate to historical issues with the program. These findings are not exactly news. They were also covered in the report earlier this year by Ms Patricia Faulkner—a report that Senator Milne did refer to—into the administration of the Green Loans program. That is why the Audit Office has not made any specific recommendations to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. They have noted that improvements to the structure and delivery of the program’s governance are now being made. In other words, the report identifies problems with this program that existed in the past but accepts that the government is already taking the action required to rectify those problems. As I said at the outset, the government accepts responsibility for the deficiencies identified in the ANAO report. The government has taken note of the lessons identified in this and other reports and is already taking the necessary action to rectify the problems identified in the report. The findings of this report are being used to improve the governance and delivery of the Green Loans program and other energy efficiency programs.
The administration of this program was transferred to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency in February this year. Following continuing problems with the program, the government took the decision in July to phase out the program altogether. The report highlights the work already being done by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to remedy these problems. The minister, the Hon. Greg Combet, has appointed the Hon. Mark Dreyfus QC as Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and has tasked him with taking responsibility for existing and future energy efficiency programs and ensuring continuous improvement. I am very confident that Mark Dreyfus will deal with these issues with his customary attention to detail and excellence.
Since those opposite have sought to make some political capital out of this report and the deficiencies it has identified, I will on the way through make some political points in return. The deficiencies identified in both the Green Loans Program and the Home Insulation Program are things the government regrets. But these were ambitious programs intended both to provide support to employment and help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. In the face of the global financial crisis and the immediate imperative to take action against harmful climate change, it was necessary to roll out these programs quickly. This was the ultimate source of the deficiencies identified by this and other reports. It is of course a matter of fact that the opposition opposed all these programs. They opposed them because they did not believe that the government’s action was needed to protect Australian jobs and Australian businesses in the face of the global financial crisis, and they opposed them because they do not believe the science of climate change and therefore do not believe that any action on emissions is needed.
—Nor do half your mob.
—Having endured 20 minutes of lecturing on this subject, Senator, I would think that the courtesies would require you to perhaps endure a few more moments in courteous silence. We on this side reject both those propositions. We make no apologies at all for having acted swiftly to roll out our economic stimulus programs and our programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They were both vitally important and they were both necessary actions. On both these issues we were right, and the verdict of history has demonstrated that those opposite were wrong. It is true that there were deficiencies in the rolling out of some of these programs. We have accepted that, and we have taken responsibility both for those errors and for rectifying those deficiencies.
This government was determined to take effective action against the global financial crisis and determined to take effective action against climate change, and they both remain priorities for this government. Those opposite opposed us all the way on both these issues, and no doubt they will continue to do so. We have taken some political heat for the problems identified by this report, and we have to wear it. We take responsibility for our mistakes. But it is about time those opposite took responsibility for their much greater failings of policy and acted with some political maturity in these important political debates before this chamber.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 9 of 2010-11</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,39,1
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2010-09-29,"—I continue from where I left off before there was a change of program in the Senate. I was talking about the Building the Education Revolution and about the waste of money in this program. I mentioned that on election day—Saturday, 21 August—I called into the school at Kingstown, which has a $330,000 building of about 10 metres by eight metres. I was saying that $300,000 will build you a good, large, four-bedroom brick home, but the school got a 10 metre by eight metre building with a little kitchen inside. It is just crazy.
I was interested one night to see Senator Joyce on television when he went to the school at Manilla. Two demountable classrooms were brought in on a truck. There was nothing in them, but they cost $1.8 million. That could have built you six four-bedroom brick veneer homes. But no—the school at Manilla got two demountable classrooms for the same amount of money. This is just incredible, and this is what infuriates the people of Australia—the waste of not only taxpayers money but also borrowed money that has to be paid back with interest. It is borrowed money.
We can talk more about the waste. I think the issue of the pink batts has been aired enough in this place. It is just amazing. There was a $2.45 billion program to roll out pink batts for free to insulate houses around Australia, and the very tragic thing is that four young men lost their lives. That is the tragic part of that program, and what their families went through with their loss is something that we probably cannot imagine ourselves.
But now what is there? There is $1 billion to clean up the mess. There is not only a $2.45 billion program to put ceiling batts in houses but also $1 billion to clean up the mess. The Solar Homes Program blew out by $850 million. The laptops in schools program, which was under the direction of our now Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, blew out by $1.2 billion. Labor has wasted over $10 billion of taxpayers’ money and borrowed money in its first term, and they are now borrowing over $100 million a day, seven days a week.
What do we find now if we look at the debt and deficit? The forecasts are coming out now, and a media article today says:
The Federal Budget is at risk of returning to deficit in 2013/14 after the much touted surplus in 2012/13, because commodity forecasts are too optimistic, an independent forecaster says.
While Access Economics expects revenues will total some $6 billion more than official forecasts over this financial year and next, it believes high commodity prices are unsustainable.
That is a sound argument. Having spent most of my life on the land, I know that prices—whether they be wool prices, wheat prices, land prices or mutton prices—go up and go down according to supply and demand. We know that every time prices go up you should not expect them to stay there for ever—they will come down again. That is what Access Economics are saying. The article continues:
“Despite all the hoo-ha by politicians over the ‘return to surplus’, we see the five minutes of fiscal sunshine before re-emergence of a deficit,” Access Economics director Chris Richardson says.
Releasing his updated Budget Monitor today, Mr Richardson forecast a near $2 billion deficit in 2013/14, but stressed this wasn’t due to recent policy costs - neither the election campaign nor the “undignified scramble” for a parliamentary majority which followed it.
On that deficit that we talk about and going back over the years, the 2008-09 budget of $22 billion came out at $27 billion in the red, a turnaround of almost $50 billion. In the last financial year we borrowed $57 billion. In the current financial year, which we will be in until June 30 next year, another $41.8 billion was borrowed, and another $13 billion will be borrowed in the year after. What effect is it having? We have seen six rises in interest rates because the Reserve Bank is saying that there is too much money in the economy, and the talk is that November will bring interest rate rise No. 7.
So we have the government borrowing money and pouring it into the economy while people, the battlers, paying for their homes, running their small businesses or running their farms have to face high interest rates. That is nothing new under Labor. I can recall in the early nineties the 25.25 per cent interest rates I was paying under the then so-called world’s greatest Treasurer—25.25 per cent! In other words, you pay your principal back every four years. What was the effect of that? I do not think regional Australia has ever recovered from it.
We saw the crash in the wool market, the droughts et cetera. Regional Australia, as far as the people on the land are concerned, has never really recovered from those days of the Labor government and those outrageous interest rates. I am sure those who are 30 or 32 years old or younger could not imagine paying such high interest rates. We saw home loans at 17 and 18 per cent. People had their houses repossessed. A million people were unemployed—11 per cent unemployment! We are now seeing more money borrowed and being put into the economy, and it will put upward pressure on interest rates; there is nothing surer.
There was the Green Loans fiasco, where we trained thousands of people to assess homes. What do we have? About 1,000 people actually took up the loans. With the millions and millions of dollars spent on that program, they should have just rebuilt the facilities in those houses and given them a free solar-powered hot-water system, free PB systems on the roof and free this and that. They would have been better off spending it on those thousand homes than wasting all that money on those who did the inspections. The program was a failure.
On the National Broadband Network, one person says: ‘The important point, however, is that your standard ADSL service that is available right now for around 91 per cent of the population provides minimum download speeds of 1,500 kbps and 256 kbps upload—which will give you videoconferencing just fine. ADSL2+ gives much faster speeds—minimum speeds of between 256 kbps and a maximum of 8 Mbps—and is being progressively rolled out across Australia.’
One of the big arguments for the NBN is that it is about to provide videoconferencing for medical facilities. We are hearing from people that it is already there. This means that broadband services available right now without any fancy NBN will give you high-quality videoconferencing suitable for medical and health uses, including consultation and, in theory, procedures via the internet. Leading surgeon and medical media pioneer Professor Andrew Renaut has said that either the National Broadband Network or the $6 billion coalition alternative would be sufficient to overcome Australia’s bandwidth barrier, which he says is preventing technological advances in fields such as medicine and education.
The big fear for the National Broadband Network is the take-up rate. We have seen similar networks rolled out in places like South Korea and Japan for some 10 years, yet only 30 to 35 per cent of people have taken it up. Today the Armidale Express in northern New South Wales, where I live, says:
Mr Davies’ call comes in the face of a less than stellar take-up of fibre installation in the first release area in north-west Armidale.
It is free, and Mr Davies is calling on people to ‘please take up the NBN’. He is concerned that people are simply not taking it up. So why run it out to every household at such a huge cost? As I said, going on the take-up rate in places like Korea and Japan, if after 10 years we are only going to have 35 per cent of people taking it up, look at the cost and where that money is invested and what return there will be.
My greatest concern about this government is the influence the Greens are going to have on the Labor government. Let me take you back to New South Wales and a bloke called Kim Yeadon, the minister for the environment in the early days of the Carr government. He introduced a thing called SEPP 46—State Environment Protection Plan No. 46—where farmers were not allowed to cut down a tree or alter anything on their property. SEPP 46 went on to become the Native Vegetation Conservation Act. We have seen people like Peter Spencer up a pole for 50-odd days protesting about his property rights. I note that when asylum seekers get on a roof at Villawood they attract immediate attention, but when Peter Spencer spent 50 days up a pole he could not get any attention from the government in fighting for the property rights of people in Australia.
The Greens’ influence in New South Wales has been dramatic and all negative. We are going to see exactly the same thing here. We have seen the Prime Minister’s promise: ‘There won’t be any carbon tax while I lead the government.’ Now it is all on. We have this cosy little club of stern believers in climate change saying: ‘What are we going to do? We’re going to have a conference. We’re going to work it through. We’re going to gather some facts together and we’ll look at a carbon tax.’ It is so amazing—
—BHP.
—I take the interjection from Senator Feeney. BHP want a carbon tax but not on anything that affects their exports. It will have no effect on their bottom-line profit—very clever by Mr Kloppers. Imagine if Australia, producing 1.4 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gases, abolished all its greenhouse gases. Imagine if Australia emitted zero gases. Of course that is impossible. When you breathe, you inhale 380 parts per million of carbon dioxide and you exhale 50,000 parts, so we cannot bring our emissions to zero. But if we bring our emissions to zero and produce 550 million tonnes of CO2 a year, or if we reduce our emissions by 500 million tonnes and just produce 50 million tonnes of CO2a year, what effect will that have on the world by 2020?
We know that India is going to go from three billion to five billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year by 2020—that is up by two billion tonnes. China is going to go from seven billion to 10 billion—up another three billion by 2020. Those two countries will produce another five billion tonnes of greenhouse gases a year by 2020. If Australia cuts it greenhouse gas emissions by 500 million tonnes a year, that is an extra five billion tonnes. But you are not going to change a thing. The amount of greenhouse gases is going to continue to rise. While India, China and the United States are producing 50 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gases and are not going to do a thing about it, you want to take us down a road of taxation and put electricity prices up for everyone—including aged-care facilities, local governments, our exporting industries, our abattoirs, the people who live at home and even Senator Sterle’s own household. And you think you are going to save the earth by doing this!
This is just outrageous. This is what we are going to face: we have a government that is in bed with and dominated by the Greens. The Greens will want their pound of flesh, they will dictate to the government what they want and the government will simply go along with them. There will be more of the same. What will the Greens policy of ‘Let’s raise the registration fee for B-doubles to $23,000 a year and take away their 16c rebate on fuel’ do for the price of everything that is transported around regional Australia? What will that do for the prices of food going into the towns and for the export of grain et cetera going out to the wharves? This is what the government will be facing. The Greens will have leverage on them with a 10-foot crowbar, leveraging the government until they get their demands. That is what we have in front of us in Australia—a Labor government, a minority government, dominated by the Greens.
This government will do the same thing to our nation that the disgraceful government in New South Wales has done to the state of New South Wales. The New South Wales government has driven people out of their state at a rate of 500 a week. That is why we lose seats. That is why the seat of Gwydir was taken from us and the seat of Flynn was formed in Queensland. That is why another seat is gone. We have just had the seat of Wright formed in Queensland. People are being driven out of New South Wales because of the Greens-Labor coalition in that state, and this is what Australia is going to face.
The government will see how many jobs will be cut, how many industries will suffer and how many industries have been moved overseas because of its carbon taxes. The cement industry will be the first one gone. This is the direction the government will take our country. Come next election, do not worry about minority governments, because the people of Australia will see that Independents like Tony Windsor and Robert Oakeshott from the conservative seats just turn their backs on their electorates. The public will not forget that next time, and we will see a big change. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,40,1
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-09-29,"—It gives me great pleasure to reply to Her Excellency the Governor-General’s address to the 43rd Parliament. The opening of parliament is a special occasion and quite properly a very ceremonial occasion. This ceremony not only celebrates the fact that Australia has one of the most stable democracies in the world but also recognises our cultural heritage and the Westminster tradition that has led to that stability. Of course, there has been an important recent addition to this ceremony, the welcome to country, which recognises that we meet on the land of the first Australians.
The commencement of a new parliament brings with it many new faces in the House of Representatives and, come 1 July, there will be several new faces in this place as well. It also brings the departure of several members and senators—some by choice, others not. I would like to congratulate all new members and senators on their election and all those who have retained their seat. It is a great honour to be chosen by your constituents to represent them and it carries with it a great sense of responsibility. To those elected to the next Senate it may seem like a long wait until the term begins on 1 July next year, but I can assure them the time will pass quickly. I also congratulate the ministers and parliamentary secretaries on their appointments. I hope that everyone who comes into this parliament does so to advance the interests of the Australian people, and I believe that is the case.
Parliament involves a contest of ideas and in that contest there are inevitably casualties. Politics can be a tough and unforgiving business. To those who were not re-elected, I offer my commiserations. I would like to thank you for your contribution to this parliament. While your election results may make it difficult at the moment to feel that your service is valued, I can assure you that it has been of great value. You have dedicated yourself to public service and sought to advance the interests of your fellow Australians, and I commend you for this.
The federal election just past seems to have produced a series of disparate results across the country. Despite the swing against us in some areas, the Labor Party achieved an excellent result in my home state of Tasmania. I would like to congratulate my colleague Senator Polley on her re-election to the Senate for another six-year term and Senators-elect Anne Urquart and Lisa Singh on their success as well. As a result of the past two elections, Tasmania will soon have six Labor senators for the first time since 1985.
The member for Franklin, Julie Collins; the member for Lyons, Dick Adams; and the member for Braddon, Sid Sidebottom, were all re-elected on comfortable margins. I think this demonstrates that, while there may be national factors at play, there is a lot of value in having a hardworking member who represents their electorate well. Ms Collins has worked hard for the people of Franklin, and I congratulate her on her promotion to Parliamentary Secretary for Community Services. I have known Julie for a long time. She has worked hard for the people of Franklin since her endorsement prior to the 2007 election and I firmly believe she will continue to do so. With Senator Sherry’s continued tenure as a minister—the Minister for Small Business and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism—it is pleasing to see two fellow Tasmanians in the ministry. It is a proper reflection of the abundance of talent that exists within the Tasmanian federal Labor caucus.
Geoff Lyons’ result in Bass is also to be highly commended, given the seat’s history of volatility and marginal outcomes. Mr Lyons has already worked hard to establish his local credentials through his involvement in sporting administration, surf-lifesaving and various other grassroots community organisations. He also has a strong background in health and aged care, and I know he will be a worthy representative for the people of Bass. Although I did not make it across to Mr Lyons’ first speech, I know he has delivered it. So it is straight down to business for Mr Lyons in representing the people of Bass.
The result in Denison was obviously unexpected. As with the other four Senate seats in Tasmania, we actually recorded a swing in our favour against the Liberal Party under two-party preferred terms. I strongly believe that Jonathon Jackson—the Labor candidate—had and still has a lot to offer. While I would like to see him continue to pursue a political career, I wish him well in whatever he does. However, it is a rare and monumental achievement for an Independent to be elected in their own right at a general election, and I congratulate Andrew Wilkie on his election as the member for Denison. I guess it is somewhat a coincidence that he enters parliament at a time when Independents have a significance never before seen in Australia’s House of Representatives.
Nationwide, the federal election just past has produced an unusual result where neither Labor nor the coalition hold a majority of seats in the House of Representatives in their own right. A stable government depends on three things. Firstly, it needs the majority of its members to agree to pass supply bills so that the government is able to fund its programs. Secondly, it must have the confidence of the majority of members in the House of Representatives. It is these two matters on which Her Excellency the Governor-General seeks advice in deciding who will form government. It is these two matters on which we have agreement from a sufficient number of the Independent members and one Green member to allow us to form government. Whatever arguments the coalition may advance about their right to govern because of more votes or more seats, the simple fact is that government, under the Australian Constitution, requires the confidence of a majority in the House of Representatives. If neither side wins an election outright then there is a second contest, and that is the contest to convince the crossbenches that you will be able to form a stable and secure government.
This brings me to the third criterion for stable government, and that is goodwill. While the Gillard government have sufficient support on confidence and supply, we still need to negotiate each piece of legislation individually. To make this parliament work, every member needs to approach these negotiations in good faith. So I find it very disappointing that Tony Abbott and the opposition’s approach has been to try and take a wrecking ball to this parliament. Their attitude seems to be that they will do anything within their power to destabilise the parliament because they want to go rushing back to the polls as soon as possible.
Exhibit A is the way they tore up an agreement on the pairing of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, an agreement they say is unconstitutional, despite the advice of the Solicitor-General to the contrary. If they seriously believe that the pairing arrangement is unconstitutional, why did they agree to it in the first place? Why did they not get their advice before they signed on the dotted line? Or was it a simple case of doing what suited them at the time and then changing their mind when the result did not go the way they expected? That is not quite Australian, I would suggest. There seems to be a born to rule mentality on that side of the chamber.
Exhibit B is the coalition’s refusal to join a parliamentary committee to discuss options to tackle climate change. That is not surprising, given their current leader’s pronouncement that climate change is crap. Once again, it is a great example of the opposition preferring to try and spoil parliament rather than work cooperatively for the good of the Australian people. The members for Lyne, New England, Melbourne and Denison all appear to have had their decisions vindicated. They decided that their vote would go towards providing stable government. They are looking for a government that is willing to engage in cooperative discussions about outcomes, that is willing to negotiate in good faith and that wants to see arrangements put in place to make the parliament work.
The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, has selected a competent and talented team for the front bench. I know that they will be well supported by their fellow members of the Labor caucus. The Gillard government is committed to a strong, fair Australia and is prepared to do everything possible to ensure that this nation has a bright future. The people of Australia deserve nothing but the best and the Gillard government will deliver this, no matter what the opposition throw at us. Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her team are committed to making this minority government work and we expect the same level of commitment from all other members of parliament, regardless of their political affiliation or independence.
The Gillard government is committed to continuing the excellent financial management that saw Australia fare much better than other developed countries during the global financial crisis. Treasurer Wayne Swan has already shown that he can do the job, and with his skills and expertise Australia will continue to have a growing economy.
We are committed to creating jobs and providing Australians with a first-class education and the skills necessary to be effective members of society in whatever career they choose. Peter Garrett, Senators Chris Evans, Kim Carr and Mark Arbib, along with Kate Ellis and Senator Jacinta Collins, are a strong, effective team who will work hard to keep employment and education on track.
The Gillard government is also committed to looking after regional Australia, with Simon Crean leading the way in this area. Tony Burke holds the portfolio of population and sustainability and will ensure that Australia has strategies in place to set a population target and to provide infrastructure for a growing population.
Ministers Nicola Roxon and Jenny Macklin continue the great work they have started in their areas and are supported by the great team of Warren Snowdon, Mark Butler, Kate Ellis, Senator Mark Arbib, Catherine King, Julie Collins and Senator Jan McLucas. Together, they will continue to pursue health and hospital reforms and to deliver family and community services that meet the needs of the most vulnerable Australians. Health reforms are essential to ensure that Australians can access the best possible medical services. For the first time, the Australian government will provide the majority of funding for the public hospital system but local communities will retain control through the local hospital network.
More money is being invested in training medical professionals, including specialists, to reduce waiting times in emergency departments and for elective surgery, as well as making it easier to access a doctor after hours. The government is providing an additional 2½ thousand aged-care places to help deal with the ageing population. Australians suffering from mental illness will receive increased support through additional Headspace services, early intervention practices and more mental health nurses. The government is also giving a new focus to preventative health, including increasing the tobacco excise and a move towards plain packaging for cigarettes. There is also $50 million being invested in the National Binge Drinking Strategy. Welfare reform is another area that we will continue to work hard in. The people of Australia deserve financial support to help them through the tough times they may be going through. We need to do what we can to ensure that their hardships are only temporary.
Kevin Rudd will lead the way as Minister for Foreign Affairs, with Dr Craig Emerson as Minister for Trade. We all know that international relations are complex. That is why we need to have people with talent, skills and diplomacy looking after Australia’s interests on the international scene. Stephen Smith will take over from Senator John Faulkner as Minister for Defence, a very important role, with our troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Gillard government are committed to protecting Australia’s national security. We are committed to making the world a safer place than it is today.
Robert McClelland and Brendan O’Connor will continue the excellent job that they have done as Attorney-General and Minister for Home Affairs respectively. There are others I could mention, but there is a time limit to this speech. It is not possible to discuss all the areas the Gillard government is working in to progress Australia. But rest assured that the Gillard government is a team effort and all members of the team will be working hard. This is one area that separates us from those in the opposition. The people of Australia are not fooled—nor, I would imagine, impressed—by the childish antics of poor losers.
I can only imagine Mr Abbott as a child in the playground, taking his bat and ball and going home when he did not win the toss, or refusing to play ball when he could not get his own way to play on the ground of his choice, wanting to change the rules to suit his own ends and taking no notice of the independent umpire—really bad sportsmanship, Mr Abbott.
It is not only Mr Abbott’s approach to the parliament that makes him a wrecker; it is the policies he would pursue as Prime Minister if he had the opportunity. As soon as Mr Abbott appointed a spokesperson for broadband, Mr Turnbull, his first instructions to him were to ‘demolish’ the National Broadband Network. Maybe he should look at the votes in Tasmania, to see if the people there want the National Broadband Network. Maybe that issue had an impact on the bad result the opposition had in Tasmania. It is quite ironic that the person in the coalition given responsibility for pursuing the development of broadband has actually been instructed to stop the rollout of optic fibre broadband. Prior to the election, Mr Abbott clearly demonstrated that, when it comes to national infrastructure, public services, broadband, trade training centres and GP superclinics, he is defined not by what he proposes but by what he opposes.
Government should proceed on the basis of plans for the future, not plans to tear up infrastructure, axe services and try to take Australia back to the past. Despite Mr Abbott’s plans to destabilise the 43rd Parliament, the government are going to try and make it work, and we have evidence that it can work. The evidence is history. In 1999 and 2002, in Victoria and South Australia respectively, Labor formed successful minority governments with the support of Independents on the key questions of confidence and supply. They put in place working arrangements to negotiate the passage of legislation through their lower houses. Only this year, Tasmanian Labor successfully entered into a minority government arrangement with the Greens and have demonstrated that they can work together.
And what better evidence is there of the workability of such arrangements than the Australian Senate? Since I came into this chamber, we have had to negotiate with the Greens and the two Independents to pass legislation without the support of the opposition. We have already demonstrated through that process that we can work together with the crossbenches. We can discuss legislation with Senator Bob Brown and his colleagues, with Senator Xenophon and with Senator Fielding, and we know how to negotiate and get bills passed. And we in the Senate are used to being conscientious about turning up to every division, even at times when we are sitting at two o’clock in the morning. To my colleagues in the lower house: while some media commentators may tell you that the situation is some new paradigm in Australian politics, all I have to say is: ‘Welcome to our world!’
I know we can move forward with these arrangements in place to pursue a true nation-building agenda. We will pursue health and hospital reforms to take the pressure off waiting lists and give local communities a greater say in the administration of their hospitals through the establishment of local hospital networks.
We will build a national broadband network with fast optic fibre to 93 per cent of businesses and household premises. This network will revolutionise telecommunications and the way we do business and dramatically improve education, health and community care services. It will boost productivity and make Australia the most connected nation on the planet. The NBN has already been rolled out in Tasmania, with customers already signed up to internet service providers for speeds up to 100 times faster than anything they have experienced before.
We have already introduced a paid parental leave scheme, giving working parents the opportunity to spend more time bonding with their newborn children. This scheme will also assist businesses to retain skilled and valuable workers.
We will give Australians a greater share in the wealth extracted from our non-renewable resources through the minerals resource rent tax. These resources are owned by all Australians, and by providing a fairer share of the wealth we can boost Australians’ superannuation savings and offer tax cuts to small businesses.
I look forward to working in the 43rd Parliament with the re-elected Gillard Labor government and pursuing Labor’s strong, aggressive agenda. It will be an interesting and exciting time for all of us. With a dose of goodwill and a spirit of cooperation, I am confident that it will work.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,40,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-09-29,"—I am pleased tonight to speak to the motion on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General’s speech and to raise a number of issues, particularly with respect to health and healthy lifestyles. In the speech presented in this chamber by Her Excellency the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce, she made it clear that the federal Labor government, in its wisdom:
… will invest in increasing participation in community sport and supporting our elite athletes, thus contributing to a more active and healthy society.
It is a laudable objective, of course, to invest in increasing funding for community sport. So I was scratching my head as to why this government would be saying such a thing when, on the other hand, they expect to chop the most successful and popular after-school program, the Active After-School Communities program, which was announced and started in 2004. Why would they say that they wanted to increase community sport and support for community sport when, in a matter of months, that program will conclude? The government did not make their position clear during the election campaign. Why not? Probably because they expect the program to terminate at the end of this year. In fact, the rumour mill is moving fast, and people are seriously concerned, because the government have not made their final position clear. All we can say is that we can expect that the program will conclude at the end of this year.
It is an incredibly successful program. It was launched by former Prime Minister John Howard in 2004 in Launceston, in fact—in my home town of Launceston, in my home state, at my healthy lifestyle forum to help combat childhood obesity. At that time, in the lead-up to the 2004 election, then Prime Minister John Howard announced the coalition’s anti-obesity strategy action plan, which included the Active After-School Communities program. The Minister for Sport at the time, Senator Rod Kemp, was also there to assist in the launch of that program. I am proud as Punch that the program was launched at my forum. I am proud as Punch that I was part of the thinking and the strategy behind getting that particular program announced and then, in due course, developed in conjunction with the Australian Sports Commission.
This is a very important program. This is a program which encourages children to be physically active, whether it be in a sport that they enjoy or some recreational activity. It is a fantastic program and it has been proved to be successful. There have been reviews, and the reviews all give it the big tick. There are some 150,000 school children across Australia in over 3,250 schools that have participated annually in the program. In Tasmania we have 90 schools and 5,000 students participating in the program this year.
At the moment the Active After-School Communities program employs some 180 staff nationwide, all of whom face a very uncertain future. In Tasmania there are five full-time employees and one part-time employee and they do a fantastic job. I would like to commend and congratulate specifically Blair Brownless, who is the state manager for the program based in Hobart. He is such an enthusiast. Of course, he is also an enthusiast for the Geelong football club—his brother is Billy Brownless. In my home town of Launceston there is Ralph Morris, who does such a fantastic job as a coordinator to make things happen. He does not need to do very much because the kids love it, the mums and dads love it, the families love it and the schools love it.
The shadow Assistant Treasurer, Sussan Ley, and I launched a petition on 18 June this year to save the program. My office has been inundated with responses and encouragement from families and children, who say, ‘We want the program to continue.’ Earlier today I was pleased to lodge in the Senate a petition with 320 signatures, not just from adults, mums and dads, but also from children who support the program. It is a great program.
Features of the program are that after-school sport and team-playing activities are provided, with funding for the regional coordinators—as I have said, there are five full-time and one part-time employee in Tasmania—and grants to help delivery costs, teacher-staff supervision, delivery fees, venue hire and equipment and transport costs, giving children an opportunity to participate in a variety of activities.
Is this is just directed to big cities? Is it just available to what some people would call city slickers? The answer is no. This program covers rural and regional areas as well. That is one of the fantastic things about the program: it gets to rural and regional Australia. Rural communities love it. In those communities we must remember that there are limited opportunities for children to participate in sport programs, and children are often left without the opportunities of their city counterparts due to the significant costs and the travel involved.
The benefits of the program are obviously the reduced risks of obesity and all the flow-on effects of that, the improved cardiovascular fitness and sleep outcomes, the increased confidence that it gives to the kids and the improved cooperation, social and leadership skills. These are not just problems for Tasmania; these are problems for this country. Frankly, we need to do better.
I want to refer to one of the letters in support of the program that I have received. It is from the Snug Primary School and it says:
On behalf of the Snug Primary School students I am writing a letter to you about stopping the Active After School Communities Program.
Ending the program will cause a big upset to our school. Many students participate in activities and enjoy them greatly. It is a big part of our school Health and PE program for many students ...
and it goes on and on. I also have a letter from the Cancer Council Tasmania. I know senators on both sides of this chamber have some involvement and interaction with the Cancer Council Tasmania. They do a great job. What do they say? Darren Carr, CEO, wrote to me on 12August and said that the council:
... would like to congratulate the Government for initiating the Active After Schools Community (AASC) program. What a success it has been.
He was referring, of course, to the Howard government in that regard. He went on:
I am writing to advise of Cancer Council Tasmania’s desire for the continued support of the AASC program.
The opportunities created by the program in nearly 90 Tasmanian schools have had immense health benefits for primary aged children.
This is fantastic. He went on to say:
As you may already be aware, one quarter ... of Australian children were deemed overweight or obese in 2008. A lack of physical activity is one of the main causes of childhood obesity.
Unfortunately Tasmania has the lowest percentage of children participating in organised sport, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If the AASC program were to lose its support and funding from the Federal Government, the statistics are likely to worsen and in turn would have a negative impact on the health of our children.
Obesity needs to be tackled from childhood because if it is not, obesity may persist through to adulthood. There is also an increase in the likelihood of developing diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and a variety of cancers.
Programs such as AASC have the potential to make a difference to these childhood obesity rates. Therefore we cannot let the Federal Government dismiss the funding and support of such a worthwhile program.
We call on all political parties to indicate their support for continuation of the  AASC program ...
I stand here tonight saying the community support it and the campaign should be supported. This program should be supported. I had the honour and privilege of being in the other place just a couple of hours ago to hear the first speech of the new federal member for Bass. I congratulate him on his first speech. I noted his special interest in community sport. He has had quite a background in that area and I note that and commend him for that. So I would say that this is probably the first major challenge that he will face, because during his speech he called for increased funding and increased support for community sport. The question is: will he support this campaign? The question for the new federal member for Bass is: will he lobby his Prime Minister? Will he lobby the relevant federal minister for education, the Minister for Sport and the minister for children? Will he join the campaign? Will he distribute petitions in his electorate of Bass. Likewise, to other senators and members in Tasmania and around the country: will you get behind this campaign to save this fantastic program which was started under the Howard government at the my healthy lifestyle forum. Will it happen? I do not know.
I also know that the Hon. Sharman Stone is a fantastic supporter of this program. She and I did a lot of work in Tasmania on her recent visit prior to the federal election in support of it. So I leave that open as a question for the federal member for Bass and say that this will no doubt be the first real challenge for him.
The petition I lodged in the Senate today says:
We the undersigned citizens agree that the federal government should continue funding the Active After-schools Communities program. The program was launched at the Healthy Lifestyles Forum in Launceston in June 2004 by former Prime Minister, John Howard. The popular and successful program has benefited 3,250 schools nationwide with over 150,000 children participating. In Tasmania alone, over 90 schools are involved with 5, 000 children participating ...
and it goes on. One of the features of the school sport and team-playing activities is that they provide funding for regional coordinators and so on. The program also gives children a safe place to go after school if no-one is home, and that is an added benefit. It is not just a health benefit but there are childcare benefits after school.
The federal government has committed funding for the program only until December 2010 pending a review. This is an issue for the staff. The staff are concerned about their future. Let me put the government on notice: staff are now looking for other opportunities. You will lose good people. Here we are at the end of September and you have got October and November. The school term will be concluded within a matter of months and by the end of the year you will find that those good staff will leave to find other opportunities. They have got no guarantee of their future. This is an issue front and centre for the government and I call on the government to heed the calls and the merits of this campaign.
I was at the Bridport Primary School in July, providing congratulations to the school up there for their wonderful work and presenting certificates to those involved. I noted at the time the sound health and social benefits and the community support for the program. Mike Furlong from the Bridport Bowls Club was very involved in supporting the Bridport Primary School. They have got bowls champions now coming out of the Bridport Primary School. It is fantastic. So the skills that are being developed flow through. So I call on the government to take that into account.
A couple of years ago, in 2007 before the election, the government said that obesity should be a national health priority. What are they doing about it? This is something that can be used to address that problem. At my Healthy Lifestyle Forum just two years ago Access Economics released a report which said that the obesity epidemic in Australia is estimated to cost around $58 billion a year. That is a huge figure. This is something for all of us to be aware of.
These and other details are set out in my book The Millennium Disease, which was launched by Tony Abbott just a few years ago. One quarter of all Australian children, or around 600,000 children, were overweight or obese, up four percentage points from 1995. The figures are getting worse; they are not getting better. The obesity rate for children increased from five per cent in 1995 to eight per cent in 2007-08. It shows a shift towards the higher and heavier end of the body mass index.
In terms of adults, 61 per cent of Australian adults are either overweight or obese based on the latest statistics. The facts and figures are getting worse, not better. We have an epidemic. We are one of the four fattest nations on earth, behind the US, the UK and Mexico. Australia comes fourth. All the trend lines are getting worse, not better. We need to do something about it. This is one area where we can make a difference. I call on the government to address these issues and to make that difference.
I now wish to move to another area of concern for me personally and, I think, for many others in this country. It is an area of considerable sensitivity, and that is the issue of euthanasia. I would just like to draw to the attention of senators and members and members of the public the report of June 2008 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee into Senator Bob Brown’s bill at the time, the Rights of the Terminally Ill (Euthanasia Laws Repeal) Bill 2008. The committee made a number of observations. The end result was that the way the bill was drafted at the time made it a dog’s breakfast and it needed to be substantially amended. Even Senator Brown in his report agreed with the committee’s conclusions that it needed to be vastly amended.
Subsequently Senator Brown did bring in a further bill with respect to euthanasia to provide the ability for the ACT and the Northern Territory in particular to have a right to legislate in this area. I have particular concerns, and have had for a long period of time, with respect to providing and supporting euthanasia, which involves one person being sanctioned to kill another. That is the long and the short of it.
I am particularly concerned about the safeguards or the adequacy of those safeguards. Clearly, with respect to the Northern Territory—and you can have a look at our report—there were inadequate safeguards in the Northern Territory at the time prior to the Andrews’ bill being passed and promulgated from our parliament in 1997 when their bill became effective. While the Northern Territory bill was alive and active it was clearly deficient in my view.
Have a look at the report. It is on the record. People will no doubt have to dig deep to review their own conscience on this matter. But that report does outline some of the arguments for and against, such as: the issue of the importance of palliative care and quality palliative care; the problem of adequate safeguards; and the possibility that it would lead to a slippery slope. For example, acceptance of voluntary euthanasia would lead to involuntary euthanasia and, indeed, euthanasia for lesser diseases and conditions. There is the potential for the erosion of the doctor-patient relationship. It places pressure on people to end their lives even when they are not ready, for example, to reduce the burden on their family or the health system. This is a particular area of concern. Whether it be the vulnerable, the old, the frail, the disabled or the weak, the pressures will be there. Once you introduce a bill like this, if it is successful there will be financial pressures. There will be a healthcare costs and pressures. There will be expectations of family and they will assume new dimensions.
I want to alert the public to Paul Kelly’s commentary today in the Australian. It is excellent in my view. Under the heading ‘Brown’s euthanasia bill a perilous test for Gillard’ he makes some very thoughtful observations, including quoting from this Senate report. Obviously, the sanctity of human life is critical in any of these decisions. In the case of the Northern Territory legislation, the impact on Indigenous communities must be taken into account and the way they see these issues. This is clearly a great concern.
Senator Bob Brown and Ms Gillard, the Prime Minister, see this as a top priority for the government and the Greens and that is why this bill has been introduced. I simply raise these concerns. I draw the attention of others to that Senate committee report. Hopefully, it will better inform senators in this place who in due course will have to exercise their views and, I assume and hope, their conscience on this matter.
In the remaining minute I have I want to ask a question and make an observation. The observation is that the Prime Minister did not attend the church service prior to the opening of parliament. I respect and understand that because she is an avowed atheist, but of course that would be the first time in my memory that that has happened in the political history of this country. I stand to be corrected and am happy to check the facts and figures there—and if somebody could do that then that would be good—but certainly to my understanding that was the first time the Prime Minister did not attend the church service.
The question I have is: why didn’t the Governor-General, Her Excellency, attend that service? There has been no reason given. I hope she will make that clear to members of the public. The public in general have a right to know. In past years the Governor-General has attended.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,40,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2010-09-29,"—It is with great delight that I rise to add my comments to this debate on the Governor-General’s opening speech. What a historic occasion it was to have our first female Governor-General opening the 43rd Parliament with Julia Gillard as Prime Minister. This Labor government sees as important for the future of this country having a strong economy, having a vision for the future and tackling the difficult issues that we are confronted with.
Before I go on to talk about some of those issues I want to take this opportunity to congratulate my Tasmanian colleagues on their re-election to the other place—Sid Sidebottom in Braddon, Julie Collins in Franklin and Dick Adams in Lyons—and I want to make some comments about the new federal member for Bass, Mr Geoff Lyons. He made his first speech to the parliament this afternoon. I congratulate him on his contribution. He has set a very high bar for not only what he will bring to the federal parliament but how he will be a strong, outstanding advocate for the electorate of Bass. I want to take this opportunity as the Labor senator who led the Senate ticket in the election to congratulate senators-elect Anne Urquhart and Lisa Singh. They are both outstanding women who will make a fantastic contribution in this place.
I want to turn now to the issues that we as a government will confront. These things were neglected over the 12 years of the previous Liberal government. They are things like investing in infrastructure in education, tackling homelessness and talking about aged care. I would also like to talk about an issue in Tasmania that was key to our success in the last federal election—the rollout of the National Broadband Network. This is the most important development for Australia in a very long time, as important as roads, rail and electricity. It is certainly the largest single investment in infrastructure made by an Australian government. The benefits are very real.
The opposition talk of the cost of doing this but there is never any mention of the huge cost to the Australian community and to our economy of not doing it, of not making this investment. This would be a missed opportunity for creative talent, for existing businesses and for new businesses to upload their video files without constraints and for health, for education and for all of us to operate in a more secure Internet system.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,40,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-09-29,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This report of the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy on digital television transmission and reception is quite extensive and comprehensive and it highlights the litany of failure with respect to digital television access in rural and regional parts of this country. I specifically will address my remarks to Tasmania. There is a litany of complaint for rural and regional parts of Tasmania and it has continued. For example, last year we were the only state in Australia that missed out One HD 24-hour sports TV channel. It has now been rolled out. Initially it was to be rolled out to the capital cities but not Hobart—not Tasmania. Then I started a campaign in June or July last year. We had a Facebook campaign, we had community support and Tasmanians, particularly in the south, said: ‘We want it. We deserve it. We are part of Australia. Hobart is the capital of the sovereign state of Tasmania and one of the capitals in this country of Australia.’ We said it is not fair. That campaign continued for some time because we felt we were being treated as second-class citizens and it was not good enough. We are just as keen on sport—AFL football and also rugby league, but mostly AFL football, I must say. Many of us down there support the Richmond Tigers. They have not had a great year—
—Go the Pies!
—Go the Pies, says Senator Feeney, for this Saturday. So we are saying that we are like every other member of the Australian community. So it was disappointing at the time that Southern Cross Ten Network launched One HD to regional viewers in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the ACT from 2 July and of course there was a huge delay in Tasmania. In the end we got it to Hobart. We made that campaign successful. Community support and community pressure made it happen. And guess what? It then went to other parts of Australia. So we started a campaign for all the other parts of Tasmania. It took time and we were ultimately successful, but we had to fight to make it happen. I am proud to be a member of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team and, with others, we fought very hard. There was a group of sports fans not just in Hobart but also in Launceston. We urged quick action and we ended up getting it.
But since then it seems that the networks, this government and Senator Conroy have not learnt their lesson. Why have they not learnt that lesson? Just a month or two ago, I think it was the week of August 30, Channel 7 and Channel 10 announced that they would launch new digital channels, 7Mate and Channel 11, across Australia except Tasmania. So they have not learnt their lesson. There was a Facebook page created and a campaign started. I commend Rebecca White from Tasmania, a local member of parliament down there, for making an effort to say that we should be treated like all other parts of Australia. Well, guess what? In due course they did listen and they did learn and now those new digital channels are coming to Tasmania.
I am very disappointed that the federal Labor government has not acted more directly with respect to access to digital television on the east coast of Tasmania. I am advised, based on this report of September 2010 and other advice I have received, that that is not going to be due until 2013. That is a long way away. We want to be treated like other parts of Australia and 2013 is a long way away—obviously more than two years away. That is a decision that I know Senator Conroy can influence. He can make a decision and he can stand up for the people of Tasmania. I am asking him tonight to do so and putting him on notice. I am saying to him: ‘Please intervene. Please step forward. We know that your government has pledged some money to be spent on broadcasting digital services to regional areas across Australia and we want Tasmania included—the east coast of Tasmania and other parts of Tasmania, whether it be the west coast, the far north-east or the islands, King and Flinders.’ We need that support from the Federal government. I ask this government to come forward and say, ‘We acknowledge there is a problem here.’ The way the program and the system is running at the moment is discriminatory. This report that I am referring to tonight, dated September 2010, is very clear. The fact is that it is simply not good enough. I am asking the government to step forward, take on board the concerns and fix the problem. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-09-29,"—I rise today to compliment the Labor government’s Building the Education Revolution initiative, which has seen schools across this great nation receive much wanted and much appreciated multipurpose halls, classrooms, undercover areas, libraries and technology rooms. After 12 years of neglect, our schools now have brand new or upgraded facilities which will bring them into the 21st century. In the last six months I have been privileged to visit many schools in Queensland which benefited from the Labor government’s injection of $16.2 billion to inspect and officially open these great new facilities. Contrary to Senator Joyce’s ‘glorified garden sheds’ claim, not one was in sight. Instead, I saw big enclosed halls complete with stages, where students can play sport when the weather is inclement and can hold their graduation ceremonies, musicals and school assemblies. One school I visited can fit the entire student body in a building for the first time. I saw extended classrooms, where schools like Living Faith Lutheran Primary School can expand and become a triple stream school. I saw covered walkways at Toowong State School, under which students can walk from one building to the next without getting wet or facing sunburn. I saw new libraries and rooms full of computers, allowing every student in a class to develop their IT skills.
To me, this project has been an absolute success. For many schools I visited this funding, which was part of our $42 billion economic stimulus package, was a dream come true. Dayboro State School principal, Ms Glynnis Gartside, whose school received a multipurpose hall and a library resource centre, said that she had not seen anything like it before. At the BER opening on 14 July she said:
Firstly, we are happy. These new facilities, that we wouldn’t have even dreamed to dream of two years ago, are well built, appropriate to our needs and will serve the Dayboro community well into the future. Secondly, in my long career as a teacher with Education Queensland—this is my 39th year—I have never seen first-class facilities like these made available to primary schools unless the pressure of growth or sheer decay of existing facilities has made it absolutely necessary. It just goes to show that if you stay around long enough anything can happen.
Another school which I visited in the electorate of Dickson was Living Faith Lutheran Primary School. During the official opening of their new multipurpose hall and classroom in August, school council chairperson, Roz Cooper, said that these facilities would not otherwise have been a reality for the school for many years. She said:
We are just absolutely delighted because we couldn’t have got as high-quality or well appointment to the buildings without the funding of the state and the federal Labor governments for both this hall land our third year 1 class. Given that this is our 10th year, that would have been well down the track before we could achieve that, so we’re very, very grateful.
Of all the schools I visited, not one negative comment was made. The students and teachers are pleased with their new buildings, and the principals are thankful and delighted. Not only has this project benefited 9,500 schools in Australia; it has also kept people in jobs during the global financial crisis.
The BER was a key element of the Labor government’s $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which aimed at supporting up to 90,000 jobs to keep Australians employed. In February 2009, $1.288 billion was allocated to 9,495 schools to renew and refurbish existing facilities under the National School Pride Program; $821.8 million was announced to fund the Science and Language Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools, to provide state-of-the-art facilities for our schools; and $14.1 billion was allocated to Primary Schools for the 21st Century, to fund 10,656 projects in 7,961 primary schools throughout the nation. When the rest of the world heard about the financial crisis taking place in the United States, the Labor government decided to take direct action to prevent our prosperous nation from falling into a recession. The construction industry had slowed down, which meant many people would have faced the prospect of unemployment. To curb this problem and to keep Australians in jobs the Labor government turned to an economic stimulus package to boost the economy and provide vital infrastructure for our future generations. These projects have delivered new and refurbished buildings for our growing schools that have benefited not only their students but also their wider communities. Community groups will also be able to access these halls at little or no cost.
Standing in any of these fantastic facilities, the last thing that comes to mind is ‘monumental failure’, as the member for Sturt described the BER program. A media statement released by the Building the Education Revolution Taskforce, which was established to investigate and respond to complaints made about the program found:
… BER P21 is delivering quality infrastructure within the timeframe constraints set.
The statement went on:
For some of the 22 education authorities’ project costs are materially higher than would have been obtained pre-BER in a business as usual environment. For some education authorities however the costs do not appear to be higher.
Notwithstanding the validity of issues raised in the complaints which are concentrated in the NSW Government system, our overall observation is that this Australia wide program is delivering much needed infrastructure to school communities while achieving the primary goal of economic activity across the nation.
The project was a highly positive initiative for our nation and achieved what was intended by the Labor government. It kept people in jobs, it stimulated the economy and it provided quality new infrastructure for our schools.
Another school which was delighted with their new buildings was Chevallum State School. During the BER opening in August, a poem was read by a student, Penny, which voiced the school’s delight. I would like to share the poem with those in the chamber this evening and those listening:
The Building Education Revolution
Has created answers and been a solution
In enhancing and complementing our existing facilities
It will boost our student learning abilities
Our new hall is the heart of our education
Upholding Chevallum’s high achieving reputation
Parades and performing arts, we do
Ceremonies and concerts, to name a few
When multi-age prep comes to town
There is now more space to move around
Lots more area for think and play
Children negotiating and having their say
The space is open and bright
It’s easier to construct, read, problem solve and write
The new library is a place of quiet and peace
As you read your brain will surely feast
With nooks and crannies and personal space
You can curl up against a bookcase
A central place for all to meet
Computer labs where one can take a seat
For readers and others it’s a second home
If you come here you’re never alone
Our new teaching kitchen is a diverse learning space
Lifelong learning skills students will embrace
We work in a safe, hygienic and efficient way
Preparing a variety of meals from the garden to gourmet
The Building Education Revolution
Has created answers and been a solution
In enhancing and complementing our existing facilities
It will boost our student learning abilities.
It is clear not only from that poem but also from the other feedback that I have received in attending BER openings that the Building the Education Revolution is a successful program which has delivered 21st century facilities to schools across the nation, kept people in jobs and boosted our economy. Our students now have new halls, new computers and an even more prosperous future ahead, thanks to a Labor government.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Building the Education Revolution Program</title>,Adjournment,42,1
