"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-03-12,"—This bill is an important but uncontroversial one. It is uncontroversial largely because it is a slightly modified form of the previous government’s election commitment. Once again, it is an example of the Rudd government’s ‘me too’ policy strategy. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then the Howard government indeed has a great deal to be proud of.
This bill increases the utilities allowance for pensioners to $500 per year. It extends the utilities allowance to other beneficiaries of pensionable age and also to disability support pensioners and people of any age on carer payments. The bill also increases the telephone allowance for pensioners, carers and disability support pensioners with an internet connection and provides an increased seniors concession allowance to $500 per person. At the cost of around $4 billion over the forward estimates period, some three million people will benefit from the passage of this bill.
We support these measures as, in the main, they were our policies and the government should be supported in implementing them. But I make a few observations. This bill recognises that carers and pensioners deserve our support—certainly they had it during the 11½ years of the former government—and that they are amongst the most vulnerable in our country to cost of living increases and limited external resources. This made the recent attempt by the Rudd Labor government to axe the lump sum bonuses to carers and pensioners even more heartless. So it is reassuring that due to the pressure applied by the coalition Mr Rudd has agreed, indeed copied, the coalition policy and last night further committed to maintaining these lump sum bonuses.
Of course there are some questions still to be answered but, notwithstanding this, the contemplation of axing the bonuses exposed the dark heart that lies at the very centre of this government. For days the government applied all sorts of linguistic trickery to avoid giving a straight answer on the bonus payments. The spin doctors tried to confuse the issue, but the public will no longer accept weasel words instead of firm policy. For a government that was committed to symbolism, this government’s message of the last five days has been very clear: ‘Let’s see what we can get away with and hope that the pensioners and the carers simply won’t notice’.
But they did notice, and the message will not be lost on them. The message I can take, on behalf of the coalition, to carers and pensioners across our country is this: they know the levels of support we gave them during 11½ years; they know we will not tire or resile from our support for them as some of the most vulnerable in our community. We will not let this government get away with trickery and we will support measures that support carers and disabled pensioners—anyone in receipt of a pension—to live a full and meaningful life. The opposition supports this bill and we commend the government for its rapid action and acknowledge the fact that these things can only be enacted so speedily due to the strong economy, but that anything that affects our strong economy will reflect on the level of benefits that we can supply. That is a caution for the government not to destroy the Australian economy because of the effects it will have on our most vulnerable and marginal.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ENHANCED ALLOWANCES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-12,"—The Democrats support the Social Security and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Allowances) Bill 2008. As the Liberal Party speaker outlined, it is uncontroversial and provides beneficial assistance to millions of Australians—the vast majority of whom are in significant need of assistance such as this. But it is important at a time such as this to ensure that we do have some honest debate with regard to the issues we are talking about as we move into the budget. Once we remove the first few sentences of Senator Bernardi’s speech and he got into the rhetorical flourishes and all of the political point-scoring, we see why we have ended up in the economic situation we have today.
We have had this repeat line from the coalition and we have seen it through some of the media about the new government’s plan to ‘axe the lump-sum bonuses’, which is the phrase that Senator Bernardi uses. It is a simple fact that these bonuses are not there to be axed because they were one-off bonuses. The fact that they were one-off bonuses four years in a row shows how dishonest the rhetoric of the previous government became in their desperate search to buy voter blocs with each budget. For four years in a row they trumpeted their wonderful largess and kindness by handing out one-off—that was the term they used repeatedly, budget after budget—lump-sum bonuses.
It is a simple fact—it is there in the budget papers, or more accurately is not there in the budget papers—that this payment is not there to be axed. It was a one-off. It was a one-off last year as well. If the coalition was genuinely concerned about providing ongoing reliable assistance to Australians who needed it, such as carers, they would not have made it a one-off; they would have put it in the budget so that it was definitely there to be relied on by people year after year. This would have been in the interests of good economic management.
We have had all this rhetoric about how wonderful the economic management of the coalition was when they deliberately created this expectation, and we have now seen them fan this expectation that people would be entitled to receive so-called one-off lump-sum bonuses every year, but they did not put it in the budget. So you have got literally billions of dollars of expenditure that is not accounted for but that everybody is expecting to receive, purely because of the former government’s desire to paint themselves as some sort of benevolent hander-out of largess leading up to elections.
People do not want to say this of course, because anybody who stands up and says the lump-sum one-off so-called bonus payments are bad policy immediately gets labelled as uncaring: ‘You want to leave carers in the lurch.’ I do not; the Democrats do not. As I have said repeatedly in this place, if there is one group in the Australian community who deserve all the extra support they can get, it is carers. They relieve the rest of the community of an enormous burden by caring for people in the home. They do need extra support, so I do not begrudge them receiving it. But it is a simple fact that if you make that support an annual drip-feed that is not built in then you are always leaving them vulnerable to that being taken away down the track, whether for legitimate economic budgetary purposes or for political purposes. If the opposition had been genuinely concerned and had cared about ensuring that they got that extra support, they would have locked it into the budget year after year in an ongoing way rather than pull it out of the pocket as an ever increasingly tired trick every year and say, ‘Here is a one-off special for you’, four years in a row.
The other aspect that needs to be explored is whether, when we are wanting to provide extra support to carers, as we need to do and as the Democrats have repeatedly argued, so-called one-off so-called bonus lump-sum payments every year are the best way to provide that support. It is obviously the best way to make a big splash in the media. It is the best way to get people’s attention if they get a nice big bonus, and that is all good to try to get their support come election time. But does it actually provide the best bang for the buck, the taxpayers’ dollar, in providing support that is needed in a way that is going to be of most benefit to carers and is actually going to get best value for money? That apparently does not matter.
That sort of analysis has never been done, and one of the reasons it has never been done is that it has always been presented as a one-off, so-called, even though it has been four years in a row. This is the mess you get into when that sort of bad policy becomes locked in because of the short-term vote-buying desperation of the government of the day. I spoke about this on at least one occasion—I think on two occasions—when the so-called one-off bonuses legislation was being put through. A couple of times legislation to enable these bonuses was even called the one-off bill. The first time, in 2004, it was the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004, to be followed on by the one-off payments to increase assistance for carers and other measures bill the year after. This is the sort of completely misleading language we got.
There are a couple of factors here that need to be emphasised. As I said in the chamber on at least one of these occasions, I am certainly not going to oppose extra support being provided for carers, but I do think it is important to step back from shrill and, frankly, exaggerated and distorted and sometimes dishonest populism. It is not just the coalition engaging in this; some in the media see the opportunity to create one of those controversies that gets lots of attention and gets lots of people concerned, and then they can all pat themselves on the back at the end of the week and say, ‘We stopped the government doing it,’ though it is something it might not have been going to do anyway.
The simple fact is that in many circumstances one-off lump-sum payments are not necessarily the best way to help people. They are particularly not necessarily the best way to assist in circumstances where we are trying to fight inflation. In a circumstance where there is inflation, extra support for pensioners, for carers, is all the more important—they need that extra assistance to help them deal with the consequences of inflation. But doing that by releasing large piles of money all at once does run the risk of having a sudden surge in demand, a sudden flood of money into the economy, and an extra likelihood therefore of a greater flow-on effect to inflation than would otherwise have occurred if it had been provided in a more measured way.
Where is the evidence that says that a one-off lump-sum payment of $1,500 or so is actually going to be best used and be of most benefit for the carer and, even more importantly, for the person who is being cared for, compared with, say, a $50 a fortnight increase spread out over the year with a much smaller lump sum once a year? Where is the research to demonstrate that this is the best way to help people? It has not been done, because that is not what the focus of it is about. The focus of it is about how to make a bigger splash. Here is a constituency, here is a clearly defined demographic: let us throw a big pile of money at them that they will notice and see if we can buy their support. It is that sort of electorally driven policy that created to some extent the poor economic management that we ended up seeing from the former government over a long period of time.
The other point that needs to be made is that bonuses did not just go to carers—and, as I said, if there is one group that needs extra support it is carers. I probably will not avoid misrepresentation because that is the currency of political debate in Australia but, nonetheless, to try to minimise misrepresentation I repeat that I believe extra support should be provided to carers. The fact that the previous government did not value carers enough to lock that extra support into the forward estimates in the budget is a poor reflection on them, but I believe that extra support should continue to be provided for them. I am not convinced that the best way to provide it for them is through one-off, lump-sump payments. I think it is completely appropriate for the new government to re-examine whether or not so-called one-off lump-sum payments, or even permanently entrenched lump-sum payments, is the best way to provide extra support, whether for carers or for anybody else. Let us see some research; let us see some evidence about that being the best way to provide assistance. So I do believe that that extra amount of money should be provided to carers and those they care for, but, on behalf of the Australian taxpayer, I would like to see it spent in a more effective way, a way in which there is better value for money—and, I might say, in a way that might have less of an inflationary impact, which is obviously counterproductive to what others are trying to achieve.
There are also a range of other so-called one-off bonuses, particularly to seniors across the board, that are frankly much less justifiable. The fact that all of us here are scared to say anything about that because we then get slammed with populist rubbish that we are trying to take money away from the mouths of pensioners et cetera means that this sort of bad policy continues. Undoubtedly significant groups in the Australian community who are not in most need have nonetheless received these sorts of one-off lump-sum payments in recent years and, as a broad group, seniors are one of those. Now undoubtedly there are significant groups within aged Australians who are suffering significantly and who need extra support but, in some cases, the support that has been provided has not been targeted towards those who most need it. It has been targeted towards those who are recognised as potentially the most valuable electoral demographic for the coalition.
So let us ensure that we use taxpayers’ funds—whether for carers, for older Australians or for people with disabilities—in a way that actually targets those who have the most need and not just have a grand, big bang, grandiose handout of money, as was famously noted last year, when we even had former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam receiving a bonus payment in the mail from the former government of, I think, $500 in recognition of his contribution to the country as an older Australian. I am sure he has made a great contribution, but it was a bit ironic, particularly given that Mr Whitlam is usually held out as the most economically irresponsible and profligate Prime Minister in history. But the previous government was so desperate to buy votes that they were handing out big cheques to anybody and everybody over a certain age group regardless of their income bracket. That is what we degenerated into, and we need to step back from that now and have a little bit of backbone to resist the populist, and frankly inaccurate, media campaigns that are waged from time to time.
I do not know what is planned by the new government. I certainly will always, whether inside this chamber or outside, continue to criticise them if they do not provide the support that is needed for Australians who are most in need. As I say repeatedly, carers are clearly just about at the top of that list for all sorts of reasons as people who are most in need and merit more and more support. But let us make sure we get value for money out of that and let us at least have a little bit of honest debate. Let us not just have these huge beat-ups months out from budgets that panic everybody in the community and lock governments into ongoing bad policy, which apart from anything else may mean that carers do not get the support in the most effective way possible. It is quite possible that the same amount of money could be spent to far greater effect for carers. For example, some of it could be spent on providing more respite hours, more relief for them; extra resources could be spent towards specific equipment; payments could be targeted towards and, required to be spent on, specific relief for the person being cared for; it could be spent in a whole range of different ways.
They are not one-off payments. Let us make it clear now that they have not been one-off in any real, honest sense of the word. Lump-sum payments are not necessarily the best in many of those cases. Certainly, in some cases—not for carers but in other cases—they have gone to people who frankly have not needed it. That is the circumstance we have got into. We do need to step back from the terrible situation we ended up in, where in some cases we ended up with not just a massive expansion of middle-class welfare; we actually started providing upper-class welfare as well, and we do need to start unpicking that. It does not in any way mean that carers should not get support—and I repeat that—but it does mean that we do need to start unpicking and unwinding some of the irresponsible approaches of the previous government.
Where there is a case for providing more support for a group in the community—and carers are definitely one of those—then let us lock it into the budget and not just do a so-called one-off year after year. If we actually do care about these groups—as I am sure we all do—let us make it reliable for them so they can plan for it and let us make it economically responsible for the country by ensuring that the expenditure is accounted for next year, the year after and the year after, rather than governments having to pull $2 billion extra off the budget at the last minute because of the need to continue to provide so-called one-off payments that are anything but.
It is a perfect example of how, as soon as you provide assistance to any group in the community, as soon as you provide any sort of payment, it immediately becomes seen as an entitlement and as something people should receive in an ongoing capacity. It does not matter whether or not you call it one-off. That makes it hard to withdraw. If there is any time when we should start trying to withdraw it, it should be now.
As I said, I am always going to be critical of whoever is in government when they are not trying to support the people who need it. But if the government are actually taking not only economically responsible but also socially responsible steps to redirect government expenditure towards those who are more in need in the community, then I will support them even if it does mean getting swiped by inaccurate populist rhetoric from some in the media or others in politics who want to falsely accuse me of not caring for the aged or not caring for carers. It is because I do care that I want to see public funds spent more effectively for them.
It is time that we put this debate back on a more honest footing. One of the best ways to do that is to stop using one-off payments and describe them as what they are and account for them as what they should be, which is ongoing payments—hopefully payments that are developed on the basis of research and evidence as providing the best assistance to people who are most in need.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ENHANCED ALLOWANCES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-03-12,"—I rise to speak on the Social Security and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Allowances) Bill 2008. Older Australians are the lifeblood of this nation. Through their hard work, they have built our national prosperity. The Rudd Labor government will ensure that older Australians enjoy that prosperity, which they have helped to create for all of us. The fastest growing group of the Australian population is our older Australians. It is estimated that the number of Australians aged 70 or over will double over the next 20 years. It is for this reason that we must look carefully at the demographics to ensure that they are getting a fair deal. The Labor government, under Kevin Rudd, understands the cost of living pressures faced by older Australians and those on fixed incomes, like disability pensioners and carers. This government also recognises that, although self-funded retirees may be asset rich, many are cash poor. Spiralling petrol prices, food and grocery prices and housing costs mean older Australians, people with disabilities and carers are in real need of increased financial support. This bill will benefit over 1.7 million aged care support recipients, 250,000 Commonwealth seniors health card holders, 700,000 disability support pensioners and 120,000 carer payment recipients.
Firstly, this bill increases the annual rate of the utilities allowance from $107.20 to $500 per household and provides for the allowance to be paid in $125 quarterly instalments, rather than biannually. For the first time, this bill extends qualification for the utilities allowance to people who are under pension age and receiving a disability support pension, carer payment, wife pension, widow B pension or bereavement allowance and to people who are under qualifying age and receiving a service pension or an income support payment. I feel this is an important benefit, and I am sure it will ease the cost of living for seniors in my state of Tasmania. The bill also increases the annual rate of seniors concession allowances from $218 to $500 for eligible self-funded retirees and provides that the seniors concession allowance will be paid quarterly, with the same timing as the utilities allowance. Utilities and seniors concession allowance changes take effect from 20 March 2008. They will be paid every three months in $125 instalments. This means that payment will be made closer to when household bills are due, making household budgeting a little easier.
Lastly, the bill increases the rate of telephone allowance from $88 to $132 for certain income support recipients who have an internet connection at home. The increase will be available to pension age income support recipients, disability support pension and carer payment recipients and self funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth seniors health card. The bill also increases the rate of telephone allowance for all the people who have an internet connection at home and are eligible for a telephone allowance under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act or the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. The Rudd Labor government understands that the internet is a critical means for families to stay in touch with their loved ones. Some Australians on income support pensions and payment can be at risk of becoming isolated from the community. That is why we are helping them stay in touch with their friends, children and grandchildren around the country and around the world via the internet. Affordable home access to the internet has the potential to connect them with the new world of communication and information.
The bill delivers on a key election commitment to help older Australians, people with a disability and carers to help them meet the costs of everyday living. The Rudd Labor government has committed over $4.1 billion to making ends meet. This shows how committed we are to helping our older Australians. The Rudd Labor government is dedicated to ensuring Australians are getting a fair go. For this reason, the government is investigating whether Australians are getting a fair deal at the supermarket. While the Howard-Costello government’s failure to act on 20 Reserve Bank inflation warnings has impacted on prices across Australia, the new Rudd Labor government wants to know if more can be done to ensure we have access to a competitive market for basic food items. Prime Minister Rudd has instructed the ACCC to take a broad approach to its inquiry and ensure that all aspects of the chain are included, from the farm gate to the checkout counter.
There are many in the community who will be relieved with our commitment to help them to make ends meet. I know that certainly in my home state of Tasmania these measures will be of great benefit to those who are eligible. These measures are just another example of how the Rudd Labor government has listened to the community and delivered a positive outcome. The former Howard government had the motto: ‘Whatever it takes, spend, spend, spend. Don’t worry about the economy; don’t worry about the impact on inflation—just keep spending and get yourself elected.’ The Rudd Labor government are showing that we have the good practice of listening and taking economic responsibility for any decisions that we make. I am pleased that the government have introduced these measures at this time, and I commend them to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ENHANCED ALLOWANCES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2008-03-12,"—I rise also to speak today on the Social Security and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Allowances) Bill 2008. This bill honours the Rudd Labor government’s $4 billion election commitment to assist older Australians, people with disabilities and carers—some of the most vulnerable members of our community—to make ends meet. The government understands the increasing financial struggle faced by older Australians, people with disabilities and their carers when it comes to paying the bills and making ends meet. Like many other Australians who have been hit hard with rising petrol and grocery prices and increased interest rates, these people have been doing it tough. But unlike other Australians, many older Australians and those suffering from a disability rely on the support of others, including the government, for financial assistance. The Rudd Labor government recognises this.
Indeed, during the election campaign the Rudd Labor government recognised the need to provide further, sustainable long-term support for those in need, including older Australians, those with disabilities and their carers, as a priority. This is why during the campaign we announced a four-point plan to provide increased financial support to over three million eligible Australians to help them with the struggle of making ends meet. The plan included increasing the utilities allowance to $500, to be paid quarterly rather than biannually; $50 million to establish a national reciprocal public transport entitlement to ensure state government seniors card holders can travel at concessional rates anywhere in Australia; increasing the telephone allowance by 50 per cent, from $88 to $132 a year, to help with the cost of internet connection at home; and establishing a seniors internet fund to provide grants of up to $10,000 for 2,000 eligible community organisations to set up free internet connections for their members.
This bill begins the process of delivering on the government’s commitment in these areas. This bill delivers on our commitment to increase the utilities allowance and telephone allowances for eligible seniors, carers and people with a disability. It does so in several ways. The bill will operate to significantly increase the utilities allowance currently offered to older Australians receiving income support pension payments such as the age pension and veterans’ affairs service pension. This measure will see the current utilities allowance increase from $107.20 to $500, to be paid quarterly to singles and couples combined. This measure alone is set to benefit over 1.7 million aged income support recipients, 250,000 Commonwealth seniors card holders, 700,000 disability support pensioners and 120,000 carer payment recipients. I am sure that this increase, to be paid quarterly, will come as a welcome relief to many of those Australians already eligible to receive the utilities allowance. The Rudd Labor government understands the practicalities of keeping up with incoming bills, which is reflected in the decision to make the payment quarterly rather than biannually in a bid to assist in budgeting for such expenses.
In addition to this increase for those Australians already eligible for the allowance, this bill also extends the qualification criteria for the utilities allowance to cover people under pension or qualifying age and receiving a carer payment, a disability support pension, an invalidity service pension, a partner support pension, an income support supplement, a bereavement allowance, a widow B pension or a wife pension. This extension will ensure that even more Australians in a position of need receive extra moneys to cover their quarterly expenses. The bill also operates to significantly increase the rate of the seniors concession allowance, which is paid to self-funded retirees, from $218 to a total annual payment of $500 for each eligible individual. This will also be paid on a quarterly basis on the same days as the utilities allowance.
Finally, the bill also delivers on another of the government’s election commitments by providing a higher rate of telephone allowance to older Australians, carers and people with a disability if they receive income support and have an internet connection. The rate will be lifted from $88 a year to $132 a year for those that have an internet connection. The higher rate will also be provided to veterans and their dependants that have an internet connection at home.
The government recognises the importance of communication for older Australians and those with a disability to be able to stay in touch with family and friends. Contrary to suggestions by the opposition in the past week, these are not the actions of a government that does not care about older Australians and those most in need. I would suggest quite the opposite: the bill and its contents are the actions of a government that recognises the financial burden on many older Australians and people with disabilities and that is committed to assisting them to make ends meet.
The measures contained in this bill come on top of the Prime Minister’s commitment to guarantee the retention of the one-off bonuses paid to carers and seniors in this year’s budget and future budgets by placing them in the forward estimates, putting an end to unnecessary speculation and uncertainty in this area. This is the action of a government which is committed to establishing long-term financial security and support for the most vulnerable in our community to assist them with the ever-increasing family budget.
Our carers and seniors deserve to be treated with respect, and by making this announcement that is what the Prime Minister has done. The former government never provided certainty and never provided for carers and seniors into the future. The stark fact is that the former government did not have a long-term plan for our carers beyond the budget cycle. The fact that the carers and seniors bonuses were dependent on the economic circumstances of the time and the former government deliberately chose not to include them in the forward estimates is evidence of this.
The Rudd Labor government is committed to bringing to an end the lack of surety and genuine commitment shown toward older Australians, carers and those people with a disability by the opposition while it was in government. By guaranteeing the continuation of this payment as well as the introduction of the contents of this bill, the Rudd Labor government has shown genuine commitment to provide seniors and carers within our community with certainty for the future. It proves that the Rudd Labor government is committed to establishing financial certainty and spending habits to build for a sustainable future.
There are 2.5 million carers in Australia who look after family members or friends with a disability or other chronic condition. The contribution that carers make to our community is not denied by anyone in this chamber. It is estimated that carers save the Australian economy approximately $20 billion annually through unpaid work. We on this side appreciate, as I am sure those on the other side do, the work that seniors and carers do and the invaluable role that they play in our community. What the Rudd Labor government have done to show that we understand the stress and the work that they do is to provide certainty and security where the former government did not. They used the one-off bonuses as some sort of carrot for carers and seniors to beg for each year. This bill, and our commitment to retaining the bonus payment, proves the Rudd Labor government are 100 per cent committed to looking at ways in which to provide our carers and pensioners with greater financial certainty and security into the long term. This bill will see over three million Australians better off, and I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ENHANCED ALLOWANCES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-03-12,"—in reply—I wish to thank the speakers who have participated in the debate on this bill. I note that there was a very positive contribution by all and I appreciate that. I particularly think that Senator Bartlett’s comments in this current debate were well made. There does need to be a sense of context and perspective about all this, and we need much more longer term certainty for pensioners and carers because they play such a vital role in our community. They need to be able to plan. It is hard enough to plan when you are on a good income but, when you are on a very low income, it must be extraordinarily difficult to plan for meeting everyday expenses. I know from my experiences in dealing with carers that they have enormous stress in their lives as it is, and they could certainly do without the sort of financial stress they are under. Certainly, part of that is to improve their conditions. I think the other part is to ensure that they have a bit more certainty about their income, as many of them live in very trying circumstances. In any event, I thank senators for their contribution to the debate.

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2008-03-12,"—Today, I want to respond to an article in today’s Australian Financial Review by Alan Mitchell, the economics editor. The article makes the case that Labor Party policy seems to be heading towards the development of physical industry clusters. I do not know what the minister is thinking but, as the minister has established an inquiry into innovation and other inquiries, I think that the minister has an open mind on this as well. Having had a close association with the northern suburbs of Adelaide, which have a strong manufacturing focus and indeed account for something like 70 per cent of South Australian manufacturing output, I have taken a close interest in manufacturing in particular but industry policy in general.
I would like to take issue with Mr Mitchell on a couple of aspects of his criticism of cluster development. Cluster development is not only as he describes it. He talks about Silicon Glen in Scotland being formed to try to match Silicon Valley in California in the United States and indeed refers to the multifunction polis, which was a project, now defunct, that was mooted in Adelaide some decades ago. What I have taken a close interest in is a cluster strategy which does not require that companies be physically located together and for which there is no government funding put into building real estate, as he puts it, where companies can collocate. Rather, what has been particularly successful—in pilot form—in the northern suburbs of Adelaide has been the development of a cluster strategy whereby a number of companies are identified that could be brought together to form a knowledge intensive base which could be used to improve each other’s practices, technology and knowledge and that could often jointly bid for contracts, either domestically or overseas. The synergies invoked by this kind of cluster development have the ability to greatly improve the outcomes for those industries.
I have a close interest in the manufacturing industry and today I want to talk about a success story that has resulted from a cluster strategy that was developed in the northern suburbs through the sponsorship of Playford council and the work of Mr Rodin Genoff, who was a driving force behind this innovative network. The company is Priority Engineering Services. It was founded in 1984 with just three employees. After some expansion, the company moved to the city of Playford and in 1995 they began to export their core range product of metal stamping plant equipment to the Asia-Pacific region, leading to the establishment of a Malaysian office one year later.
The company has gone from strength to strength as a result of its involvement with several other companies in the Elizabeth West Innovation Network. The culmination of that was in 2005 when it launched Australia’s first industry based robotics training centre, which was developed as a result of a joint venture with a leading UK automotive production control system supplier. This centre enables local companies to work with state-of-the-art technology, leading to new applications in factory automation. This joint venture eventually led to the creation of the Beyond Automation consortium. This consortium includes Malaysian robotics experts, a Malaysian financier and a global German engineering and automation firm. Between them, the partners provide know-how, capital and market position, especially in regard to access to Chinese markets.
This is the kind of thing that I would like to see happen. I am not looking to the past to the old type cluster developments. I recognise that we cannot artificially reproduce Silicon Valley type clusters. But, where we have such a strong a basis of a manufacturing industry as we do in South Australia and many small and medium enterprises that by themselves do not have the ability to take up new technology or to develop export regions, then it is entirely appropriate for governments to facilitate those companies being able to skill up their own employees and build their company knowledge and their ability to export. Indeed, I do not see where Australia can go without that kind of approach; without looking to the future for advanced manufacturing, a niche that Australia can fill. I am very proud of the way the northern suburbs of Adelaide have coped with the downturn in the manufacturing industry. I am very proud of how many small and medium enterprises have developed their own innovative technologies. Very often, they need a bit of extra assistance to cope with marketing and the dissemination of their marketing materials to fertile markets—and particularly to fertile export markets. This is where governments can come in and with a small amount of money assist companies like Priority Engineering to develop and enhance their skills.
I have only recently met with directors and staff of Priority Engineering. It is very exciting to be with them because they are very proud of their company, very proud of what they have achieved in a relatively short amount of time, and very proud of their product. Naturally, any company is happy to have a government subsidy, but they are proud to be using it in a very effective way to enable South Australia to continue to be a strong player in manufacturing industries. We all recognise that where there is cheaper labour and fewer rules and regulations, including environmental regulations, then we will not be able to compete in a number of areas of cheap, mass-manufactured goods, but we can still turn our innovation and ability into something that will continue to drive strong manufacturing exports.
In South Australia employment in the manufacturing sector is continuing to fall. I am not a believer in artificially propping up that industry. Subsidies such as tariffs and the multifunction polis type of strategy are strategies of the past and I do not want to revisit them. But that does not mean we should abandon an entire industry and that we should walk away from manufacturing. We have to look at innovative ways to address some support for industry without providing artificial supports such that, if they are withdrawn, the industry would collapse. I want to talk later in a little more detail, if I get the opportunity, about Mitsubishi, because in South Australia in some senses the manufacturing industry—the motor industry and the whitegoods and appliance industries—was formed on that kind of artificial subsidy, particularly tariffs.
I do not think too many people in South Australia are great believers in that kind of subsidy, particularly having been given the example of the multifunction polis, which did not even get off the ground. The manufacturing industry is still very important to South Australia, and there are manufacturing industries that are growing—in particular, structural metal product manufacturing, with a small average annual growth rate of two per cent; fabricated metal product manufacturing, with an average annual growth rate of 2.9 per cent; and electronic equipment manufacturing with an average annual growth rate of 5.7 per cent.
Those are the kinds of companies that are naturally clustered around the northern suburbs of Adelaide and I see it as a logical conclusion that we use the accident of that geographical clustering to create a kind of strategic clustering. People such as Mr Rodin Genoff have the intellectual ability and also the energy and enthusiasm to drive that. Mr Genoff was employed by Playford City Council, and I should congratulate local government in the northern suburbs for encouraging and supporting that innovative work. This all happened at a time when the former federal government provided very little support in terms of sustainable regions funding or any other funding to advance the work that was being done by local government. So I certainly congratulate local government in the northern suburbs for the work that they did nevertheless in promoting the manufacturing centre. Mr Genoff is now doing a consultancy for the European Union in Denmark. He has seen similar opportunities in those European countries.
In Australia we must always run to keep up in the manufacturing sector. We cannot continue to rely on raw exports of minerals or agricultural products, even though I recognise that those industries, although they are primary industries, do generate a reasonable level of technology and services which are extremely beneficial to our country and to my state of South Australia in particular.
In conclusion, I suppose I half agree with Alan Mitchell but I disagree with his view of what constitutes clusters. He says in his final paragraph:
Perhaps like me, you can feel an official cluster coming on. In which case, just remember Silicon Glen.
That was a cluster that was developed in Scotland. I would say to Mr Mitchell, who is a very respected economics editor, that the clusters we are looking at are of the future and will not require the type of heavy government subsidy which, if withdrawn, creates problems.
Again in South Australia, we had a recent example of that, when a Liberal state government encouraged a number of companies to come in, with significant subsidies in terms of providing real estate and buildings and all kinds of rent relief and free land and so on. When that continuing subsidy was pulled back, initially by the Olsen Liberal government, those companies lost their commitment to South Australia. Many of us—I was in the South Australian parliament at the time—learnt a very hard lesson then: that artificial subsidies are not the way to go and that we must work with industries which are embedded in the area or embedded in the state and which are keen to proceed. To me, the strategic cluster theory seems to be the way to go, and I look forward to the development of a pilot project in the northern suburbs, as was announced during the election campaign by the Rudd team.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Industry Policy</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1,speech

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-03-12,"—I thank Senator Scullion for the question, although I do not think it does him much credit.
—That’s outrageous!
—I do not know of any senator in this place, Senator Abetz, including you, who supports child abuse or is not committed to fighting child abuse with every measure available to federal government. I think an attempt to score some sort of political point by trying to make some sort of allegation that Senator Crossin is not committed to the fight against child abuse, as I say, does you no credit. Senator Crossin has had a long interest not only in Indigenous affairs but in children’s services, and she has followed those interests throughout her career in the Senate.
What you do know, Senator Scullion, and what the Senate knows is that there was bipartisan support for the Northern Territory intervention. The Labor side of politics, prior to the last election, offered bipartisan support to the then Howard government immediately it came up with its plan to intervene in the Northern Territory to try and combat child abuse. We offered total bipartisan support immediately and we supported you through all the measures aimed at intervening.
Senator Crossin has been part of that Labor commitment to combat child abuse in the Northern Territory, and when we took government we continued that plan. There have been a couple of minor adjustments, but in large part the intervention has proceeded along the same lines. To come into this Senate and somehow try to take one part of one comment that the senator may or may not have made—I have not actually seen the comments that you refer to, and I would like to see them before I pass any judgement on the veracity of what you have said—I think does the opposition no credit.
What we have seen in the last few days is the Liberal opposition in the Senate take the low road. We saw it yesterday with Senator Ronaldson. He made accusations in this place that the Liberal Party were not prepared to make in the House of Representatives. That is the amount of bottle they had—they were not prepared to carry their allegations against a Labor member of the House of Representatives there. They did not have the bottle.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the Government’s embarrassing discourse at the moment shows that he is unable to answer the particular allegation put to him. The point of order is clearly on relevance. The relevance is what Senator Crossin said so disgracefully yesterday. What Senator Ronaldson may have asked yesterday—which was a very good question, might I add—is completely irrelevant.
—Order! Senator Abetz, you are starting to debate the point of order. You made your point about relevance. The question was broad and I believe that the minister is within his rights in answering the question in the manner that he sees fit.
—I note the only embarrassment to this chamber is the behaviour of some of those Liberal senators as they become accustomed to opposition.
—I would like you to come back to the question, Senator Evans.

—Order! Senator Evans, you will answer the question and not comment on other matters.
—Thank you, Mr President. As I say, I do not think this is a very constructive road for the senator to go down. As I say, Senator Crossin has a long commitment to Indigenous people in the Northern Territory and to children in the Northern Territory and works extremely hard at promoting their interests. I think to come into the chamber and allege that somehow she is not serious about tackling child abuse does Senator Scullion no credit. I know Senator Crossin participated in the petrol sniffing inquiry and in a whole range of inquiries looking at protecting and enhancing the opportunities for Indigenous children. The Labor government has committed to a whole range of initiatives, including early intervention initiatives and preschool intervention, to provide better opportunities and protections for Indigenous children. We will continue the Northern Territory intervention. We will continue the commitment to assisting Indigenous children.

One of the things that the Labor government has committed to is a review, 12 months after the intervention, to assess the evidence. I was one of those at the estimates hearing—Senator Scullion, I do not know whether you were there—when people in charge of the intervention talked about their attempt to build better evidence of what is occurring on the ground: the amount of sexual abuse, who is being abused and how we combat those things. They are important public policy issues, and I think to take us down this road is really quite disgraceful. The Northern Territory intervention is committed to by the Labor government.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2008-03-12,"—Thank you, Senator Sterle, for the question. Australia does face a number of long-term challenges on both the international and domestic fronts. This is a time of an uncertain international environment and that has resulted from a sharp downturn in the US housing market associated with what is commonly described as the subprime mortgage situation, which in turn has impacted on financial markets. We have seen that evidenced not just in Australia but also worldwide with the market volatility of recent times. The events of recent months have shown that Australia is not immune from such turbulence as has occurred in the United States. The Rudd Labor government remains alert to the impact of global credit market conditions on the Australian economy—
—That’s a relief.
—and I will have some more to say, Senator Kemp, in detail about these associated issues in the coming months. There is an increasingly difficult global economic set of conditions that reinforce the Rudd Labor government’s determination to modernise our economy.
We also face strong domestic demand in our economy. We are facing capacity constraints, in large part because of the neglect of the former Liberal government, in areas such as infrastructure, education and training. Because of that neglect we are experiencing significant inflationary pressures. Inflation is our most pressing domestic challenge. The simple reality for those opposite is that they failed to appreciate the seriousness of the situation when they were in government. For the months of October, November and December underlying inflation for the year was running at 3.6 per cent. That is the highest in 16 years and well above the Reserve Bank’s band on which it is required to take action. We have seen an extended period of increase in underlying inflation and the new Rudd Labor government is not going to ignore this, unlike the now opposition who simply ignored 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia on inflation. We do know that higher inflation leads to upward pressure on interest rates. This hurts hard-working Australian families, it erodes living standards, it harms business and it threatens future growth and job creation.
Unfortunately, as I have already indicated, our predecessors lacked the foresight to deal with issues around infrastructure, education and training. I note that Senator Minchin, the new Liberal leader in the Senate and former Minister for Finance and Administration, has to bear some responsibility for the lack of fiscal discipline that was applied by the former Liberal government, particularly in the last year as it disintegrated.

Senator Minchin interjecting—

Government senators interjecting—
—Order! Order on my right.
—Although I was about to say it is difficult, I would not attribute all the blame to Senator Minchin, the former finance minister, because he did face a particularly challenging job with the level of disunity in that last year of the Liberal government. That disunity of course has continued. It seems to be that treasurers—in this case Mr Turnbull, the shadow Treasurer—always have their eye on the top job, which makes—
—Order! Senator Sherry, I would draw your attention to the question.
—it particularly difficult for finance ministers to do their job in an atmosphere of general collapse of discipline and disunity, which we continue to see amongst the Liberal Party now in opposition. So the Labor Party intends to be fiscally disciplined. We intend to increase the budget surplus from one per cent of gross domestic product to 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product. We quite proudly boasted in the run-up to the last election, and we continue to quite proudly boast, that we are fiscal conservatives. (Time expired)

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2008-03-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Scullion today, relating to the Northern Territory intervention and comments made by Senator Crossin during the debate on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General’s opening speech on 11 March 2008.
I asked quite a simple question of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in the Senate today. I simply asked him to repudiate the outrageous remarks of Labor’s Senator Crossin. It was a very simple question. It may have even gone to an error. She was a little bit excited with the hubris of winning the election and may have made an error, I am not sure. The context of this particular remark does need some sort of explanation. She said:
So the dramas and charades and the attention that was sought by the previous government in relation to child sexual abuse and child neglect, I believe, were seriously overstated.
Well, that can be a belief—I do not have too much of a problem with that—but I think she is sadly mistaken. I am not denying that is there, but when you have only 50 that statement clearly diminishes. Whether it was accidental or not, I hope that Senator Crossin takes the opportunity in this place to correct the record.
In the answer given by Senator Evans, he indicated that we have a completely bipartisan approach in these matters and that I should simply just get on the program. Labor, of course, completely supports the intervention! With respect, I understand that that was with a couple of particular points that they made, and they made those through the election. But basically they would completely support the intervention. I have to say that, during the election campaign, I met a considerable number of intervention sceptics. In fact, pretty much wherever I went I found people—
—I didn’t meet too many who voted for you, Nigel.
—We have more interjections from Senator Crossin. She says—and I quote again:
And I think that the resounding results at the polling booths in the Northern Territory show that. Aboriginal people clearly rejected the methods of the intervention.
I can assure you that not all of Labor believes that they have a bipartisan approach to the intervention. I can tell you that. We have a very serious sceptic in Senator Crossin. I have to say that it seems that, wherever I went in the Northern Territory, she was quite right. There were people saying, ‘Down with Broughie; out with Howard; I’m not going to vote for them,’ because they had been told that a vote for Labor meant a vote against the intervention, make no bones about it. It happened everywhere I went. We make no bones about it; there was not a great deal of support for the intervention in those communities. Labor promised that they would unwind the intervention if they supported Labor. So we have very much a watching brief. We will watch this phase to see whether the rhetoric actually follows the actions.
Of course, in the speech yesterday there was continual gloating about the election win and about the fact that Labor won the vote because they did not support the intervention. That is not a bipartisan approach. In this place Labor has said, ‘We have an absolute bipartisan approach.’ But I can tell you that, out there on the ground, there was nothing like a bipartisan approach. Individuals came to me and said, ‘Well, I’m not voting for you, Nigel, because there is too much change at once,’ and that may have been the case. Individuals were very confused; it was very difficult. They were saying, ‘Labor has said they’re not going to support the intervention so we’re supporting them.’ They are the facts of the matter as I saw it.
In terms of the previous government’s actions, we were never about winning votes in Indigenous communities. It was an act of leadership, a pact of leadership. It was a pact that came from this place because we had bipartisan support. Now, those individuals in the previous government—and I was one of them—were quite proud of the movement of the intervention, because I think it will make a great deal of difference. Senator Crossin bagged the Little children are sacred report. I certainly do not think that she has any support for the outcomes of that. That report was commissioned by the Northern Territory government, and the report was the basis of evidence taken by individual people in communities.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I think I just heard Senator Scullion say that I had ‘bagged’ the Little children are sacred report. My point of order is that Senator Scullion ought to be accurate in his comments and perhaps provide some quotes as to where that is the case, because that is certainly not the case, and never has been the case.
—There is no point of order.
—There is no point in Senator Crossin being in denial about the intervention, and in being in denial about what she said yesterday. It is quite clear—and I will send around the Hansard; I cannot quote for her now—where she says, ‘I will be publicly calling for some more work to be done on the statistics’, which is clearly—(Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2008-03-12,"—I rise to provide some comments on the pathetic and sad contribution by Senator Scullion today. In taking note of answers to questions—I actually thought that was what we did in this chamber—I thought that the opposition’s time in this half-hour was to make comment about answers to questions provided by senators, not to have a personal attack on members of the backbench, or to comment on speeches that had been made the day before. The comments Senator Scullion referred to are in my address-in-reply speech. If the coalition in this chamber are grappling so desperately with what it is like to be in opposition, well, so be it. If these are the tactics they want to endorse, let’s go for it. I am happy to stand here hour after hour and debate what is happening at the moment in the Northern Territory in relation to the intervention. What you cannot accept, Senator Scullion, and your party cannot accept—
—Senator Crossin, your remarks should be addressed through the chair.
—is that, in the Northern Territory seat of Lingiari, we obtained a 52 per cent endorsement for the Labor Party and its policies at the last election. Your vote plummeted to 35 per cent. So I say to you, Senator Scullion, ‘Get over it, and move on.’ There was a resounding endorsement for the Labor Party and its policies at the last election. At the Yirrkala booth, 292 voters to four; at Galiwinku—where your minister had flown in and out of that community day after day—they were lined up 50 deep, hour after hour. You were there and witnessed—
—Senator Crossin, your remarks are to the chair.
—hour after hour, people lining up, hundreds at a time. When handed CLP ‘how to vote’ cards, what did they do? They threw them on the ground. Why did they support us? They supported us because we said we would change the intervention. There were aspects of the intervention we took to the election. We said that we would retain CDEP—and we have done that. We said we would look at the permit system—and we are doing that, although I read today that you cannot cop that. You are going to block that legislation, despite that fact that Indigenous people in the Territory voted to change the permit system back to the way it was. We put a set of policies to Indigenous people in the Northern Territory, and they were endorsed.
What did I say yesterday? You are so poor at doing your research for question time that you just cannot deliver the blow, can you? My comments yesterday were quoted from the estimates transcript—from Lesley Podesta, who is the head of OATSI. Senator Adams asked Ms Podesta how many people had had the health checks. Nearly 6,000. How many of those had been referred to Family and Community Services? The answer was 50. Why have they been referred to Northern Territory FACS? In the Northern Territory, there is a range of issues. We do not break it down. Is it child sexual abuse? Maybe. But generally, Ms Podesta said, it was to find alternative care or because there were problems within the family unit.
Therefore, you have to say to yourself, the Howard government intervened in the lives of Indigenous people in the Northern Territory in such an abrasive and drastic manner on the basis of the Little children are sacred report. Research shows you and evidence shows you that, to date, that may not have been, and probably is not, the case. It was never the case. The intervention was there for political reasons, but we supported it because people in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory do need the support; they do need this commitment; they do need assistance to have more houses, to have more children checked; to have in those communities the massive injections of funds that you so sadly neglected in your 11 long years in government.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Indigenous Communities</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,11,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2008-03-12,"—Senator Crossin spoke about estimates. We had a very good discussion on the Northern Territory intervention at estimates. I believe that the intervention team has consulted very well. The health checks have surely helped Northern Territory people and the children in these communities. In their update of 7 March 2008, the intervention team states that 65 remote communities have had child health checks undertaken. Eleven town camp regions have been visited by the child health check teams. Surely, this is all about consultation. As at 5 March 2008, there have been 7,622 Northern Territory child health checks completed, and a total number of child health checks—including medical benefits scheme checks—of approximately 9,300. This must be helping. There are seven child health check teams deployed, and the child health checks are being performed by local Aboriginal medical services in various regions.
We also have the general business managers in there helping the communities. As of this month, there are 52 general business managers employed. When all of them are employed, 72 communities will be serviced by a general business manager. This must help the population, including the children. With regard to welfare reform, there are currently 26 community employment brokers in place providing services to 45 communities. Income management is in place in 25 communities and associated outstations in four town camp regions. Six thousand, five hundred and forty-three people are currently being income managed. This must be an improvement for those families and for those children who have gone without. There are a total of 28 community stores licensed, with 20 stores operating under store-specific licences and eight stores operating under one Outback Stores corporate licence. A total of 636 Australian government jobs have been created to date. This is very good news and I believe consultation has helped to achieve this. We have a new police presence in 18 communities, and there are currently 35 new interstate and 18 new Northern Territory police deployed. There are also the community clean-ups. The clean-up program has commenced in 40 remote communities. One thousand, six hundred and sixteen properties have been surveyed and made safe, and 351 minor repairs have been completed. There are currently 32 project management and trade contractor teams engaged under the community clean-up program. In consultation, Northern Territory towns are really being looked after.
Through you, Mr Deputy President, I do have a concern about the permit system being reinstated. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, said that restoring the system was important because it helped keep grog smugglers and paedophiles out of remote Indigenous communities. Well, they were there when the permit system was in use. Surely the system that we as a government had in place would have opened up the community so that other people could come in and ensure that these practices did not continue. I feel the permit system did not protect Indigenous communities, so why go back to it? Also, the ban on pay TV porn in remote Indigenous communities should not be voluntary, as Labor’s legislation intended. According to the Little children are sacred report, pay TV porn was readily accessed by kids and was a significant part of grooming kids for sexual activity. In conclusion, I do believe that we are going forwards and not backwards and I commend all those involved with the Northern Territory intervention team.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Indigenous Communities</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,11,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2008-03-12,"—How interesting that in its first 100 days the government finds itself facing questions in question time from opposition senators making up stories about Senator Crossin’s quotes. To me, it is sad evidence that the opposition, the coalition, are now trying to reconstitute this issue in a way that is divisive. I find it quite hard to believe that in the current circumstances, where we have a commitment from the coalition in opposition to work with us on the development of policy for our Indigenous people, we have such a tardy and shallow effort here in the chamber today to use the plight of many Indigenous children in such a divisive way, particularly evoking comments by Senator Crossin which, if taken in context, are entirely correct in her analysis and her contribution to this important debate.
I think it is important to note the progress that the Rudd Labor government has made with respect to Indigenous Australia. In its first 100 days, the Rudd Labor government has many, many things to be proud of, not least being the delivery on behalf of the Australian parliament of a national apology to Indigenous people, particularly the stolen generations. We have also announced—and this is a very critical point for Senator Scullion to take note of—the proposed establishment of a joint policy commission, to be chaired by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, to develop remote Indigenous housing solutions.
Another initiative is the establishment of the Indigenous Australian Early Development Index, which will enable assessment of key aspects of children’s early development essential to their readiness for learning at school. Legislation introduced to the parliament on 14 February will target improvements to Indigenous education, including a commitment to an additional 200 teachers in the Northern Territory and funding for an additional 18 classrooms. There will be an additional $49.3 million for substance and alcohol rehabilitation and treatment services for Indigenous communities, particularly in remote areas—and so on.
What we have from the opposition, unfortunately, is a very tacky ploy today to once again introduce the politics of division, of the wedge, on this critical issue. I thought we were past that. I do recall Dr Nelson saying on the day of the apology that the opposition was past that. Sadly, the senators representing the opposition in this place did not get that message. To take up another point raised by the opposition in this taking note debate: there were differences in the Labor Party position on the Northern Territory Indigenous intervention leading up to the election. I find it quite astounding and misleading that Senator Scullion would say in this place that somehow there had been a change in our position. We had key differences. We did say we would retain CDEP, we did say we would look at the permit system—and we note that the coalition is going to oppose that legislation that has now been introduced—and we did say we were going to review it after one year. They are all legitimate issues, no doubt voted on by Northern Territory voters with the intervention issue on their minds. I say to my colleagues in the Senate: this is not an issue for tacky division to be played out. We are past that. It is the obligation of any senator in this place to approach this very challenging and critically important issue with due gravitas, considering the bipartisan nature of the challenge that now sits before us all.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Indigenous Communities</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,11,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-03-12,"—To take up the last point made by Senator Lundy, I agree that tacky divisions, as Senator Lundy put it, need to be avoided if we are to proceed on a bipartisan basis to address the problems of disadvantage and child sexual abuse in the Northern Territory. But what is obvious from the remarks that have been made today in the chamber by Senator Crossin, yesterday in the chamber by Senator Crossin and previously on the public record by Senator Crossin is that there are obviously divisions within the Australian Labor Party about exactly what the Northern Territory intervention actually represents.
Let us be perfectly clear: there are widely divergent views within the Labor government about just what this intervention is all about and, indeed, about whether the intervention itself is a good thing. We can see that plainly on the record from what Senator Crossin has had to say. I quote the words that she has used—this is not making up what she has had to say; this what she actually said:
... the dramas and the charades and the attention that was sought by the previous government in relation to child sexual abuse and child neglect, I believe, were severely overstated.
She thinks that our concern about child sexual abuse and child neglect in the Northern Territory was overstated. What does Minister Macklin think about it? On 16 June last year, just after the Little children are sacred report was tabled, she had this to say:
I don’t think anyone knew just how serious it was. What’s so important about this report is that it really has lifted the lid on just how horrific the levels of child abuse are. If there is one good thing that has come out of this report, it really does expose the dreadful level of child abuse that’s taking place.
Which is the Labor Party’s view? Is it the view of Minister Macklin or the view of Senator Crossin? These are not, under any reasonable reading, consistent views about the basis for the Northern Territory intervention.
The fact is that there is a subterranean view within the Labor Party, which occasionally comes to the surface in comments like those made by Senator Crossin yesterday and again today, that fundamentally rejects the basis on which the Northern Territory intervention has been mounted. The fact is that there are some in the government who would like—right now—to backslide on the intervention, who would cheerfully trash the entire exercise if they could. And what Senator Crossin had to say were not just the remarks of a single senator. They were the remarks of a senator who represents a vein of opinion within the government which needs to be, with great respect, understood and, if that view is going to prevail, that needs to be indicated now.
I want there to be bipartisan support for the policies of intervention which the previous government put in place. But I also think that the opposition and the government and all of their members need to commit in totality to what it is that was proposed and executed in that intervention. And it means the kinds of comments that Senator Crossin has made in this place, which, frankly, severely undermine the very basis for the intervention, need to be repudiated by the chamber itself and particularly by the leadership of the government. What Senator Evans had to say in the chamber today was to reaffirm that the government believes in the Northern Territory intervention and the basis for it. I welcome those comments, but I ask Senator Evans and the leadership of the government to indicate clearly whether that is the view of the government as a whole.
Senator Crossin made this remark yesterday:
Aboriginal people clearly rejected the methods of the intervention.
In doing so she drew attention to the vote by Indigenous people against the coalition in the federal election. The question raised by that remark is: if she thinks that Aboriginal people rejected the methods of intervention, does she reject the methods of intervention as well? I do not think there is any doubt that she did, that she does and that others in the Labor Party do.
We are entitled to know whether those views are minority views which are not representative of the government or whether they represent what is going to change the policy of this government as this intervention is rolled out. That is my fear—that we are seeing here the signalling of a change in government policy as this intervention proceeds. And we need to know now whether that is actually going to be the case or whether this is simply the wild and inaccurate remark of a single senator, made in haste and repented at leisure.

SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE


Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill:


Poker Machine Harm Reduction Tax (Administration) Bill 2008


Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration


Poker machines are a major community concern in Australia today. Family First’s Poker Machine Harm Reduction Tax (Administration) Bill 2008 would introduce a new federal tax on poker machines in pubs and clubs to push pokies out of these community venues and restrict them to casinos and racetracks, which are dedicated gambling venues.


Poker machines are no good for families:

About 293,000 people have a significant gambling problem in Australia and about 85% of problem gamblers use poker machines;
About 52% of problem gamblers said they had borrowed money and not paid it back, 36% said they had sold property to raise money to bet and 43% said they sometimes went without food to pay for their addiction. One in four suffered divorce or separation and one in 10 had seriously contemplated suicide;
On average around seven other people are affected by a severe problem gambler’s behaviour. That’s around 2 million Australians;
More than 50% of regular poker machine users are problem gamblers or at risk of becoming problem gamblers.

The National Market Driven Energy Efficiency Target Bill 2007 is a private Senator’s bill which was referred to the committee on 16 August 2007 for report by 22 October 2007. Nine submissions were received, however no hearings were conducted.


The committee sought and received an extension of time from the Senate on 17 September 2007 to report on these bills by the last day of the 41st Parliament, 11 February 2008. However, the intervening federal election prevented the committee from further examining the bills.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-03-12,"—I seek leave to make a statement in relation to the notice of motion by Senators Allison and Ronaldson on the sexualisation of children in the media.
Leave granted.
—I want to put on the record the government’s position in relation to the motion moved by Senator Allison and amendments that the government moved. The government takes community concerns about sexualised images of children in the media seriously. The use of sexualised images of children in magazines, retail catalogues, advertising brochures and the electronic media is a source of concern to many Australians.
Last year the Senate passed a resolution calling for the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, to report on this issue. The scope of ACMA’s statutory functions are not, however, broad enough for it to address the full breadth of the issue of sexualisation of children. For example, content in the print media and consumer retail catalogues falls clearly outside the scope of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and outside ACMA’s responsibilities.
The government supports the proposed establishment of a Senate inquiry into the sexualisation of children to ensure that the issues for all types of media are appropriately addressed. However, the government has some concerns about elements of the proposed terms of reference in this motion before us today for referral of this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts. It is the government’s view that the inclusion of radio in the terms of reference for the inquiry is inappropriate and unnecessary. The majority of community concerns relate to the use of visual images considered to present children in a sexualised manner. This inquiry should concentrate on what needs to be done to protect children in relation to inappropriate visual images.
The government also questions the relevance of including an examination of the sources and beneficiaries of premature sexualisation of children in the media. It is not clear what this is intended to achieve. As I have said, the concern is about the impact of the use of sexualised images on children and the possible impact on their health and wellbeing.
The government also has concerns about the inclusion of specific references to the commercial broadcasting industry codes of practice. As I noted in my opening remarks, the use of sexualised images of children in printed material has been of particular concern, and this type of content is not subject to these codes. Additionally, proposing possible changes to media regulation from the outset may unintentionally limit the scope of the Senate inquiry. It is also the case that advertising, including on television, is subject to specific advertising industry self-regulatory codes of practice which are overseen by the Advertising Standards Bureau.
In conclusion, while the government supports an inquiry into this matter, we have suggested a number of changes to the terms of reference which in our view will make the inquiry more focused and productive.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications and the Arts</title>",Miscellaneous,24,1,speech

Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The Australia many of us grew up in can seem like a different place to the one that exists today.
The pressures of increasing costs of living and too little time are the driving force in working Australian’s lives.  The ways Australians work, live and plan for the future have radically changed.  Australians are working harder than ever but they have been seeing little return for their toll.  There is less and less time for the things that make us Australian – community, family, friendship – as working Australians are caught up in a constant cycle of financial stress and work and family strain.
One of the harsher aspects of these changes relates to the place of children.  Children - Australia’s most precious asset and the light that brightens us so much - are increasingly seen as a burden.  Children are increasingly being viewed as carrying an impossible level of responsibility and compromise for parents.
Working families are choosing not to have children because they believe the obligations of children exceed their capacity to meet those obligations.
The birth rate dropped from 3.5 babies per woman in the early 1960s to 1.84 a decade ago. It has increased a little to 1.86  babies per woman in 2006.
Research published just last month from the Australian Institute of Family Studies  reveals that the ongoing pressures on working families are preventing many women from having children.
Australian families are not having babies.  Not because they don’t want to, but because they don’t have the confidence.  They don’t believe that social and labour systems will support them if they do have another baby.
The Fertility and Family Policy in Australia study reveals that fertility rates are at close to the lowest ever in Australia and are below the level required for population replacement.
This is not news of course.  Everyone in this house knows that Australia has a fertility problem.  And they’re aware of the potentially damaging long-term economic and social consequences.  Australia’s falling fertility rate is a massive challenge that has been facing Australia for years.  The former government became aware of the issue and that is why we saw a flurry of reports ,and were subjected to the repeated battle cry that ‘demography was destiny’ from the former Treasurer.
However, for all the chest-thumping, it seems that the former Government fundamentally mis-understood the basis of the policy challenge before them.
Measures like the Baby Bonus provide some financial support to help with the initial costs of having a baby but are not enough for effectively tacking low fertility rates.
What the Fertility and Family Policy in Australia study reveals is that most of the people surveyed actually want to have more children. Very few considered no children or one child their ideal number of children.
Their decision to not have children was also influenced by other factors including difficulties in accessing childcare, job insecurity and the cost of housing.
But even in economic good times, couples lacked confidence in their ability to create and maintain a family environment which provides emotional and financial support for children.
Working families want to have more children.  They just don’t have confidence in their ability to cope.
What this shows is that old-style policies and the old way of doing things have not worked.  Old style policies and the old way of doing things have created a baby-intolerant society. 
We have to design policy settings that make having children possible.  Working families are crying out for better support during life transitions so that they have the confidence to have more children, if that’s what they want.
Old-style polices have not worked.  Support systems need to address the realities of modern Australian life.  We need fresh ideas and perspectives on how to tackle this problem. 
This Government isn’t afraid of testing new ideas; or exploring new options for addressing hard challenges.
We are committed to building a modern Australia to meet the challenges of the future.  Key to this is ensuring a child-centred approach to family policy.  The best interests of children must be at the very centre of social and family support policy.
That’s why we have been hard at work implementing our election commitments and ensuring that children are at the centre of Australia’s family and income support system.
That’s why the Deputy Prime Minster, Treasurer and I have asked the Productivity Commission to examine ways the Government can provide improved support to parents with newborn children.
Any policy reforms in this area will be aimed at ensuring strong and sustainable economic growth, take into account our ageing population and the importance of early childhood development, and support Australian families balance work and family responsibilities.
We want to explore ways to make it as easy as possible for working mums and dads to balance their employment with the important job of raising a new generation of Australians.
The Productivity Commission is uniquely placed to advise the Government on the best way to balance economic considerations with the aspirations of working families.
The Productivity Commission will be asked to look at the economic and social costs and benefits of paid maternity, paternity and parental leave.
We know that fertility issues do not start and end with paid maternity or paternity leave.  There is no one-size solution and no magic bullet. Working families need a range of options to suit their needs.
The Commission will conduct a thorough examination of these issues and provide an opportunity for public participation. The Commission will be asked to report by February 2009. Public hearings will be held and submissions from the public will also be sought, with a report produced for the Government to release publicly.
The findings of the Inquiry will feed into the Government’s plan to build a modern Australia. 
Family support must be geared to the best interests of children and stronger families. The Government is hard at work implementing our commitments and testing ideas for making sure that occurs.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Fertility Policy</title>,Ministerial Statements,26,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-03-12,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I thank the Senate for its indulgence. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Jenny Macklin, has released a fertility policy statement today in which she refers to how Australians are working harder than ever but are seeing little return for their toil. She has referred to children as being increasingly seen as a burden. I quote: ‘Children are increasingly being viewed as carrying an impossible level of responsibility and compromise for parents.’ As a parent, I have some disagreement with this particular statement and a number of others that are in this document. Children are undoubtedly an obligation, but they should never be referred to as a burden. They are an obligation in which parents rejoice; parents rejoice in their ability to help foster and nurture the development of our future generations.
I understand that Minister Macklin has made these comments in reference to what had hitherto been a declining birth rate in Australia. Over the decade in which the previous government was in power, the birth rate actually climbed, however subtly. That demonstrated that support for working families and for parents was very much forthcoming. The fact is that Australian people are choosing to have fewer babies than they would have had in generations past. But that does not mean that they are not having children. Yes, mothers are often having children later in life, but that is simply because they have other opportunities available to them. Those opportunities are available by virtue of increasing education among women. More women are now committed to careers and to the workplace environment.
The minister talked about how a declining birth rate has not been arrested. That is simply not true. The birth rate increased under the previous government. It is now approximately 1.86 children. I am not sure how you have 0.86 of a child, but the fact is that the birth rate is slowly increasing over the course of time. This is a tribute and a credit to the policies of the previous government.
In reference to some of the suggestions that the minister has made, she has asked the Productivity Commission to look at the economic and social costs and benefits of paid maternity, paternity and parental leave. Paid maternity leave would certainly benefit working women. But the baby bonus, as it is referred to, is paid as a lump sum to individuals irrespective of their work status. In effect, they are getting many weeks worth of the average wage, which will assist them in bringing home their children and with the initial costs associated with child care. The extension of this into paternity and parental leave is quite a vexed issue. It relates directly to the environment in which women find themselves. Often, they want to pursue their careers. If they choose to pursue their careers and choose not to have children, no amount of money will change their minds, quite frankly, because that is what they are committed to. We should not force people to have children by any stretch or try to bribe them to have children. All we need to do is to ensure that children are born into an environment in which there are sufficient resources to get them through to school age and through school, where they can be taught to grow up into responsible and well-educated citizens who have opportunities.
I am a bit worried about this because the minister has acknowledged that the Productivity Commission’s report will not come up with a magic bullet—words which in fact bear a remarkable similarity to what the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, said in a press interview in 2002. In fact, they were the words: ‘There is no magic bullet.’ But Treasurer Costello acknowledged that support for parents does not limit itself to paid maternity leave or maternity leave full stop. There are any number of women who choose to stay at home and look after their children or who choose not to enter the workforce on a full-time basis. These are the people that this statement by the minister completely overlooks. That is what concerns me. We should not be forcing people back into the workforce if they do not want to go into the workforce but choose to stay at home and look after their children. There is no more honourable profession, in my opinion, than that of staying at home and helping to raise your children and providing them with the guidance that is necessary. And those people need to be given the appropriate support for this.
This is what I think the government has overlooked. It is so obsessed with giving people opportunities to return to work that it is overlooking those who are pursuing the equally valuable and important task of staying at home and looking after children. Over the course of time these sorts of costs—maternity leave and such—will be borne either by the taxpayers of Australia or by individual businesses. The real test will be how we implement that whilst maintaining prudent fiscal responsibility and support for mothers—and fathers, quite frankly—who choose to stay at home and raise their children, thus relieving our childcare centres of overcrowding and thus relieving the public purse in many instances from having to look after their children.
I welcome any inquiry that is going to support families and encourage children but I have concerns about the scope of the reference that the minister has proposed. I think the government would do much better to consider in a much broader approach the potential benefits of maintaining support for non-working mothers. There needs to be further encouragement along this line because no child is better off than when they have a parent at home with them for as long as possible until they start at school.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2008-03-12,"—The Skills Australia Bill 2008 is one of the first pieces of legislation to be tabled in the new parliament by Labor under Kevin Rudd. It is being marked as a priority for the parliament as the Rudd government recognises the degree of neglect by the Howard and Costello regime. That neglect and lack of funding has led to the situation in which Australia is now in—with a chronic shortage of skilled workers, for which industry is crying out to employ. This lack of skilled and trained workers is one of the major causes of the current inflationary pressures now evident in the Australian economy. The Rudd Labor government was elected to address this situation, and quite rightly it is a priority.
In the Senate last year I outlined the skills shortage problem and the duplication in systems that the former government’s bill introduced with the Australian technical colleges. The Commonwealth funded technical colleges run in duplication alongside the respective state based TAFE systems. Commonwealth funded colleges that were ‘unsurprisingly, located in marginal electorates such as Bass and Braddon in Tasmania’ have generally turned out to be expensive failures, with over half a billion dollars being spent on unnecessarily duplicated campuses and other facilities, which in late 2007 had resulted in: not a single graduate; 1,800 enrolments across all colleges; just two out of the 21 colleges having met their 2007 enrolment targets; an average cost per student of $175,000; only one-third of the colleges legally registered to provide training; the bulk of training outsourced to state TAFEs or registered training organisations.
With Skills Australia and the rest of the Rudd government’s five-point plan, we are planning to actually meet future challenges well before they arise—unlike the former government. It was not like they were not aware of the deepening skills shortage situation. They were given warning after warning. They were warned of the deepening skills crisis on more than 20 occasions by the Reserve Bank. The shadow minister, Mr Turnbull, is still pushing the former government’s line that Australia does not have a ‘chronic skills crisis’. However, his view is not echoed in a survey of 250 medium to large Australian companies recently released by the global business consultant Grant Thornton. The survey found that ‘shortages of skilled workers remained the biggest problem affecting expansion of Australian businesses’.
In addition to the constant warnings from the Reserve Bank, a survey and report of 760 producers conducted by the Australian Industry Group during the final term of the previous government—Australia’s skills gap: costly, wasteful and widespread—revealed that one in two firms were experiencing difficulties obtaining skilled labour. Yet, according to It’s crunch time, another AiG report, one in five young adults have not completed year 12 or a certificate III vocational qualification. It is patently obvious from the former government’s lack of response to these reports and warnings that they were intent on looking after themselves electorally, with short-term excuses not long-term solutions. Skills Australia will be a statutory body headed by a panel of seven experts drawn from the worlds of industry, economics, training and academia. This management panel and Skills Australia will assist government in targeting investment in training exactly where it is needed.
As early as 1997, a year after their election, the former Howard-Costello administration ignored warnings by the Reserve Bank that skill shortages would adversely affect growth and were a prime contribution to rising inflation. The previous government masked these problems by using phrases such as ‘skill needs’ or ‘skill gaps’ and further compounded issues by reducing the Commonwealth’s funding of TAFE systems by 6.6 per cent between 1997 and 2000. These cuts have had an obvious flow-on effect that meant over the last decade TAFE has not been able to meet the demand for training places. The establishment of Skills Australia by way of this bill aims to reverse the situation and ensure that there are adequate places for workers to train in TAFEs countrywide. This is all part of the Rudd government’s five-point plan to fight inflation and lift the productive capacity of the Australian economy after the damage wreaked by over a decade of the Howard-Costello government’s neglect and decay.
In terms of skilled worker shortages, by the former Howard government’s own estimates Australia faces a shortage in excess of 200,000 skilled workers over the next five years. In fact, by 2016 that shortage will be closer to 240,000 workers that are not in place. That is 240,000 carpenters, electricians, nurses and plumbers that, had the previous government bothered to address the situation, would already be either advanced in their training or well and truly making a contribution to the economy. Instead, inflation is at a 16-year high, the building industry is overwhelmed and the waiting list for new houses grows day by day.
The Rudd Labor government has well and truly taken the horse by the reins and is confident that with the establishment of Skills Australia, combined with the rest of its five-point plan, the skills shortage will be addressed appropriately. Addressing and allocating resources to major areas of skill shortage and training needs—as identified by Skills Australia in consultation with industry—is the central tenet of the Rudd Labor government’s Skilling Australia for the Future policy. Skills Australia will be the provider of high-quality advice to government which will, in turn, support individual workers in obtaining higher skill levels and qualifications thus deepening the national skills base. In Tasmania, for instance, two of the state’s largest employers, the fast catamaran builders Incat and Austral Ships, are in need of trained metal fabricators and welders. Skills Australia will be able to identify this area of skills shortage and, in turn, recommend allocation of funding to requisite training courses in Tasmania and nationwide.
To cite a further example of the derision with which the former government treated the TAFE and vocational training sectors, some 325,000 potential trainees were turned away from TAFE colleges nationwide under their watch. This truly shows the abject contempt our predecessors held for getting on with the job at hand and addressing what has turned out to be a genuine limiting factor on our national economy. This new authority, Skills Australia, will work in close consultation with industry to ensure training facilities and necessary funding are pinpointed exactly where they are needed and in a timely manner to ensure that the current situation of a dearth of available and highly skilled workers is a relic of times gone by. The Rudd Labor government is, front and centre, committed to helping Australia’s industrial sector to prosper and grow—not just stagnate and wither as seemed to be the main tenet of the decade of inaction watched over by Mr Howard and his electorally-driven former coalition government.
Upon its establishment, Skills Australia will analyse and report on current and emerging skill shortages and requirements in the national economy, both in macro and sector based spheres. It will widely disseminate information from research and meetings with stakeholders that will enable businesses and workers to assess and inform their training and employment options. It will also provide government with key recommendations on potential and existing areas of skill needs to encourage an idea of where, when, how and what amount of public funds will need to be invested to strengthen relevant skill bases. Skills Australia will give advice on the allocation of 450,000 training places between establishment and 2011, ensuring government is able to rapidly convey to training providers specifically where trainees and workers with requisite skills are in demand by industry.
Existing industry skills councils will be strengthened and will advise and connect employers from industry with nationally accredited providers who will train both existing employees and those new to the workplace. The Rudd Labor government, in a departure from the previous occupants of the government benches, has already and will in future heed the advice and any warnings issued by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
An initial and urgent response to the current skills shortage has seen the Rudd Labor government acting with the utmost urgency to ensure 20,000 new training places will be available from April 2008 to 30 June 2008. The government has already called for expressions of interest for the provision of these places, which will be directed specifically at those looking to enter the labour market, thus stimulating workforce participation and lifting the productive capacity of Australia. In addition to this, the Skilling Australia for the Future policy will support up to 65,000 apprenticeships over the next four years.
The Rudd Labor government is also committed to moving forward the national skills agenda through the Council of Australian Governments. Through COAG, all Australian state and territory governments have agreed to work together to increase the productive capacity of the economy, address inflationary pressures and deliver higher quality services to the community. Building on the work of COAG, the Rudd Labor government has begun discussions with the state and territory systems to ensure close coordination between governments in planning for and funding growth in training and skills development. It is only with a long-term productivity agenda that we can hope to achieve simultaneously high economic growth, low unemployment and low inflation.
There are many benefits to be achieved by working together. A better return on publicly funded training investment can be expected. We can increase the capacity of enterprises to adopt high-performance work practices that increase productivity through supporting workers to realise their potential. The Skills Australia Bill is the first part of the Rudd Labor government’s policy package to address skills shortages and thus fight inflation. The Rudd Labor government is ‘skilling Australia for the future’. It is a challenging and vital plan and it requires an active contribution from all parties.
There has been support for the Rudd Labor government’s Skills Australia Bill from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which, in a press release dated 13 February 2008 and headed ‘Great potential in Skills Australia’, welcomed the introduction of this legislation and stated:
We are pleased that Skills Australia will bring together data about Australia’s skills needs from existing sources. The absence of a consistent definition for ‘skills shortages’ across Australia makes this function particularly valuable to industry.
It is only with all stakeholders actively engaged in this skills agenda that focus can be put on the end result—to increase the productive capacity of Australia’s economy via a more highly skilled and thoroughly trained workforce. The ultimate result of the creation of Skills Australia will be an industrial arena where the career aspirations and desires of workers are recognised, developed and justly rewarded. Establishing Skills Australia is the first of many steps the Rudd Labor government is taking as part of a comprehensive approach to overcoming the challenges and issues that Australia faces in securing a productive and prosperous future.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2008-03-12,"—I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech on the Skills Australia Bill 2008 which I began earlier today.
Leave granted.

The remainder of the speech read as follows—

Part of the problem we face in addressing Australia’s skills shortage has been that training has not sufficiently matched industry’s needs.
Business and Industry have not been adequately consulted regarding their requirements for skilled workers. Through Skills Australia industry groups can predict and tailor training to the needs of their future workforce.
The Government is bringing everyone in on this one. We are including industry, businesses, academics and unions, as well as every single Australian State and territory for this first time to address this problem together.
Based on feedback from this group we will be able to allocate training places according to industry demand.
By planning and co-ordinating a united approach we will be able to ensure that the skills crisis that the Howard Government created and perpetuated can not and will not happen again.
These reforms will help with a better assessment of Australia’s skills needs and ensure new training places are delivered in a way that meets the needs of industry and our economy.
Industry skills councils will work with employers to identify their skills needs and match those needs with nationally accredited training by drawing on the advice of Skills Australia, its collective knowledge and skills base.
Australia’s training system must shift to a system that is driven by, and which responds to, the needs of business, industry and the economy. In this way, we can meet current demands and also ensure that we are looking ahead to future needs.
As already mentioned, this approach to addressing the skills shortage in Australia has the support and will have the involvement of every State and Territory through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).
Already, a level of co-operation has been achieved by the Rudd Labor Government, which could never have been achieved by our predecessors.
The Department for Education, Employment & Workplace Relations has begun discussions with state and territory education authorities to ensure close co-ordination between governments in planning and funding training and skills development. Over coming months we will see the benefits that Skills Australia will deliver.
A significant reason for its success is that it will be working with industry and governments in Australia, rather than against them.
There are many shared and real benefits to be achieved by working together. We can expect a better return on publicly funded training investment and we will see a co-operative approach to the way that investment is applied.
It is only with all stakeholders actively engaged in the skills agenda that we can focus on our outcomes—to increase the productive capacity of the economy through a more highly-skilled workforce.
Mr President, it is important to keep in mind that for almost 12 long years’ vocational education and training was relegated to the bottom of the government’s priorities.
Under the previous government the number of apprenticeships and traineeships commenced as a result of a Job Network placement fell by more than half.
Between 1998 and 1999 there were 32,807 places compared with only 14,925 in the financial year 2006-07.
I bring to Honourable Senator’s attention, an article by Sid Marris in the Australian on 14th February 2008, in which the Australian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (ACCI) called on the Rudd Government:
“…to appoint a business person with industry experience as the chair of the new body… (as)…an approach which brings together important intelligence across portfolios will contribute to Australia’s skills planning processes.”
Isn’t it ironic. Here is the so called peak representative body of industry, who have had their feet firmly planted under the desk of Howard ministers – through the connection of Peter Hendy, former Chief Executive of ACCI, who we all now came out of the office of the former Minister for Industrial Relations in the Howard Government, Peter Reith – talking about the inclusion of different groups within training bodies.
And we all know the ACCI’s background, who spent 11 years doing all that they could denying union involvement in training bodies.
Now that their mates have been turfed out, they demand that they should have a place at the table.
The ACCI is just as guilty as the former Howard Government in overseeing the greatest demise of skills training in this nation.
Unlike these narrow interested groups, we on the Labor side of politics, support inclusion. Be it in the workplace, enterprise bargaining or in the development and implementation of skills training.
I also bring Honourable Senator’s attention to an article in the Age on 5th February 2008 by Tim Colebatch in which he states:
“The Howard Government dropped the ball on skills training, and chose infrastructure projects for political ends, not economic value.”
This damning statement of the Howard Government provide proof to the Australian people and to this Parliament that the former Howard Government was utterly negligent - failing to prepare Australia for the resources boom and a burgeoning economy.
Because Australia was simply not ready to respond, many opportunities have been lost.
A skilled country is essential for economic reform and a strong stable economy.
Addressing the skills shortage is part of the Rudd Government’s Five Point plan to address inflation and maintain this country’s economic strength.
We were once a nation of innovation. Now that the 12-year lapse in leadership is well and truly behind us, let’s roll our sleeves up and get on with the real task of not only addressing the skills crisis but ensuring we never find ourselves in this situation again.
If we don’t invest as a nation, we don’t get a return, it’s as simple as that.
The Labor Party saw it coming. Together with the states and territories we will, through new leadership, provide a fresh start on skills and training.
The only answer that the lame Howard Government had was to try and flood the country with foreign workers. And what a wonderful solution that was…
In summary, Mr President, I commend this Bill to the Senate and if any Senator opposite has an ounce of decency in their bones, they will support this Bill through the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SKILLS AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-03-12,—I wish to speak for only about a minute. I particularly want to mention that Senator Carol Brown in her address indicated that there had been no students graduating from the northern technical college in Tasmania. This is in fact incorrect. The graduation ceremony was held two weeks ago at the Burnie Civic Centre and students graduated. I just wish to place on record that students have graduated from the northern technical college in Tasmania.,SENATE,<title>SKILLS AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2008-03-12,"—Like my colleague, I have been prompted to rise to speak because I have been listening to the addresses by members of the new Labor Party government on the other side. They have flushed me out of my office because what we have heard is all the old hacks get up and deliver nothing but a litany of misrepresentations on this important issue, on this economic squeeze that we know exists. Senator Carol Brown looks all quizzical and surprised, but she delivered the most set piece of all the speeches from the government side, putting in every second line ‘the former government’s legacy and the problem they have created’. She read it with disinterest, just delivering her lines as if being told to.
Let me say this to you, Senator Brown, for as long as you can possibly stay in the chamber: it is quite well recognised and denied by no-one that there is a skills shortage. There are different reasons for that. But let me also assure you, Senator Brown, and the previous speakers from the government, that the establishment of Skills Australia is not the panacea. It is not the solution. It is just another advisory body. It can join the other 43 committees, inquiries, commissions and conferences. You may as well just add: Skills Australia—an advisory body to the government. That is all it is. It is not a step forward at all. It is a statutory body to advise the government on an issue they ought to already know about. And by the way Senator George Campbell delivered his speech today he is very keen to get onto that statutory body to advise the government. He was oozing to get onto the body with his praise for Skills Australia. But, rest assured, your deliveries today would convince no-one in the industry, no-one with any understanding, that Skills Australia is a step forward in solving the greater problems we have before us. You showed little knowledge of and little interest in the bill. You just rushed in here simply to deliver a litany of falsehoods against the former government.
I should also add that I want to go back to the Hansard and look at one of Minister Carr’s—I find ‘Minister Carr’ hard to say—answers in question time today in regard to what I believe were false figures which he gave on the government’s new apprenticeships scheme. He will have to come in here and correct that particular error.
As I said, there is no denying that we have a shortage of skills in this country. It is well known. There are many different reasons for that. Some of them go as far back as the eighties and the poor decisions made then in regard to the abolition of the tech colleges. We know that the tech colleges were a success in delivering the supply of tradespeople to meet the demand. But they were abolished by the Labor government on the grounds of some sort of false snobbery, that everyone ought to be doing arts or something at university. They abolished the tech colleges. The eighties may seem a long time ago for a lot of people but that had a cascading effect throughout the nineties and right through to today. The abolition of the tech colleges without doubt pulled the rug out from under the training of future tradespeople. And to think a Labor government did it.
The second reason that we have this squeeze on skills is the economy—the two economies, I should say. When the Labor Party were last in government under the Hawke-Keating government, in particular during the period when Paul Keating was Prime Minister, there was a severe recession which cut into businesses. Businesses simply stopped taking on apprentices. I have the figures for that. Apprenticeships dropped right down in 1994 to 107,000—a record low. The obvious effect, if the economy is driven into the ground, as it was by the previous Labor government, is that naturally the number of apprenticeships will drop off. Again, that has an effect for years to come because it takes some four years, plus probably a year or two extra in experience and training, for a properly skilled apprentice to get up and running, to meet their productive potential. So the recession during the previous Labor government had a severe effect on the skills pool in this country.
When we came into government, we immediately introduced the New Apprenticeships program in acknowledgement of the pending skills shortage. When the coalition were in government, we had 12 years of economic growth. That is another factor that squeezes the skills pool. Of course it does. These are the reasons. There is a heavy demand for skilled workers in a growing economy. That seems to have escaped those on the other side. They simply want to make cheap political points. These are the economic facts. The previous government’s record in regard to apprenticeships ought to be held up. I will not hear from the other side that it was not a very proud record. When we came in, as I said, apprenticeships were down to 107,000. In leaving government, there were somewhere near 450,000 to 500,000 apprentices in training. That is an enormous leap—from 107,000 to 400,000-plus. That was the success of the New Apprenticeships scheme. That was based on increased payments to employers and increased incentives for young people to take up an apprenticeship.
Moreover, we introduced the tech colleges. I should say that this government will abolish the previous government’s technical colleges program. Again, that is going to have a serious long-term effect. Just as we are talking now about the effect of the abolition of the technical colleges in the eighties upon the skills shortage and all those wasted young people who could have had more productive lives by taking up an apprenticeship but were forced into some other educational stream which did not suit them, we will be talking in the future, in probably the next 10 or 15 years, about the abolition of the technical colleges that this government is going to undertake.
Labor have learnt nothing. They are going to commit the same serious error twice. So do not anybody say that this is a new Labor government. This is the same old Labor government, and the same old unionists are on the speakers list—Senator George Campbell, Senator Sterle and the like. They should know better and should be standing up for future workers, the tradespeople. They were probably the beneficiaries themselves of an apprenticeship or perhaps even a tech school of some sort. The point is that Labor have learnt nothing and they are about to make the same mistake. What is their answer today? It is Skills Australia—an advisory body.
Also, besides the New Apprenticeships scheme, the previous government acted to increase their skilled migration program to meet short-term shortages. It ought to be noted that this skills shortage is an international one. It is not unique to Australia. How many people know of Australian nurses who have been attracted to England by higher pay? This is an international problem. We are competing on the international stage to attract workers. Nevertheless, the previous government increased the skilled migration program to 100,000-plus, I believe, and it has been a successful program.
Further to that, the previous government introduced the skills voucher program, which was targeted towards older—if you want to call 25 and over older—unskilled workers to train themselves up. The current government are going to abolish it. The voucher scheme is probably one of the most efficient, targeted and necessary schemes for that age group of all the programs introduced, and the government are going to abolish it. What are they going to do instead? They are going to introduce an advisory body. So we have the 2020 conference, we have commissions—the health commissions are set up—we have inquiries into this and that, we have motherhood statements, spin statements and platitudes, and now we have a new statutory advisory body for an issue of concern that we all know about. It does not require another advisory body; it requires management.
Those on the other side have approached this whole debate in a sheer political manner. Those who have spoken do not even know what Skills Australia gets up to. They have been given their brief and have come in here—and their brief is not so much to talk about the bill; it is to knock the previous government. I see Senator Evans, the new Leader of the Government in the Senate, has walked in. When are they going to get down and govern? Are they just going to wait for all these reports and commissions and advisory bodies to come in one day before they actually govern? Get down and start governing, is my advice, and do more in this area than just set up an advisory body.",SENATE,<title>SKILLS AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2008-03-12,"—I rise to speak on the Skills Australia Bill 2008. This bill provides for the establishment of the statutory body Skills Australia—a body that will supply the government with first-class independent advice about the skills needs of this nation now and into the future. Skills Australia, which will be made up of members from a range of backgrounds, including economics, industry, academia and training providers, will work with the government to boost the skills of the Australian workforce.
Crucially, this partnership will make sure that the ever-expanding gap between skills training and the demand for skills closes. It will mean that the areas of greatest need for skills injections are highlighted and targeted. Some of the industries which may receive the new training places include health and community services, construction, mining and service industries. Ultimately, though, Skills Australia will give the government its advice on the distribution of 450,000 skilled training places by 2011 to ensure a good fit between the skills which industry needs and the skills Australian workers have. Indeed, industry demand will be central to ensuring this new dawn of skills training is as effective and productive as it can be. This new body will be an important part of a total skills package of $1.17 billion over four years. It will represent a financial and intellectual investment in the skills arena.
Many on the opposition benches have tried to deny Australia is in the grip of severe skills shortages—just as they have tried in the past to deny the growing hold of climate change, just as they have refused to believe that workers have been ill-treated and exploited under Work Choices and just as they have stubbornly refused to accept the need for a national apology to the stolen generations. Those opposite can deny it all they like, but the reality of the skills crisis is hitting home and it is hitting hard—yet another dark and devastating legacy of the Howard government.
But even the former government’s own figures, through the Centre for the Economics of Education and Training, indicate that Australia faces a shortage of more than 200,000 workers over the next five years. In just eight years, by 2016, that figure will have grown to 240,000. Like climate change, the skills crisis is not an overnight predicament. It did not sneak up on us; it has been building for years, threatening our future prosperity.
In fact, the Reserve Bank of Australia warned the Howard government as far back as 1997 that this problem would hurt our economy, adversely affecting growth and putting upward pressure on inflation and, therefore, interest rates. But the former administration, which seems to have suffered dreadfully from selective deafness, ignored 20 warnings over a decade. To make matters worse, the TAFE system, the largest training provider in Australia, had its funding slashed. This disinvestment meant TAFE could not properly meet the call for training. It meant that more than 325,000 people were turned away from TAFE over the life of the Howard government. So, with all of its denial and neglect, it is little wonder that we are behind the eight ball when it comes to skills, to climate change, to water and to relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia—and the list goes on. We have ground to make up. In fact, we have a lot of ground to make up.
This bill is part of a new direction in skills training—a new focus; a new priority. This is about investment rather than disinvestment, about moving forward and about improving Australia’s outlook. The new government is serious about meeting the many challenges left to it by years of inaction and apathy. In addition to planning for Skills Australia, this government already has set about making other changes that address skills shortages. It has started talks with other nations to expand the working holiday visa program for young people and adjust that program to allow longer working stays for people in the construction sector. There also will be an extra 6,000 places available this year in the skilled migration program. Further, the government already has called on industry experts to look at ways of easing labour shortages in the long term through skilled migration.
Because of the urgent nature of the skills crisis and the pressing need to lift the national economy’s productive capacity and reduce inflationary pressures, this new government has hit the ground running. Because we know we must act now, this legislation has been brought before the parliament as a priority. Because there is no time to waste, the government will make available from next month the first 20,000 of the 450,000 extra training places it has committed to. The first of the new places will target people who currently are not working—a strategy which obviously will have even further benefits. This government, through Skills Australia, will not just allot new training places and then walk away from the issue; it also will make sure that most of the 450,000 high-quality training opportunities lead to a higher level qualification. This sits well with the Business Council of Australia estimates that say almost half of those skilled workers needed in the next decade to meet the demand will need to be qualified to certificate III level or higher. The government also will work with the states, through the Council of Australian Governments, to develop a truly national skills agenda.
So this bill is one part—an important but not isolated part—of a broader plan of skilling Australia for the future. It is part of a collaborative plan that will encompass contributions from all interested and relevant parties. The consequence of the bill will be a more skilled workforce, a more confident, fulfilled workforce. It will be a workforce that can better meet industry demands and address the gaping chasm between demand and supply, the skilled and the unskilled, the included and those that have been neglected.",SENATE,<title>SKILLS AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-03-12,"—The Democrats welcome this move to set up an advisory body on skills shortages. It seems to me that the last government did not have one. It was pretty clear, from the measures that they put in place to solve the skills crisis, that it was more knee-jerk and vote-catching than anything to do with establishing good public policy. However, I want to urge the government to make sure it is clear—because it is not clear in the Skills Australia Bill 2008—exactly what the Skills Australia body will do. I hope it is not just about plumbers and electricians. We do need them—there is no question about that—but I have already spoken twice in this place today about skills shortages. On one occasion I spoke about the health sector, where skills shortages are so serious as to be worthy of a very high priority for Skills Australia to address. It is not just that we do not have enough doctors; there are, as I said, many ways in which we need to change our health system in order to allow other health professionals to be part of that system under existing structures.
I also spoke to the bill concerning the additional 50 teachers in the Northern Territory in Indigenous schools, where there is, again, an enormous shortage of teachers. We know that measures such as introducing 50 new teaching places will fail absolutely if we do not have sufficient teachers on the ground doing it. Or, at least, they will come from somewhere else where they are currently needed and in employment. So I urge the government to not just look at what would loosely be described as the ‘trades’ but make sure that this body also takes care of the professions, such as nurses, teachers, dentists, psychiatrists and the full range of those who are in short supply but so necessary to us in delivering health and education.
The reason I am critical of the former government in terms of skills is that, as I said, it seemed to me that decisions were knee-jerk. The former Prime Minister’s famous tech schools initiative was determined to bypass the states to put in place something which was very much a fifties view of what technical education should be about. I gather it was variously met with disdain and disapproval from the state governments because no discussion had taken place. I note that this body, Skills Australia, is charged with the business of talking with state governments, and that is a really good move. We need to get away from this whole idea that the Commonwealth will supersede and step over the service responsibilities of the states, and we need to work with them. I congratulate the government for doing this.
However, when I turn to the section about the appointment of members of Skills Australia, I fear that all of the Democrats’ work in this place putting up hundreds of amendments talking about appointment on merit and the sorts of things that ought to be in legislation in putting up boards has been ignored. There is nothing in the bill about appointment on merit, there is nothing here about probity and there is nothing here about independent scrutiny of appointments. I have to say, Minister Evans, that it is a great disappointment to the Democrats, after all of our efforts and all of the amendments that we have put up, to find that these points do not appear in this bill. Including them ought to have been an easy thing to do and is something that you should have done.
We have got a list of the sorts of experience that members of Skills Australia should have, and that is a good thing, and we have got mention of a member being able to be appointed on a part-time basis, but, at the end of the day, members, including the chair, are to be appointed by the minister by written instrument. Here we go again. I will not be putting up our standard amendment, because, as I understand it, the government is already underway with its appointment process, at least for the chair. We have acknowledged that that is the case and modified our amendment. I foreshadow that when we go into committee I will move our amendment, which is numbered QM342, and not put our standard amendment, which is based on the Nolan principles.",SENATE,<title>SKILLS AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2008-03-12,"—I rise to speak in continuation in the address-in-reply debate on the very important matter of the carers bonus. I note that in the last 24 hours there has been a major development which is the confirmation that the Rudd government has done a backflip over the plan to axe the $1,600 annual bonus to carers. In my view that is a great win for Australian carers, their families and their loved ones. It is an enormous relief. There was a lot of anxiety, stress and indeed distress in the community. In fact, the level of anxiety had hit the roof. I know that from the feedback that many coalition members and senators across Australia received—and I am sure there would have been government members and senators who would have received that feedback as well. The government have finally listened but it has taken nearly a week for the government to do a backflip and to say that the bonus will remain.
I want to say congratulations to Pat and Harry Stafford in particular. They have been married for 60 years and they came out with me on Saturday morning in Launceston to stand up for the carers in Tasmania. Pat Stafford has motor neurone disease and she has had it for 15 years. She is in a wheelchair. They wanted to stand up for all those who are vulnerable, who need their help and assistance, and to say that any possible intention on the Labor government’s behalf to remove that $1,600 annual bonus is totally unacceptable. I want to say congratulations to Pat and Harry Stafford. They are part of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, which meets monthly. They are wonderful supporters of not only their family and friends but other people and other families with motor neurone disease and other people with disabilities. I say congratulations to them.
I want to congratulate and say thank you to Bev and Jim Barnard from Launceston, in fact from Youngtown. Jim Barnard has Parkinson’s disease. I spoke to Bev Barnard personally and they were willing to put their names forward in a big story in the Examiner with a photo on Sunday, 9 March. I want to read this article, and to acknowledge and thank the Examiner for promoting this very important issue. I thank Fran Voss, who did the report. It says a little bit about Bev and Jim and their situation and I would like to refer to it:
Bev Barnard of Youngtown is one of 400000 primary carers around Australia stunned by the news that the Federal Government is considering axing the annual $1,600 carer bonus. There are just under 16,000 primary carers in Tasmania. Mrs Barnard, 64, cares for her husband Jim, 68, who has suffered Parkinson’s disease for 15 years and her 30-year-old visually impaired daughter. Mr Barnard was diagnosed when he was 53 and is now totally dependent on his wife.
What a situation for them. What a difficulty. It continues:
Their daughter, Kayleen, has been visually impaired since she suffered a brain haemorrhage at four days old. Both Kayleen and Jim also suffer depression and other health issues. The $1,600 annual bonus enables Mrs Barnard to buy medications, replacement items for the house like a new washing machine, transport her husband and daughter to medical appointments and pay for respite care to allow her some time off.
I had a talk to Bev Barnard and she was very, very upset and stressed. She said, ‘I’m not doing it for us, I’m doing it for the vulnerable, for the disabled and for the people who need it in Tasmania and across the country.’ I want to say thank you to them on the public record.
Thank you to Pat and Harry Stafford for what they have done. I remind the Senate and indeed the public what Pat Stafford said on Saturday when she made that bold announcement to the public. She said that the lump sum payment was a wonderful help. She said, ‘This enables us to keep our 25-year-old car.’ It is a Mitsubishi car, I saw it and the wheelchair goes on the back. It is quite a contraption to get it all to work together, but it is an excellent vehicle for their needs and with a wheelchair on the back it is well put together. She said that it is their only means of transport to keep them on the road. She said ‘The lump sum also allows us to pay the winter heating bills and this payment gives us a quality of life.’ She talked about the need for a kettle and other miscellaneous items in the house particularly during the wintertime. The lump sum payment was particularly appreciated. Her husband, Harry Stafford, said that without this help Pat would end up in an institution.
This is what we are facing and this government has been dillydallying around with weasel words for the last six days trying to fob off this issue. This is an important issue for the 400,000 carers and their families throughout Australia. Harry Stafford and indeed Pat Stafford have summed it up. On Saturday Pat said that John Howard was the quiet achiever but Kevin Rudd was the quiet deceiver. She said that she knew nothing about this before the election.
Of course they worried. There was no comment; there was no discussion about it before the election. And we have had this issue running for nearly a week in the public arena without the government saying anything about there being an ironclad guarantee that this bonus payment would not be removed. So they have stood up on behalf of their community—and I say, ‘Congratulations and well done,’ on behalf of all Tasmanians, who I know are very proud of them for doing that.
I want to thank Mrs Kimberley Ware. She rang my office and we spoke together. She has two autistic boys, one aged 16 and one aged 7. The eldest boy will soon be 17. She cannot work. She is there by herself 24/7 looking after these boys, and surviving is very tough. She told me about concerns, about what she has to put up with and about the meagre funds that she has to do it with. I say ‘thank you’ to her, and I also note that she contacted the office of her local member, Jodie Campbell, and had no assistance provided to her.
This brings into focus the role of the local federal member, the member for Bass, Jodie Campbell. What has she done? Did she stand up? What has she said about it? I know what she said on Saturday, because we debated this issue publicly and it was reported publicly. She said that this payment was a one-off. The fact is that the payment had been paid for four years in a row—every year for four years. It was not a one-off; that is one thing it was not. So why did Ms Campbell not stand up for and on behalf of her local community, for and on behalf of the carers and those who are vulnerable—the people with disabilities in her local community?
We had 150 Centrelink call centre jobs in Launceston axed by the Rudd Labor government, and Ms Campbell failed at that first test to stand up for her local community. What we need in Tasmania and around the country are people who are willing to stand up. Both on the call centre and the carer issue, Ms Campbell has been willing to be Mr Rudd’s co-conspirator. She has not met the major test. She should be defending her region and taking on the ministers in Canberra and any of the Canberra bureaucrats who are not acting in the best interests of her community. She will simply be regarded as a Labor lackey if she is not willing to stand up.
I want to pay tribute not only to Pat and Harry Stafford and Jim and Bev Barnard but to Janis McKenna of Carers Tasmania. Carers Tasmania have been strong advocates for the people of Tasmania who need their support and advocacy. Janis has been fantastic. She has been on the radio and in the news and other media doing the job that she has to do. Her objective is to care for and stand up for the carers of Tasmania. So, thank you, Janis McKenna. It has been a pleasure working with you and your organisation to see if we could get some reality injected into the Rudd Labor government so that they removed all doubt entirely.
I notice that there was some news today. In fact, it was not clarified until after the TV news went to bed last night. I say that it is not good enough for the backdown by the Rudd Labor government to be dribbled out to the media via what was quoted as being a ‘Rudd spokesperson’ after the nightly news on Tuesday evening. The Prime Minister should have taken the medicine and had the courage to announce it himself. So we had some news later today that the Rudd Labor government has confirmed that the carers and seniors bonus will be paid as a lump sum payment by the end of June. There is enormous relief in the community now about that.
I want to particularly thank Brendan Nelson for taking a lead on this issue at a national level and calling the government to account. I want to thank Tony Abbott for his strong advocacy for the 400,000 carers and I also want to thank Margaret May, who has been a staunch advocate on behalf of those carers in and around Australia. In Tasmania, we have over 69,000 carers, and we have 16,000 primary family carers. They really deserve support, and it is very important.
To the unsung heroes in our community, it is a great relief today to hear the news that the bonus payment will be made, and I hope that the Rudd Labor government has learnt its lesson. It has been caught out, and I think the Pat Stafford quote is appropriate. I have said it once and will conclude with it:
John Howard was the quiet achiever but Kevin Rudd has turned out to be the quiet deceiver. We knew nothing about this before the election.
So the good news is that there is relief today. The anxiety levels have hit the roof for nearly one week, but there is enormous relief today and I congratulate those carers who are willing to stand up on behalf of their local communities.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,34,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-03-12,"—It is indeed a pleasure to join in the address-in-reply to His Excellency the Governor-General’s speech to parliament of what is now some weeks ago. In extending my best wishes to the Governor-General, can I say what a magnificent job he has done as Australia’s leader over a long period of time. I particularly want to thank him for the very visible visit he made to Townsville recently—principally to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Royal Australian Regiment, of which he was a distinguished leader at one stage in his military career. I thank him for the way he interacted with the Townsville community. He attended a youth forum that the Mayor of Thuringowa, Councillor Les Tyrell, put on; and I certainly hope that Councillor Les Tyrell is the new mayor of Townsville City after next Saturday. The Governor-General and his wife were very gracious visitors to that North Queensland city and demonstrated the sort of interest the Governor-General has taken in Australia since becoming our leader.
The Governor-General delivered a speech, which of course was written by the current government, and I want to refer to some aspects of that speech and some aspects of the program that the new government raised in that speech. The new government made a great virtue of attacking inflation. Not only did Mr Rudd pinch all of the coalition policies when he was opposition, but having gained government he seemed to again be following what our government did in 1996. In 1996 our government came in with a $96 billion debt confronting it. There was a $10 billion annual deficit and there were huge problems in the economy created by the Labor Party. We rightly pointed out that we had this huge government debt to address.
Mr Rudd, thinking of those times, thought he had to try and find something he could blame on the coalition and blame his inexperience on as he got into more and more trouble. He anticipated he would need a peg to hang his hat on in relation to blame. Having promised, of course, that he was finishing the blame game—a promise that was as shallow as most of Mr Rudd’s other original promises—he then picked on inflation. With the help of a very compliant media, he has raised the issue of inflation in the attention of the Australian public. However, what he has forgotten to mention, of course, is that the last Labor government that we had had inflation running at 10 per cent—double-digit figures—when we came into government 11 or 12 years ago. Labor simply cannot be trusted with management, as shown by their record over the last term of the Labor government, with huge interest rates—up to 17½ per cent. I carry my bank statement with me because younger people these days do not believe me when I say that I was paying 17½ per cent on my housing loan, but I have got the bank statement to prove it.
So Mr Rudd picked on this fictitious claim about inflation running out of control. Inflation is an issue—it is one of the issues that the Howard government addressed and one of those that would have been carefully handled had we retained office. But Mr Rudd will really need to think of another blame game issue rather than the inflation one, because we know from Labor’s last experience in government that they will be looking at inflation in the double-digit area and thinking of it as normal.
The government’s comments about economic reform are a lot of fluff. I think it has been clearly demonstrated over the last 100 days that to be a fiscal conservative you have to do more than just mouth the words. The new government has become, I think, quite well recognised in the first 100 days as being good on the rhetoric but finding it a lot more difficult to put that rhetoric into action. As Senator Barnett mentioned in the speech before mine, the government’s comments about work and family in the address by the Governor-General are clearly easily forgotten by the government as it sets out to penalise those who are more vulnerable in our society, the carers and the elderly. I am delighted that Brendan Nelson has led a campaign that has reversed the decision of the Labor government to slash payments to carers and the elderly.
With education—and a lot was made of this in the Governor-General’s speech—we see that rather than assisting with education the new government seems to have gone out of its way to attack education. The very popular—and not only popular but very useful—Investing in Our Schools Program has been slashed by this government. One wonders what those state schools, Catholic schools and independent schools are going to do for the assistance they needed, which was not being provided by the state governments—who do have primary responsibility for education. In the health area there were a lot of promises by the Labor government. There was a health ministers’ get-together—a bit of a powwow; a bit of a chat—a week or so ago. What came out of it? Nothing except the chat. They agreed to have another chat at some time in the future to see if they could address the problems.
A lot was made, in the government’s speech, of climate change and water. As I have mentioned in this chamber previously, Australia produces less than 1.4 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. If you shut Australia down tomorrow, it would not make one iota of difference to the changing world climate. We are part of the globe, and Australia’s miniscule emissions will have no impact on the changing climate of the globe. What we have to do to address that, and what the previous government was doing, is to show leadership, as demonstrated at APEC, where we got the big emitters to the table and made sure that they started thinking about it—because only by getting the big emitters to the table and getting them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions will we have any chance of changing the dilemma that we are looking at with world climate change.
The Governor-General’s speech on behalf of the new government mentioned a lot about social inclusion and Indigenous policy. Well, we see that the best thing that could have happened to Indigenous people, the intervention in the Northern Territory, is already being wound back by this government. I simply cannot understand that except by thinking that the government is being pressured by certain forces inside the Labor Party to take action which is really not in the best interests of our Indigenous brothers and sisters in Australia.
In relation to that, Mr Rudd was very keen to talk about the forcibly separated Indigenous children. As it turned out, there are other, non-Indigenous Australians who were also forcibly separated from their parents in the prewar and early war years—60,000 of them, the subject of a very good Senate report a couple of years ago. I have written to Mr Rudd and asked him when he is going to apologise to those non-Indigenous Australians who were forcibly separated from their parents and when he is going to consider compensation for those people. I have had a most dismissive letter—not from the Prime Minister, to whom I wrote, but from one of his parliamentary secretaries—arguing about whether an adviser had committed to doing something about this some time ago. That is an issue which must be addressed by the new government, and I will certainly be working with the Care Leavers Australia Network to try and get something done to acknowledge the hurt of those forcibly separated Australians who were not Indigenous people. Mr Rudd seems to have one set of policies for one lot of Australians and a different set for another lot. Perhaps it is an issue of which one might get him the best publicity at any particular time.
Governance and transparency were highlighted by the Governor-General on behalf of the new government. We heard a bit about the 2020 Summit that Mr Rudd is convening. Before the election, apart from pinching all of the coalition government’s policies, Mr Rudd also indicated he had a plan for Australia. We knew he was going to set up a lot of reviews, committees, task forces, boards and inquiries, but we did actually believe him, most Australians believed him, when he said he had a plan. We now find out that he had no plan at all and that he is going to get together a group of Australian people—the ‘best and brightest minds’, he says—to provide this plan for him.
In doing this, Mr Rudd has selected a steering committee that comprises a group of academics from the ‘golden triangle’ of Canberra-Sydney-Melbourne, with the exception of the Hon. Tim Fischer, who will bring some sense and a different perspective to the organisation of that conference. But there is no-one from the minor states on the steering committee, no-one at all from Northern Australia and, apart from Mr Fischer, no-one from rural and regional Australia. So this think tank of 1,000 ‘best and brightest minds’ obviously means the best and brightest minds that happen to live in the golden triangle of Canberra-Sydney-Melbourne.
To make sure that no-one from the north of Australia can get to the summit, we find that the initial advice—this is probably going to change, like most other things with Mr Rudd—is that there will be no expenses provided and no attendance fees paid. So that is great if you happen to head a major company, be a university academic, be one of Mr Rudd’s mates from business or be someone like Mr Rudd with millions of dollars behind him who can travel around Australia without assistance. But for ordinary people from Northern Australia being able to get to this conference would be just impossible. Mr Rudd probably does not know, because when he goes north he flies in a taxpayer funded government jet, that ordinary people have to drive for many hours to get to an airport, then they have to change aircraft three or four times, and they have to be away from their work for three or four days, to put in a couple of days attendance at any conference in Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne. These things were not considered, of course, because this conference is going to be for the golden triangle elite that Mr Rudd will be looking to to give him the plan that he did not have.
All in all, quite contrary to the Governor-General’s speech, which indicated that this new government was committed to bringing a fresh approach, committed to being a government that listens to the Australian people and committed to being a government with a vision for Australia’s long-term future, none of those urgings are in fact at all accurate. This is a government with no plan, little interest in Australia’s future unless you happen to live in Sydney, Melbourne or Canberra, and it is certainly not a government that is bringing fresh ideas to the table. The only new idea so far seems to be great slashes in funding to the most vulnerable in our society. I hope that the first 100 days are not the benchmark by which this government will be judged.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,34,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2008-03-12,"—It gives me great pleasure to respond to the Governor-General’s speech in the address-in-reply debate, the first that I have taken part in where there is a Labor government in office. It was the focus in the speech on the future that particularly struck me. There was a focus on the future in both a social dimension and an economic dimension. I am very pleased that we now have a government which is looking to the future and which does in fact have a plan, and a plan on two fronts: to prepare for the future growth of Australia and to prepare for any future shocks to Australia’s economy. This mirrors a lot of what was done by the previous Labor governments under Hawke and Keating, where necessary restructuring and modernisation of the country took place in order to prepare the country for the future.
There were of course a number of social platforms in the speech, but today I specifically want to address some of the economic initiatives that it covered. I want to reiterate that they prepare us for future growth in Australia through innovation, productivity, research and development, and also prepare us for any future shocks to the economy, one of which we are only just beginning to feel, I suspect—that of inflation. But currently we are also feeling tremors through the world’s financial markets and it is difficult, I think, at this stage to tell how far those tremors will go.
In talking about the economy, I want to focus on the manufacturing sector, because it is of great importance to my state of South Australia and because, during the election campaign, the future Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, expressed a great deal of support for the manufacturing industry in Australia—support that was expressed in emphatic terms that have not been heard from an Australian leader for some time and that was, fortunately, also backed up by comprehensive campaign commitments to ensure that the manufacturing sector does continue in Australia and can look forward to growth, change and development.
Before I address some of the promises within the campaign and then the measures that were addressed in the Governor-General’s speech, I would like to talk a bit about a particular example of manufacturing in South Australia. It was recently announced that Mitsubishi’s factory in Adelaide would in fact be closed—that the Mitsubishi company would no longer support vehicle manufacturing in Australia. That was indeed something that had been speculated about for some time and did not, in that sense, come as a shock to us in South Australia. Nevertheless, it was very bad news for the workers in that plant especially and for the economy of South Australia in general, although it was probably not as bad an economic shock as it might have been had it happened some time earlier.
For those who are not really aware of the development of the Mitsubishi factory, I can tell you that Mitsubishi’s Tonsley Park plant was opened in 1964 as the Australian manufacturing plant for Chrysler Australia. Chrysler then opened an engine manufacturing plant south of Adelaide in Lonsdale in 1968 to provide engines for the models being assembled at Tonsley Park. Then in 1980 the Tonsley Park plant was sold to Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and a new subsidiary, Mitshubishi Motors Australia Ltd, was formed to run the plant. At that time it produced the very popular Colt and Sigma range of vehicles, and they continued under the Mitsubishi range until the late 1980s, when production switched to the larger Magna and, later, Verada motor vehicles.
In the year 2000, Mitsubishi employed around 4,000 employees across the Lonsdale and Tonsley Park sites but by the early 2000s it was clear that the Magna/Verada line had aged considerably and approval for construction of a new vehicle was gained from Mitsubishi. A new car was engineered, and the Mitsubishi 380 was delivered to the market in 2005. In 2004, 670 workers at the Lonsdale engine plant and 350 at the Tonsley Park site were made redundant in response to a downturn in sales.
The car that arose out of the construction of the new vehicle, the Mitsubishi 380, did not achieve the success that was hoped for and has sold relatively poorly since its introduction in late 2005—down to as few as 50 cars a day. Finally, as I said, on 5 February this year it was announced that Mitsubishi would cease production of the 380 at Tonsley Park, effective at the end of this month. As a result, 930 direct jobs will be lost, and up to 2,000 jobs will be lost in industries supporting Mitsubishi’s manufacturing operations. Fortunately, the South Australian and federal governments have pledged $50 million towards retraining, Job Search and investment attraction.
I think one of the reasons that the unfortunate loss of the Mitsubishi plant is not as devastating as might be expected is that governments in South Australia and federally were acutely aware that there were a number of spin-off industries out of the motor manufacturing industry—a number of small to medium enterprises that relied on motor vehicle manufacturing in South Australia, in both the Mitsubishi and Holden plants. Fortunately a number of those smaller manufacturing industries have found other markets in other parts of the world and are successfully exporting to those markets. So although many people in those support industries will lose their jobs there will be some who will go on and continue to thrive.
I spoke at another time about the clusters project in northern Adelaide. That has been one of the reasons that some of these smaller plants have gone on to develop technologies that have enabled them to continue to manufacture well and innovatively, and to produce exports to the rest of the world. I am pleased to say that part of the Labor government’s plan is to assist that kind of manufacturing success story. As part of Labor’s $200 million Enterprise Connect initiative, $1.5 million has been committed to fund a Mapping the Connection project in the northern part of Adelaide. The idea is to examine the supply chain relationship between companies in northern Adelaide, as well as nationally and internationally, and then go on to develop strategies and programs to connect companies with one another and improve the supply chain opportunities.
That has already been successful, in a couple of instances, in a pilot project that was established in the northern suburbs. Those kinds of industry clusters have proved to be a magnet for direct foreign investment in Australia. An industry cluster has become a group of independent companies and associated institutions, including universities, that can both collaborate and compete. They do not necessarily need to be geographically concentrated but are linked by common technologies and skills, and some kind of governance or management arrangement is put in place.
That is one of the ways that the Labor government is looking to support innovation and exports in the manufacturing area. Another relatively small but significant program of the new Labor government will be retooling for climate change. There will be $75 million in grants which will particularly help small- to medium-sized companies meet the costs of such things as energy and water efficiency. This will be of great assistance to small to medium companies in the new era when companies need to be much more aware of environment change. Another program which will assist the northern suburbs is a $20 million grant to establish a manufacturing centre in Mawson Lakes in northern Adelaide. This is part of the larger manufacturing network program in which Labor will invest up to $100 million. This centre will work directly with manufacturing businesses to help them improve innovative capacity and will provide hands-on support for things such as benchmarking and managing the challenges of small business in that transitional growth period.
These are small but significant ways to allow businesses to cope with change in the manufacturing industry and to give them a bit of a lift-off to compete in a global market, which is becoming increasingly common. It is now becoming much more difficult to concentrate on just the domestic industry. Companies are beginning to understand that an export focus does assist them to grow and compete in today’s world. In the northern suburbs of Adelaide, an area where we are well poised to develop the kind of hub that will make an ideal manufacturing stronghold, we have widespread capabilities in ICT, defence, the automotive industry I have just discussed, electronics, mineral processing and food and wine. Many of those are growth areas and I expect, with a little bit of help, that those industries will grow and develop and will make the northern suburbs of Adelaide an even stronger manufacturing centre.
I briefly mentioned innovation and research and development, but that is not to say that I do not think that that is all important in developing an industry in Australia. I think we are beyond the phase when we can just stay with our current range of expertise. In fact, I think Australia, in its own borders, congratulates itself for its ability to innovate and develop good technologies and new processes that are practical and assist significant gains in the industry. But I think we have seen a slowdown in that in the past decade, because research and development was not a priority of the Howard government. It will be a great priority for the current government. The previous federal government cut the R&D tax concession, for example, from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. When you compare it to other areas, you see what a difference that kind of concession can make. The European benchmark is 150 per cent. In Malaysia, it is about 200 per cent. Across the European Union as a whole, there is also a 150 per cent R&D tax concession for science and innovation, as well as a €46 billion innovation and competitive program. Many of the major industrial companies around the world fund these kinds of programs. It is very important that the Rudd Labor government has adopted that with great enthusiasm and is determined to promote innovation and research and development.
We have the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research in the chamber at the moment. He has sent out the message, very loud and clear, that we, as a government, are wanting innovative research in all our tertiary institutions and that we expect much of that will feed back into our economy and businesses to enable Australia to once again position itself at the forefront of change and innovation and find itself new directions in the changing world. I am very excited about the direction that we are taking in industry, particularly, in my home state of South Australia. I commend the new government for the approach they have taken to that.
In the last few minutes that I have available I want to move slightly away from industry and talk about the changes to industrial relations that were mentioned in the Governor-General’s speech. It is a great relief for all of us in the Labor movement in Australia that we will see an end to Work Choices and the scrapping of that legislation and a relief to see the determination by our new Labor government to bring about changes to industrial relations legislation. Those of us who were out on the ground when campaigning hard all through last year heard story after story when we spoke to many people who were adversely affected by the Work Choices legislation. It was not just employees; it was also employers who had great difficulty coping with the red tape, the confusion and the conflict created by the Work Choices legislation. It was a divisive and difficult piece of legislation that did no good whatsoever for businesses and employees in Australia.
I am pleased that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has moved as swiftly as he said he would before the election to change that Work Choices legislation. I, and many people I know, look forward to seeing a more just and fair industrial relations system developed as a result of that. Of course, most employers want the best for their employees, but the Work Choices legislation too often opened loopholes that many unscrupulous employers used to screw down workers’ rights, pay and conditions.
The most glaring example I had when I was campaigning was a man who went to work for a printer in the northern suburbs. He had worked for that printer for three months and the printer asked to take him on permanently. The man asked if he could vary his hours by 15 minutes, starting 15 minutes earlier and finishing 15 minutes earlier, in order to pick up his child from school. That was refused and the man was sacked. He was not only sacked but refused his last two weeks wages on the grounds that he had not given proper notice. That man went through the Work Choices system trying to find some redress and was given none until the intervention of my office. That is the kind of unfair practice that was promoted under the Work Choices legislation that I very much look forward to seeing changed under this new government. The opposition has indicated that it will support that legislation, and I look forward to seeing that facilitated through the parliament in the next few weeks.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,34,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-03-12,"—In rising to reply to the Governor-General’s speech, I would like to acknowledge the great respect that I have for His Excellency and the manner in which he has served our nation as our leader. I think he has at all times conducted himself with great dignity and probity and brought a great deal of respect to the office, and I am sure that he will continue to make an outstanding contribution to Australian public life in the future. During His Excellency’s speech, he outlined a number of initiatives that the Rudd government is intending to pursue. These were detailed in the context of a new government coming into office. He said:
As one of the world’s oldest democracies, it is easy for us to take elections for granted and to fail to appreciate how fortunate we are, to live in a nation where governments change hands peacefully, as a result of the free expression of the will of the people.
Nothing could express the benefits of living in Australia more succinctly than what has been put there.
But what concerned me in His Excellency’s speech was the plan for realigning and reforming our federation in line with the Rudd government’s plans for an Oceania almost, an East Asia or a Eurasia, as have been outlined in George Orwell’s book Nineteen Eighty-Four. His Excellency said that Mr Rudd has:
... a plan of reforming the Federation by forming partnerships with the States and Territories to tackle the legitimate demands of working families for the delivery of better services from all levels of government ...
We do not need to reform the federation in order to get better outcomes and delivery of services for working families; we need state Labor governments to step up to the plate. It is not the responsibility of the federal government to interfere in service delivery, except where there has been a grotesque failure. And that is the challenge that the former government had to deal with for 11½ long years. We should not be messing with our federation. We should not be messing with our Constitution or even suggesting that we do so; it has stood the test of time for over 100 years. It was designed and developed to divide powers between the state and federal governments for the proper government of the country.
Mr Rudd, through his statements of reforming the federation, indicates that he wants to recast it in his image. He said that he wants to end the blame game. The blame game is simply the responsibility game—the responsibility that is spelt out so clearly in our Constitution. Mr Rudd has once again put forward more spin. He has put forward no real substance. He has created a very tight sound bite built around George Orwell’s Oceania where he will play the great oligarch of the party, as it was described, intent on having an all-conquering new order interfering in the everyday lives of Australians.
This contravenes the very nature of our country. It is one of the world’s most successful democracies, as acknowledged in the same process. It has been successful because there has been a very clear division of powers. That is not to suggest there are not areas in which it could improve. Of course there are areas in which it can improve, and the reason it needs to improve is that we have state governments that have been awash in money and spending it most unwisely, ignoring the important things that are meant to go on.
But Mr Rudd has started his prime ministership by trying to redefine the past. By redefining the past, he is casting doubt upon the economic and financial acumen of the previous government—a government that delivered 11½ years of sustained growth, delivered enormous budget surpluses, paid back $96 billion worth of Labor debt and maintained home mortgage interest rates at a lower level than they ever were under a previous Labor government and, indeed, lower than they ever have been under the present government. Mr Rudd has once again borrowed from George Orwell’s novel:
‘Who controls the past,’ ran the Party slogan, ‘controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.’
Mr Rudd is simply seeking to reinvent the past so he can frame his future around a need for drastic measures to sustain Australia’s prosperity. There are drastic measures needed to sustain Australia’s prosperity, but they involve a change of government, and that is going to be at least two or three years away.
We should not be changing our Constitution. Mr Rudd said he has a plan to change the federation. I ask: what plan is this? Have the Australian people been notified of or consulted about these changes that may affect our Constitution or, indeed, the way our federation functions? Simply because state Labor governments cannot fulfil their obligations—or will not fulfil their obligations, I should say—and are neglecting their responsibilities, constitutional change is not necessitated.
During the years of the Howard government, it became very clear that the Labor governments—states and territories—were incapable of properly delivering the services their constituents required, and that is why the federal government had no choice but to step in on multiple occasions and accept further responsibility in order to ensure that the people of Australia were not disadvantaged. But in this brave new world of cooperative federalism, Mr Rudd should be ensuring that the state Labor governments will fulfil their obligations to our broader community.
Rather than constitutional reform, Mr Rudd should be advocating a stronger system for ensuring that the state governments are picking up the areas that they are meant to have picked up. I am not a constitutional lawyer, but certainly I accept the fact that government should have a limited role in people’s lives. I also support the fact that our federation is the best means of ensuring that both service delivery and the national interest are represented at once.
Section 51 of the Australian Constitution highlights the important roles and responsibilities of the federal government. These go to core national issues like defence, marriage, foreign affairs, trade, taxation, communications, quarantine, fisheries and immigration. These are important issues for the government to fulfil to the very best of its ability. Outside of this, the residual powers that are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution reside with the states. I do not believe that this government should overstep the federal-state boundaries and try to stretch the Commonwealth’s powers beyond what is prescribed in our Constitution. Although I am not a constitutional lawyer, I believe that there are circumstances where it will be necessary to intervene in some particular areas. We can take legal advice on it and, indeed, the High Court has made rulings in this respect before.
Before we take the bold step of deciding to relieve the states of any of their burdens or of proposing a recasting of our federation, we have to ensure that we are not making state governments less and less accountable and less and less significant, lest they disappear altogether. Perhaps the ultimate aim of the campaign is to see the disappearance of state governments. But I have this view, which is rather old fashioned in some quarters, that state governments are better placed for service delivery because they are closer to the provision of services and to the needs of the community than the federal government can be.
It is interesting that as the state governments have received more and more funding over the course of the years they have been seen to be more and more wasteful in their use of this money. In my own state of South Australia, they once budgeted for an increase in public servants of some 600 people but ended up putting 6,000 people on the payroll. You cannot just have an oversight and add 10 times the number of people to the public payroll and then expect your books to balance. Indeed, it is an unfortunate state of being that the books no longer do balance.
State governments have incurred some $40 billion worth of debt and expect it to rise to over $80 billion over the course of the next few years. Why are they doing this? Because they know that the public do not hold them accountable; they hold the federal government accountable. We need to ensure that the public recognise which responsibilities lie with state governments and that the Commonwealth should not be picking up the tab simply because it is in the too-hard basket for them. Over the last decade we have seen the inadequate delivery of services at the state level until the Commonwealth has stepped in. Record tax windfalls have been going to state governments and yet they still squander these abundant resources. Mr Rudd has an obligation not to recast the federation and not to blur the lines of where responsibilities lie between federal and state governments but to make the state governments account for what they are doing and hold them to it.
It would make more sense to reform the federation from a regulatory sense rather than simply stepping in to the service delivery area. Reducing some areas of conflict between state governments would, I am sure, meet with a wide measure of support because what is good for people in one state is usually good for people in other states. Let me give you an example. Occupational health and safety is designed to protect workers and to provide safe working conditions. Why should the occupational health and safety regulations in South Australia be different from those in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia or anywhere else in Australia? The intention of these laws is to protect workers. The provision of a national regulatory regime would ensure that businesses could easily work across borders. It would ensure that there would be increased competition because people could transfer their labour and their skills across borders—business people could do that with their own staff. It would also ensure that we have a nationally compliant scheme in which changes could be effected very easily.
There are any number of regulatory areas where this would make very good sense. Another one would be consumer credit laws. I gave a speech in this place last year about—
—It was a very good speech.
—Thank you, Senator Abetz. I gave a speech about how consumer credit laws vary according to each state. In some states you can charge 48 per cent annual interest. In other states there are no caps on interest rate payments charged by short-term money lenders. In fact, you can roll additional fees into it, which means that some people are paying thousands of percentage points in interest per annum for short-term money.
These sorts of things need a national regulatory environment to protect consumers and ensure that there is standardisation across our country. Our country is simply too big and at the same time too small in population to have different regulations in each of our states across areas that have a commonality of interest. I suggest that that is where the focus of any reform should be. We should not be looking at replacing the service delivery obligations of the states. We should not be looking at reforming the role of our Constitution, which has supplied enormous stability and contributed to one of the world’s longest standing democracies and, I have to say, one of the greatest democracies anywhere in the world.
We need to have a consistent approach to this. We do not want to have Mr Rudd controlling the thought processes of all the state governments. We do not want to see George Orwell’s ultimate party solution coming forward. We want to see that anyone who has a voice and an opinion in this place will have it honoured and respected. Some of the early signs are very concerning. One of these of course has been the complete lack of commitment until last night about the future of the carers allowance, and there are still questions that need to be answered in this regard.
More disturbing was something that was brought to my attention earlier today. I am a very proud member of the parliamentary sports club. It is a bipartisan affair. It is an organisation which is committed to sport, to health and to ensuring that many of us will get out and be active and be good role models for the public. It is also designed to get our pollies healthier and fitter so that we can do our jobs even better than we currently do. It has met with great success in the five years or so that it has been established. It has raised about $100,000 for charitable purposes. It displays a sense of bipartisanship which fosters stronger relationships amongst our parliamentarians both domestically and internationally.
My concerns relate to a trip which was to be privately funded by our members of parliament individually and was scheduled to not only take a business delegation to England and France during the break but also engage with members of parliament in other countries both on the sporting field and outside the sporting field. No taxpayer funds, I understand, were going to be used for this. Yet when Mr Rudd’s office was advised that this trip was going to take place, I am told that the message that came back from his chief of staff, Mr Epstein, was that any Labor member who wanted a future in the Rudd government would not be going on this trip.
This is a despicable act by someone who is clearly prepared to rule the roost as some sort of oligarch. This is a problem for democracy in our system, and also for the charities that were going to be the beneficiaries of the $100,000 or so that was expected to be raised. This was a bipartisan delegation which has enjoyed wide support in the engagement with our international compatriots.
It is very disappointing and a very clear indication of how Mr Rudd intends to run his government and ultimately how he is going to ride roughshod over the states. I would hope that this is not the case but time will tell. I would only say to the people who are listening to this broadcast that we on the coalition side will continue to ensure that the states bear up to their responsibilities. We will do this through the state Liberal oppositions and through the federal coalition in this chamber as well, and I hope that we will return to a more balanced environment across Australia’s political system.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,34,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-03-12,"—I would like to join the address-in-reply to make a contribution on a very important issue, which is the wheat industry. ‘Working families’ was the mantra used by this Labor government to get elected. Now that it is in office, it emerges that families who work on the land are not included. I refer specifically to the thousands of wheat growers across Australia, who face the most radical overhaul of their structure in its history. They face the dismantling of over 60 years of marketing systems that were built around them and for them. Wheat growers who sow their crops today do not know what tomorrow will bring.
They will no longer have a buyer of last resort to purchase their wheat. They will no longer have a national pool or an estimated pool return which their bankers rely on to fund cropping and harvesting operations. They will not know whether they will get paid for their wheat when they do sell. They will not know whether or not to build storage facilities. They will not know whether their buyers will be able to transport their wheat to a port or whether there will be a ship to take it to its market.
They will not know how to be players in an international market characterised by foreign subsidies and sophisticated financial instruments. They no longer have any say in a market dominated by international multinational corporations responsible to their shareholders. Australian wheat growers no longer face a market where they command a guaranteed quality premium. They will be picked off by large grain traders and will experience larger price fluctuations and lower returns than they have experienced for generations.
The impact of this will be a marked increase in instability in the wheat industry in Australia. That means thousands of growers and their families, suppliers and local communities face a future of uncertainty and greatly increased risk to their livelihoods. This issue has not gained a lot of attention in the day-to-day world of politics. Believe me, there is nothing more serious to hundreds of thousands of Australians reliant on the wheat industry than the impending extinction of the single desk marketing arrangements for wheat exports.
These changes are going to be implemented without the government doing its homework on what will happen as a result. If the government does not know what is going to happen, how on earth can wheat growers be expected to judge their position? We know that the government has done nothing in this regard because we were told so in the estimates committee. In the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport estimates, I specifically asked whether the department had done any work, research studies or modelling on the effects of all this wheat hitting the market at one time. The answer came straight back from the department representative, who said, ‘No, we haven’t.’ I made the point that there is a great concern out there that if the wheat comes off quickly and all goes to the ports at one time there will be total confusion and chaos. I was told that I had identified a serious issue and that the minister is aware in broad terms of the issues around grain transport.
Growers are also concerned about whether their premium price for quality wheat would be maintained in the absence of a single desk for exports. People were prepared to buy Australian wheat at a premium because the quality standards were high and they were prepared to go that little extra way. So I asked at estimates: who will now be in charge of guaranteeing the high standards of Australian wheat if three, four or 10 people have licences to sell? Who is going to be responsible for guaranteeing the high standard of wheat exports? The answer to that was that part of the government’s policy commitment on wheat marketing is to establish an industry expert group to advise on a range of issues around the implementation of the new policy. I think that it would be a good thing to get the answers from that committee before we implemented this brave new world.
That is all very well, but it is too late. That sort of information analysis should have been done before the government committed to a policy that they obviously have not thought through. They should know what the policy is before inflicting general mayhem on such an important national industry. The government does not even know how wheat quality will be tested under the new regime. As a department official told me in estimates,
... we do not know what the details of that will be at this point, but the minister has established an industry expert group to give him advice ...
I also asked a question on the handling infrastructure of the wharves. There will be increased pressure on those as everyone tries to get the wheat out at the highest possible price and at the earliest possible time. I asked whether there had been any modelling done on that. ‘Not that I am aware of,’ was the answer from the department. I pushed further. There will be increased cost with the pressure on port facilities. I asked whether the minister had been advised of those likely increased costs. I was told:
It is not at all clear what might be the outcome for bulk handlers, in terms of costs or otherwise, of the new wheat marketing arrangements. At this stage, we are keeping a watch on that issue ...
…            …            …
We cannot say anything definitive about what might be put in place at this stage because no decisions have been taken. It is an issue that we are aware of and we are certainly keeping under scrutiny the development of the new arrangements.
I tried to make it clearer for the people charged with inflicting this policy on wheat growers. I asked:
Has the department advised the minister that there will be considerable problems when a grower rocks up to the bank manager and says, ‘I want $200,000 to put the crop in,’ and the bank manager says, ‘Well, how much are you going to get?’ He says, ‘Well, I don’t know, because there’s no export pool returns.’ Is the minister aware of that?
In return, I was given a lecture on how:
... all growers have access to all the information that is necessary for them to make a reasonable estimate of the price. They have access over the internet to the Chicago and Kansas boards of trade figures on a daily basis and they can work back through the freight and other issues to work out a price.
So the government expects every wheat grower to do for himself what the Australian Wheat Board has been doing with an army of experts for him over 60 years.
The obvious question for the government is: if the department does not know what the effect of deregulation will be on the price, transport costs and availability, how on earth does it expect the wheat grower and his local bank manager to figure it out? I asked this question:
... is the minister aware of the problems of not having estimated pool returns? You say that a farmer may be skilled and he may even be able to employ someone, if he has a huge farm, to advise him. But the average guy that has 4,000, 5,000 or 6,000 acres is not going to be able to estimate what the price will be—and even if he does, it will be a wild guess. The bank manager is not going to be interested in his estimations. He wants to know what price he—
the farmer—
is going to get. If he does not know what price he is going to get, he will not lend him money. I ask you whether you have advised—as you should have—the problems of not having a pool will cause?
As everyone in the industry knows, if the pool goes, it will undermine the domestic return. Once the pool goes, the domestic market will probably go down with it. But no-one from the government could give me an answer. Once again, if the industry basically operates from a widely accepted yardstick, which is the estimated pool return, how does the market work without it? How does the bank manager know what to lend? How does the grower work out how much he needs to plant and to borrow for the planting? How does he know the transport costs or when he will get paid? How does he know if there is a ship waiting to take his wheat or a truck ready to deliver it to the port? All of these things have been in place for 60 years. All of a sudden, he has to face a scorched earth policy when it comes to getting his wheat to market. And the government that has put him in that position cannot give him any advice as to what will happen.
At estimates, I asked:
What is going to happen if we get a bumper crop, say 24 million tonnes or 25 million tonnes, and we do not have the capacity to get that wheat out, we do not have the infrastructure? In previous terms, that wheat was sent out over 12 or 18 months. Have you advised the minister what would happen in a situation of oversupply with no buyer of last resort?
I was merely told that the minister was aware of the issue. So I tried again. I said:
Let me put this to you: you have a 25 million tonne crop and facilities to get rid of 12 million tonnes or 18 million tonnes, and quite a lot of it is under canvas, under cover—who is going to buy it? You cannot sell it because you cannot get it out. The domestic market is full. It is sitting there under canvas. Who goes out and buys that wheat?
I was told:
... growers do not necessarily have to sell or price their wheat at the price that is pertaining at harvest time. They can store the wheat.
So I asked the obvious follow-up question:
How do they store it if all the facilities are full and it is under canvas? ... A lot of them do not have a lot of storage facilities; most of them do not.
I explained:
In the event of a bumper crop ... no-one is going to wait for a better price when every silo is full, every railway carriage is full and every wharf is under strain. No-one is going to be able to sell it for a reasonable price, because the price will go down. ... Surely, as a competent department, you would have done modelling to show the best possible scenario and the worst possible scenario. ... I imagine that some modelling would have been done.
But the response was:
I will not make any comment on that; it would be improper for me to do so. All I will say is that the department is simply implementing the government’s policy commitments consistent with that.
This dialogue reveals what little thought has been invested in Labor’s policy, what little professional analysis has gone into it as well as the lack of input from the growers. It is alarming that this industry has been subject to a major upheaval with so many key questions unanswered.
The government has thrown the industry up in the air like a pack of cards and no-one knows where they will land, least of all the poor wheat grower who has to make decisions now about how much to plant. This is a major industry whose future is at stake.
After the dismal performance of the government at estimates hearings, I placed further questions on notice, which of course have yet to be answered. They provide a good summary of the unknowns afflicting the growers as they prepare to sow this next season’s crop, which I believe is being planted at the moment. My questions on notice were:
Can the department advise whether the minister will be in a position to inform Australian wheat growers how the new export wheat marketing arrangements will affect them?
Has the department provided advice to the minister on how growers will be affected if the government-accredited exporter fails to pay growers?
What safeguards or protections for growers has the department investigated, should government-accredited exporters fail to pay or delay to pay their wheat suppliers?
What measures are being considered to provide assistance for the comprehensive education of wheat growers in the world of international trading, hedging, futures contracts and associated financial dealings to prepare growers faced for the first time with these decisions under new marketing arrangements?
Has the department considered and provided advice to the minister of the ramifications of growers not having a guaranteed buyer for the wheat crop for the first time in over 60 years?
Has the department taken steps to advise the minister of the great uncertainty for, and marketing vulnerability of, growers as they sow the 2008 crop without any explanation about the proposed new marketing program that will apply for the sale of that crop?
Has the department evaluated the government’s proposed wheat marketing policy in terms of its impact on working family growers?
Has the department investigated whether Australia’s wheat growers will be forced into absorbing added biosecurity risk management costs with the introduction of multiple sellers likely to lead to a breakdown in current grain hygiene controls and established systems of grain handling and transport?
Has the department advised the minister of the financial and moral impact on working family growers of the present two to six years of drought?
Has the department assessed the impact on farm family income in a deregulated wheat export market dominated by international corporations seeking to maximise returns to foreign shareholders rather than Australian working family growers?
Has the department assessed the advantages and disadvantages of removing the strict controls over the AWB group that is set out in the Wheat Marketing Act?
Has the department sought to consult the Australian Bankers Association on the financial implications for Australian wheat growers under the government’s proposal to repeal the current Wheat Marketing Act?
Has the department sought input from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and/or his department on wheat growers’ concerns that under the government’s proposed wheat marketing arrangements there would be serious issues of road safety, more rail closures, greater port congestion and higher transport carbon emissions?
Has the department done any work to assess how a majority of export growers will receive cash flow when their grain is no longer taken up by the national pool? Is it true that traditionally some 30 per cent of the export remains unsold on the international market 12 to 18 months after harvest with the unsold wheat being rolled into the succeeding pool and growers always assured of receiving cash flow by way of pool distributions or by entering into harvest loans based on their tonnage delivery and the estimated pool return? How is this matter being addressed in the government’s wheat policy?
Unfortunately, all we have are questions, questions and more questions. The government has no answers. This is a very unhealthy climate in which to implement radical structural change to a market where Australia has historically performed well. This is not the way to help working families in wheat districts; this is the way to chaos in a major market with ramifications not only for the nation’s wheat growers but also for the nation’s transport infrastructure and export performance sectors. I urge the Rudd Labor government to pull back from implementing such widespread change without getting some, at least some, of these answers in place.
I conclude by quoting the words of wheat growers themselves through the Wheat Export Marketing Alliance:
The government has no marketing plan or understanding of how to deal with the inequities and problems that will arise from its legislation. ... Managing this rushed transition will be immensely difficult, particularly for wheat growers who are being forced into planning for their future in an information vacuum at the grower level.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,34,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2008-03-12,"—This address-in-reply debate presents an opportunity to reflect on the remarkable level of activity of the Rudd government to date. I would like to begin by reflecting on what was the extraordinary opening week of the 42nd Parliament, with the historic apology and acknowledgement of the sorrow we all express to Indigenous people on behalf of the Australian parliament for the stolen generation.
It was quite an emotional day for many people, but for my part it was something that was long overdue. There was a sense in the Canberra community that at last a great wrong was set right and that it was the beginning of an extensive program of public policy to try and rectify the injustices and inequities that still exist with respect to the Indigenous peoples of Australia.
I would also like to mention the significance of the welcome to country that occurred in the Members’ Hall of Parliament House on that day. It has been a feature of many a state and territory government, but I particularly acknowledge the efforts of the Stanhope Labor government here in the ACT and their welcome to country and acknowledgement of the Ngunawal elders. To see our very dear friend Matilda House participate in this very formal way in the opening of parliament was a wonderful moment, and one that I found very moving.
Members of the Rudd Labor government are all committed to make sure that the apology was the beginning of a fresh start. It is about forging a new partnership between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and a very specific strategy to close the gap on key health, education and employment differentials that exist. I also acknowledge the bipartisan nature of the commitments made on the day of the national apology, and look forward to working constructively with all parties represented in both houses of parliament to make this fresh start a reality.
Along with the other ACT senator, Senator Humphries, and my colleagues in the other place, it is a privilege to represent the Australian Capital Territory and the nation’s capital. With only five years to go until the centenary of the national capital it is appropriate to reflect upon some of the principles and efforts made that led to the creation of Canberra. One of the motivations was to resolve, once and for all, some of the historic rivalries between the states and create a national capital so that Australians could feel that there was once place that was truly representative of them all. Obviously, the parliament is the greatest symbol of our democracy in that regard, but its home here in Canberra is a very tangible symbol of what it is to be a Commonwealth—a federated democracy. The privilege we have in representing this particular constituency is something that is not lost on me, nor on my colleagues. Back then, Canberra very much represented a fresh start and there is some relationship with the fresh start that we all felt and participated in at the beginning of this 42nd Parliament—embarking on a concerted effort to resolve those inequities that exist with our Indigenous population.
Reflecting on the last 11 years, one negative was the sore point for many Canberrans that the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, chose not to live in Canberra. This is something that echoed back to me throughout the 11½ years that they were in government: people here in Canberra, and elsewhere, took personal offence to this. Whatever justifications the Prime Minister may have had at the beginning, they were certainly not the same justifications he could rely upon at the end of his term. That continuing, very powerful symbolic rejection of Canberra as the personal home of the Prime Minister and the home of our federated democracy really delved its way deeply into the psyche of many Canberrans and also people beyond our borders.
I was extremely thrilled and proud to see that there were no such inhibitions on behalf of Mr Rudd, our Prime Minister, and his family. I have enjoyed the commentary about their settling into Canberra as their home and know the excitement of many Canberrans on seeing the Rudds or the Prime Minister out and about on our streets. It is something that we are really lucky to have as a community. It is part and parcel of the wonderful combination of being such a diverse and vibrant community in our own right and yet having this very grave and important responsibility of being the national capital.
The Rudd Labor government has hit the ground running, working hard to take on the challenges left to us by what can only be described as a lazy and complacent government. There are very specific issues of neglect which I will comment on in due course. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge some of the initiatives that have been taken by the Rudd government in the first 100 days.
I have already mentioned the primary importance of the national apology, and another very important first step was to ratify the Kyoto protocol. It was just yesterday that the 90 days ticked over and we are formally part of the global community working together to fight the particular challenge of global warming and climate change. Finally, we are part of that movement and we, as a government, recognise the need for very specific and decisive action at all levels, even at the very micro level of households and communities. Every sphere of government has a role to play. Local government has, in many respects, driven a lot of the community based initiatives with respect to managing energy consumption, waste management and design of more energy efficient communities. State governments have led the way in committing to the specific goals with respect to energy conservation and climate change. Now, finally, that national sentiment is wrapped up and reflected in the policies of the federal government—the Rudd Labor government, post their election in 2007.
Not least of the Rudd government’s initiatives is the introduction into the federal parliament of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, through which the government is replacing the unfair Work Choices laws with a new workplace relations system that delivers fairness for employees, flexibility for employers and long-term productivity growth for our economy. I will come back to the issue of productivity growth shortly. But I would like to take this opportunity to say to all those working Australians who found it within their hearts and minds to focus on the issue of workplace relations leading up to the last election that it was without doubt a significant factor in the outcome of the election. The line had been crossed on what most Australians considered to be a fair and sensible balance in our workplace and industrial relations system. I think the outcome of the election showed that, in the minds of most Australians, the Howard government had crossed the line for what was acceptable. It has been quite fascinating to watch some of the convolutions of the opposition since this bill has been in parliament over how they will respond to it. I think they know, deep down in their hearts, that their policy was extreme. It frightened people. It was excessive. It was ideological. And it certainly had no place in the practical, good operation of a healthy and growing economy in the 21st century.
When the Rudd government won office it inherited inflation at its highest level in 16 years and interest rates at the second highest level amongst advanced economies. We now know that, while the Howard government was asleep at the wheel, our productivity growth was falling and, slowly but steadily, inflation was again let loose in the Australian economy, resulting in numbers for Australia that are significantly above those for most OECD economies. So it is not surprising that the Rudd government moved immediately to make fighting inflation an absolute priority. We are now implementing a five-point plan on inflation, designed very specifically to put downward pressure on interest rates. I will run through those points briefly: strong budget surpluses achieved by reducing waste in government spending, encouraging private savings, tackling skills shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks, and lifting productivity and workforce participation. All of these strategies require a great deal of diligence and focus, and that is what they will get from the Rudd government.
The inflation problem we are facing did not emerge overnight; it has been building for some time. For 1½ years underlying inflation had been running at around the upper end of the Reserve Bank’s two to three per cent inflation target band. So it is a fact that the inflation challenge we face today is a direct consequence of policy neglect in the past. The Howard government fuelled inflationary pressures in the economy by feeding demand with massive and unproductive spending bribes during the election period, and in the period leading up to that, whilst ignoring the growing infrastructure bottlenecks and, very importantly, the growing skills shortages which had the effect of choking capacity in the economy. For over a decade, spending was not directed to the challenges on the horizon or to boosting the productive capacity of our economy. I recall that even in the late 90s, in the first two terms of the Howard government, the need to invest in the skills that would drive our economic growth in the future was a raging issue. So this is not an issue that the former government, now the opposition, can say snuck up on them. On the Labor side we had a consistent commentary right through the period of the Howard government about the need to invest in skills, in trades, in education and higher education in order to set ourselves up to make the most of the economic growth opportunities that would present themselves in the global economy in the 21st century. But the then government’s spending was not directed to those urgent needs and priorities. They presided over an unprecedented boom off the back of record terms of trade but failed to make those critical investments in skills, as I have mentioned, and also in infrastructure.
We know that with an economy operating at close to full capacity the only way we will be able to achieve sustained improvement in incomes over time is to direct our policy efforts towards expanding the productive capacity of the economy. A decade of neglect of the twin investment deficits, in infrastructure and in skills, has meant that our economy has been ill-prepared to deal with the demand surge flowing from the terms of trade boom. The best platform for economic prosperity in the long term is a well-educated population and a skilled workforce. We know that, and that is why the Rudd government has begun implementing its program for an education revolution—from early learning in schools, to primary and high school education, to tech colleges and universities, to research and development and innovation policy. It is part of the urgent needs of this country that we were talking about back when I was involved in the Knowledge Nation investigations under a previous leader of Labor—
—Noodle nation!
—You can ridicule Knowledge Nation all you like. I think it is a testimony to the credibility of Labor’s education revolution that we have been focused consistently over many years on the need for investment in education at all levels. It has been the Howard government that has scoffed at and ridiculed the need for this kind of investment—to our peril as a nation, and obviously exacerbating the very specific economic challenges that we now face as a country.
The Rudd Labor government, with all of the initiatives that I have outlined and the pressing economic priorities facing us, particularly that of reducing inflation, have a tough challenge ahead of us. But the Rudd Labor government’s agenda to date and our performance in the first 100 days of government will inspire and fill with confidence the people of Australia that at last they have a government that understands the true nature of what stands before us.
Prior to a Rudd Labor government, the people of Australia were faced with a series of obfuscations and misleading and manipulative policy statements, which fuelled inflationary pressures and sought to inflame growing problems, not fix them. Fortunately for all of us, with the solid foundations of a very conservative fiscal approach to managing our economy, the Rudd Labor government has come through with the right mix of policy solutions across a vast range of portfolios to start setting things right.
Our Prime Minister is the first one to say that this is not going to be easy. The depth of the challenge that faces our economy in dealing with infrastructure, skills shortages and in placing downward pressure on inflation is profound. But I think it is true to say that Labor will face a tougher test in the minds of many on how we perform in these difficult circumstances. I certainly think that the tough test will be passed with flying colours, as once again it is a federal Labor government that does the truly hard yards when it comes to managing Australia’s economy, not the easy pickings riding on reforms of the previous Labor government that we saw from the Howard government and not the consummate neglect that we experienced for the last 11 years which hark right back to some of those early budgets in 1996 and 1997. I am showing my age now, but I remember how research and development and innovation funding was slashed to the very bone in the 1996, 1997 and 1998 budgets and how difficult it was at the time to sustain any hope that the then government, the Howard government, had any eye to the future whatsoever about preparing us for the challenges of a global economy in the 21st century.
All I can say is that I have complete confidence in my colleagues to manage the agenda. We are focused on the industries of the future. We are focused on fixing the problems of the past. I am very proud to stand here as part of the Rudd Labor government and to be part of this forward agenda because it is one that will change the shape of Australia. It will inspire confidence amongst all of the people of Australia that we have a plan. It is a positive plan, it is a plan that is going to be accountable and that fully engages with people, and it is starting right now with the performance of our first 100 days. I look forward to the ongoing activities of a truly inspiring government that has everyone talking positively about the prospects for Australia’s future in the global economy and society of the 21st century.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,34,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2008-03-12,"—I have listened to a few speeches today and I must say that there is a common thread coming through from the Labor government. They have all been picking up on their leader’s, the Prime Minister’s, style of speaking. It is just so full of rhetoric. The previous speaker, Senator Lundy, who is well known in that department, surpassed herself today. She filled in her last five minutes with circular praise of her own government. It was all full of rhetoric. I beg the government, conceding that you won the last election: get down and govern and stop the rhetoric and the commissions and the new statutory authorities and the committees. Just get down and govern. You do not need the rhetoric anymore. You can leave that to oppositions, if you like. There is a definite common thread. Not from you, Senator Sherry, because you have served in previous governments. You get down to the nitty-gritty. You are that sort of person. I do not like to eat into my own time because I do have a set speech here, but I had to make the point on air to anyone listening to the previous speaker that Labor government speakers have got up one after another and just simply espoused rhetoric that their own leader would be proud of. I make that point.
In my address to the Senate today, I would like to say that it is now some five years to the month since a coalition of the willing led by the United States armed forces, in which Australia was of course included, began an offensive into Iraq with the aim of toppling the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. This pre-emptive strike in March 2003 against a regime which not only had harboured terrorists but had involved itself in terrorist activity was undertaken in the height of the atmosphere of the early days of the war on terror. The Senate will clearly recall the shock of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Centre where some 3,000 people were killed in the most horrifying circumstances, Australians included. And of course there were the October 2002 Bali bombings where some 202 lives were lost. The majority of those were Australian.
It is true to say that the war on terror is now receiving less media attention and that there is less social angst here in Australia and even fewer successful terrorist attacks in Indonesia where we suffered our worst attack against Australians predominantly because of the policy of pre-emption against terrorist activities and cells and of course the laws that were put in place that have armed our security forces to act in the interests of our citizens.
Ironically, though, it is fair to say that while all this has occurred—and it is a very good place to be—nevertheless the war is no weaker in its intensity and purpose. Ironically, the level of combat in Afghanistan today is as great and as precarious as it was at the beginning, in 2001, when the offensive was led against the Taliban regime. In the other theatre of war, Iraq, it is true to say that the stakes have always been very high in winning that war and establishing a free and democratic nation. The former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, put it succinctly in 2006:
... global terrorism is so anxious to stop us in Iraq and Afghanistan—because if they succeed in that then they stop the possibility of democracy taking the place of religious fanaticism in these countries. Whereas if we succeed and if democracy takes root in Iraq and Afghanistan then I think, after that, global terrorism is on a downhill path.
Further, the consequences of a democratic Iraq will mean democracy does work in the Arab world and it will set undercurrents throughout the whole of the Middle East for greater freedoms and fair democratic elections in a region ruled by oppressors and dictators.
It has been in this time of democratic transition that the insurgents have most fanatically tried to whip up a civil war between the Sunnis and the Shiites to head off the path of democracy. But no fear, no threat and no bloodshed has halted the people of Iraq’s desire for democracy. Just look how far the people of Iraq have come. In around January 2005, 8.5 million Iraqis, under the serious threat of violence, came out to vote for an interim government. Some 10 months later, 10 million people took part in a vote on a referendum. Several months later, 12 million people, or 75 per cent of the eligible voters, came out to vote for a national assembly—a parliament. In that span of 12 months there had been three elections, each one bigger than the one before, and there can be no doubt of the Iraqi people’s rejection of the insurgents’ mad ideology. They want to win against the insurgents and the terrorists.
While there have been many dim days, particularly in the latter part of 2005 and in 2006, when it seemed that the terrorists were unstoppable and were really doing serious damage against the fledgling democracy in Iraq, it is now true to say that the worst periods of blood and terror in Iraq seem to be over, at least in terms of frequency. But we are quite often reminded of the depths of evil that the terrorists will stoop to. Just one month ago or thereabouts we all saw on the news services the marketplace that was bombed in one of the worst killing sprees in Iraq. Hundreds of women and children were gathered there and some 100-plus were killed. Two mentally disabled women—they had Down syndrome—had bombs strapped to them, probably unbeknownst to them, because the bombs were triggered from afar. That is the depth that terrorists will go to—to use people in such a way in a terrorist act and indiscriminately blow up marketplaces.
Nevertheless the worst may well be behind the country. The progress can be measured in three benchmarks: firstly, the strengthening of the democratic processes; secondly, security of the Iraqi people; and, thirdly, the diminishing activity of the terrorists. Without doubt, the tactical change in combating the insurgents, called the ‘surge’, which commenced in full in June 2007, where extra United States troops—I believe around 30,000—were sent to Iraq to quell the increase in terrorist attacks, has been the turning point from those very dark days of late 2005 and 2006. Stability is now within reach; security in the worst areas like Baghdad has improved greatly. According to US military figures, monthly attacks have decreased by 60 per cent since June 2007 and are now at the same levels as they were in around 2004. Civilian deaths are down approximately 75 per cent since a year ago. From January to December 2007 sectarian attacks decreased some 90 per cent in the Baghdad districts. Over the past year thousands of extremists in Iraq have been captured or killed, including hundreds of al-Qaeda leaders and operatives.
So it is worth noting that the improved security situation in Iraq has come not just from the surge provided by the United States but from a growing Iraqi security force that grew by over 100,000 in 2007 and now stands at half a million. As never before, concerned locals citizen groups have sprung up in the neighbourhoods volunteering to support security. There are some 80,000 members of this semi-militia group. But, along with these security improvements, equally encouraging, if not inspiring, to this step forward in security are the parliamentary improvements—the democratic improvements.
In a recent report Condoleezza Rice said:
In Iraq, the presence and role of the US and our coalition partners have been authorised by UN resolutions. The current UN authorisation expires at the end of this year, and Iraq has indicated that it will not seek an extension. It would rather have an arrangement more in line with what typically governs the relationships between two sovereign nations.
She went on to say:
There is little doubt that 2008 will be a year of critical transition in Iraq as our force levels continue to come down, as our mission changes and as Iraqis continue to assert their sovereignty. But to continue the success we have seen in recent months, the Iraqi people and government will continue to need our help. Iraqis have requested a normalized relationship with us, and such a relationship will be part of a foundation of success in Iraq—a foundation upon which future U.S. administrations can build.
Australia has been at the forefront of building that success. Australia has contributed in a most valuable fashion. Around 1,000 Australian Defence Force personnel have carried out, and are still carrying out, vital activities in Iraq. They are engaged in coalition efforts to train the Iraqi army and coastal defence forces; ADF air traffic controllers support coalition air operations; reconnaissance and transport aircraft further support coalition tasks; and our Navy continues to patrol the waters around Iraq. ADF personnel also guard the Australian representative office in Baghdad, thereby allowing our diplomats to carry out vital duties.
This is the report card on Iraq. It is very encouraging. The part played by our armed forces is a proud achievement. It is indeed a proud achievement for our country to believe in a cause and to meet and fight the terrorists front-on, to help establish democracy and to help a people who want democracy established. It has not been easy; it has been testing, but we have stayed the course. Having said that—having heard the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, in the House the other day trumpeting and smarting on the recent announcement of pulling out some 515 troops from the Overwatch Battle Group—the grounds on which it was announced that the troops were pulling out are disappointing and even shameful.
We all know that that particular battle group of personnel had in fact done their job and reached a point where a decision had to be made. There were several options: to redeploy, to redeploy some of them, or to bring them all home. The point I want to make is that, while any government would have confronted that decision, the foreign minister smarted on the reasons they should come home: that they should never really have gone, it was never a just cause and they should not even be there helping the Iraqi people establish a democracy. That is basically what he was trumpeting. In his view, the purpose in the beginning, and the end, was never justified. I would say to the new government that they have let down the very service personnel who were sent to serve there—who sought to do their job for a good cause and who have had to put themselves in harm’s way—by totally belittling the reason they were there in the first place. Those that served are entitled to better. They are entitled to better from a foreign minister, a position that requires smart words not a belittling of the force.
This has similarities to the Vietnam pullout—I will not say it is as bad or as dramatic, but all the trumpeting and smarting of why our troops ought to be pulled off the front line are still there and still deep rooted in the Labor Party. They have never understood what is going on in Iraq. I have just given you a report card on the Iraqi situation and it is a growing success. As a country, we ought to be proud of it and we ought not to belittle those that have served there. Instead, the government has reinforced all the prejudices that the Labor Party bring to making decisions in regard to our defence forces and all the suspicions that they cannot stay the course, will not stay the course, on the war on terror. They have completely missed the point.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This document, the report pursuant to section 440A of the Migration Act on the conduct of the Refugee Review Tribunal Reviews not completed within 90 days, for the period 1 July 2007 to 31 October 2007, is a report from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on protection visa applications, as is required under subsection 91(Y) of the Migration Act. It is similar to the previous document on the Order of Business, which I chose not to speak to, with regard to Refugee Review Tribunal decisions that took more than 90 days. It is worth noting that the requirement to table this report goes back to amendments made to the Migration Act in 2005. It was part of some agreements that the then government made, in part in response to pressure from some of their backbenchers, Mr Georgiou and Mr Broadbent in particular, amongst a few others. It related to the extreme level of public concern, certainly amongst a significant proportion of the public, about the very long period of time that people were in immigration detention.
One of the reasons why people were in immigration detention for prolonged periods was the long period of time it took for decisions to be made, whether they were review decisions or initial visa decisions. There are a couple more documents on this list that I will speak to in a moment which go further on the detention issue, but the simple fact is that it would not matter so much if these initial decisions on protection visa applications—which are refugee applications—took more than 90 days if, in many cases, the people who were putting in the applications were not locked up during the decision-making process and while the administrative wheels turned. To me that is the key problem.
If you remove mandatory detention, if you remove the requirement for people to be locked up until their visa applications are determined and if you have a normal, sensible, rational and far cheaper approach of enabling people who are not health, security or flight risks to be out in the community whilst their application is determined, then it would be less of a problem when you have delays. It should be emphasised that a number of people who apply for protection visas are out in the community, which gives the lie to the suggestion that there is some sort of inherently unsafe thing in having people who have made refugee claims being out in the community. We have many of them out in the community now, all the time. They are already here on some other form of visa. It is only people who have either had their visa cancelled for various reasons or arrived without a valid visa who are left locked up—and locked up for some periods of time. That is why it is of particular importance that the decisions sometimes take longer than 90 days.
The simple response of removing the requirement for mandatory detention is the obvious action, and that certainly needs to happen. But we do need to look at why the applications listed here took more than 90 days, and the reasons are given in this report. One reason that comes up frequently—it is certainly not the majority, but it is quite frequent—is the delay because of an external agency, namely a security assessment from a relevant agency, usually ASIO. This is an issue I have raised at Senate estimates a number of times, as well as in the Senate chamber. It is outside the control of the immigration department a lot of the time. They can make their assessment quite quickly, but the security assessment can take quite a long period of time, particularly when you are talking about the initial decision.
A few of the applications here took over two years, for example, and that was due to an external agency security assessment clearance. That highlights to me that we need to be focusing more on ensuring that ASIO does its task as quickly as possible. I know it is something they are looking at—or they have said they are looking at it, because that is what they told me at estimates—but I would urge the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Minister Evans, in examining some of the problems with people being in detention for prolonged periods of time, to also look at this aspect and what he can do, perhaps in conjunction with the new Attorney-General, to ensure that that process is sped up so that security assessments are done more promptly. It should be noted that, according to ASIO’s own figures, not a single refugee applicant in Australia has been rejected on security grounds. So any suggestion that this group is a significant security risk is not borne out by the facts. (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2008-03-12,"—This evening I rise to draw to the Senate’s attention the work of a tremendous community based organisation, working with Aboriginal families in remote Central Australia—the Waltja Tjutangku Palyapayi Aboriginal Corporation or as we commonly know it in the Centre, Waltja. It grew out of the Central Australian Family Resource Centre, which began operating in 1993. The National Family Resource Centre Program—a Commonwealth initiative back then under the former Labor government of course—provided funding to organisations assisting families in the areas of advocacy, development of family services, information provision, education and training and needs identification. Following the withdrawal of Commonwealth funding in 1997, the Family Resource Centre members decided to incorporate as an Aboriginal association. This incorporated entity now has the distinction of celebrating its 10th anniversary this week of doing good work with families.
Waltja is an advocate for community based services and a mediating organisation linking Aboriginal people in remote communities to service providers and funding bodies. Waltja is also a service provider, providing training, health, nutrition, disability and youth services under Commonwealth and Northern Territory funded programs. It is, in short, an invaluable contributor to social service provision in the Northern Territory, in particular around Central Australia.
This week, Waltja is celebrating 10 years of working to improve the position of Aboriginal families living in remote communities in Central Australia. Women from Waltja’s member communities will all be in Alice Springs to celebrate Waltja’s work and to acknowledge its various funding bodies and partner organisations. Celebrations began last Saturday at Witchettys in the Araluen Arts Precinct with the fundraising art exhibition, where a large collection of paintings donated by Papunya Tula artists were exhibited.
Painted canvas diary covers by well-known artists are a feature of the exhibition. In fact, the painted canvas diary covers are a feature of quite a number of people I know around the Northern Territory who use them as folders and protectors for their diaries. There are also items such as wooden artefacts, painted enamel cups and seed necklaces. Indeed over 1,000 original art works were displayed, from which many will be sold with the proceeds going towards supporting Waltja’s capacity to address emergency relief and community support needs.
Today marks the launch of Waltja’s 10 year story a publication outlining its achievements. As a Waltja committee spokesperson proudly explained:
... we’ll have—
at the launch—
all the women who can get in from the communities here in this important week. We are really proud of Waltja. We work strongly together—committee and staff, black and white. Waltja works with the remote families and communities to help keep the services running the way we want them to. It has been a hard few years and things are still pretty confusing for people in the communities targeted by the intervention. But things are sounding better with the new federal government and their big apology. We have still got lots to celebrate.
Indeed, senators should be celebrating the existence and success of bodies such as Waltja, a body which is governed by a strong and active management committee made up of senior Aboriginal women who meet regularly and have direct involvement in delivering programs and services. Waltja’s workers are on the road and are living or working in the remote communities most of the time. In fact, I have met members of Waltja conducting workshops in quite a large number of remote communities in and around the Central Desert.
Waltja operates according to crucial community development principles for Aboriginal self-determination. It recognises that the family is the foundation of the Aboriginal community and Indigenous identity and that service delivery is most effective when it occurs in the context of the broad family, as understood by Aboriginal people, and in partnership with Aboriginal people. Waltja also lives the idea that the most effective services are provided by local community people who have access to training and ongoing support. To this end Waltja workers and its management committee provide workshops and one-on-one training and support for remote communities to develop and manage their own services, such as child care, out-of-school-hours care, youth programs, disability brokerages, aged care and nutrition and research programs. They help with funding applications, governance, operational plans, recruiting and employment, staff support and training, and financial management.
With regard to training, Waltja is also a registered training organisation—an RTO—which helps Indigenous people to obtain Certificates I and II in Business, which are nationally recognised qualifications. Waltja has been granted funding and support for this training from the Northern Territory Department of Employment, Education and Training and from the Commonwealth’s DEEWR, under the joint Indigenous funding pool. This is testament to Waltja’s commitment to meeting the Australian quality training framework standards for registered training organisations. Its training supports Aboriginal community development and self-determination, and the employment of Aboriginal people in community based services. In the future Waltja hopes to extend its training operations by offering an even more highly accredited training scheme and courses to meet wider community needs.
All Waltja staff are supported in gaining qualifications that are related to their work. This includes accredited training in administration and business services, multimedia, children’s services, youth work and community services, assessment and workplace training, senior first aid and four-wheel drive training. Many staff even have training in website design, health promotion, video production and editing.
As previously noted, Waltja also works to create employment, which is a vital element when it comes to the sustainability of remote communities in Central Australia. Its Training Nintiringtjaku initiative, for example, aims to enable senior Aboriginal people to gain paid work supporting training organisations delivering accredited training in their communities. Nominees from remote communities across Central Australia—Kintore, Papunya, Mt Liebig, Nyirrpi, Willowra, Yuendumu, Yuelamu, Laramba, Engawala, Atitjere, Bonya, Titjikala, Mbwelarre, Areyonga—complete, plan and promote training, part of the Certificate IV in Training and Assessment, and advise and support desert knowledge researchers, through the Desert Knowledge precinct in the CRC, to plan, promote and conduct community based research projects.
Finally, I want to talk about Waltja’s work in health and disabilities, which involves tackling the difficult area of identifying the extent and the severity of disabilities in remote Aboriginal communities. In part, the difficulty in this area is the consequence of the lack of support services available in remote communities and the ensuing lack of knowledge about what services people with disabilities are entitled to. It is also because Aboriginal people on remote communities experience multiple disadvantages, including poverty and high levels of chronic disease. Disability can be hidden and therefore people with disabilities, and their carers, frequently do not receive the support they need. Were it not for Waltja, many individuals would not receive adequate support—family support, disability and aged care workshops, and clinical support which helps the ill to be treated in their communities. Remember, senators, there are no hospitals in remote communities, so the work that Waltja does in providing support to carers in the communities is vital in the Central Desert region.
In celebrating the work of this organisation, it is worth knowing that Waltja is Luritja for ‘doing good work for families’. The name encapsulates the Waltja story. I want to take this opportunity tonight to recognise Waltja and its past and current executive and operational staff—people like Irene Nangala, Margaret Orr, Marie Briscoe, Wendy Brown, Isobel Nampitjimpa and many others. In particular, I would of course like to recognise Sharon King, the wonderful woman who guides and leads this organisation. I have the deepest regard for the work they do, as should all members of this place. The Waltja website is www.waltja.org.au. I urge all senators to take the time to look at what the organisation has achieved in such a positive and tremendous fashion. It is a model of success in Indigenous community based service delivery and I would like to congratulate them on their 10 years of operation.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Waltja Tjutangku Palyapayi Aboriginal Association</title>,Adjournment,38,1,speech
