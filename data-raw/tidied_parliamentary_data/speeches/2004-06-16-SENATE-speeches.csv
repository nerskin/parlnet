"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-16,"—I had almost concluded my summing-up on the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004 when we ran out of time yesterday. I had made a certain response to a question that Senator Murray had asked. In conclusion, the FBT laws will also be changed to permit the continuity of fringe benefit tax treatment for non-remote housing benefits where the administration and payment of FBT is devolved by state or territory governments to an agency. This will reduce compliance costs for those governments. The bill will encourage those who have come from overseas to transfer their foreign pension entitlements to Australia. The change will enable a taxpayer who is transferring their overseas superannuation to an Australian-complying superannuation fund to elect to have part of the transfer treated as a taxable contribution in the Australian superannuation fund. By doing so, the fund, rather than the individual taxpayer, will pay the relevant tax arising on the transfer. Tax will be paid at the concessional superannuation fund rate rather than, first of all, the individual having to be aware and take the initiative and pay at the individual's marginal rate.
This change will overcome the difficulties currently experienced by individuals who are faced with a tax liability but who do not have recourse to funds to pay the liability, due to the benefits being preserved in the Australian fund until retirement. This change, combined with the fact that the tax will now be payable at the concessional superannuation fund rate, will encourage the transfer of overseas superannuation into Australian funds in appropriate cases.
Lastly, the bill amends the alienation of personal services income provisions to clarify when the Commissioner of Taxation may take a determination that the alienation provisions do not apply to a taxpayer. Technical defects in the current law may give rise to unintended outcomes. The amendments will ensure that the law operates according to the original policy intention. I thank my colleagues Senators Sherry and Murray for their support for this bill, and I commend it to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-16,"—The Labor Party will be supporting the New International Tax Arrangements Bill 2003. After much posturing from the Liberal-National Party government, the Labor Party have finally been able to piece together a reconciliation of the very confused measures that relate to this piece of legislation. We have been able to carry out a reconciliation of the 2003 budget measure: the review of international taxation arrangements. The budget measure referred to an unspecified set of review of international taxation arrangements measures, and the component of the costs that would be associated with the two new double tax agreements—DTA—for the United Kingdom and Mexico that were unclear. It was not until the two DTAs were being ratified by parliament that it was clarified that the budget measure referred to an unspecified set of RITA measures and the UK DTA only. The budget estimate of the cost of these international tax measures was $270 million over the budget year 2003-04 and the three forward estimate years. This raised concerns about the budget estimate, because the direct cost of the UK DTA was $280 million over those four years. The cost of this bill over the four years was a further $62.5 million.  
The government then introduced into the other place another tranche of RITA measures —the New International Tax Arrangements (Participation Exemption and Other Measures) Bill 2004—which had a cost of $105 million over four years. The total direct cost of the original $270 million RITA budget measures had reached $447.5 million—that is almost half a billion dollars, a very considerable sum of money. The government had advised that there was another tranche of measures to come. Labor senators referred this bill to a committee to obtain a full reconciliation with the original budget estimate of the measures.
The only explanation for this absence of information was that the cost of the further measures may change before they are introduced into parliament, and requests from my colleague in the other house Mr Cox to the Treasurer's office for some clarification on these matters were to no avail. It is not unreasonable that the cost might change, but it is also not unreasonable for the parliament to be told about it, particularly when the cost of the original budget measures appears to have blown out by some 65 per cent.
As a result of the Senate committee's consideration of this bill, the following further information has been obtained from Treasury. The cost of the remaining RITA 2003 budget measures will not exceed $50 million over the four years, taking the total direct cost to some $497.5 million. The costing of the original RITA budget measures also included an offset, which was the government's decision to defer the implementation of an earlier decision to provide franking credits for foreign dividend withholding tax. The original decision to provide franking credits for foreign dividend withholding tax was made in November 1999, and the estimates of its costs were $340 million in 2002-03, $190 million in 2003-04 and $200 million in 2004-05.
If all those listening to this debate find this a bit hard to follow, I would not be surprised. Actually delving into the detail of what is in the forward estimates and what was in previous budgets in respect of these measures has been incredibly difficult and incredibly complicated. I have to say, `Thank goodness for Senate committees,' because they are able to get Treasury to front up and provide some detailed answers. One of the problems we have—and we have this with other budget measures—is that when a measure is announced you then have to try to track forward some years to find out what happens to the measure in terms of both savings and expenditure. This is not easy to do because often it is not easy to find the information in following budgets and it is certainly not easy to track forward in successive years to see what is exactly happening. The only way to get this sort of information is to directly question the officers concerned—and there is no criticism of the officers; I do not blame them—and you might get an answer, but you do not always get one, at a later time through the Senate estimates and/or the legislation committee process. 
While all these numbers do not coincide with the whole of the current budget and forward estimates period, they do indicate a very substantial offset within that period for 2003-04 and 2004-05, which totals some $390 million. So while the likely cost of that measure might have changed, it is safe to conclude on the basis of the information provided by Treasury that the total direct cost of the RITA measures in the 2003 budget will be less than the $270 million estimate contained in the 2003 budget.
It is interesting to note that we are here today to amend the CFC and the FIF rules, which were first introduced by a Labor government. The member for Hotham introduced the legislation in the other place to enact the controlled foreign companies rule on 13 September 1990. Once again, we have an example of a Labor government introducing important reforms that strengthen the integrity of our tax system, which ensured that individuals could leave income offshore to earn passive income in an attempt to avoid or defer taxation in Australia. The CFC rules passed by this parliament in 1992 further strengthened this regime.
It is now 12 years on and times have changed. Labor welcomes the reforms included in this bill as a minimalist reflection of those changes. Since 1988, Australian investment overseas has grown by some 500 per cent. Foreign investment in Australia has grown by over 400 per cent. Increased investment inflows and outflows from Australia and the importance of these flows to Australia's economic prosperity have precipitated the government's review of international taxation arrangements. In a globalised world economy it is crucial that our international taxation arrangements are internationally competitive and that they do not, through their complexity, discourage overseas investment by Australians or by foreigners in Australia.
This is not to say that Labor would ever support the reopening of the loopholes that existed before the CFC and the FIF rules were introduced. All Australian workers who pay the correct amount of tax deserve a government that ensures that wealthy Australians do the same. The Board of Taxation review of international taxation made a number of recommendations, and this bill represents the first of three tranches of legislation to implement the government's response, which was announced in the 2003-04 budget. Schedule 1 in the bill amends the foreign investment fund rules to exempt superannuation funds from the FIF rules, increases the FIF balance portfolio exemption thresholds from five to 10 per cent and removes the management of funds from the FIF definition of `non-eligible business activities'.
Superannuation funds face significant compliance costs in adhering to the FIF rules. To comprehend why eligible superannuation funds should be exempted from the FIF rules it is crucial to understand what the FIF rules aim to achieve. They are not a revenue-raising tool but an important anti-avoidance mechanism. They aim to discourage taxpayers from leaving money offshore in order to defer or avoid paying tax. The major advantage from tax deferral comes from the timing of the tax point and bringing the money back to Australia when the taxpayer has a lower marginal tax rate. Eligible superannuation funds which have a tax rate of 15 per cent on earnings do not face the same incentives to defer paying tax. Excluding complying superannuation funds and unit trusts which invest on their behalf from the FIF rules would therefore not create significant risks to the integrity of the tax system and would reduce the compliance costs faced by these superannuation funds. These amendments will benefit all Australians by reducing the administrative costs on superannuation funds. I would hope that that in turn will flow on to lower fees and charges. We will be making a follow-through examination of this in some detail at a future date. 
The balanced portfolio exemption exempts taxpayers from the FIF rules where less than five per cent of all a taxpayer's interests in FIFs are not exempted from the FIF rules. This recognises that taxpayers with a portfolio of investments may sometimes hold non-exempt FIF interests but that their intention is not to minimise or defer tax. The balanced portfolio exemption ensures that taxpayers in this situation who are of low concern in relation to tax integrity are not caught up in the FIF system. However, these taxpayers still need to determine whether or not they are exempt from the FIF system. The proposed amendment would increase the balanced portfolio exemption from five per cent to 10 per cent. This recognises the changing nature of overseas investment. However—given the extensive exemptions applying in the FIF rules and the fact that this will do nothing to reduce the compliance costs faced by business—Labor, while not opposing the measure, considers that further investigation is necessary and will be referring this measure to the Senate Economics Committee.
The last measure in schedule 1 will remove funds management from the definition of non-eligible business entities. Currently, funds management is considered to be a non-eligible business activity and is therefore subject to the FIF rules. However, these businesses are providing an active service to their clients, and it is inappropriate that they be covered by the FIF rules, which are intrinsically about taxing non-active income. Therefore, it is not consistent with the intent of the FIF rules to treat these activities as non eligible.
Schedule 2 of the bill will exempt public and certain other unit trusts from withholding tax on widely held debentures. When foreign investors purchase widely held debentures directly or through a foreign funds manager, no withholding tax is payable. If they use an Australian funds manager, withholding tax applies. This rate varies, depending on the foreigner's country of origin, from five per cent to 10 per cent. This inconsistent tax treatment is seen as a major disincentive for foreigners to invest in widely held debentures through Australian funds managers. Without this disincentive Australian funds managers would have a natural advantage over foreign funds managers due to their generally superior local knowledge. Providing this exemption will provide consistent tax treatment of widely held debentures obtained by foreigners directly and through Australian funds managers. As such, it will increase employment and income generated by the Australian funds management sector, and should contribute significantly to increasing Australia's role as a major financial centre.
Schedule 3 will specifically list the categories of attributable income of controlled foreign companies in broad exemption listed countries. Currently, the CFC rules work by covering all income and then exempting certain income. This involves a costly compliance process as taxpayers determine whether income is exempt from the CFC rules or not. This amendment would simply list in regulation the CFC income which is taxable—that is, it would take taxpayers directly to the end point, significantly reducing compliance costs.
Schedule 4 of this bill ensures that double taxation does not occur with respect to royalty payments. When a company pays a royalty payment to a foreign company, withholding tax applies. A portion of that payment is taxed in Australia—for example, a royalty on intellectual property. The transfer pricing rules ensure that related companies cannot use transactions between themselves to move profits around and avoid or minimise tax. The transfer pricing rules deny a tax deduction to a company for a royalty paid to a related company, thus removing the ability of the company paying the royalty to minimise tax. If withholding tax applies to a royalty payment and a deduction is also denied then the payment is effectively being taxed twice. This is punitive and it is also inefficient. This amendment would ensure that, where the transfer pricing rules deny a tax deduction, the withholding rules do not apply. Thus, the payment would effectively be taxed only once, as it should be. 
The Labor Party will be supporting the bill. But, as I said in my opening remarks, our concern is that trying to track through the net costs and implications was difficult. It was only through the Senate estimates and legislative committee processes that we were able to obtain vital information. Frankly, that information should be provided on an ongoing basis in the detail required to consider what are, I have to say, very complex arrangements. Any taxation arrangement tends to be complex, but that is particularly true in the international area. These are very complex arrangements and there are some proposed changes, but the Labor Party supports the measures.",SENATE,<title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-16,"—The New International Tax Arrangements Bill 2003 is a business bill. I suppose you could describe it as that. It reduces the taxation compliance obligations on companies, super funds and managed funds investing offshore. The bill went through committee. It is the first tranche of legislation that was announced in last year's budget in this area. It apparently has a revenue impact of around $67 million over three years.
The bill covers four areas. Schedule 1 will reduce the compliance obligations on superannuation entities with fixed managed trusts that invest offshore. Schedule 2 allows eligible unit trusts to offer debentures that will be exempt from interest withholding tax in the same manner that applies to companies. Schedule 3 improves the application of controlled foreign companies' rules, but only with respect to broad exemption listed countries. Broad exemption listed countries are similarly taxed countries like the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France and Germany where investment cannot be considered part of any tax avoidance purpose—which might be fanciful in some respects, I guess. Finally, schedule 4 prevents the double taxation of royalties subject to withholding tax. 
On 9 May 2003 journalist Allesandra Fabro, who does a lot of work in this area, wrote in the Financial Review that business looked to reforms as a step that would lower the cost of capital for Australian multinationals and reduce the incentive for them to move offshore. She also noted:
A number of surveys in recent years have decried Australia's international tax regime as onerous and discouraging to offshore investment.
This is an opportunity to state the long history of cooperation that the Senate has shown to improving the way in which companies and super funds and managed funds can interact internationally. Over time the Democrats, Labor, when they were in government and in opposition, and the coalition, in opposition and in government, have combined in common cause to advance our competitiveness and the ease with which we interact internationally. 
We are one of the world's big trading countries. We are a country that looks across our borders for much of the creation of national wealth and jobs, and the Senate has been well aware of that. I make this remark because there is the view in some quarters of the business community that the Senate is difficult in these matters because it wishes to review them. The Senate wishes to review them because it needs to be sure of the revenue consequences of any measure before it. Indeed, the committee said that two issues really were at the front of its mind on its examination: the impact of revenue of the balanced portfolio exemptions under the FIF rules and the overall cost of measures implemented in response to the Board of Taxation report. It is very important that we understand the consequences to revenue of the measures we adopt. Even though notionally there is a cost to this, the Labor Party, ourselves and the government recognise that the benefits have not been quantified but are quite apparent to anyone who understands the background of these things—that is, just making it a little easier to do business on an equitable basis. The Labor Party's reference to the committee—it was they who referred the bill to the committee—was a good one. Their exploration of the revenue matters during estimates and in the committee were productive and helpful, and the remarks about the importance of that process deserve to be emphasised and supported by me. 
This is the first of a number of efforts the government is making in the international tax arena. In May 2002, the Treasurer issued a press release announcing a review by the Board of Taxation of four areas of international taxation arrangements—the dividend imputation system; treatment of foreign source income; foreign source income rules that comprise principally the controlled foreign corporations, CFC, foreign investments fund, FIF, and foreign tax credit exemption rules; the overall treatment of conduit income; and high level aspects of double tax agreement to policy and processes. In all those areas you have highly technical, extremely complex and very difficult matters for Treasury to consult on and to liaise on internationally and domestically. My general impression is that the opposition, the Democrats and the coalition can be well satisfied with the effort that Treasury puts into getting those things properly examined and assessed, both domestically and internationally.
The nature of these things is such that the community cannot engage in any real sense, and it is right, therefore, that it is only through the Senate committee and estimates processes that the community interest can be protected, from an accountability perspective, with regard to the need for its parliamentary representatives to be sure we are not just giving a nice little leeway to business to make some money without being properly accountable for their revenue and taxes to the people as represented in the parliament. In the end, no evidence was presented to the Senate committee to oppose the bill. The bill received strong support from the Business Council for Tax Reform, from the BCA, from the Taxation Institute and from ASFA and IFSA. It is not because the bill is only 13 more tax pages that the Democrats will support it; we do think it is useful legislation.",SENATE,<title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-16,"—I formally record my thanks to both Senator Sherry and Senator Murray for their efforts in respect of the first of three tranches in the government's push to review and reform international tax arrangements. I now sum up the New International Tax Arrangements Bill 2003, which is the first tranche. In the 2003 budget, the government announced the outcome of a review of international tax arrangements and foreshadowed over 30 initiatives designed to modernise and improve the international competitiveness of our tax system. The bill, which is the second instalment of international tax review legislation, addresses issues facing the superannuation and managed fund industries. With over $500 billion invested in superannuation, which for most Australians represents their second largest asset after the family home, the government wishes to ensure that fund members get the best possible returns.  
A substantial part of superannuation fund assets is in foreign investments. Superannuation funds invest around $90 billion offshore, most of which is in foreign shares. Much of this investment is conducted through Australian managed funds, which operate through trust structures. The reforms in this bill will improve the international competitiveness of Australian superannuation funds and managed funds and will improve returns to their investors. Increasing to 10 per cent the threshold for the balanced portfolio exemption under the foreign investment fund rules will reduce the compliance costs of Australian managed funds. 
Due to increased globalisation and the growth of the financial services sector, the five per cent threshold is simply no longer sufficient to allow Australian investors to achieve offshore portfolio diversification. Currently, fund managers may sell down interests in non-exempt FIFs to five per cent at year end and reacquire them at the beginning of the new income year, involving, as you would appreciate, significant transaction costs. Investors will now be better able to diversify their offshore investment portfolios. The measures in this bill will give Australian investors increased opportunities from international investment. 
The bill also removes unnecessary tax costs on our superannuation funds in relation to their offshore investments. Because superannuation funds currently have a low tax rate, their investment decisions are unlikely to be biased towards the kinds of offshore investment vehicles that the foreign investment fund rules are designed to target. Fund management services and expertise is an active business. It is not the kind of passive asset holding that the foreign investment fund rules are designed to address. The bill will therefore sensibly remove management of funds from the list of non-eligible activities so that investment in a company principally engaged in funds management should no longer be taxed under the foreign investment fund rules. The bill also removes an anomaly and reduces compliance costs for managed funds by extending to widely held unit trusts the interest-withholding tax exemptions currently available to companies. 
Finally, the bill also modifies the controlled foreign company rules and implements a measure to prevent the double taxation of royalties in transfer-pricing situations. By sharpening the focus of the foreign investment fund regime, the government's intention is to strip away unnecessary compliance costs currently imposed on managed funds and superannuation funds. These unnecessary costs result in lower returns to Australian investors and make Australian managed funds less competitive with foreign competitors. The government is satisfied that these costs can be reduced without compromising the integrity of the regime as a whole.
During this discussion, the activities of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee were mentioned. I also wish to place on record that I welcome the findings of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report on the bill, which recommends that the Senate ultimately pass the bill. I thank the committee for its report and for the efforts of its members. I understand from Senator Sherry's remarks that, through the Senate committee process and with the cooperation of Treasury officials, the costing has been unpacked and has now satisfied concerns. 
I place on record that the 2003-04 Budget Paper No. 2 showed a net aggregate costing for all the FIF measures of $270 million over the forward estimates and stated that the costing included the new tax treaty with the UK and savings from not proceeding with a measure, which was announced following the Ralph review, to provide franking credits for foreign dividend withholding tax. I understand that the questioning process has enabled some unpacking of the costing. The costs of the measures contained in this bill are not substantial, but costings have been provided for each component part of the review of international tax arrangements when each part is finalised. The committee has certainly played a role in that. 
Senator Murray alluded to the work of Treasury officials. I should also record this, because it does not often happen that the consultation process works so extremely well. Treasury's interface with business and their provision of very significant feedback to the government has worked extremely well in the development of these policy responses and legislation. Obviously, it works much better if you can have a policy direction from the government and then have the detail and finetuning built from the ground up. You always end up, in very complex situations, involving in some respects for people who are not close to it mind-bogglingly complex matters where some of the difficulties are identified before the legislation gets to a stage where it is being debated. Involving industry at a much earlier stage in the policy development process I think has really paid dividends. 
Certainly it is difficult to think of a better way to develop complex tax legislation. I formally thank Treasury for their sustained efforts and I also note the strong business support for the bill. It again demonstrates that the government has listened and has been responsive to legitimate calls from industry for specific tax reforms to remove unnecessary impediments to business. This cannot be described as some concession to the big end of town. It is absolutely critical when you operate in a global environment that you have a competitive tax system able to be responsive to the needs as identified by business and that the measures in this bill ultimately flow through as assistance for those who have investments in superannuation funds.
I thank the business community, which has played a valuable and constructive role in helping to develop the law through the consultation arrangements. I am very gratified that the Senate, through my colleagues Senators Sherry and Murray, can see the big picture as well as the detail in respect of these bills. I do thank them for their support, and I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-16,"—I rise to speak on the Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003. In Labor's view, parliament needs to strengthen the corporate governance regulatory framework to ensure that Australia's capital markets remain efficient, fair and transparent. The CLERP 9 bill goes some way to strengthening the framework; however, it does not go far enough. Labor takes the view that the CLERP 9 bill fails to sufficiently hold boards accountable and fails to sufficiently empower shareholders. Labor welcomes the government's decision to adopt a number of Labor's proposals, which include giving shareholders a non-binding vote on the remuneration report; expanding the disclosure requirements for executives, from the top five executives to the top 10 executives within the corporate group; recognising the need to amend the disclosure obligations in section 300A on executive remuneration; and requiring the auditor to attend and answer questions at the AGM. These were all Labor proposals, and the Labor Party welcomes the government's getting on board. 
Whilst these reforms are needed, they do not go far enough. Obscene salary packages to executives, massive termination payments in spite of poor performance and the perceived failure of audit committees have outraged shareholders, employees and retirees. It was clear from the inquiry of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services that we needed to toughen up the CLERP 9 bill. To toughen up the framework, Labor will move a number of amendments to the bill. Labor's amendments do not contain any surprises; the government has known about them for months. In October 2003, we released our first discussion paper on CLERP 9 and indicated the issues that Labor believed should form part of the bill. Since then we have tested our proposals through the joint parliamentary committee's inquiry on CLERP 9. We received widespread support for many of our amendments from a variety of groups, including the Australian Shareholders Association, the Australian Council of Super Investors and Corporate Governance International.
After completing the inquiry on 30 May, we released Labor's guide to the CLERP 9 amendments. This guide sets out Labor's proposed amendments to the bill. Since then we have released the text of our draft amendments. In the same week we released our guide to the CLERP 9 amendments. We released the text of the draft amendments to allow further consultation. We again received widespread support for releasing the text of these amendments. Before discussing our key reforms, it is important to note that our reforms are based on transparency, accountability and disclosure. If the government votes against Labor's amendments, it will be voting against better transparency in relation to the Financial Reporting Council, enhanced accountability in relation to audit, enhanced transparency in relation to executive remuneration, increased accountability of directors and better disclosure in relation to proxy voting by fund managers and trustees of super funds. If the government chooses to vote against Labor's reforms, which empower shareholders, it will be voting against reforms that will increase shareholder activism. Anyone who owns shares, anyone with superannuation and anyone who has been outraged by obscene salary packages will welcome Labor's amendments.
The explanatory memorandum states that the underlying objective of the bill is to improve the operation of the market by promoting transparency, accountability and shareholder activism. The CLERP 9 bill fails to sufficiently empower shareholders and fails to sufficiently hold boards accountable. Accordingly, Labor will be moving a raft of amendments to increase shareholder activism and to increase the accountability of boards. The role of shareholders in holding companies accountable has not been fully appreciated until the last few years. Many Australian boards have acted in their own self-interest, not in the interests of their shareholders. This highlights the disconnect between shareholders and the company. This disconnect arises from the imbalance in the relationship between shareholders and the board of directors. An article in the Harvard Business Reviewaccurately diagnosed the cause of the problem. It stated: 
When shareholders fail to engage, either in setting direction or holding board members accountable for their behaviour, an important link in the governance system is missing. In this context, a director's allegiance shifts from its proper base—the shareholders—to the nearby boardroom, where fellow directors and management fill the void.
This redirection of a director's allegiance from the shareholders to other directors and management has created an environment in which shareholders' interests have taken second place to boardroom ego. 
This issue is also prevalent in Australian boardrooms. In his report on HIH, Justice Owen said, `Shareholder apathy can play a part in undesirable corporate governance.' If shareholders as owners are unwilling or unable to exercise their powers or to make themselves heard, directors and management will lack guidance or constraint from those whose interests they are supposed to serve. In order to hold directors accountable, shareholders need to be empowered. Labor will be moving a raft of amendments to empower shareholders. Our amendments will require shareholder approval, non-binding, where a director chairs more than one top 300 listed company. We will require disclosure of information about directors prior to their being elected, such as their relationships with the company and other directors. We will require disclosure of the qualifications of company secretaries. We will amend section 250A(4) to ensure that the voting intentions of shareholders are carried out and amend section 251AA to require disclosure of resolutions withdrawn prior to AGMs. These amendments are not political and should not be controversial. Most of these amendments are based on disclosure; they give shareholders more information.
The explanatory memorandum notes that one of the bill's objectives is to promote shareholder activism; however, the CLERP 9 bill fails to sufficiently empower shareholders. Shareholder activism in Australia is at a much lower level than in the US or the UK. With proxy voting levels in Australia at 44 per cent and with proxy voting levels in the UK reaching 55 per cent and around 80 per cent in the USA, Australia has a long way to go to reach the levels of shareholder activism which exist in other jurisdictions. Over half of the Australian adult population now invest in the share market, either directly or indirectly. Considering that most Australians have an exposure to the share market via their superannuation, shareholder activism and corporate governance are of immense importance. Labor takes the view that the exercise of ownership rights by all shareholders, including institutional investors, should be facilitated by government and supported by the regulatory framework. Recently 43 per cent of shareholders in the Walt Disney Company in the US recorded a no-confidence vote in the chairman, Mr Michael Eisner. As a result of this vote Mr Eisner has stepped down as chairman of Disney.
Shareholder activism is no longer confined to the US. It is a global movement that Australian companies are now grappling with. Recently the US has introduced new requirements in relation to its mutual funds. Under the rules, mutual funds will be required to disclose their voting records. Just last week I visited the SEC and had a long discussion with them about this. I asked them if they got as much resistance as I am finding to this in Australia and they said, `Absolutely.' This was something that the funds management industry in the US fought tooth and nail, and it is no different here. The only difference is that in the US they stood up to those vested interests but here the government, as usual if it has a choice between backing the board or backing shareholders, backs the board.  
I hope the government will accept these amendments. I hope the Democrats and the minor parties will accept these amendments. I hope commonsense will prevail and we can move to world's best practice, as they have adopted in the US on this issue. As I said, this is a global movement. It is happening all around the world. Australia should be taking a lead. Labor believes that Australia is being left behind now in relation to shareholder activism. The OECD Principles of corporate governance, which was released earlier this year, call for disclosure of how institutional investors exercise their ownership rights. The OECD report says:
For institutions acting in a fiduciary capacity, such as pension funds, collective investment schemes and some activities of insurance companies, the right to vote can be considered part of the value of the investment being undertaken on behalf of their clients. Failure to exercise the ownership rights could result in a loss to the investor who should therefore be made aware of the policy to be followed by the institutional investors.
So, in accordance with these OECD principles, Labor believes that fund managers in Australia should disclose their voting records and voting policies. This disclosure obligation is not onerous. Companies can simply disclose their voting records and voting policies on their web sites.
Let me describe Labor's amendments. There has been a fair degree of misinformation on these even though we circulated our amendments two to three weeks ago and first raised this as an issue over two years ago. Let me be perfectly clear. Labor's amendments are as follows. Where a fund manager votes, we require the fund manager to disclose their voting policy and voting records. Where the fund manager does not vote, they are not required to disclose a voting record. In relation to trustees of super funds, we require them to vote on material resolutions and to disclose their voting records and voting policies. In our view, material resolutions would include matters such as remuneration and election of directors to the board. We have said that material resolutions will be disclosed in the regulations. Labor welcomes the government's decision to adopt Labor policy and reinstate a register for the disclosure of beneficial ownership. However, we believe that disclosure of substantial shareholders in the annual report can also be improved.
The CLERP 9 bill inserts a new requirement on financial services licensees to manage their conflicts of interest. In our view, this is not sufficient. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's 2003 surveillance report on the independence of research analysts found that significant improvement was needed in some areas. In relation to conflicts of interest, ASIC said:
We did observe some systemic weaknesses in the ability of entities to adequately identify, manage and disclose conflicts of interest.
ASIC also found that investment banks had ignored industry guidelines. During the committee hearing, one of the issues raised was whether the requirements in the bill and ASIC's policy paper were sufficient. Of particular importance is whether specific obligations should be imposed in relation to research analysts. ASIC's original submission to Treasury on CLERP 9 took a robust view in relation to the types of conflicts which needed to be disclosed and those which needed to be prohibited. In November 2002, ASIC's view was: 
The work of analysts is sufficiently influential to warrant special safeguards to ensure that direct and indirect users of reports can be reasonably confident that integrity is not flawed by conflicts.
Labor endorses these comments. ASIC's original CLERP 9 submission also raised concerns about whether disclosure was sufficient in relation to certain conflicts. It said:
... at a fundamental level, the Act needs to prohibit certain activities of analysts where conflicts cannot be effectively managed, and disclosure of such conflicts is not sufficient to mitigate consumer or market integrity risk.
ASIC recommends that the following activities are prohibited: trading by an analyst or researcher in products that are the subject of a current research report within a set period and trading by an analyst or its individual researchers against a recommendation or opinion contained in a current research report. Labor will move amendments to implement ASIC's original recommendations. Accordingly, Labor members endorse the following amendments: prohibiting trading by an analyst or researcher in products that are the subject of a current research report within a set time frame; prohibiting trading by an analyst or researcher against a recommendation or opinion contained in a current research report; and publishing any reports for a period after the analyst firm has acted in an IPO for the company that is the subject of the report—establishing quiet periods. The Labor members also believe that the government should mandate written disclosure in analysts' reports of any conflict of interest of the analyst and require companies to disclose information provided during briefings to analysts. The Australian Shareholders Association advised the committee that they endorsed Labor's proposals to require the disclosure of information provided during analysts' briefings.
Executive remuneration was one of the most contested issues discussed during the JPC hearing. The payment of obscene salary packages and massive termination payments—often in the light of poor corporate performance—has resulted in an uproar by shareholders, employees and retirees. The community is outraged that there appears to be one rule for corporate executives and another rule for the rest of the work force. The link between payment and performance appears to have been severed. In addition, many people feel as though the payments to directors and executives do not correspond with community expectations. In 1998 Labor, with the Democrats, inserted section 300A into the act. This section required the disclosure of information about the remuneration of directors and executives in the annual report for all listed companies. This was a major step towards increasing the transparency surrounding executive remuneration. Unfortunately, the spirit of this section has not been followed by some companies, particularly in relation to the disclosure of options. Let me make that point again. On something like 24 to 28 June 1998—sometimes I get the dates wrong; Senator Murray corrects me regularly on this—
—The 25th.
—Thank you, Senator Murray. It is now six years later, almost to the day, and we have not been able to get companies to actually comply with the law. If another area of the law were ignored for six years, there would normally be an outcry from the government of the day. But not from this government. Further reform is urgently required. The CLERP 9 bill makes some changes in relation to executive remuneration but it fails to go far enough. The following do not need to be disclosed under the regulations and therefore will not form part of the remuneration report that this government is putting forward: company policy on duration of contracts; notice periods; and termination payments. There is the question of whether the director or executive has entered into an equity value protection scheme. That is a hedging instrument which ensures that the value of the equity remains fixed regardless of changing market values. People may say, `What happened to this idea that you wanted management's interests aligned with the shareholders' interests?' The whole point of giving management equity and options is to tie them together so that poor performance by management affected the people in management themselves. But a few clever spivs have worked it out: `We don't have to be part of this risk. We can get these schemes and put them in place. It doesn't matter if we perform poorly and the share price goes down: we have a locked-in profit.' You would have to say that this completely severs the link between shareholders and management. 
Labor does not think that is good enough. Many companies who do this do not tell their shareholders they have done it. You may ask: why is that? It is no surprise. When management decide they want to sever the link that they have used as an excuse to get equity and options, they do not want to tell their shareholders. What does Labor say? Labor says, `You have to tell your shareholders. If you sever the link between shareholders and management on performance and equity, you at least have to do the decent thing and tell your shareholders.' This legislation has ignored that, but our amendments will put that decency into it. These bills aim to increase transparency, but the government has turned its back on transparency. When it comes to a battle between a board and a shareholder, it will back the board. It will back its mates on the boards of this country every time. Accordingly, we suggest the government should pass Labor's amendments, which enhance the disclosure obligations of companies in relation to executive remuneration.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-16,"—The Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003 represent a red-letter day for corporations in Australia and for the coalition government. For a government which has long felt that it is better to leave the market to itself, this set of bills represents a realisation and an acceptance that self-regulation has not been working and that the market would benefit by greater changes to corporate legislation to ensure that corporate governance standards are lifted and improved.
I listened to Senator Conroy's remarks and I am aware with his recounting of history that once again, as over these last eight years, the minister at the table, Senator Ian Campbell, Senator Conroy and I will be here determining the future direction of these bills and these initiatives. It is a great credit to the continuing process of review by the Senate, by the parliament and by the government itself that we are able to advance the cause of introducing far greater morality and far better behaviour in the corporate world without interfering with its competitiveness, its innovation, its enterprise, its contribution to creating jobs and its contribution to the national wealth.
The bills are known as CLERP 9 and are the latest in a series of reforms to corporate law. These bills and provisions will be supported by us, subject to the amendments we hope can be achieved through a combination of government reactions to the committee report and the determination of the detailed amendments put by Labor and by the Democrats. I want to say at the outset that the Senate is deeply indebted to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which is chaired by Senator Grant Chapman, and to its secretariat for two reports which make a considerable contribution to understanding the initiatives. The reports make many recommendations which I hope the government has been able to rapidly respond to. I have not yet seen any circulated amendments, but I am sure they are going to come before us. 
I want to delve into the bills by first repeating a philosophical view I have—which I have spelt out in my minority reports and supplementary remarks to the committee's reports—that neither the government nor the committee have yet grasped the most important nettle of all: reforming the way in which boards and directors operate. We should recognise that the legislation does not really disturb the fundamental relationship between shareholders, executives, directors and the auditor. The Democrats believe that, at its very core, existing company law is inadequate in terms of corporate governance, that the board and directors are central to the relationship between shareholders and company, and that the board and directors are largely not addressed through the CLERP process.
Directors' duties are very wide on operational management matters, but poor corporate governance and ethics can create situations where major conflicts of interest, mismanagement, impropriety and even corruption can go unchecked. Fundamental to the Democrat philosophy is a belief that many of the political principles that apply to popular democracies can transfer across to shareholder democracies. At its heart, the principle of limited liability is also founded on the principle of corporate democracy—shareholders democratically, by right of their shareholding, have the right to determine how companies operate. 
Well-founded concepts such as the separation of powers, accountability and democratic process have as valuable a role to play in the corporate world as they do in political life. Corporate democracy is the key to corporate governance. At the heart of democracy is the restraint of power, the notion of checks and balances and the regular testing of popular support. In discussing corporate governance, our political and constitutional language is a helpful tool: best practice regular elections, compulsory voting, representative bodies, independent institutions and people, appointments on merit, the separation of powers, transparency, accountability and full disclosure.
The Democrats believe that one solution is for the current responsibilities of a board to be split between the main board and the governance board. The main board would continue to be elected by shareholding and would concentrate on strategic, business and operational issues. It would contain executive and non-executive directors and, because of its election method, would continue to have a bias towards the dominant or large shareholders.
A small corporate governance board would be composed of non-executive independent directors—perhaps three. It would have a limited remit and would call and chair shareholder meetings, propose changes to the company constitution, resolve conflicts of interests, determine the remuneration of directors and executive management, appoint auditors and other advisors such as valuers, and manage the process of electing directors. To protect the interests of all shareholders, not just the dominant shareholders, voting rights would be determined democratically by numbers rather than by power based on the number of shares held. In other words, it would be determined by shareholder not shareholding. Because of its election method, it would have a bias towards all shareholders rather than just the large shareholders. 
This separation of powers seems a difficult concept for the traditional business community to fully appreciate at present. It has worked well in our broader political democracy. The Democrats have sought through the committee process, through our consultations with business and through advocacy in the Senate to get people to respond to and understand these philosophical beliefs which should underpin the way in which boards, directors and companies operate. Because we have not yet got that understanding through, we will not attempt amendments to create a governance board at this stage. The idea does need to be better understood first. But, in our view, you cannot approach corporate governance and corporate law without questioning the basic underpinning of corporate law in this country. We think that there needs to be a shift in the way in which these matters are addressed.
Turning to executive remuneration, which will take up a fair bit of time in this debate, we think it is a matter of great public and private interest. Executive remuneration does lie at the heart of investor confidence and faith in the credibility of corporations in the share market. It is a matter of great public interest because the extravagant greed of too many directors and executives has not only caused a justifiable public outcry but also contributed to major company failures and market shocks. It is a matter of great private interest because too many shareholders have been robbed by the siphoning off of their funds through board-approved salary and retirement package rackets. At the heart of this matter is a series of connected failures.
Neither board practice nor the law prohibits arrangements where there is a conflict of interest. Those who benefit from devising clever, concealed and costly salary bonus or option packages that benefit the executive and director mates on the board are quite often the same people who approve those packages. They are even sometimes ticked off at the shareholder level by the chairman holding proxies that he exercises at his absolute discretion. It is a travesty in law if ever there was one. If ever there was a single reason to require institutional investors to exercise a compulsory vote, the corrupt use of discretionary proxies is it. The myth out there that executives do not influence these matters is just that—a myth. One in five directors is an executive and those people exercise a great deal of power.
The nature of this debate reflects the fact that there has been disagreement between the government and the non-government side of the Senate. Last year the Democrats and Labor introduced amendments to ensure the disclosure of remuneration packages at the time of contract, to require companies to disclose accruing retirement benefits to executives and directors, to strengthen shareholder power to veto directors' retirement payouts and to force companies to reveal in graph form increases in executive salaries compared to share prices. The government did not accept those amendments at that time. You cannot divorce board delinquency in authorising unjustified remuneration packages from some company constitutions and board behaviour that allows or fosters poor director election processes and the patronage of mates. This cosy world delivers supporting structures of mutual self-interest and aggrandisement. Therefore, the accompaniment to good remuneration practice and good remuneration committees has to be best practice director election processes, maximum independence and ethical systems to prevent the conflicts of interests and collegiate conspiracy where corporate insiders enrich themselves at the expense of shareholders.
I want to turn to auditor independence. A considerable part of the CLERP 9 reform changes relate to the role of the auditor and auditor independence. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in report 391, Review of independent auditing by registered company auditors,in August 2002 concluded with this recommendation: 
The Committee considers that Section 324 of the Corporations Act 2001 would be the appropriate section of the Act to incorporate a general statement on the independence of the auditor.
It is notable that the Corporations Act and the bill still lack definitions or clear criteria for independence. While the bill does not have a definition of auditor independence, it does impose a general independence requirement on auditors. This requirement is not met if a conflict of interest situation exists in relation to an audited body at a particular time and at that time the auditor knows but does not take reasonable steps to ensure the conflict of interest ceases to exist. It seems convoluted but you could say that, in the bill, the definition of `Conflict of interest situation' in setting a general standard of auditor independence is really the bill's definition of what constitutes auditor independence. A conflict of interest situation exists, according to the bill, when:
(a) the auditor, or a professional member of the audit team, is not capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment in relation to the conduct of the audit of the audited body; or
(b) a reasonable person, with full knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, would conclude that the auditor, or a professional member of the audit team, is not capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment in relation to the conduct of the audit of the audited body.
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in report 391—and I should mention that I sit on that committee as well—did pick up the essence of the auditor independence argument at pages 6 to 7, in paragraphs 1.23 to 1.30. At paragraph 1.30 it said:
For each of these stakeholders, the Committee has explored a number of mechanisms to enhance independence. However, a core set of mechanisms and criteria in each of the following areas, are common to enhancing the independence of each group:
	appointment;
	security of tenure;
	termination; and
	remuneration.
At paragraph 5.5 of chapter 5, the committee report quotes what it describes as the comprehensive definition provided in `the ICAA and CPAA Professional Statement F.1—Professional Independence'. That definition covers independence of mind and independence in appearance. While these are essential ingredients of a definition of auditor independence, they are incomplete. What is missing is the vital third part of the definition: independence in fact. Full independence is only possible when the method of appointment is objective, on merit and not subject to patronage, favour or inducements; remuneration is sufficient, profitable and secure for a reasonable period and not hostage to other services or retainers; tenure is reasonable and secure; and objective, fair and consistent separation or contract-ending mechanisms exist. Without these elements in place, full independence is not possible—apart from for the very strong, the very virtuous or the very uncommercial.
I will turn to remuneration briefly. The Democrats believe that an independent auditor is vital for an effective audit, but to quote Charles Macek, the Chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, as reported in the May 2004 CFO Magazine:
Where does your obligation, where does your loyalty lie? It's going to lie with whoever is paying our salary. It's just human nature.
The greatest weakness is the method of appointment. Intertwined with any discussion on the appointment of auditors is the relatively new institution of the audit committee. The audit committee has been held out as a guarantee of probity and good process. It is nothing of the sort. The problem starts and ends with the board. I will repeat what I said in my minority report in the committee's part 1 report for CLERP 9—that is, that the board is the central institution in the relationship between shareholders and the company, stakeholders generally and auditors specifically. It is self-evident that many boards, directors and companies operate to high standards, but it is the task of legislators to attend to those who do not and to appraise the public interest. 
Companies have such an effect on our society that serious weaknesses in corporations law must be attended to. A major weakness lies in director election processes. Regrettably, the election of directors is often either deliberately or effectively rigged in favour of dominant shareholder interests. I am told that 52 per cent of ASX corporations have a dominant shareholder and many of the rest have a few dominant shareholders. Such dominant shareholders frequently control the boards of our companies through their voting power. That means many or most directors are directly placed by or under the patronage of a dominant shareholder or shareholders who will quite naturally seek to ensure that their interests are put first. This dominance and patronage over many directors is reinforced by company constitutions and board behaviour that allow or foster poor director election processes.
This dominance and patronage of the dominant shareholders is reinforced by the absence of compulsory voting by institutional investors, by their voting apathy, by their giving proxies to the chair or, worst of all, by the often disgraceful way in which proxies are voted at the chair's discretion. The only way to diminish dominant shareholder voting power is to dilute it. The greater the vote and the more thoughtful the vote exercised, the lower will be the real power of the dominant shareholders. These are public companies but they are sometimes treated as private fiefdoms ruled by oligarchs who are openly contemptuous of their often small fellow shareholders. This combination of methods and practices minimising votes effectively results in the shareholders at large being unable to prevent a dominant shareholder dominating the board. Under our system non-executive directors are not much protection either because many are far from independent. This is because they have often been appointed under the dominant shareholders' patronage, a patronage reinforced by the conformity imposed by the board collegiality rule. It all ends up being very neat and cosy for the dominant shareholder.
Here is a likely scenario. The directors under the patronage of or subject to the dominant shareholders appoint the director members of the audit committee who are also under the patronage or subject to the dominant shareholders and are therefore highly likely to act in the interests of the dominant shareholders. The subordinate or patronised audit committee recommends which auditor should be appointed. The board in turn forwards that appointment to the shareholders, who duly elect the auditor. The selected auditor is obviously going to be one the board can work with. Unscrupulous boards might flavour the auditor appointments with some nice non-audit service goodies—a practice so common and so repellent to independence that Sarbanes-Oxley has pretty much ruled it out. The audit committee dutifully conveys to the auditor the wishes and interests of the dominant shareholders and, later on perhaps, the auditor is rewarded by a seat on the board—under patronage, of course. Then the whole cycle starts again. A company cannot proceed on that basis. ",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2004-06-16,"—As has been mentioned, the Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 and the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003 are designed to give effect to CLERP 9. Corporate reform is a vital area that goes to this country's economic wellbeing, both now and into the future. These bills are about ensuring that the regulation of the marketplace is relevant and up to date and that the regulatory mechanisms that government imposes on the marketplace to protect its citizens are able to deal with the level of risk that exists. I believe that all senators would agree that unfettered markets do not operate in the best interests of our fellow Australians. Australians understand that transparency and a preparedness to share information with all is the best protection they can have from the unscrupulous and devious people who exist in any society. When the unscrupulous and devious are operating major companies, effective regulation is even more important. We have seen over the years that the unscrupulous and devious can wreak economic hardship way beyond their own company and in fact affect the whole economy. No-one would doubt that the excesses that were reported in the HIH Royal Commission should not have taken place. They took place because effective regulation did not exist.
It is incumbent on all governments to ensure that companies have to abide by minimum standards. The regulation of the marketplace has, at its heart, information. With information available, suppliers, regulators, shareholders and consumers can make informed decisions within the marketplace. Without information, everyone is at risk. It is much more difficult to behave like an Enron or an HIH when information is readily available and regulation is effective and timely.
There has to be a balance in the marketplace. Going all the way back to the South Sea Bubble in the 18th century, investors have been at risk from an unregulated market place. Nowadays, with an increasing number of Australians also being shareholders, the risk from the unscrupulous and devious operating in companies is increased. Australians who have saved and who have funds available to invest need to be able to make informed decisions based on publicly available information. Nothing is more important in this process than the audit process. If the audit processes are flawed, investors are placed at risk. No-one would invest in a company where there was any doubt about the integrity of the audit.
However, there is also the future to consider in this discussion. With over nine million Australians now having superannuation, regulation is more important than ever before. The future wellbeing of those nine million Australians is dependent on having decent and effective corporate governance. If our companies are allowed to operate as an Enron or HIH, the retirement futures of those nine million Australians are at risk. With so much of their future tied up in investments in companies through shareholdings held by the superannuation funds, we must ensure that now and into the future our corporate sector is well governed and effectively regulated. Having said that, it is important to note that the ALP has clear points of difference with the government's approach to these bills.
As Senator Conroy has outlined, there are a number of key changes that the ALP intends to move to these bills. Firstly, there is the issue of executive remuneration packages. Every time the ALP has raised this issue Senator Coonan, in particular, has launched into a rant about how we on this side are all suffering from some kind of income envy. The government's simplistic response to this ALP policy demonstrates how out of touch they are with the concerns of their fellow Australians—indeed, with their fellow shareholders.  
Those opposite believe that Australians think it is reasonable that large numbers of executives get these massive packages, and yet their performance does not match the money. For example, in a recent survey conducted by the Business Review Weekly, the 20 highest paid CEOs had seen shareholder value increase in just five cases. The average Australians—many of whom now receive some kind of bonus or performance component in their take-home pay—know that unless they meet their performance targets they miss out on the money. Australians find it hard to understand how it is that 15 out of the 20 highest paid CEOs can underperform yet still receive their full package. Rather than being about income envy, what the ALP policy is all about is transparency and performance. We do not argue that all people should receive the same. Rather, we argue that all should be treated equally. 
One of the problems with executive remuneration is that the information is not available and shareholders have little or no say in the process. That is simply not good enough. Perhaps this could be put down to the government's hands-off attitude to the big end of town. If the government's mates in the corporate sector could not hand out the big packages, who would be buying the tickets to their fundraisers, one may ask. One wonders whose advice the government would take. Let me quote from Hansard, 16 February 2004:
The government has, on many occasions, noted the importance of a co-regulatory approach and has looked to the ASX Corporate Governance Council as a source of best practice guidelines.
Those words were spoken by the Treasurer on these bills in other place. So, the government would contend that they are taking the advice of the ASX Corporate Governance Council to ensure that community expectations are being met. However, it is interesting to note that those guidelines say that companies should not provide options, bonus payments or retirement benefits to non-executives. One would, therefore, think that if that is what they are saying in their guidelines the government should include them in the legislation. If you accept the argument that the market moves too quickly for the legislation and that the ASX Corporate Governance guidelines should be used more generally, then the argument extends to the proposition that every time the legislation is amended it should take the guidelines as a given. This would assist in ensuring that the legislation closely follows the practices recommended by the ASX. By putting into the legislation these disclosure arrangements we get the best arrangement. As things change, the regulations can be amended. To put up a process that is not as strong as the ASX guidelines seems like a cop-out.
Another area of concern is that the disclosure regime that will accompany these bills regarding executive remuneration is not well known. It is important to all Australians that there are clear and precise processes in place for the disclosure of executive packages. Shareholders need to be able to be assured that all the information used by the executives to determine these packages is also available to them. 
Another amendment which the ALP is strongly committed to is to ban the practice of non-recourse loans to directors and other executives. Currently, only loans above a certain amount—in this case, $100,000—need to be disclosed. Why do we have a system that allows directors and other executives to use company funds as their personal piggy bank? Surely if you or I wanted to buy shares in a company we would have to source the money through normal commercial practice. Why should directors and executives not have to go through the same process as you or me? Again, it is not a case of income envy, but rather another argument about equality and transparency for all—the same treatment regardless of your position. 
The next area where Labor disagrees with the government is that of termination payments. You can see the government's approach in this particular section of the bills. Section 200B of the bill prevents a payment being made in connection with retirement from a board or managerial office, unless shareholder approval is first obtained. That is a good point; that is fair enough. But the government, in sections 200F, 200G and 200H, then provides exceptions to that rule. That is clever stuff and, as is normal for this government, too clever by half. How can you make a rule and then make a whole bunch of exemptions? This government has done it yet again.
Labor believes that the thresholds for these approvals are again set at too high a level: one set of rules for most people, yet another set for people at a certain level and, of course, exemptions for people at the top end of town. Again, this is about equality of treatment. The largest corporate collapse in our history, HIH, was the subject of a royal commission. The royal commission made, as is normal, a number of recommendations to address the deficiencies that it identified. What happened to the recommendations of the royal commission? These bills do in fact give force to some of Justice Owen's recommendations. However, they do not give force to all of his recommendations.
The Labor Party will give force to all of Justice Owen's recommendations from the HIH Royal Commission. One key recommendation was that there be a four-year period before a company's auditor or audit partners would be able to join the client. Based on the HIH example, this is a sensible course of action and one that the government has not seen fit to give credence to. Secondly, the royal commission recommended that auditors would not be able to provide non-audit services which would compromise the independent role expected of company auditors. These measures, recommended as a result of identified deficiencies, should in my view be implemented. Yet again, the government has failed to do so.
The ALP also requires that auditors provide more information than is currently the case. This concept of an audit opinion, as part of the company's annual report, would allow shareholders and potential investors to be clear about all advice provided from the auditors to the company—again reinforcing my opening position about the clear and precise provision of information to all.
Labor is also of the view that more needs to be done to strengthen analyst independence and enhance the disclosure requirements so that potential investors can place more credence on such information. Labor is committed to increasing the power and role of shareholders. Labor would require more extensive disclosure and would ensure that shareholders have an increased say in the operation of the company they choose to invest in. But there is always a balance to be struck between the rights of companies and those that they deal with. However, that balance should always weigh up risk. Unless shareholders and investors are confident that the company is operating within the law and that sufficient information is available, then the current changes do not go far enough. Rather than listen to Minister Coonan rant about income envy, the Labor Party is interested in the effective corporate regulation to protect our fellow Australians and their investment in their future wellbeing. 
Question agreed to. 
Bills read a second time.
Ordered that the consideration of these bills in Committee of the Whole be made an order of the day for a later hour.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-16,"—The legislation we are debating is fairly monumental legislation, and there is certainly a great deal of interest in it in the community. The Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 closes the existing Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme to new parliamentarians, and the Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004 establishes a new superannuation scheme for all members and senators elected at or after the next general federal election. Labor will support these two bills, but not without reminding the Liberal-National Party government that, had the Labor Party not announced on 9 February its intention to close the existing parliamentary superannuation scheme, we would not be here today debating these bills. Following the announcement by the Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Latham, that we intended to close the parliamentary superannuation scheme, it took the Liberal-National Party government just two days to execute one of the most monumental backflips we have seen in Australian politics in recent times. It was described aptly by a notable political commentator, Mr Dennis Shanahan, who writes for the Australian. He said:
It's a backflip of the order that would do the Howard family's bedtime story character, Mr Flip-Flop, proud.
We saw one of the most vitriolic internal conflicts ever faced by a Liberal-National Party government. It was a conflict that almost turned into a parliamentary revolt not on one occasion but on two occasions, as I understand it, when the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, announced that he was adopting Labor's policy to close the existing superannuation scheme for parliamentarians and replace it with a scheme that better reflects the current community standard. This was a decision by a Liberal government which was truly policy on the run, a reaction that resulted in a reversal of grand proportions.
In the days following Mr Latham's announcement, and prior to the Prime Minister making his announcement, several of the Prime Minister's parliamentary colleagues rushed out to the media to voice support for the existing parliamentary superannuation scheme and to oppose its closure. The Prime Minister was quickly on the defence and he stated:
... a lot of people out in the community think anything in relation to Members of Parliament and anybody in elected office is unmeritorious. I have to say that the salaries paid to senior ministers compared with the responsibilities of people in the private sector are way below what is received in the private sector. 
That was said in defence of the politicians' superannuation scheme. Then the Treasurer, Mr Costello, weighed in and said:
... by changing the super scheme, do you think you will get better MPs? We ought to do things that will get us better MPs in Australia, but I don't think this is one of the things—
that is, closing the PCSS—
that will do it.
As we subsequently discovered on this occasion, Mr Costello really got hung out to dry on the issue. We also had the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, adding his perspective. He said:
I don't think what politicians are paid overall is unreasonable.
That was said in defence of the politicians' superannuation scheme. Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate—I am glad to see his colleague Senator McGauran is here—could not resist the temptation to put his very unique stamp on the debate in relation to politicians' superannuation. He stated about Labor's policy:
It reeks of Hansonism. In the worst possible way, it is populist.
That was the contribution of Senator Boswell from the National Party. What could be more populist than a government changing its mind almost overnight—in two days—and a Liberal government collapsing in the face of public support for the Mark Latham led Labor initiative? The Prime Minister has been in parliament for over 30 years and this was the first time we learned that the Prime Minister had anything approaching concern about closing the existing parliamentary superannuation scheme. Let us face it: the Prime Minister had no intention of closing down the out-of-date—and, we have argued, overly generous in a contemporary and community context—Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme until it posed a risk to his own government. The government's decision to close the scheme was nothing more than knee-jerk politics in the hope that jumping on the bandwagon would somehow assist a tired and fading government that has run out of ideas and initiatives.
—Live in hope; that's what you said last time, Nick.
—Senator Kemp is actively interjecting. He was the Assistant Treasurer responsible for superannuation. We never saw Senator Kemp coming up with an initiative like this on behalf of the Liberal Party. He did not have the leadership, the fortitude or the bravery to confront his own colleagues. He presented nothing in terms of leadership on this issue during his couple of years as Assistant Treasurer responsible for superannuation.
I turn to a little bit of history. The existing parliamentary scheme was set up in 1948 by the Labor government of Mr Ben Chifley. The reasons given for the establishment of a scheme for parliamentarians were an acknowledgement that at that time entering parliamentary service often meant a reduction in parliamentarians' opportunities to re-establish careers and the loss of a potential superannuation payout from an employer when the parliamentarian left that employer prior to retirement age. The scheme acknowledged that some sort of compensation was needed to encourage people of higher calibre to enter parliament. As Ben Chifley stated in the second reading speech to the bill in 1948:
In its general purpose the scheme aims to meet the situation, long recognised by members of all parties, that men or women who serve in parliament often sacrifice opportunities to provide against the day when their parliamentary careers come to an end.
He pointed out that most of those who were likely to benefit from the introduction of the retiring allowance were `not drawn from the wealthy classes' and had `no substantial private means'. Let us turn to the situation today, which is very different from some 50 years ago. Members in 1948 were generally older when they entered parliament and, on losing their seats, their age would often prevent them obtaining further employment. Many were in occupations that would be very difficult to return to if they lost their seats. It is unlike the situation today, where generally, although not exclusively, people who leave parliament can return to the work force in some form. 
In addition, people whose careers had been in the trades and semiskilled labour force were unlikely to have accrued assets that could support them and their families in their post-parliamentary lives. When the scheme was initially established it was nowhere near as generous as the current scheme. In fact, it was only about a quarter of the level of benefit of the current fund. It was recognised that the nature of parliamentary service—a service that could be ended by a vote of the electors—was somewhat different from employment in the wider community, which was largely permanent in nature. The then deputy leader of the opposition, Queensland Liberal senator the Hon. Neil O'Sullivan, stated during the debate:
People in private industry, occupying positions carrying salaries equal to the allowances of honourable senators, cannot be sacked overnight without due compensation.
	...	...	...
I am willing to share with the Government the responsibility for the introduction of a pension scheme.
So there was bipartisan support for the introduction of the scheme in 1948. But, as I have indicated, Australia has changed dramatically since that time, particularly with respect to superannuation. One little footnote of history that is often missed in this debate is that the Chifley Labor government established national superannuation for all Australian workers at that time. That was a funded national superannuation system that would have provided a higher retirement income than the current age pension system. On its election in 1951, the Menzies Liberal government ceased funding the national superannuation scheme that was to cover the broader Australian work force. I put that into context. Back in 1948, the Labor government focused not just on politicians; it focused on the entire community in terms of superannuation.
Superannuation is now universal, as a consequence of Labor's visionary move to introduce compulsory superannuation, known as the superannuation guarantee. It started with an initial three per cent in 1987 and rose to the present nine per cent in 2002-03. I remind the Senate and those listening that the current Liberal government vehemently opposed, from opposition, the establishment of superannuation coverage for most Australian workers. Until 15 years ago only the relatively privileged—mainly males and, certainly, people who worked for large employers on middle to high incomes—had access to superannuation. Today some 88 per cent of employees have superannuation, thanks to the Australian Labor Party.
Today's parliamentarians generally enter parliament at a younger age and, more often than not, have some professional qualifications. On leaving parliament, many former members are snapped up by both private industry and the public sector in a variety of roles. Others can more easily re-enter their former professions. Unlike the circumstances of 1948, today—again, thanks to a Labor government—if you leave an employer to enter parliament and you have a superannuation entitlement, you maintain that entitlement through vesting. That was not a situation that existed in 1948. 
Few former parliamentarians today are left with limited means and work opportunities. Certainly, at 50 you can return to the law today far more easily than you could have returned to driving a train in Chifley's era. Today the general work force is more transient. Suddenly departing the parliament at an election is no longer so different from being made redundant or being required to change employment in the private sector. That is the circumstance that affects most of the Australian work force today. As I have said, superannuation is not lost if a person leaves one employer for another or, more specifically, to enter parliament.
As a result of the changes I have outlined, there has been a growing cynicism about the generosity of the existing parliamentary superannuation scheme. That is understandable. Today's community standard for superannuation is nine per cent. That is the established minimum and, for the overwhelming majority of the work force, it is the level of superannuation contribution from their employer. It is understandable that the community has developed a concern and cynicism about the fact that parliamentarians have a defined benefit superannuation fund significantly in excess of the benefits that the community enjoys—some seven times the level of benefit of most Australians. Of course, the fund is also paid for with the Australian community's taxes.
It is now the appropriate time to change the situation, and Labor supports the legislation but with one important qualification. There has been, and no doubt will be, argument as to whether the scheme should be closed down completely and retrospectively—even to existing members. The existing scheme is a defined benefits scheme. That is, it provides a guaranteed level for a lump sum combined with a pension regardless of the performance of the fund, earning rates and fees and charges. Again this differs dramatically from the overwhelming situation that confronts the Australian work force. They are generally in what is known as an accumulation fund where they are subject to market rates of return—they have certainly had some negative returns in recent times—which gives no guarantee of a final savings figure and is subject to fees and charges. Defined benefit funds do not have that feature.
Defined benefit funds are not just confined to politicians. In the past there has been widespread coverage of parts of the Australian work force, in both the private sector and particularly in the public sector, by defined benefit funds. However, they have been declining rapidly in recent years for a variety of reasons, not least because they are costly to run. They have higher contribution levels. There has been a very clear trend towards the closure of what is known as DB—defined benefit—funds. It is important to note that when a defined benefit fund is closed it is closed to new members but not to existing members. In other words, it is not retrospectively closed to existing members. The closure of the schemes retrospectively generates rights to substantial compensation by the members because of the impact a retrospective closure would bring.
Whilst we cannot obtain accurate statistics, we do know that there are certainly hundreds of thousands of Australians in the work force who are in a defined benefit fund that has been closed, across both the private and public sectors. Most state governments have closed their defined benefit funds. Regulations have passed this parliament to close the Commonwealth Public Service defined benefit fund. But the funds have not been closed retrospectively, with existing members being required to leave the existing defined benefit fund. The new fund applies to new employees. 
That brings me to the argument that has been advanced in favour of retrospective closure of the existing scheme. The argument is that you cannot have two classes of employees; you cannot have one group of parliamentarians under an old defined benefit fund that is more generous than the new fund, which pays a lower level contribution to new parliamentarians. That is not a unique situation. As I have said, there are hundreds of thousands of workers in both the private and the public sectors in old defined benefit funds working side by side—often doing the same job—with employees who are in new accumulation funds with a lower benefit. It is not an unusual situation. Allowing the existing scheme to remain for current members and former members recognises this clear legal and practical principle.
Labor have some concerns about the level of generosity at the top end of the current parliamentary scheme. It is very generous to ministers and to other officeholders. It is an acknowledged fact that most defined benefit funds, whatever their nature, have a capping provision; they do not have an unlimited benefit at the top end. Labor acknowledge this fact and we will be moving an amendment to cap the amount in the current scheme for a number of officeholders' and ministers' allowances that are included in the calculation—in other words, to increase the retirement benefits under the existing scheme. It is a small number of people. The capping measure that we will be moving as an amendment caps the upper limit to the current cabinet ministers' additional loadings. The Parliamentary Contribution Superannuation Scheme uses these allowances—it is a complex formula—to calculate retirement benefits, but we believe there should be a cap at the upper level.
I note the leadership exercised by Mark Latham on this issue. He has been very insistent that, if he is elected Prime Minister of Australia, the cap will apply to him. His benefit will be lowered to below that which he would otherwise obtain under the current scheme. Labor does not see that the role of ministers and other officeholders should be completely ignored, but it does believe that some of the more senior officeholders are, with respect to superannuation, overcompensated. So we will be moving a capping amendment at the committee stage, which will mean that the allowance for the Prime Minister, for example, which is currently set at 160 per cent, is capped at 72.5 per cent. If Mark Latham is elected Prime Minister, that would mean a loss for him of some half a million dollars to $1.9 million, if it was in a lump sum, depending on how long he lives and how long he serves as Prime Minister. That cap will be applied to all future prime ministers, deputy prime ministers, treasurers, Senate leaders, leaders of the House, Speakers of the House and Presidents of the Senate.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-06-16,"—The Australian Democrats have long campaigned for the reform of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme. We go back quite a long way. Indeed, in 1996 we successfully won a reference to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation—and I acknowledge the chairman of that committee, Senator Watson, and the then deputy chair, Senator Sherry, are both in the chamber at the moment. The committee investigated the parliamentary superannuation scheme in 1997 and reported in September of that year, and it is worth acknowledging its unanimous conclusion:
The Committee considers that change to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme is desirable. The scheme is now out of step with superannuation practice in the wider community. There is convincing evidence that it is excessively generous to a small group of retiring parliamentarians. 
That was its conclusion back in 1997. Seven years later, we finally get some action in respect of that conclusion. I do acknowledge that in 2001 there were some changes to the ability to preserve benefits but no changes to the actual size of the benefits themselves. The frustration of the committee in 1997 was due to a reluctance of the Labor and coalition caucuses to agree to a reduction in the level of public subsidy to the parliamentary superannuation scheme. That has been the core problem all the way through. Politicians voting on their own remuneration are not prepared to cop a cut, even when they acknowledge that on every possible consideration it is way out of kilter with the superannuation remuneration in the private sector and the community generally. 
The Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004 and the Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 are a direct result of comments made by the Labor leader, Mark Latham. Today I want to focus my comments on the Labor Party's position on parliamentary superannuation. In August last year, Mark Latham launched this debate by saying on Brisbane radio that the public had every right to be angry about the generous superannuation for politicians. He went on to say:
There is a lot of distrust of the political system and one of the nagging concerns is the double standard about super.
In February, just before he launched this initiative, he said:
... I can't defend the current scheme. It is way out of line from a decent community standard and it is also way out of date. This is a scheme that was devised at a time when it was said as politicians left parliament they struggled to get decent jobs ... 
He also said:
I think politicians need to recognise that a lot of the public distrust and cynicism about modern politics is about double standards, and when people see a parliamentary super scheme that is way out of line, far more generous than a community standard, it is hardly surprising that the public makes a grievance about that. 
A week later he announced his changes. I was getting quite excited. I thought, `We're finally going to get the changes we need to see.' What did we see? The 226 current MPs were carved out of any reform. They were going to continue in a scheme that the Leader of the Opposition said he could not defend, was a double standard, was overly generous and was out of step with community standards. But it is okay for the current 226 MPs to continue to be members of that scheme and to continue to have excessive benefits. I note that in the ALP's news statement on 10 February Mr Latham again said that parliamentary superannuation had become a major source of public dissatisfaction and cynicism in modern politics and that was why a Labor government would pass legislation closing the scheme to new entrants. Why not to existing people? Why do we not acknowledge that, if you stand for election and are elected at the next election by the Australian people, you are contracting for another term with the Australian people? Why is it that somehow the 226 existing MPs are being put in this special class of people who are going to be able to maintain a superannuation subsidy, courtesy of the taxpayer, equivalent to 67 per cent of salary? 
The Democrats think that is utterly inappropriate, and it is the weakness in the position put by Mark Latham. By bringing these reforms forward as evidence of the need to get cynicism and double standards out of politics, he has created a new double standard and a new level of cynicism because the reforms will apply to new MPs but not to existing MPs. Let me give you one example of how this will apply. Hypothetically, if the new member for Kingsford Smith becomes a minister in a future Labor government, he will be subject to the new superannuation scheme—nine per cent of his office holder's allowance will be his superannuation entitlement as a minister. But, if he is side by side with Senator Sherry in the cabinet room, Senator Sherry will be on the old scheme and will be entitled to a full additional defined benefit of 2½ per cent to his final defined benefit of salary for each year that he is a minister. Somehow Senator Sherry's package will be worth an awful lot more than, say, Mr Garrett's package as a minister for the same time. I am not going to get into the question of whether Senator Sherry or Mr Garrett will be worth more or less as a minister, but I think it is inappropriate to have in the cabinet room two people on two totally different remuneration systems doing pretty much the same sort of work.  
That is the why in the committee stage the Democrats will be moving amendments which will try to deal with this issue. We will make the entire Senate vote on these amendments to ensure that the current scheme is closed down for all MPs and that all MPs who are reelected at the next election will be under the new scheme. We will put in place transitional proposals based on those in the current bill to ensure that the service up to the next election will be determined under the current superannuation scheme and will not be retrospective. 
It is an absolute furphy, and Senator Sherry should know it, to argue that it is retrospective, to say that the new scheme should not apply to existing MPs. As the witnesses from the Department of Finance and Administration made clear in their evidence to the Senate committee that investigated this bill a couple of weeks ago, we in this place are not bound by the laws of contract, that this is a statutory entitlement—it is almost a statutory privilege to have access to a superannuation scheme—and the issues of contract law and retrospectivity do not apply because this entitlement flows from statute and not from a personal right. Our view is that it is not a matter of retrospectivity. If you go to the Australian people at the next election and say, `I want a contract for another term as a member of parliament,' you should agree to the same terms and conditions that the new entrants—who are unlucky enough not to be in the class of 2004—get for their superannuation. We will move those amendments and we will make this chamber vote on them. We think it is an important principle. If this chamber is going to vote to maintain for itself a whole range of superannuation concessions that it is not prepared to grant to new entrants, then it should be on the record that it is prepared to do so. 
I really hope that the backbenchers of both the coalition and the Labor Party think carefully about what they are asking the Senate to do today as to whether it is fair and appropriate to say that new members of parliament are going to be paid 60 per cent less than us just because we were here first. I think that is an appalling principle to apply to superannuation and to politicians' remuneration. It is an appalling principle to carve ourselves out as an exception to reform of a benefit that is acknowledged as way beyond a reasonable community standard and to do so based on a furphy of a legal argument that any other approach would be retrospective. It is not retrospective; it is not a breach of the federal Constitution. All the other furphies that have been raised have been knocked out by the evidence we heard at the Senate committee inquiry. We can and should acknowledge that the community is not happy with our superannuation scheme and that we can and should bring our scheme into line with community standards. 
I will move those amendments in the committee stage, and I do hope the Senate approves them. If those amendments fail I will move a second set of amendments—the `Peter Andren option', which the chamber will also get a chance to vote on—which allows members of parliament to opt out of the current scheme and to go onto the community standard and be publicly accountable for that. I hope that the Senate will give parliamentarians the option to shift out of the current scheme into the new scheme and to be accountable to their voters for doing the right thing by not being part of this double standard that Mr Latham said was in such need of reform. I do hope the chamber gives that amendment favourable consideration, and I acknowledge that senators will get the chance to vote on it. 
The Democrats have long supported reform of the existing parliamentary superannuation scheme. The proposed changes outlined in the bill apply only to future members and senators. The overly generous retirement pensions for existing members of parliament will continue to accrue superannuation benefits based on the old rules. We believe it is hypocritical for current MPs to impose reduced entitlements on future MPs while maintaining an increase in their own excessively generous superannuation entitlements. It is disappointing that this is the situation that this parliament has come to today. Only the Democrats—and I acknowledge the work of the Independent MP Mr Peter Andren—have proposed alternatives which would see changes to superannuation entitlements for all MPs applying from the next election. We have done this on the basis of the recommendations of the 1997 Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which acknowledged that the current scheme was excessive, and on the basis of the acknowledgment by the Leader of the Opposition that the current scheme is a matter of public distrust and sets a double standard. I hope the parliament gives favourable consideration to these aspects.
It is worth noting for the record that, according to the most recent Senate inquiry into this bill, the current level of public subsidy to the superannuation scheme is equivalent to 67.6 per cent of parliamentarians' salaries. That is the current actuarial cost of the current scheme, calculated as a notional percentage of politicians' current salaries. That is an enormous benefit when you compare it with the community standard of nine per cent. Over the course of the development of this scheme, we have voted ourselves a superannuation package that is roughly seven times more generous than that which applies to the community as a whole. I acknowledge that the changes in 2001 did result in a reduction in that percentage, from 69.2 per cent to 67.6 per cent of notional salaries, but the changes we are making today, according to the evidence from the Department of Finance and Administration, will have a fairly minimal immediate effect on that cost. It will take many years before there is any significant reduction in the cost to the taxpayer.
We estimate that, by failing to impose on existing MPs the changes to the scheme, the unfunded liabilities will be increased to the tune of $45 million a year for each of the next three years. That is the cost of the unfunded liability that we, the 226 members of the class of 2004, represent by voting to keep ourselves in the old fund. That is an impost that we should not impose on the taxpayers of Australia. I can think of a lot better ways to spend $45 million a year than to subsidise the retirement incomes of people in this place.
I should also note that the unfunded liability for the current parliamentary superannuation scheme is $551 million. This was exposed by the Democrats at estimates committees last year. That liability will continue to rise if we ensure that existing MPs remain in the current scheme. If we want to reduce that liability, we have to move to a fully funded scheme. The government's proposal for a nine per cent scheme is at least a fully funded scheme for future MPs. It is incumbent upon us to try to reduce unfunded liabilities in superannuation, and it would be reasonable to do so in respect of our people. 
I should also note in passing that the current scheme has a range of different anomalies. If a person leaves parliament with less than eight years service—which applies to a significant number of members of parliament—they get much less of a benefit than someone who retires with more than eight years service. The public benefit rises for each year of service after that, peaking at a maximum of 18 years service before starting to decline. It is impossible to determine equity between members of parliament under the current scheme because each member of parliament will end up with a different level of public subsidy, depending on the years of service they have completed when they retire. We need to deal with this matter, and the best way to deal with it is to put everybody on the same basis. A flat nine per cent superannuation contribution from all would be fair to all, whereas the current scheme throws up anomalies between MPs.
It would also mean that superannuation would no longer be a reason for people to stay in or leave the parliament. The number of people who hang on to get that pension at eight, nine or 12 years service is quite significant. The actuary who gave advice to the Senate committee acknowledged that there is evidence that people do hang on just to qualify and then depart. If we moved to a fully funded scheme with a flat rate for all employer contributions, we would get rid of superannuation as a reason for people to hang on past the date they felt they were useful. There would be a benefit to the public out of the amendments the Democrats will move in the committee stage.
Senator Sherry raised concerns about whether the Democrat amendments would be retrospective. I do not believe they would be. DOFA advised the committee inquiry that these bills pose a very low risk of constitutional issues arising from taking away a right that we are not entitled to under section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. A politician does not have a contract of employment with the parliament; rather, a politician has an entitlement established in legislation to payment of salary and conditions during the term they are a politician. It is neither a contractual right nor an employment right; it is a statutory entitlement. As such, the changes recommended by the Democrats are not retrospective and should be supported. They will ensure that all parliamentarians are on the same remuneration basis. Any entitlement that has accrued to a current politician would be maintained under our proposal—we do not propose to take away what has already been accumulated or earned—but it is the decision of all of us to contest the 2004 election, which constitutes a new statutory engagement with the Australian people. If we lose we should be entitled to our existing entitlement but, if we win, we should accept the entitlements for future service on the same basis as all of our colleagues. That is a reasonable proposal, and I hope that the government will consider it.
In the context of parliamentary remuneration generally, the Democrats are of the very firm view that there should be a holistic review of parliamentarians' remuneration and that it should not be done by this place. It should not be done by 226 people who have to declare an interest in the bill and who will vote on their future entitlements. It should be done by the Remuneration Tribunal, which should be given complete control over all aspects of a politician's package. The tribunal should be required to undertake a holistic review of salary and entitlements, with a view to setting a package. Each of us is responsible to our electorates for how we use that package, but the package as a whole would be the subject of an independent determination. The Democrats strongly believe that that is the approach which needs to be adopted in dealing with these issues. 
It is a massive conflict of interest for each of us here to be voting today on what our superannuation would be. It is a massive conflict of interest and a massive double standard for us to be voting to exclude ourselves from a reform which we are imposing on new MPs. It is certainly a massive conflict of interest when we acknowledge that we are voting to keep for ourselves a standard way beyond that which currently applies to the general community. From that point of view, the Democrats will be supporting this bill as it is at least a move in reducing the excessively generous subsidy from the public to our superannuation fund, but we will be moving in the committee stage to take it further and apply it to all of us so that none of us can be accused of a double standard or hypocrisy. That will ensure in going to the next election that each of us will be acknowledging our scheme is out of kilter with the community and each of us is committed to moving it back to that community standard, and this is part of that process.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2004-06-16,"—The radio audience will now be well aware that the Senate is debating the Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004 and the Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. The purpose of the two bills is to establish new superannuation arrangements for new members of the Commonwealth parliament as from the next election. Under the primary bill, employer contributions made on behalf of new members and senators will now be nine per cent, which is equal to the superannuation guarantee requirements, and will be paid into a complying superannuation fund of their choice. The purpose of the other entitlements bill is to close the parliamentary scheme to new members from the next federal election, to suspend any pension being paid to former members and senators who re-enter the Commonwealth parliament at or after the next federal election, and to allow members and senators covered by the arrangements in the Parliamentary Superannuation Bill to salary sacrifice up to 50 per cent of their parliamentary salaries.
These amendments are being made, as the Prime Minister stated, in response to the public's general perception that parliamentary superannuation is too generous. That is not doubted, because there is a community perception that all parties agree to the changes. Here we have an initiative to reduce the portion of the superannuation entitlement package to parliamentarians which is regarded as excessive. I think all parties agree. In fact, Mark Latham, while agreeing, said that the changes should go further and be extended to judges and the Governor-General. That is not what the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation decided in 1997, because there are particular and peculiar circumstances relating to judges which warrant the continuation of the current arrangements. It seems that the proposed amendments to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme have the support, in principle, of all major parties and Independents. Some wanted to go further and have suggested amendments.
The comments on parliamentary superannuation by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition are interesting in that they virtually echo what was stated by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which I chaired in 1997, in its report The Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme and the Judges' Pension Scheme. The committee heard at that time a criticism from some quarters that the scheme was `excessively generous and out of step with community standards'. One area that was particularly highlighted was the payment of pension benefits to retiring or defeated parliamentarians before the usual retiring age. As a result of that report, the Howard government acted and removed the ability for politicians under 55 years to access these provisions at an earlier date. I remind honourable senators that the Commonwealth parliamentary superannuation scheme was built around a concept many years ago of many members and senators having a career before entering parliament later on in life. Not surprisingly in this day and age, there was a blow-out in costs to the parliamentary scheme. This was due in part to the fact that, across the whole community, people have also been living longer, including parliamentarians. 
The committee also found that the apparent generosity of the parliamentary superannuation scheme must be considered in the context of the overall remuneration package—not looked at separately. There was adequate evidence that parliamentary superannuation lagged behind what was expected for similar levels of responsibility in the private sector and some public sector positions. Basically, there were problems with the scheme in terms of internal inconsistencies and so on. I must declare an interest because I was a trustee and still am. The Senate select committee heard evidence at the time—in 1997—that there were many talented people who would not consider becoming parliamentarians because of the relatively low remuneration package compared with other options that were available to them. There were other disincentives as well—disruption of lifestyle, family life and careers.
Witnesses and submissions highlighted a number of issues relating to the parliamentary superannuation scheme, such as a lack of equity between members of the scheme, the inflexible nature of the scheme, the compulsory nature of members' contributions regardless of their circumstances, no portability of entitlements if a member leaves parliament and inadequate controls over the costs associated with benefits received by partners of parliamentarians or ex-parliamentarians when they die. There were submissions that suggested the scheme should be replaced with a fully funded accumulation scheme. While this option had a number of benefits, the committee then was of the view that parliament needed to focus on issues relating to independence before considering replacing the scheme with an accumulation scheme. One of the advantages of the proposed changes to the parliamentary superannuation scheme is that over time the ongoing unfunded liability of the scheme will be reduced—and reduced quite considerably. The reduction is expected to be $0.9 million in 2003-04, increasing to $5.3 million in 2007-08.
The amendments will also have the effect of bringing parliamentary superannuation into line with a community standard. Currently, that community standard—the superannuation guarantee rate, which employers are obliged to put in for their eligible employees—is nine per cent. The amendments will also mean that parliamentarians will be subjected to the same types of arrangements as their constituents—accumulation schemes. Further, by requiring new members and senators to have their contributions paid into a complying superannuation fund, the amendments will give them an understanding of how any changes to the superannuation legislation will affect the community generally. That has to be good.
One inevitable aspect of the changes is that three different classes of superannuation benefits will apply to parliamentarians, depending on when they were elected. That has applied in the public sector—the Commonwealth scheme—for quite some time, with different classes of people doing the same jobs. We will not be peculiar in that respect. Some people have argued that it is possible that the changes could result in the Remuneration Tribunal recommending a significant pay increase to compensate for the superannuation benefits that have been lost. I find that quite astounding. If something is regarded as excessively generous, why would we want the superannuation tribunal to use another avenue just, for example, to increase the absolute level of the remuneration outside superannuation to offset what was lost as a result of taking away the excessive component? On the other hand, it could be argued that, if the tribunal believed that there was an excessive component in the package, it could not be assumed that the tribunal would provide a salary offset to the superannuation package. With those thoughts in mind, I was surprised to read the report from the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee review of this bill. While it supported the package in the bill, the second part of the recommendation seemed to suggest that it sought a review of the remuneration entitlements soon after July 2004. I thought that would defeat some of the purpose here. 
One matter of interest is that, while parliamentarians will be able to choose the superannuation fund into which their contributions will be paid, they will be prevented from choosing to have their own self-managed fund. This will mean that parliamentarians who already have their own self-managed fund and are subject to the amendments will have to join another complying fund.
Some politicians have sought to publicly align themselves with community concerns over the excessive element in the superannuation package. I refer to Bob Brown, who is present in the chamber now, and Mr Andren in the House of Representatives. When called upon to use the pathway of giving a public declaration nominating a selected charity to receive the excessive component on their superannuation benefit, it was surprising that neither would give a public utterance. Therefore they both declined; maybe they might change their minds today. Each politician, while protesting vigorously—and that is their democratic right—knew that there was not a mechanism to move out of the existing parliamentary scheme while still a member. There is this pathway of nominating a selected charity, and that is quite clear: they can put it in the declaration of interests. I must say to Senator Brown and Mr Andren that some perceive this as a level of hypocrisy. But not the Australian media. They seem to be silent on this matter while talking about other aspects of the cases of Senator Brown and Mr Andren. And good luck to them.
As chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation at the time—1997—I was always of the view that significant change was inevitable, that moving to an accumulation scheme would tend to reduce many of the excessive benefits and that therefore it was only a matter of time before the door was opened. Despite the move to the community standard in relation to superannuation, there are still people—both in the parliament and in the community—who believe that politicians are over-rewarded. We must look at that with some degree of scepticism. If we are really interested in democracy, we should recognise that there is a real danger of developing a cult mentality that will lead to parliaments attracting mediocre people or those with private means. This will damage the parliament by removing the range and quality of representation, particularly from the professional and other sectors of society. I support the legislation. ",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-06-16,"—The Greens will support the Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004 and the Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 because they are a major move in the right direction. They reflect the policy of the Greens, the Democrats and Independents like Mr Andren, the member for Calare in the House of Representatives—a policy expressed over many years. I want to congratulate Mark Latham, the honourable leader of the opposition, for taking this policy up shortly after he became Leader of the Opposition and forcing the hand of the Prime Minister.
We now have at last a response to the very decent proposition that members of parliament should get the same top-up from their employers—the Australian people, ultimately the taxpayers—that other workers are, by law, expected to get from their employers: about a nine per cent top-up for the superannuation payments going towards retirement and sustenance in old age. However, the decision to split the proposal so that existing members of parliament will continue to get the 69 per cent top-up while new members of parliament after the next election will get the nine per cent top-up is testimony to the self-interest that is still deep within both the government and opposition parties.
I note that Mr Latham has said he will accept the lesser payment if he becomes Prime Minister, and that is to be lauded as well. But the caucuses of both the Labor and Liberal parties were very strongly motivated to keep the extra 69 per cent top-up coming from taxpayers. If it were payable up until the next election, you could understand that. But for this legislation to continue the 69 per cent payment to existing MPs after the next election would be to implement an outrageous two-tiered system—where people elected equally under the Constitution by an equal response from the people of Australia and who are doing equal work in this parliament, which is based on equality, will receive unequal remuneration. It is simply unacceptable for there to be a two-tiered system. Existing MPs who get re-elected by the people of Australia on 7 August, if that is the date, will continue to get a 69 per cent top-up, but new members of parliament elected equally by the Australian people will get a nine per cent top-up. This legislation is an extraordinary indictment of self-interest.
Moreover, I think this legislation is unconstitutional. I draw senators' attention to section 48 of the Constitution, which is imbued with the spirit of MPs being paid equally for the equal job they do in representing their constituents. It is a very short section. Section 48 states:
Until the Parliament otherwise provides, each senator and each member of the House of Representatives shall receive an allowance of four hundred pounds a year, to be reckoned from the day on which he takes his seat.
These days that would read, `he or she takes his or her seat'. That is it, but, if you accept the spirit of that Constitutional provision, all MPs would be paid equally. Of course, a system has evolved of paying a loading to those people who have ministerial responsibility or greater electoral responsibility through remoteness or size of electorates. But I do not think you can argue in any way that it is consistent with the Constitution for MPs to be getting different remuneration—and vastly different remuneration—through their superannuation provisions simply because some were in the old parliament and some are going to be in the new parliament. I believe that that opens this particular legislation to constitutional challenge. It is simply unfair legislation which is flouting a fair provision in the Constitution. 
I will be moving—along with Senator Cherry, if I heard him correctly—to amend this legislation so that after the next election all MPs, all senators and all members of the House of Representatives, will get the nine per cent top-up and not the 69 per cent alternative. I will also be supporting the Andren amendment, which is that those who wish to opt out should be able to. There is collective protection going on within the Labor and the coalition caucuses which says: `One in, all in. We will keep the 69 per cent for ourselves. Everybody has to accept that position.' It has been broken with to a degree by Mr Latham's laudable commitment regarding his potential prime ministerial superannuation top-up, but it is not acceptable that this parliament can write advantage into this piece of legislation for those people who are going to vote on it today, as opposed to those people who will come in as new representatives of the Australian people after 7 August or whenever the election is held. I ask members to reflect on that.
There is absolutely no difference in the status of MPs elected after each election. We start the job anew after an election. Each member is dismissed when an election is called and each member either comes back or newly comes here as absolutely equal, being appointed by the people of Australia as absolutely equal. What happens as far as ministries and so on are concerned is then left to the government of the day. But we are all elected equal, whether we are Mr Howard, Senator Watson or Senator O'Brien, whom I see on the Labor bench now. We are absolutely equal and we have no right to be legislating, as these bills seek to today, an inequality from the start based on the advantage of those people who, in the majority, would want to vote on this today. We will be putting forward that amendment—to make it equal, to make it all nine per cent after the next election—in the committee stage. I ask honourable senators on both sides of the house to reflect on that and to support that when the vote comes up in a short while.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2004-06-16,"—I want to make a few remarks in summing up the debate on this important legislation. The Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004 and the Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 form a package that will deliver on the Prime Minister's commitment to bring parliamentary superannuation in line with current community standards. The package closes the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme to new senators and members and puts in place new super arrangements for those members and senators who join the parliament at or after the next election. It will involve a government contribution of nine per cent of parliamentary salary, paid to a complying super fund or retirement savings account chosen by the senator or member, and there will be a default fund where no choice is made.
The senators and members covered by these new arrangements will have a salary sacrifice facility so they can supplement their superannuation. The arrangements will apply to new senators and members elected or appointed at or after the next election. This will include a former senator or member who rejoins the parliament at or after that time. Any pension being paid from the parliamentary contribution super scheme to a former senator or member who rejoins the parliament will be suspended while they remain in parliament, but payment of the pension will be restored from the later of the completion of that new period of parliamentary service or age 55. The changes proposed in these bills will not affect the super arrangements for sitting members and senators who will not be able to transfer to the new arrangements. 
The government has considered but does not support the changes moved by the Democrats and the Greens to transfer sitting MPs out of their current arrangements as those changes may have an effect on accrued superannuation. Such changes would not be in line with the super arrangements applying generally in the community, which protect accrued super entitlements. The existing senators and members will have made financial arrangements and commitments based on the expectation of continued membership of the current scheme. It would be quite unfair and inequitable to retrospectively reduce their entitlements.
We also do not support amendments moved by the opposition to cap the entitlements under the existing scheme of any existing MP. The arrangements proposed by the government will ensure that all MPs, existing and new, have their superannuation benefits based on their total parliamentary salaries regardless of the amount. If the opposition believes that it is appropriate for a Prime Minister to be paid a higher salary than a minister then it is entirely appropriate that the salary for superannuation purposes of that member should reflect that differential.
This legislation does come on top of some substantial government changes to the parliamentary contributions scheme in 2001 to more closely align parliamentary superannuation with the superannuation arrangements of the majority of Australians. Those changes meant that senators and members entering parliament after the last election would have their pensions deferred between leaving parliament and age 55—a significant change. That did impose a higher standard of preservation on parliamentarians than what is imposed on others who receive pensions. This is important legislation. I thank senators for their contributions to this debate.

Bills read a second time.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Senator SANTORO,",LP,2004-06-16,"—Yesterday the Queensland Treasurer, Mr Terry Mackenroth, handed down the state's 2004-05 budget. It is a budget underpinned by record funding flows from the Commonwealth, mightily helped along by the GST—every cent of which goes to the states and territories. A significantly positive proportion of it, of course, goes to Queensland. It is a budget helped along by the record surplus of $2.37 billion for 2003-04 expected to be recorded when the final figures are tallied after 30 June. In line with Mr Mackenroth's record as a Treasurer who consistently misses his targets, it is a budget underpinned by some figures that the prudent—those not named Mackenroth or Micawber—would place firmly in the fanciful column on the balance sheet.
State budgets are about service delivery. There is very little about them that goes to high policy questions. I said as much in my first speech in this place, and nothing has happened since to make me change my view. The states deliver services, increasingly with the benefit of Commonwealth fund inflows. When they perform that duty well they should get the credit. When they do not—and Queensland under Labor certainly displays great deficiencies in this respect—they get brickbats.
Today the people of Queensland are entitled to ask why, if everything in Mr Mackenroth's garden is so rosy, the ambulance tax—$88 a year on everyone's electricity accounts, and bad luck if you have more than one of those—has not improved ambulance response times. The people are entitled to ask why, when Mr Mackenroth has money to burn, electric shock complaints have gone up by 50 per cent in the past four years because of cutbacks in the government owned Energex power utility's maintenance and inspection services. The people are entitled to ask, when they hear the Premier and his ministers complaining about the state of the roads, why road funding in this budget—the best ever, according to the state Treasurer—has in real terms dropped to only 12 per cent of the overall capital works budget, when in 1998 it was 23 per cent. Twelve per cent is the lowest ever, which cannot be the best ever—unless, that is, you are a Labor politician. 
As state Liberal leader Bob Quinn said yesterday, as he and other Queenslanders looked for the nettles hidden in Mr Mackenroth's prize-winning flowerbeds, this is not good enough when Queensland is the major beneficiary of increased revenue flows from state taxation, the GST, the housing boom that has lined the state Treasurer's pockets with windfall stamp duty receipts and the spectacular one-off 18 per cent rise in investment returns—thanks to the buoyant stock market and nothing whatsoever to do with Mr Beattie, Mr Mackenroth or anything they may have concocted or have tried to convince us they have concocted in that area.
Why, when we have all heard for months from the Queensland Labor government about how they cannot fix the Ipswich Motorway and the Tugun bypass and all the other transport problems that result from Premier Beattie and others playing ostrich when a problem approaches, has Mr Mackenroth been unable to allocate extra money for roads? Why is it only now, Queenslanders might ask—and I certainly encourage them to do so—nearly six years after the spotlight was turned onto the state's horrendous problems with child abuse, that the Beattie government is beginning the real process of putting money into fixing it? While it is good to see this money allocated, as it is in other areas of social need, it will be even better to see the results if it is put into the business end of the process, the bit that actually does the work of protecting children, instead of into building yet another of Mr Beattie's self-serving bureaucracies. These are all questions of substance about which the Beattie Labor government prefers to be silent, to bluster or to try to sheet the blame home somewhere else—normally towards the federal sphere. 
The fundamental problem with the Beattie government, and this comes from the very top of it, is that spin substitutes for substance and delay replaces delivery. If the Beattie government was in the pizza delivery business, then it would have gone out of business a long time ago. This Premier thinks that policy is in fact politics. As much as he is a stand back and throw money politician, he is also a fill the air with hyperbole politician. It is the hard yards that matter; it is the results that count. 
Let us look at the real record rather than the remastered album he is now hawking around Brisbane town. Under Mr Beattie and Mr Mackenroth, Queensland has seen the disintegration of the Southern Pacific Petroleum shale oil project near Gladstone and the collapse of the proposed $286 million LG Chemical plant, also near Gladstone. Under Mr Beattie and Mr Mackenroth, Queensland has seen the scrapping of the proposed wastewater pipeline from Brisbane to the Darling Downs and also the loss of MIM to a Swiss company. Under Mr Beattie and Mr Mackenroth, Queensland's cane harvester Austoft has decided to move from Bundaberg to Brazil, while Kellogg, Incitec Fertilizers and Queensland pharmaceutical manufacturer Herron have relocated their operations, or at least parts of them, and Qantas decided to base its new budget airline Jetstar interstate. This is hardly a comforting record when it comes to attracting and keeping investments in Queensland—something that the Queensland Premier has been telling the state, the nation and the world how good he is at doing.
Then there is the matter of accurate forecasting of budgets, something else where Mr Beattie and his Treasurer are apparently in need of remedial instruction. It is a pity they will not be able to get that at TAFE. They have done a bit of their favourite reforming there also, and now it does not work nearly as well as it used to or it should. The fact is that glowing budget predictions look nice, but they have to stack up. Mr Mackenroth's predictions have a horrible habit of falling short. Yesterday he forecast an 8.5 per cent rise in business investment in Queensland for 2004-05. This time last year, forecasting a bumper crop for 2003-04, he shot for 9.5 per cent. Yesterday he was forced to admit to a 6.5 per cent outcome. Queenslanders today will be hoping that this time he manages to get closer to his target than a 33?per cent plus undershoot. 
According to the Queensland Treasurer, the budget handed down yesterday—the Beattie government's sixth—delivers on the commitment to improve the quality and range of services and infrastructure to the people of Queensland. Fresh from its February re-election, the state government says it has targeted its key priorities and that the expenditures are affordable. There is no doubt that they are affordable—on figures Mr Mackenroth has produced many people say that more indeed could be afforded—and it is here that the Queensland government comes unstuck. Of course it is not alone in state governments coming unstuck. All state Labor regimes come unstuck while performing the simplest of tasks, but it is here that it is most open to criticism. 
Health funding is going up by 11 per cent. Mr Mackenroth says that it shows heart. Queensland public hospital users will be hoping the money will actually go into service delivery and thus make a real difference and not just on paper. They will be hoping that the money does a front-end job delivering real improvements where it matters, rather than lubricating the bureaucracy where it does not. In regional areas delivery is not up to scratch. In the middle of the large population areas such as the Sunshine Coast, hospitals do not deliver ENT, ophthalmological or vascular outpatient services. Until now, a six- to 12-month wait for routine surgical procedures has been the norm and emergency departments waiting times are four hours plus. That is what Queensland Labor has been delivering during the past four or five years.
In 2004-05, health spending will total $5.1 billion in a budget worth $23.4 billion—21.3 per cent of the total state budget. But let us put that into perspective. It includes the proceeds of the $2.1 billion federal hospital funding package that Queensland signed up to last August. However, if Mr Mackenroth's new money can really treat the endemic malaise that afflicts the state hospital system, everyone will cheer—and I will certainly be the first to do so. The budget also provides for the full implementation of child safety reforms, or at least that is what the Treasurer claims. This will involve additional funding of at least $240 million a year—in Mr Mackenroth's words—by 2006-07. Child protection activists will no doubt note that this peak spending will arrive in 2006-07, eight years after Beattie's Labor government first had the opportunity to put right this dreadful wrong. That is another aspect of the Beattie government's appallingly bad record on service delivery, and it is an appallingly bad record in a fundamentally important area of service delivery—the protection of children, particularly the protection of children in state care.
Beattie Labor talks the talk but so far it has not shown that it can walk the walk. The fact is that, on the figures, the Queensland budget is remarkably fat. It is in this felicitous condition for a number of reasons—and this is at the heart of my interest in these matters. There is the GST. On a final outcome basis for 2003-04, Queensland will receive $6.410 billion from that source alone. In 2004-05 it is expected to receive $7.098 billion in GST money. The increase in GST revenue to Queensland between 2000-01 and 2004-05 is $2.44 billion or 52.4 per cent—an average annual increase of 11.2 per cent. And Mr Beattie and Mr Mackenroth still want Queenslanders to believe they have been short-changed by the federal government and so cannot deliver in key areas of service delivery. 
Then of course there are the federal specific purpose payments to the state government, which in 2003-04 totalled $3.145 billion and in 2004-05 are expected to total $3.282 billion. Clearly the state government has been well served in terms of revenue allocations by the federal Howard-Costello government. The state government has also received a windfall investment return, as I mentioned previously. It has benefited from windfall gains from stamp duty because of the housing boom and has announced some concessions, which I acknowledge in this place is good news. It has benefited from higher than anticipated state tax revenue. State tax cuts worth $300 million a year will be delivered. That is a start, which I also acknowledge, and offers some rewards to state taxpayers, who this year paid an additional $810 million to the government. Insurance duty will be cut from 8.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent. That is good too. I just put those figures on the record so that nobody on the other side particularly can accuse me of not recognising some of the good that is in the budget—as I said before, credit where credit is due.
Education spending will rise by almost seven per cent to improve facilities and boost teacher numbers. Again, much of this increase comes from the federal government, and that also must be acknowledged. Unfortunately, when it comes to Labor premiers and Labor governments, that acknowledgment is always slow in coming, if it ever does come. There is a record capital works budget of more than $6 billion, we are told. But there can be no argument that capital works need to be at record spending levels given the cost of today's infrastructure, the pressure of population growth in the south-east of Queensland, and the chronic decline in capital works budgets since the state coalition left office. Of course, the time lags involved in the cranking up of the capital works programs will see much of the benefits delayed. Debit tax will go from 1 July next year—one of the reform measures agreed to on the introduction of the GST. The government is also abolishing the 10 per cent credit card duty which is effectively a limited state GST. It is worth remembering that withdrawal of regressive state taxes was a primary objective of the Commonwealth tax reforms, which state Labor governments such as the Queensland government of course vigorously opposed. It is also worth remembering that the Labor Party and the state governments, Queensland included, brawled over and meddled with the new tax system and have been dragging their feet ever since.
There is a forecast budget surplus of $646 million in 2004-05 on top of the $2.37 billion surplus expected this year, a good recovery from the deficits Mr Mackenroth produced when global stock markets retreated and could no longer hide his inability to budget. Gross state product is forecast to grow by 4 per cent in 2004-05, driven by population growth, exports and business investment. Population growth is forecast at 2 per cent, more than 1,600 people a week, fuelling consumption as a major driver of the economy. Unemployment is expected to remain steady at 6 per cent. There is still no sign of Premier Beattie's 1998 promise of five per cent but, hey, never mind about that, the circus has moved on to new attractions these days. Mr Mackenroth says he is expecting at least another 100,000 jobs to be created. But what he does not say is that those jobs primarily result from the progressive workplace relations policies, the pro investment tax reforms and the sound financial and public administration of the Howard federal government. They will never result from the coercive and restrictive workplace relations and the anti small business policies of the Labor Party. 
Of course, Queensland is still a low tax state. But it does seem to have got into the business of bracket creep. Last year it was Mr Mackenroth's proud boast that Queenslanders paid 28 per cent less than other Australians in state taxes and charges. In 2004-05 Queenslanders will be forking out only 27 per cent less than other Australians. Does Mr Mackenroth have a secret `up by one per cent per year, not quite so low tax state policy' hidden in his desk drawer? He should not have, because Queensland is, despite so many years of Labor, still in a sound position. But the proof of the pudding—the budget pudding, not the magic pudding—will be in the eating, on results, not on forecasts, and we in this place will certainly make sure that the Queensland state government is held accountable, particularly when it absorbs so much of the federal funds that we so generously allocate to it.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Queensland Government: Budget</title>,Matters of Public Interest,5,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-06-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation (Senator Ian Macdonald), the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) and the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked by Senators Allison, Murphy, Mackay and Humphries today relating to the Government's white paper on renewable energy.
I will first remark on some of the more remarkable comments of Senator Minchin in an attempt to defend the indefensible. Senator Minchin was trying to say that a five per cent mandatory renewable energy target was a threat to Australia's coal industry and, therefore, to jobs. That is the inescapable conclusion of an analysis of what the minister said. A five per cent renewable energy target, according to Senator Minchin, is a threat to jobs in our export-oriented mining industry—what laughable nonsense. In fact, the government's policy is more than a threat to jobs; it is a guarantee of a decline in jobs in the renewable energy sector. It is those workers whom this government has betrayed, it is those jobs which will disappear, and what Senator Mackay said in her question, attributed to the industry, is evidence of the decline in employment which will result from this government's policy: Pacific Hydro announcing that it will put on the backburner $1.5 billion of expenditure on renewable energy and the industry saying that the result of this announcement will be $5 billion less in investment in the renewable energy sector. 
We had earlier this week a statement by the Wind Energy Association that, given an even break and an extension of the renewable energy target, by 2020 wind energy would be price competitive with coal. That would be a marvellous outcome for this country, a marvellous outcome for the environment. But this government has guaranteed that, if that is ever to be achieved, it would be put back further and further. The government's announcement, frankly, is a backward step for the environment, a backward step for the renewable energy industry, and it is laughable to suggest that a five per cent target is a real challenge to our export-oriented coal industry. That is utter nonsense.  
Senator Abetz, from my state of Tasmania, was nodding in approval and cheering in defence of a policy that will destroy jobs in his own state with the probable cessation of the proposal to manufacture the turbines in the state of Tasmania. Senator Abetz was cheering on the decline of an industry in his own state. That is absolutely disgraceful. The skewing of the renewable energy policy expansion will have that effect, there is no doubt about it, in a state that is the leader in renewable energy technology and the producer of an almost totally renewable energy market through hydro and wind power.
This government has had eight long years to come up with this so-called policy. For eight long years it has had its head in the sand. And what do we see? Yet another short-term fix focused on throwing dollars at the re-election of the government. When I analyse the package and see how many of the big numbers are back-ended well past the term of the coming parliament it reminds me of the fisherman's hall of fame. Has anyone heard of that? I think it was announced in 2001 that a fisherman's hall of fame was going to be built in Bundaberg. It was a great announcement by the coalition. It will be announced again for the next election because not a sod has been turned. This will be an announcement for the election after next, I suspect. This is the announcement of a policy for the coalition in opposition at the election after next because, frankly, it is a joke insofar as its back-ending out into future parliaments is concerned.
What does this policy do about some of the real issues for this country? What does it do about addressing global climate change with a long-term market based approach to greenhouse emission reduction? Nothing. What does it do to specifically address Australia's increasing dependence on crude oil? Absolutely nothing. What does it do to remove the regulatory impediments that are leading us to an energy supply crisis in households and industry? Again, the answer is nothing. This is a failed policy from this government. The opposition will look at aspects of it to see if there is any worth at all in it but it has failed the test we have laid out for it. It is a back to the 1950s policy and a demonstration of the bankruptcy of this government.",SENATE,<title> QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Environment: Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2004-06-16,"—I rise to speak about the mandatory renewable energy target policy that has been put out by this government. Despite some of the submissions from the opposition, there is a huge array of benefits in this policy. It is interesting to hear talk about the fisheries hall of fame in Bundaberg. I am quite sure the senator opposite will recognise that the formulators of this policy certainly should have pride of place in that hall of fame, because for the first time that I know of the barramundi fisheries in North Queensland and in the Northern Territory suddenly have access to one of the most crucial aspects of running them. Nearly 30 per cent of the cost of running the artesian fisheries is for petrol. This policy says that we will extend the rebate to include those issues that ensure that we run things that are outside of diesel. I am quite sure that people in the Northern Territory who are involved in the seafood industry will also recognise that this policy captures some of the issues they have been lobbying on for a very long time.
We talk about what we are doing globally for climate change. I would remind senators that Australia will meet its greenhouse targets in 2010. We are on track and will meet them in 2010. We will continue to support this sector until 2020, and this policy looks very clearly at ensuring that we do just that. We are putting in over $2 billion, and renewable energy investment will flow from this scheme, which is very important for the future of Australians. We talk about why we are looking after ordinary Australians through this process. If you look at the MRET review panel, if we are going to expand this target it will impose direct costs on households of ordinary Australians. Once again, the cost will be increasing prices for electricity and those sorts of commodity items. It will be harder because it will impact on people in their homes. 
The projected cumulative costs of meeting these sorts of targets will be more than $5 billion by 2020, and that is just in terms of some of the present net values. We want to broaden the range of low-emission options available in the future. There has been talk about wind losing out; we all know that one of the greatest impediments in the wind industry is the fact that you cannot simply flick the switch and have it tie into your grid. We know that the issues are all about storage so we are depending on the very good processes involved in research and development in this country. We have put $20 million towards someone who can come up with those sorts of options. We are expecting people to recruit into this program and to use Australian innovation and our very good science to resolve this issue. We have a high level of confidence that that will happen and we are backing it up with a $20 million incentive to ensure that the storage issues associated with converting wind energy into grids is resolved. These are the ways you have to go about this. You have to look at the direct impediments to ensuring that good quality Australian technology that is currently being found in Tasmania—and supporting 280 jobs there—is not only being supported but being underpinned by processes to ensure that the storage link that is missing will be resolved.
We will focus very strongly on reducing the cost on the broader range of some of the low-emission technologies. We know there will be some cost involved in that, and clearly the policy has set out ways of reducing in a broad sense the costs. We have allocated more than $300 million over the last six years to renewable energy development, and to say that this government does not have a comprehensive policy and has not made a comprehensive commitment to ensure that we are looking at alternative energies and are not very concerned about climate control and climate change is a complete furphy.
Also in this energy white paper is an allocation of $134 million, on top of the $600 million for low-emission technology, in support of the 2004-05 budget. This country, very proudly under the John Howard government, has said that we will put in train processes in Australia that will ensure we meet our targets by 2010 under the Kyoto arrangements. There is absolutely no doubt that we will meet our targets by 2010. It is just so important that we recognise that this policy deals not only with our global obligations but also with the domestic balances we have to find in this matter.",SENATE,<title> QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Environment: Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2004-06-16,"—I rise to speak on the same matter. I appreciate that Senator Scullion is actually here responding, because somebody who is not here responding is Senator Colbeck, and I wonder why. Today in the Advocate newspaper Senator Colbeck—who is a Liberal Party senator from Tasmania—expressed concern with what has happened. He expressed concern with respect to the fact that the MRET had not been increased and he expressed concern about the economic implications for Tasmania. He expressed concern about the very statement that his government made yesterday, but he is not here defending it. It is left to poor old Senator Scullion to come in here and defend it. In fact, I do not notice any Tasmanian senators in here talking about what is a very critical issue for Tasmania. 
—That is right, Senator McLucas. Tasmania generates around 60 per cent of Australia's renewable energy and is currently considered a world leader in developing renewable hydro and wind power. This reputation has been extremely hard fought. For those who remember, we have had a difficult history with hydro power in Tasmania. It has been a political hot potato. At last we had a situation whereby my state of Tasmania—which, as I said, produces 60 per cent of Australia's renewable energy—was in the box seat to reap the rewards of what has been a very difficult and politically chequered history, and that is hydro power in Tasmania. That has gone. Pacific Hydro have said—and I asked the minister about this today—that they are going to abandon $1.5 billion worth of projects as a result. This is disgraceful for Australia and for Australia's economy. Hydro Tasmania chief executive Mr Geoff Willis has said:
The White Paper is a major disappointment and displays a regrettable lack of vision and foresight on the part of the Federal Government.
He went on to say that there was nothing in yesterday's statement for the renewable energies sector at a time when it was still in its formative stage. Also he said, and he would know because he is the CEO of Hydro Tasmania:
The decision will dramatically reduce future investment in renewable energy across Australia, and Tasmania in particular.
He is not simply saying that as the CEO of Hydro Tasmania. He is saying that on behalf of the renewable energy industry right across Australia, and he is not the only one. His sentiments were echoed by the Chairman of Hydro Tasmania, who is ex Liberal senator Peter Rae. He went further than the CEO of Hydro Tasmania. He said that he was angered by the federal government's failure to announce anything to get more renewable energy into the national grid.
This energy statement sells out regional Australia. It sells out renewable energy's potential to develop jobs in regional Australia and, particularly, in Tasmania. Yesterday Vestas President and CEO Mr Svend Sigaard announced that Vestas have now shelved plans for a wind turbine blade factory in Tasmania's north-west due to lack of certainty and security as a result of this energy statement. The loss of this new investment to Tasmania will result in the loss of potentially 280 jobs. That investment to Tasmania was worth $25 million. That is an awful lot of money for a small state like Tasmania. It is an awful lot of money for a state that has finally got to the stage where it can be proud of its hydro capacity. For once in our history relying on hydro power is a good thing for the future of Australia and a good thing for the future of Tasmania. What do we now have? The hydro industry was finally getting to export its expertise right across the world, and then we got this body blow from the Howard government.
One has to wonder why. Why is Tasmania disproportionately affected by this? How do Tasmanians vote? All five Tasmanian seats in the House of Representatives are held by Labor. `Who cares about Tasmania?' says John Howard. `Who cares about Tasmania?' says this government. We on this side of the chamber do. We have indicated that we believe that the target should be lifted. We the Labor Party have said that we will fight for this.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2004-06-16,"—Listening to the ALP speakers this afternoon, one would think that the government is not committed to fostering the development of renewable energy and is not committed to doing everything possible to ensure that this country has a national strategy to develop a sustainable energy program. Of course the Howard government is committed to fostering the development of renewable energy. It is doing that through such initiatives as the Renewable Energy Showcase program, the Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program, the Photovoltaic Rebate Program, the Renewable Energy Equity Fund and the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program. All of these things remain in place, as does the existing MRET scheme. 
In other words, this government retains its commitment. I repeat that for the benefit of the people who are listening around Australia and who may have the wrong impression, especially from the comments of Senator Mackay: this government retains its commitment to fostering the development of renewable energy. That means fostering energy from sources such as wind, solar and hydro. The MRET scheme as it exists now will generate an additional 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity each year. For the information of the Senate and Senator Mackay, this is the equivalent of two new Snowy Mountains hydroelectric schemes a year and is enough power to meet the residential electricity needs of four million people. The Howard government has a very fine record of commitment to renewable energy. That is characteristic of the very strong approach the Howard government has taken to the environment since it came into office eight years ago.
The Howard government has four outstanding achievements that point to its record on the environment. The establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust has been, as I am sure Senator Mackay knows, a great success and $2.7 billion has been allocated to it over the period of this government. The Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act was introduced in 1999 which, for the first time, gave the federal government a say in environmental issues. Instead of having to come late into the process through bodies such as the Foreign Investment Review Board, the federal government now has direct involvement at the beginning of environmental issues through its decision to involve itself under five specific headings in environmental matters. The Howard government, as a world first, established the Australian Greenhouse Office. As Senator Scullion said, we have a very fine record in dealing with greenhouse issues in this country. Not signing on to the Kyoto protocol does not mean that this government is not concerned about greenhouse. In fact, under this government Australia is on track to meet its greenhouse targets regardless of the fact that we regard the Kyoto agreement to be a flawed agreement that would have an adverse impact on Australia. Then we have other major environmental initiatives such as our measures to control salinity and the proposals to have a national water program.
Under the energy statement made by the government yesterday, one of the major features is a complete overhaul of the fuel excise system to remove $1.4 billion in excise liability from diesel fuel excise. That will largely benefit people in regional Australia and in the agricultural and mining sectors. So much for Senator Mackay's comment that the energy statement was a sell-out to regional Australia. Far from being a sell-out, the Howard government has done a great deal to improve the delivery of energy and to reduce the costs of energy in regional Australia—and that is consistent with its general approach to environmental issues.",SENATE,<title> QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Environment: Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2004-06-16,"—I find Senator Eggleston's contribution somewhat ironic. I thought it was a strange decision for him to raise the Snowy Mountain scheme because one has to ask what might have happened to the Snowy scheme under the government's policy announced yesterday. We probably would not end up with a Snowy Mountain scheme, so it is an unusual choice for Senator Eggleston. 
I also want to make the obvious point that Senator Scullion said quite clearly that the government was going to meet the Kyoto principles—obviously thinking that was a good thing to do—and yet Senator Eggleston said it was a flawed policy. I do not know what the message is, but you're not on it. Between Senator Scullion's and Senator Eggleston's commentary, there is a big gap, and Senator Eggleston should read those briefing notes again. The government is probably highly embarrassed at the commentary and the response to yesterday's very flawed environment and energy statement. To paraphrase the Australian Conservation Foundation—
—That's the one Garrett was a member of, isn't it?
—Absolutely, and I am very proud to be a member of it as well—its singularly most spectacular feature is to handsomely reward the polluters and offers nothing in investment incentives to the renewable energy market. The Prime Minister is on the record saying that he is not racing to the polls before he rolls out a range of major policy initiatives. He knows that he has to reinvigorate his tired government to match Labor's new leadership and the appeal of our innovative policy positions across a whole raft of areas, notably in the environment. Labor have already announced that we will introduce a mandatory renewable energy target of at least five per cent, we have said that we are committed to signing the Kyoto protocol and we have further detailed policy to be announced in the lead-up to the election.
The bottom line is that this government just does not get it. It does not get the need for investment in the renewable energy industry—in wind, in solar or in hydrogen. Other countries—advanced European economies like those of the Netherlands, Iceland and the Scandinavian nations—are reaping the rewards of the renewable energy investments they have made over the years. These countries are exporting their technology, whether it be wind generation or hydrogen power, all over the world. We had the beginning of that clever industry in Tasmania, as Senator Mackay said, with the opportunity for the construction and development of wind generation in Tasmania, but that was trashed yesterday—gone. But here, when it comes to increasing the renewable aspects in our energy mix, the Howard government is living in the fifties. It is unsurprising that the papers have caned Minister Kemp and the Prime Minister and his energy statement. The headlines read like an eulogy for him: `Quick fix policy fuels MPs' anger' is from the Courier-Mail; `Farmers happy but Greenies fuming' from the Canberra Times; `Energy giant kills NW plan' from the Hobart Mercury; `Greens hit PM' from the Northern Territory News—maybe Senator Scullion did not actually read the paper this morning; `Coal remains king in solar age' from the Sydney Morning Herald; and `Tax break makes fossil fuels the energy of the future' from the Age. As I said, those headlines do sound like a eulogy for the minister for the environment but, sadly, also sound like a potential eulogy for the environment. 
It is far too depressing to continue reading the headlines because where I come from there is a real sense of community ownership of our environmental treasures which also deliver great economic benefits for the whole region. We have to remember that an increase of one degree in the water temperature in the Great Barrier Reef will mean the end of what we know the Great Barrier Reef to be. Not only would there be the loss of environmental values that would occur from such an event but also let us remember the economy—the $5 billion tourism industry—that depends on that icon and the jobs that flow from it. This is a government that has lost its vision on the environment and environmental thinking. This is a government that needs to change. Labor are willing to deliver proper environmental and energy policy, and we stand prepared to do it.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-06-16,"—I too rise on the motion to take note of the answers on the most important matter of the energy statement given by the government this week about the longterm better greenhouse outcome, as Senator Hill describes it. He says this is what is needed and that the government has produced a balance. We supposedly have a balance between a cost-effective fuel source—that is, coal—and longer term energy proposals. The government's white paper is very long on coal and other fossil fuels and, I would have to say, very short on anything you could describe as renewables. In fact, it is a massive hand-out to the fossil fuel industry and has left renewable energy entirely out in the cold. The $1.5 billion over seven years will be an enormous setback to much of the efforts of industry—and not much effort on the part of the government, I might say—over the last few years to shift to alternative fuels, in particular in the transport sector. 
I cannot help wondering what effect this package will have on the great pronouncement that we had last week that money would be going for the first time in great quantities into rail and that the aim would be to shift some of the freight off road and onto rail. The original proposal to reduce excise largely involved a compromise because of the great threat that this would have represented to rail. It would have shifted the very small percentage of freight that is currently on rail back onto road, and this package will be no different as far as I can see. 
Supposedly we are having a road user charge to take the place of excise, but there has been no mention in this package of what that would look like. Is it going to be an equivalent charge or is it going to be some minor charge that will be based on the size of vehicles or on the distance travelled? Who knows? What we do know, though, is that there is every encouragement in this package to increase the use of road for freight. Already we know that the freight task will double by 2020. If our roads are going to be clogged up because rail is not being used in the way that I think most of us in this place would like to see it used, then this is a major failure in policy terms. 
Effectively, it is a hand-out to mining, to the trucking industry and to the agricultural sector and it sends a strong message to stay with fossil fuels. The white paper asks major CO emitters to do an audit every five years and then to join the greenhouse challenge if they do not manage to improve their emissions. Again, that is a totally useless and ineffective measure. In five years time, we will be almost at the end of our first commitment period when in this country we are likely to see a massive blow-out of greenhouse emissions. The only reason that we are even within striking distance of reaching that target is, as we all know, the deal done on land clearing. 
The $500 million for new technologies will be taken up with very expensive and as yet unproven efforts to lock carbon emissions through geosequestration. Again, this leaves renewable energy in the lurch. That money would have been much better spent on ways to improve access to solar and wind technology. Instead of that, we are pouring huge amounts of money into technology which is unproven and, anyway, is only mopping up a problem that we should stop at the source. It is an absolutely ridiculous idea that so much money should be spent on such a purpose. Of course, we have no breakdown. The government say: `This can be used for renewable energy but we have got no criteria. We do not know how this is going to be spent.' There has been no suggestion that half of it would go to renewable energy and the other half to geosequestration. So, conceivably, the lot could be poured into a technology which is at best useless. 
The great disappointment is that we remain with almost the status quo for MRET. In fact, it is not two per cent. Anyone who thinks it is is wrong. It is more like 0.5 per cent of energy consumption by 2010. I think the least the government could have done to honour its promise to all Australians and to the renewable energy industry would be for two per cent of the energy expended—but it is not.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-06-16,"—I do not have a ministerial statement but I want to add to—
—It is not a ministerial statement? That is what it is on the red.
—I want to add to answers I gave to questions in the Senate on 11 May in relation to prisoner abuse in Iraq.
—You will need leave to make that statement.
—I seek leave.
—There being no objection, leave is granted.
—In providing additional information, I intend also to table three detailed tables compiled on the basis of information available to Defence on these issues. They provide:
	A list by rank of all ADF personnel embedded in coalition forces in the Middle East area of operations, the positions they held and the dates of their deployment; 
	A list of visits to detention facilities by ADF personnel and the reasons for those visits; and
	A chronological summary of situation reports compiled by ADF legal officers embedded in the Coalition Provisional Authority Office of General Counsel where reference was made to detention concerns. 
I would note that much of this information has already been placed on the public record at the recent estimates hearings. In addition, I can advise the Senate that Defence will today provide the answers to more than 60 questions that were taken on notice at those hearings.
Having put this level of detail on the public record, I still note there are some who are determined to implicate Australia in the abuses that took place in the Abu Ghraib prison regardless of the facts. There has been a deliberate attempt to raise the spectre of some kind of `guilt by association' in relation to these abuses. That can be evidenced by the deliberately loose language of the shadow spokesman who referred on radio to `the involvement of Australian legal officers in the abuse scandal'. 
On 11 May I gave the Senate as best I could an assurance that no Australians were involved in the abuses we have seen portrayed in these horrific photos. I said: 
What I am concerned about is that there is an implication within the Labor Party questions that, in some way, the ADF are at fault in this matter. The ADF did not manage the prisons, the ADF did not interrogate the prisoners.
Defence has thoroughly reviewed the information available to it and has confirmed the key facts in this issue. 
	Australia did not interrogate prisoners. 
	Australia was not involved in guarding prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison or any other Iraqi prison. 
	Australia was in no way involved in perpetrating the acts of abuse against Iraqi prisoners we have seen in photos published in the media. 
I can confirm that Australian forces assisted in the capture of around 120 Iraqis during the combat phase of the war but in each case the United States was the detaining authority.  
To put that 120 in context, the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimates that prior to the war the Iraqi armed forces numbered 389,000. The captures were effected in March and early April, some four months before Abu Ghraib prison was reopened by the United States. I also note that the Red Cross February report in its reference to its October visits to Abu Ghraib notes that the detainees had been captured mainly in early October.
I have been asked previously when did the government become aware of the issue of alleged abuses of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and I have said that from the time of the January media release by the United States military and the subsequent CNN report, the government would have been aware of allegations of abuse and that these allegations were being investigated—that is of course when the world at large learned of it. I have also stated that it was only with the release of the horrific photos in late April this year that I became aware that abuses had occurred and the extent of those abuses. I told the Senate on 11 May:
The abuses I saw in the media about a fortnight ago, I saw for the first time.
I stand by that statement. I have stated that Defence became aware of the existence of the February report of the Red Cross relating to detention practices in Iraq in February through ADF legal officers working for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad. 
It has subsequently emerged that, some time after 12 November, an ADF legal officer, Major O'Kane, working with coalition force headquarters in Baghdad had access to working papers from Red Cross inspections of two prisons in October. The officer had not been present during the inspections. Defence has confirmed that there is no record of those working papers being passed up through the chain of command back to Australia.
It is important to note that the Red Cross did not deliver either its February report or the earlier October working papers to Australia. The Red Cross handed its report to those who were responsible for the running of the prisons—the United States and the United Kingdom. The working papers were provided to the coalition force headquarters. I note that, despite all of the recent inferences of Australian involvement and claims of a cover up by Australian officials, the Red Cross still declines to make those reports officially available to Australia. In their view, it was a matter for the detaining authorities—the US and the UK—and remains so.
In contrast to the atmosphere of suspicion generated by the opposition's questions, the facts of this issue reveal that Australia has made a positive contribution to improved detention and judicial practices in Iraq. An Australian officer posted to the Office of General Counsel in the Coalition Provisional Authority in April of last year played an important role in streamlining detention practices and improving detention conditions. This included helping to facilitate the work of the Red Cross. This officer, who visited Abu Ghraib on a number of occasions, expressed concerns about overcrowding in prisons and his efforts helped the coalition to implement better processes.
I would note that Australian legal officers in both the CPA headquarters and the coalition forces headquarters worked cooperatively with the Red Cross to facilitate visits to prisons and access to coalition officials. As noted previously, the work of the Red Cross saw it visit the Abu Ghraib prison twice and the special detention facility at Baghdad International Airport once during October of last year. As a result of these visits, two working papers were delivered to the coalition forces headquarters where Major O'Kane was tasked to assist in responding. Officials in Australia were not informed of those working papers at the time. Until recently, Defence believed it did not have access to those working papers. I have expressed that belief publicly, as has the Prime Minister. 
It subsequently emerged that while Defence was not officially provided with those papers, Major O'Kane had brought copies of them back in February of this year among other papers from his time in Iraq. Those papers were provided to the International Policy Division in Defence on May 11 but were not recognised as what was subsequently referred to as the `October report'. I regret that incorrect information was provided to me and, through me, to the Prime Minister.
Defence officials had previously understood the working papers as dealing generally with concerns about detainee conditions and treatment. This advice was passed to the Prime Minister, who used it in good faith in response to a question in the parliament on 27 May. When the documents were discovered and examined it was clear that they included allegations we would characterise more seriously in that they referred to allegations of ill-treatment.
I would note, however, that the October working paper on the inspections of the Abu Ghraib prison does not contain evidence or allegations of the type of serious abuses which have subsequently come to light from the publication of the photos. There was no reference to naked prisoners being dragged along the ground by a dog leash as we have seen in the photos. There was no reference to the hooding of prisoners as we have seen in the photos. There was no reference to prisoners undergoing mock electrocutions, again as we have seen in the photos. There was no reference to naked prisoners being forced to lie on top of each other. There was no reference to the pyramid of naked prisoners. There was no reference to the use of guard dogs to terrify prisoners. There was no reference to prisoners being sexually assaulted by guards. There was no reference to prisoners being made to pose in simulations of sexual acts. Surprisingly, there is no mention at all of detainees being photographed.
It is a matter of record that these abuses all happened. We have seen the photos that prove it. But to suggest that Australia had knowledge of the extent of the abuses at Abu Ghraib through the October working papers is a nonsense. The October Red Cross working paper on Abu Ghraib asked the coalition authorities to clarify and improve the conditions of detention and treatment of detainees under interrogation. Major O'Kane was tasked to ensure this report was taken seriously and given a proper response.
Major O'Kane visited Abu Ghraib prison on 4 December of last year, as detailed at the recent estimates hearings, to discuss the findings of the Red Cross October working paper. Defence advised me on 26 May:
The response was taken seriously by the SJA Office and included Major O'Kane visiting Abu Ghraib and obtaining comments from the responsible officers (MP and Military Intelligence Lieutenant Colonels) about the concerns raised in the 2003 ICRC inspection. The responsible officers denied the specific allegations and were adamant that there was no abuse or mistreatment of internees.
Subsequent to the estimates hearings, Major O'Kane has again been interviewed about this visit and has confirmed that the Red Cross report was being taken seriously by coalition authorities. He has also confirmed that he raised the contents of the report `paragraph by paragraph' with the appropriate military officials and that the allegations were denied. 
As part of his ongoing involvement with the Red Cross, Major O'Kane facilitated the next ICRC visit to Abu Ghraib in January this year. All the evidence indicates that Major O'Kane continued to work in a constructive manner with the Red Cross on detention issues and in no small way ensured that difficulties encountered by the Red Cross in its October visits were not repeated.
As I have previously mentioned, other embedded ADF legal officers had contact with the Red Cross February report. They also helped facilitate meetings between the Red Cross and the CPA. While they reported the existence of the February report to officials in Australia I would note again that the report itself was not delivered to Australia as we were not responsible for detention issues.
As stated at the estimates hearings, the existence of the report was not passed to ministers at the time as it was considered that detention matters were not an issue for which Australia had responsibility and it was also clear that these issues were being dealt with seriously by the relevant detaining authorities.
Defence has faithfully tried to establish and report the facts as it sees them but I would note that it is not as simple as pressing a button or logging on to a database. More than 3,000 Australians have served in different roles under the banner of Operation Falconer and Operation Catalyst. When they return to Australia they are not all based in one location, nor do they necessarily return to the same job.
In providing full and detailed advice on this issue Defence has faced difficulties but has always provided advice in good faith and based on the best knowledge to hand. Subsequent to the estimates hearings Defence completed a review of all the information available to it. The level of detail in the tables I referred to is evidence of the effort that has been applied. The information is the most complete picture Defence can provide on its knowledge to date of this issue.
In closing I would like to quote from the advice provided to me by the head of the Defence Legal Service on 28 May which stated:
Australian Defence Force personnel, whether dealing with prisoners or detainees, acted at all times consistently with their international obligations, including under the Geneva Convention.
The men and women of the Australian Defence Force have done an outstanding job in Iraq, serving with honour and distinction. They have our government's full support. They certainly deserve better than the smear tactics and claims of cover-ups from the opposition. I table the three tables that I referred to in my comments.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-06-16,"—by leave—This much heralded statement, this comprehensive explanation, promised two weeks ago by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, turns out to be an absolute disgrace. It is a damp squib. It is not an explanation; it is a complete whitewash. Senator Hill insists on responding to allegations that have not been made. The opposition has not and does not accuse Australian troops of having been involved in the abuse of prisoners. This is a straw man put up by the government. After all, it is so much easier for Mr Howard and his colleagues to defend Australian troops against imagined slurs than to address the real and uncomfortable issues that this whole matter has raised.
This so-called statement from Senator Hill is just the last in a litany of failures for which Senator Hill himself should take ultimate responsibility. It reveals a supine government, it reveals a dysfunctional department and it reveals a minister asleep at the wheel. Senator Hill blames the opposition for indulging in smear tactics and claims of cover-up. He blames Defence for providing inaccurate information to the government. He blames everybody but himself. This is a minister more concerned about self-preservation than decent standards. This statement is full of excuses. There is nothing about consequences. The logical consequence of a fiasco such as this—and this is the big gap in Senator Hill's statement, the issue he does not address—is Senator Hill's own resignation. 
This is the minister who, 20 months ago in the wake of the `children overboard' scandal, promised to fix the very problems which have caused this mess, and he has failed in that task abysmally. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and senior defence officials, seriously misled the Australian parliament and people about what the government knew and when they knew it in relation to the abuse of coalition detainees in Iraq. The only excuse that Senator Hill can offer is: it was the best we knew at the time. We hear today that Senator Hill has apologised to the Prime Minister. What about apologising to the parliament and what about apologising to the Australian people? Remember that on 27 May in the House of Representatives Mr Howard said it was not until February of this year that a report by the Red Cross raised allegations of ill-treatment of detainees. An earlier report in October 2003 had covered only general concerns about detainee conditions and treatment. He went on to say:
To suggest that, because Major O'Kane drafted a response to the October report, he or the Australian government were in some way aware of the more serious allegations ... is quite nonsensical.
How absurd that statement looks now! In the Senate we had Senator Hill telling us on 11 May that Defence and the government `became aware of the international Red Cross report in February'. When asked when he personally became aware of the prisoner abuse he said:
I am not going to split myself from the government ... I accept the responsibilities that flow from that.
I want to come back to the issue of Senator Hill's responsibilities because I do think they are important. We had persistent questioning by the media and the opposition following the publication of the abuse photos at the end of April and that led Defence of course to conduct an inquiry, its first inquiry into the state of knowledge of the abuses.
The results of that inquiry, which included a survey of 298 members of the defence forces, were announced by the Chief of the Defence Force, General Cosgrove, and the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Mr Ric Smith, on 28 May. We were informed that none of those surveyed were `aware of abuse or serious mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners or detainees of the nature of recent allegations during their deployment' and there were `no reports about the abuse or serious mistreatment of prisoners or detainees of the nature of recent allegations made either through the chain of command or informally'. Their words! General Cosgrove and Mr Smith informed us that Major O'Kane had said that the October 2003 Red Cross report `raised general concerns about detainee conditions and treatment but no mention of abuse'.
What about the top brass? They stated:
Neither the current Australian Joint Force Commander in the Middle East nor any of his predecessors was aware of these allegations of abuse or serious mistreatment until the publication of photographs in April 2004, and neither was Defence leadership in Canberra.
So, according to the government, the situation as at 28 May was that the ADF first knew of the abuses in February when Major O'Kane saw the second Red Cross report, and the Defence leadership and ministers first knew of them when the photos were published at the end of April. Remember, 28 May was seven months after the Red Cross first raised prisoner abuses with the Coalition Provisional Authority including the embedded Australians. It was more than four months after the US issued a press release about the abuse allegations. It was three months after the Red Cross submitted a detailed report to the US and one month after the abuse photos were published. 
Remember also that the 28 May statement came after the prisoner abuse issue had been running as the No. 1 media issue nationally and internationally for a full four weeks and following exhaustive inquiries of all relevant defence personnel. Precisely how the government got this so wrong and maintained such ignorance in these circumstances has still not been explained at all. It certainly has not been explained by that pathetic statement that Senator Hill just made in the Senate this afternoon. Anyone who dared question this unbelievable version of reality was subjected, and has been subjected again today by Senator Hill in his statement, to streams of abuse for questioning the integrity of our troops. That is something that this opposition has never done. We have never done it no matter how hard the government tries to pretend otherwise. 
Since the 28 May statement the government has been in full retreat on this matter. How is this for classic backsliding? Mr Howard on 30 May said:
I am told by Defence that Major O'Kane has told Defence that the October report did not contain references to the abuse ... I'm just telling you what I have been told. 
What I want to know is what else the Prime Minister had been told at that time to warrant that incredibly guarded, slimy language. Then on Tuesday afternoon, 1 June, after 1½ days of questioning at the Senate estimates committee, Defence secretary Ric Smith admitted that there were `inaccuracies' in the 28 May statement. He said there were:
... inconsistencies between that statement and evidence that you have heard over the last two days.
He explained that the 28 May statement `reflected the best knowledge we had at that time'. But since that time Mr Smith has said that the existence of the two Red Cross working papers dated October and November 2003 had come to light and, further, that Major O'Kane's understanding that the October report had only raised general concerns, as opposed to serious allegations, was incorrect. He and General Cosgrove took full responsibility for the stuff-ups, to the enormous relief of Senator Hill, who was sitting ashen faced beside them—and, of course, they regretted any embarrassment that may have been caused to the government.
—And to the Prime Minister.
—Mr Howard was very happy to let his two top Defence officials accept the blame. On 1 June, leaving for the United States of America, he dumped all over them. He said:
I regret very much that I was given the wrong advice.
He went on to say:
I am very unhappy that I was misinformed by the defence department.
Remarkably, while Mr Howard claimed to have been misled by the defence department, he denied that he had misled the parliament and he denied that he had misled the Australian people. He said:
I did not mislead the public or the Australian parliament. The advice that I gave the parliament and the public was based on the advice I'd received from the defence department. 
This is a desperate Prime Minister trying to rewrite the doctrine of ministerial responsibility to avoid any of the mess sticking to him or any of the mess sticking to any of his ministerial colleagues—like Senator Hill. Note well: there was not a mention at all of the minister presiding over this shambles, Senator Hill. After the indignant denials and the subsequent retreat, what we have heard today in the statement from Senator Hill is another grudging apology. He said:
I regret that incorrect information was provided to me and, through me, to the Prime Minister.
As if that is satisfactory, as if that is enough in these circumstances. I think it is important to explain at this stage just what the government stands accused of—failure to take seriously the reports of abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US personnel, failure to acknowledge Australia's legal and moral obligations to Iraqi prisoners in general and those captured by Australian forces in particular, failure to take its accountability responsibilities seriously and failure to correct the serious procedural faults in Defence which were revealed during the `children overboard' inquiry. This is a serious litany of failure on the part of this government by any standard. Even by the standards of the Howard government, this is a serious litany of failure.
Take the first of those: right from the start the government has demonstrated by its inaction that it does not take the issue of prisoner abuse in Iraq seriously. It is impossible to come to any other conclusion. What did the government do in response to the United States press release about prisoner abuse accusations in mid-January and the CNN reports a few days later? Nothing. Did it think to make inquiries of its coalition partner about the seriousness and extent of these allegations? No, it did not. It did nothing. Did it bother to check whether the allegations involved violation of the Geneva conventions? No, it did not. Has it even now bothered to check on the welfare of the 120 Iraqis that Australian forces assisted in capturing? No, it has not. Of course it does not care. According to Senator Hill, they were just a drop in the ocean.
When the photos of prisoner abuse were first published on 29 April, provoking shock and outrage around the world, you might have imagined that the Howard government, as a loyal and close ally of the United States, a strong and unquestioning supporter of its actions in Iraq and an influential member of the coalition of the willing, would immediately express its concern to the United States. But, no, the abuses were not regarded as serious enough to even warrant a diplomatic murmur of disapproval—nothing at all from the Howard government.
You might have also thought that in the face of such universal outrage and disgust the Prime Minister, Minister Hill or Minister Downer might have been prompted to think: `We're part of what's happening in Iraq. We've got Australian military personnel embedded in the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad. What did they know about this? When did they know about it? What did they do about it?' But, no, it was left to others. It was left to the media. It was left to the opposition to ask questions. Even a month later on 28 May the government was not able to accurately answer those questions. It was either not asking any questions, it was not asking the right questions or it was refusing to listen to the answers but, whatever, the government stands condemned for a massive dereliction of duty.
The government has also failed to take its legal and moral responsibilities to Iraqi detainees seriously. It has both legal and moral responsibilities as an occupying power and as a member of the coalition. These responsibilities include respect for the Geneva convention, not only in relation to Iraqis captured by Australian forces but also to Iraqi detainees more generally. In fact, Mr Downer directly acknowledged these responsibilities in an answer to a question on notice last September when he said that the government had established a legal watch group `to advise on legal matters of relevance to Australia's participation in the Coalition Provisional Authority and consult with its counterparts to ensure that Australia's legal obligations are taken into account'.  
Since then the government has been attempting to sidestep the responsibilities flowing from Australia's participation in the invasion and occupation of Iraq. It argues that Australia is not an occupying power on the basis that the United Nations in Security Council resolution 1483 has specifically recognised only the US and the UK as occupying powers. But we know, according to Professor Triggs of Melbourne University:
Australia has a legal responsibility to all detained persons, whether prisoners of war or civilians, as a joint Occupying Power in Iraq and as a member of the Coalition.
She goes on to say:
Australia's continuing obligations as a joint Occupying Power are not altered by Security Council Resolution 1483 in the absence of express termination of its status in relation to future acts.
The government also contrived a legal artifice to ensure that Australian troops never officially detained any Iraqi POWs and therefore never triggered the immediate or longer term responsibilities of a detaining power under the Geneva convention. The arrangement—
—They cannot tell us what it is.
—That is right.
—The minister does not know.
—He does not, but the arrangement was that US troops who accompanied the Australian troops would always act as a detaining power even when the POWs were detained by an Australian warship crewed by Australians with only a single US Coastguard sailor on board. When we pressed Senator Hill for the legal basis of this arrangement all he could point to was a letter dated 11 March 2002 from the then Commander of the US Central Command to the then Chief of the Defence Force referring to an agreement that was negotiated for the conflict in Afghanistan.
—It could have been worse; it could have been El Alamein.
—Knowing this mob, they would probably fall back on that. The minister was unable to say—he did not know. No-one in Defence could tell him or the Senate or anybody else how that two-year-old agreement came to be relevant to the conflict in Iraq. The minister did not have a clue and today in this so-called explanatory statement that he has made to the Senate he does not even address that issue. All the promises made at the estimates committee to come back and address this important issue in a statement to be made this week in the Senate have not been honoured by the minister. It is incredible after the total incapacity of the minister and Defence officials at the estimates hearings to explain the legal underpinning for the arrangements relating to the 120 Iraqis captured by Australian forces that no explanation on this important issue has been offered by the minister in his statement today. He promised to do it two weeks ago; he still has not done it. You have to ask yourself, again, why? What is the reason?
As for the government's accountability responsibilities, it has shirked those responsibilities absolutely. In fact, it has rendered the concept of ministerial responsibility virtually meaningless. As I have said, on 1 June General Cosgrove and Mr Smith dutifully took full responsibility for having provided incorrect advice to the government and the public. But taking full responsibility apparently meant nothing more than mouthing the words because neither General Cosgrove nor Mr Smith—nor the minister today—has offered any explanation at all as to why, knowing their evidence was incorrect, they waited until Tuesday afternoon 1 June before correcting the record. We know that the errors in their evidence came to light over the weekend of 29 and 30 May. Why did they wait until Tuesday afternoon to set the record straight? Why did Mr Smith tell the Senate estimates committee on Monday, 31 May: 
... we know that no Defence personnel were aware of the allegations of abuse or serious mistreatment before the public reports in January.
Why did he say that when he must have known it was untrue? Why did he say the October Red Cross reports were only `about things like prison conditions and so on' when he must have known that they were not? Why did Mr Carmody fail to acknowledge, when asked whether the October report described serious abuses, that he knew that to be the case? Were these senior Defence officials hoping we would not pursue these issues and that they may not have to correct the record? Why else would they have sat there in estimates biting their tongues about these important issues for a day and half before putting all the facts on record? We are at least entitled to an explanation from the minister of what on the face of it appears to be—and I am happy to say here that I think it is a fair description—a contempt of the parliament. Yet Senator Hill, illustrating the same culture he presides over in Defence, has simply ignored yet another serious issue. There is no mention of any of this, of course, in the explanation he has made to the Senate today.
The Prime Minister, as I have said, has adopted a trenchant `don't blame me' approach—`It's all Defence's fault'. After all, he is just the Prime Minister, as Senator Hill is just the defence minister. Senator Hill, according to Mr Howard's code of ministerial conduct, is `ultimately accountable for the overall operation of his portfolio'—the minister who bravely asserted when he was asked when the government became aware of the prison abuse:
I accept the responsibilities that flow from that.
How has he discharged his accountability obligations? By doing nothing more than presenting a couple of half-baked excuses to the Senate weeks too late. He has not even bothered to front up and make a proper ministerial statement to the Senate. He has avoided this by simply providing additional information to answers to questions—in fact, to a question I think asked some five weeks ago in the Senate.
—But the Prime Minister said he was supposed to have a statement!
—Yes. Surely the most reasonable person would accept that that is simply not good enough, Senator Hill—nowhere near good enough, even for a minister in the Howard government! If ministerial responsibility means anything anymore, Senator Hill, you should offer your resignation. Of course, ignorance of matters such as these does not absolve ministers from responsibility. I think it compounds Senator Hill's responsibility. We know a bit more about Senator Hill because I was able to read a very interesting article in the Canberra Times written by Jack Waterford, an astute observer. On 6 June he described Senator Hill as:
... a paranoid and suspicious minister ... who distrusts all of his advisers ... a compulsive micromanager ... who wants to know everything. 
I do not know how you work that out. He wants to know everything?
—Talk about stating the bleeding obvious!
—Yes. Senator Hill has had almost three years now at the helm of the Department of Defence. If he has been kept in the dark then he has to accept responsibility for having created, or failed to correct, the circumstances and the environment that have kept him in the dark. That is the nub of it. There are uncanny parallels here between the government's handling of the prison abuse scandal and the `children overboard' affair: the same obstinate refusal on the part of the Prime Minister and other ministers to seek out the truth, the same reluctance on the part of senior officials and advisers to pass on unwelcome or inconvenient advice to their political masters, and the same Nixonian culture of plausible deniability.
Then, in the `children overboard' fiasco, as now, neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister for Defence accepted any responsibility. Then, as now, the government made Defence the scapegoat. Then, as now, the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of the Department of Defence set up a task force. Back then it was to examine `the range of internal and external communication issues flowing from the incident'. I would like to remind the Senate what happened in the aftermath of the `children overboard' scandal. Following the report of that task force, Senator Hill boastfully issued a press release on 22 October 2002 claiming that it was:
... confusion surrounding the SIEV4 incident—
that is, the `children overboard' incident—
that led to inaccurate information being given to the Government.
Not to worry—don't worry at all—he had instructed Defence to:
... move quickly to ... ensure there is no repeat of the communication problems experienced ...
That is what he said. There was to be no repeat. He was going to fix it all. Good old Senator Hill! He had claimed to have already ensured:
... a clearer understanding of the incident reporting requirements through the chain of command in the passing of such information to the Minister's office.
I bet you regret saying that. You also said, boastfully and pompously:
Ministers and decision makers within Defence must be confident that the information they are acting on is delivered in a timely and accurate manner.
And even more bombastic:
I also accept there is a responsibility to ensure there are clear lines of communication between the Minister's office and Defence.
That is right, of course—this is your responsibility, Senator Hill, absolutely your responsibility, and you have failed to deliver on it. If the Prime Minister wants us to believe the government is serious about respect for the Geneva conventions, if he wants the Australian people to have confidence in the leadership of our defence forces and our defence department, if the Prime Minister is to demand the most minimal standards of competence from his ministers and a senior minister like the Minister for Defence, if he is to attach any meaning at all to the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, then the Prime Minister has no alternative but to sack Senator Hill.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-16,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
I would start by noting that the minister did not even have the courage to formalise his additional explanation as a ministerial statement but seemed to want to do it in a half-hearted manner—a half explanation, half tabling. Despite whatever half mechanisms and half approaches the minister wants to take, the bottom line is that the lies and the dishonesty continue. 
The fact is that this government has cut and run from its responsibilities and its obligations as an occupying power and as one of the few nations on this planet that pre-emptively invaded Iraq against international law. As Senator Faulkner quite rightly pointed out, no-one, and certainly not the Democrats, has alleged that the ADF was involved in the prisoner abuse or is at fault for the prisoner abuse. It is not only false and another deception to allege that that is the case; it is grossly insulting. The implication of the minister's statement that the men and women of the ADF have our government's full support is that the ADF do not have the full support of the opposition or the Democrats. That is also dishonest and false.
Indeed, the Senate has been very careful and, I would suggest, very responsible to state repeatedly, overtly and clearly that, despite all our disagreement with this government's actions, policies and deception, we still support our troops. I believe that should be noted, because in an issue as emotional, as crucial and as important as this it would be very easy for those who are concerned about the government's approach to involve our troops in some way. The Democrats and certainly everybody in the Senate have been very careful not to involve our troops in this political debate. It is very important to emphasise that. That is why I am particularly offended by the continual implication and sometimes blatant and misleading statements by this government that they are the only ones that support the ADF or that these are allegations against defence personnel.
Indeed, I would say that, more than anybody else, the people who deserve the truth and deserve a straight explanation from this government are the defence forces themselves. I believe that the Senate owes it to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, more than anybody else, to clear up this matter. It is their reputation that is being besmirched. When this government continually suggests that the Geneva convention is an optional extra that does not necessarily apply, it is actually slurring the men and women of our defence forces, because I have no doubt that they are well and truly aware and committed to enforcing and upholding the Geneva convention.
As part of the small number of countries that, regrettably, were part of the invading force, we have an obligation to ensure that the Geneva convention is upheld not just by our own troops but by everybody involved in the coalition that we are a part of. That is why the government's dodgy legal fictions that they are using to avoid responsibility do not hold any water. The fact is that we are part of that coalition—everybody on the planet knows that—and therefore we are jointly responsible for ensuring that all the coalition forces uphold their responsibilities under the Geneva convention and other areas of international law. Just because we broke international law in being part of that invasion—certainly that is the Democrat view, even if it is not the government's—does not mean that we can ignore international law from then on.
Indeed, that is one of the reasons why the Democrats have differed from some others who opposed the invasion, by saying that our troops should stay in there and that we should not withdraw them straightaway, as has been called for by some in the community and some parties in this place. We have recognised that, even though we opposed the war, once we were involved in it and were part of the invasion, we had a moral and a legal obligation to stay there and ensure a transition occurred to a local governing authority to assist with rebuilding security. That is clearly a moral obligation, I would suggest, but it is certainly a legal obligation under international law. 
The same applies with something as crucial and central as the Geneva convention. It is not an optional extra. It is not something that we can make passing note to, with the government and the minister continuing to suggest that we do not actually have to legally follow that or stating that we do but we are not obliged to. That is not the case. We are obliged to and we are also obliged to ensure that our coalition colleagues stick to it. Even if you want to go outside the international law argument, surely commonsense suggests that, if we are fighting a battle against terror—a battle against oppression and injustice, as the Prime Minister likes to repeatedly puff up his chest and say—the strongest weapon in that battle is to uphold our own standards of justice and the rule of law. If we allow ourselves to ignore fundamental laws like the Geneva convention, we are simply asking for it. We cannot credibly criticise, complain or seek to persuade others to follow that approach if we do not do so ourselves. That is why this is so important.
I stated that we owe it to defence personnel more than anyone else to clear up this matter, and that is why the minister and the government have failed so dramatically again. Even this morning, Mr Howard said at 9 o'clock, according to AAP, that Major O'Kane, who obviously knows more about this issue than any other Australian, will still not be allowed to give evidence to a Senate committee. The Prime Minister said:
... it is not normal in Senate inquiries for somebody in that position to be interviewed.
That is wrong. I am sorry, but it is certainly a practice—
—It's not an inquiry; it's estimates.
—It is also a practice in estimates, where personnel come before the committee to answer specific questions. There have been repeated examples of committees requesting certain people who are likely to know the most about a particular area of inquiry to appear. If the government's argument is that it wants us to set up a specific reference on this matter, then it will complain about us wasting the time of the Senate. The opportunity is there, the precedent is there and the Prime Minister is simply wrong in saying that is not normal practice. Frankly, with the greatest of respect, I very much doubt that the Prime Minister has much idea at all about what happens in Senate inquiries. I suspect he has never attended one. I very much doubt that he knows much about Senate procedure, Senate precedent and Senate practice. In one sense, why should he? I do not know much about the House of Representatives procedures and practice. But he is once again being inaccurate with the Australian people.
The simple question is: why not let this guy speak? What is it that the government are trying to hide? They are simply providing the information they want to let out and nothing else. Again, the minister has the gall to complain about `this atmosphere of suspicion' being generated by the questions that are asked, as though it is a crime to ask questions. Seeking information to reveal the truth is blamed as generating an atmosphere of suspicion. What generates the atmosphere of suspicion is the government's longstanding record of being loose with the truth, of covering up the facts and, most distressingly of all from my point of view, of failing to correct the record. All of us make mistakes; all of us occasionally say things that we later discover are wrong; but the key, simple, fundamental principle when that happens is that you correct the record at the first available opportunity. 
Even with the example that preceded this statement, the record was not corrected at the first available opportunity. The record was not corrected for two days after the mistake was said to have been discovered. It was corrected just before the Prime Minister was about to jet out of the country. It was corrected after a day and a half of questioning at estimates rather than at the start of it. The Prime Minister allowed it to happen just before he was about to jet out of the country and left the Defence Force behind to be the scapegoat. It is clearly another example of not correcting the record at the first available opportunity.
There are many who say that you can tell when things are getting bad with a particular government when it starts to adopt a rule that lying is only a problem if you get caught trying to cover it up. I suggest that this government has gone even further than that and that even that unacceptable tenet has been turned on its head. It is running an administration that consistently tries to cover its tracks with misinformation rather than admit to misleading. It consistently tries to cover its tracks with the sort of dishonest abuse that Minister Hill, and even more so Minister Downer, uses. Anybody who raises a concern is criticised as being unpatriotic, as not supporting our troops or as supporting Saddam Hussein. It happens time and time again. Frankly, I am absolutely sick of seeing Minister Downer every time I turn on the television implying that anyone who does not support the war in Iraq, anybody who is criticising the government's policy, does not support our troops and is somehow supportive of Saddam Hussein. That is the sort of shallow but very offensive level of debate that this government has sunk to because it is trying to divert attention from its own clear failings, its litany of dishonesty and the misleading statements that it has made.
This is another example. After weeks of denying any knowledge about the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners prior to January, we have now seen some statements where the government have been forced to admit that was wrong. But they have tried to point the finger of blame everywhere else. As I said, the mistake was not corrected at the first available opportunity. It is part of that record of, instead of admitting to the deceit, continuing along a path of further evasion, further red herrings and, in this case, seeking to blame failings within the Australian military and the Department of Defence.
The Prime Minister has tried to protect himself from criticism by denying any fault along the lines, as many people have pointed out, of the tried and true path of the `children overboard' affair of simply saying, `I wasn't told.' But we all know that the message is out loud and clear now throughout the Public Service and the defence and intelligence communities: do not pass on something that you know people do not want to hear. The clear example behind the whole Commissioner Keelty episode was not specifically to pull him into line but to send the message loud and clear to every other public servant not to step out of line in any way, shape or form.
There were the false weapons of mass destruction allegations against Iraq and the deception that was given to the Australian parliament and the Australian people was that Saddam Hussein was attempting to purchase uranium. The Howard government's attempt to deflect all responsibility for its deceptions onto the defence department and the military is a deliberate attempt to cover up. At the same time we have the government claiming that it only first learnt of Public Service intelligence and we have military officials as scapegoats. 
For the past few weeks the government has claimed to have provided information to parliament and the public based on briefings it received from the Department of Defence. What would have happened if we did not have the Senate estimates committees? It is a clear example once again of the immense value of the Senate committee process. If we did not have the Senate empowered to reveal the truth, then these facts would not have come out and the deceit would have continued. It has only been through the presence, the activity and the independence of the Senate that the truth has been able to come out, but there is clearly more that needs to be revealed.
In March 2003 a joint agreement signed by Australian, British and American military leaders conferred obligations on Australia under international law to ensure the welfare of Iraqi prisoners and detainees. This agreement stated that all captured Iraqis must be treated in accordance with the Geneva convention. Australia was also obliged to appoint liaison officers to monitor the treatment of prisoners that Australian troops had handed over to the US forces. In a further litany of evasion, the Prime Minister has denied any responsibility for ensuring the proper treatment of these prisoners by stating that he believed the government had discharged all of its moral responsibilities. The government has confirmed it was not interested in finding out the full story about evidence of abuse of Iraqi prisoners of war.
At the Senate estimates hearings the week before last, Minister Hill was asked about whether they had followed up reports of female Iraqi prisoners being raped and tortured and was told that a US secret inquiry had confirmed the abuse. These were public allegations that were made repeatedly in a number of media outlets. Did the minister make any effort when those allegations became public to find out whether they were true, to determine the accuracy of them? Not at all; he did not. We had another red herring continually put up by the minister at estimates that by asking these questions we were trying to subvert the US justice process. Again, nobody is trying to get the Australian government to run a parallel trial. What we are trying to do is ensure that the Australian government finds out what has happened because we have a responsibility to ensure that people are treated properly, to find out if they are not and to ensure that, if that does happen, justice is done—that that is identified, the guilty are punished and it does not happen again. Unless you find out what has happened, you cannot know whether or not that has been done properly.
It is a pretty straightforward issue and a pretty straightforward fact, but it seems to be something that, even now, the government does not seem to be able to comprehend—this simple fact that if you do not try to find out what is going on you have no way of credibly being able to state that all is above board. That is why this government is able to go around repeatedly and confidently asserting that everything is being done appropriately and according to proper procedure and according to law. Because they do not try to find out and make sure that that is the case, they are not going to know if it is wrong. That is simply not good enough and it is, in effect, dishonest—but it is characteristic of the government's conduct during the entire course of the lead-up to, and then the invasion and occupation of, Iraq. This is not just a debate about semantics. This is an issue that has involved the killing or wounding of tens of thousands of Iraqis and the destruction of their homes, property, schools and infrastructure, which is not mere collateral damage. Of course, all we get again are inferences from government backbenchers that, somehow or other, by pointing this out we are supporting Saddam Hussein. 
—Well, you are.
—There we have it again: another one saying that we are supporting Saddam Hussein. That is the level of debate. By pointing out the human cost of this, by pointing out the dishonesty of the government's approach, somehow or other you are an apologist for Saddam Hussein. That is as good as the government can come up with.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. There are serial interjections coming from the government and some of them are very low quality indeed. I ask that that stop so that the rest of the chamber can hear the speech being made.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—That is not a point of order. I will determine whether the level of interjection is contrary to what we normally accept.
—It is a point of order.
—I will determine whether the level is contrary to what we have accepted in the past, and it has not reach that stage yet, Senator Brown.
—It is because of the concern and total condemnation that the Democrats and, I am sure, all in the chamber have for the human rights abuses conducted by Saddam Hussein that any form of abuse, however less severe, should also be identified and condemned. You do not want to run the risk in fighting an evil to in any way concede ground to that evil. The fact is that we went to war based on a false premise given by this government that they then changed after the fact. The facts speak for themselves. The record is there clearly in the Hansardof repeated statements in the parliament that then changed and of the shifting of gears from the excuse, beforehand, of weapons of mass destruction to, after the fact, talking about regime change. That is clear to all. The bottom line with this issue is not about whether you are for or against the war; the bottom line is honesty with the Australian people and standing up for the reputation of our defence personnel, who would in no way have truck with this suggestion that we do not stand for upholding international law and ensuring that our coalition colleagues and anybody we engage in joint operations with should also be required to uphold international law. That is something Australia has had a proud record of in the past, and the Democrats will continue to push at every opportunity to have our country return to upholding international law.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2004-06-16,"—I must say that, having heard 20 minutes of Senator Bartlett on his motion, I am not surprised the Democrats are polling one per cent; I am actually amazed it is that high, but that is not really what I am here to talk about. Mr Acting Deputy President, you may remember that, when Senator Faulkner rose to speak in response to Senator Hill's statement, he took great exception to the fact that Senator Hill mentioned at the end of his contribution that the troops have our government's full support and they deserve better than smear tactics and claims of cover-ups by the opposition. Senator Faulkner took extreme umbrage at that statement and said that Senator Hill was setting up a straw man. There is only one person that has set up a straw man today and that is Senator Faulkner himself in his little acting performance. When Senator Faulkner raises his voice and talks to the gallery, you know darn well he is on very thin ground because the louder he speaks the less sure he is of the ground that he is standing on. If he wants to talk about cover-ups, he need only look at his own contribution at Senate estimates when he said `if it was not for this committee you would have covered the whole thing up' and later on when he talked about `a culture of cover-up'. You cannot allege a cover-up without insinuating that there has been some improper or inappropriate or illegal activity that has been covered up—and I strongly deny that there has been any cover-up at all by either our armed forces or this government. There has been no cover-up at all. He then went on to quote Jack Waterford from the Canberra Times. If you are going to quote from newspapers, I suggest that you use an editorial from one that I think is a little bit more reputable. This is what the Australian said in their editorial on 9 June, last Wednesday, about the complicity of prisoner abuse in Abu Ghraib prison: 
But there still has not been a shred of evidence to suggest Australians were involved in the abuses or in an attempt to cover those up. In the absence of such evidence, innuendo—
the innuendo raised at the estimates committee—
has been liberally applied to create the impression, first, that Australian soldiers witnessed the abuse and, second, that the abuse was morally equivalent to the atrocities of Saddam Hussein.
That is what I call a balanced observation by an editorial as to what has taken place over the past two weeks. Innuendo `has been liberally applied' to create impressions which in fact do smear our defence forces. That has taken place at the estimates committee, in prior questioning and in taking note of answers in this place over a period of time. I will go further down that editorial to where it says:
If there is something wrong with Australian officers not making a bigger song and dance about general reports of abuse at Abu Ghraib in the closing months of 2003, there is nothing less wrong with the media ignoring the story between January and April.
If the story was around, why did the media ignore it for all those months? It continues:
Like the Australian officers, journalists across the world had no idea of the scale of the abuses until the report by US General Antonio Taguba, and the photos accompanying it, leaked at the end of April.
	...	...	...
Australia bears no responsibility for the crimes at Abu Ghraib, and those crimes bear no comparison with Saddam Hussein's 25-year campaign of torture and mass murder.
Some of our colleagues opposite would do well to remember those things when they start trying to make much more out of this than has been the case. This government is serious about the Geneva convention, and always has been. The US government and the US Army are serious about the Geneva convention because of the rules of engagement, which Senator Brown wanted to show all around estimates when we had them some two weeks ago. But there were two particular overriding rules of engagement that he refused to mention. One of those said that at all times the Geneva convention must be put in place and the rules of the Geneva convention must be observed. The second was that at no time should prisoners be handled by any member of the armed forces. I can tell you that they are the overriding rules of engagement, not the things that Senator Brown picked out and to which Senator Hill alluded today when he said there was no reference to prisoners being dragged, there was no reference to the hooding of prisoners and there was no reference to all of those things which were highlighted in estimates as to the treatment of prisoners.
The people involved in abusing those prisoners were committing a crime, and for that crime they are being put to trial and some have already been punished for committing a crime. We do not support what happened in that jail in any way or shape or form. In no way do we condone any of the activities that took place that were outside of the Geneva convention. To try to suggest through innuendo that somehow Senator Hill or the defence forces were in any way responsible for the abuses that took place is what I would say is Senator Faulkner setting up his straw man. 
We all know that the Labor Party did not want any of our troops in Iraq. Who will ever forget the send-off that those troops got from the then Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, last year? Who will ever forget his weasel words that day that he sent them off when he said, `We don't think you should be going but we wish you well.' As a matter of fact, he said things even stronger than that, and I think that they were very bleak words which at that stage denigrated the Australian contribution both overtly and covertly. There is no doubt that since that time the Labor Party have been looking to make up some ground, and they saw this prisoner abuse, this illegal activity—the alleged crimes and in some cases proven crimes by some members of the American armed forces—that took place in Abu Ghraib prison as their opportunity to try to reclaim some lost ground. No doubt Senator Brown, in his contribution, will go on and on about it as well. Senator Bartlett went far and wide in trying to draw all of these things together as though the Australians involved were in some way complicit in what happened there, and it just simply is not true because we have said right from the start that we abide by the Geneva convention and do not condone any of the activities that took place there.
There is no doubt that the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister were given inaccurate information, prior to their making statements, both from the Defence Force and from the department. There is no doubt that they were given inaccurate advice, and therefore their statements were made based on what they presumed was sound advice. They had no way whatsoever of knowing that the advice was not correct, so the Prime Minister used that advice when he made his statement. I thought it was a pretty cheap shot of Senator Bartlett's to say that the Prime Minister made his statement and then jumped on a plane to go overseas, when in fact it was something that had been planned months ago. You cannot get a much cheaper shot than that, because he stayed behind to make the statement to make sure that he said something before he actually left. So we have the situation where the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence made the statements based on the best advice that was available to them. When Senator Faulkner was responding to Senator Hill, he used the phrase `coalition detainees'. These prisoners are not coalition detainees. The detaining authority in Iraq is the United States.
—Who says that?
—Senator Evans would have heard at the end of estimates—I believe he was there—a lawyer from the armed forces say that the detaining authority is the occupying force that processes the prisoners. I think, Senator Evans, that you may have been there when he said that. So they are not coalition detainees; they are detained by the United States. I do not know what Senator Faulkner thought we should do with the 120 we got—set up our own prison over there? We would then have to keep forces there a bit longer to make sure that we kept them there, and they would not be able to come home by Christmas—unless, of course, they brought the prisoners back to Australia with them. Senator Faulkner said that we failed to take our accountability seriously because of these 120 troops that the Australian forces detained and then handed over to the United States as the detaining authority. 
I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this government is serious when it announces its intention to make sure that everything we do as a government, everything that our defence forces do, will be done in accordance with the Geneva convention. And if anyone suggests, either by innuendo or by any other means, that any Australian was complicit in any of the activities that took place at Abu Ghraib prison or in relation to any of the abuse of prisoners, then I am afraid they have a long way to go to try to convince the Australian public that this government does not support the Geneva convention.
One of the issues that was raised was the Red Cross reports. It does disturb me that Red Cross reports become public, because the Red Cross do not want them to become public. The fact that those reports are never published means that the Red Cross have the opportunity to get into prisons and into places they would not otherwise be able to get into because of the powers or authorities that exist within some countries. The Red Cross do not want these reports made public and yet we have seen efforts here to have all the reports of the Red Cross brought into the public arena. In some countries in the world where there is conflict, where there are dictatorships and where we know that conditions are not what they should be, it may be more difficult for the Red Cross to get in to inspect those places if their reports were to be made public. The authorities simply would not let them in. They let them in because they know the Red Cross's reports are meant to remain private. So that disturbed me.
The thing that we do know about the initial Red Cross reports is that they were concerned most of all with the conditions in the prisons, with the lack of access by families, and with overcrowding and all those other matters that were brought to the Red Cross. There was no evidence whatsoever about abuse by the forces there.
As a member of this parliament, I am very pleased that in Iraq at present there is an attempt to form a democratic government. Unfortunately, issues like this overshadow all the good work that is being done in that country at present. We never hear about the enormous advances being made in communities, in small villages, and how lives there have changed. It is a pity that we do not have more of the world's media and journalists going out and talking to those people who are so pleased because at last they feel as though they can act in some freedom and their quality of life has improved. Instead of that, the only things that the journalists of this world seem interested in are car bombings and the activities of terrorists, who are not the normal Iraqi people going about their everyday lives. The Australian Iraqi Forum has said:
We in the Australian Iraqi Forum believe that one of the saddest things about the Iraq war and its aftermath is the way it has been and continues to be debated by critics. If we fail in Iraq, we are all going to pay a huge price. The critics of the war would have played a role in derailing Iraq's path to democracy and destroyed any hope of its rebuilding. Obviously the latest revelations of abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib prison and the heinous crimes of dragging corpses in Falluja and the beheading of Nicholas Berg have added fuel to the critics' arguments.
These issues have been trawled through in estimates, we now have a statement on them and we are having estimates again tomorrow, where I guess the same issues will be raised again. It does not help in the rebuilding of Iraq and in Iraq becoming a functioning democracy without the violence that we currently see. All the debate that continues all around the world about matters that are outside Iraqi control does nothing for that country in its march towards freedom, some sort of economic stability and some sort of stability within all areas of the whole country. 
I am rather sad today to hear Senator Faulkner's contribution, because I believe that Senator Faulkner was concerned only in making a political statement to suit those people in the gallery who like to see him perform in this way. He was seeking only to extract the maximum amount of political advantage out of what is a very serious situation, and that is the abuse of prisoners anywhere. We on this side of the parliament deplore the abuse of prisoners. We support and acknowledge that this Australian government and our Australian defence forces will always abide by the Geneva convention. As has been the case with the United States Army, whenever anybody is seen not to abide by the Geneva convention, they have committed a crime against mankind and will be brought to trial—and that is happening.
The people they are dealing with are criminals. They might be part of the armed forces, but in a force of in excess of 200,000 people who have been there over a period of time there are bound to be one or two people whose standards are not the same as everybody else's. As long as those people are found out, as long as they are tried and as long as they are punished for the crimes they commit against humanity, justice has been served. It serves no purpose to drag out in this parliament debate as to why; who knew what, where or when; whether or not the government or the minister knew something before a certain date, which seems to be the biggest problem that Senator Evans and Senator Faulkner have; exactly when they knew; and why, if they knew, they did not tell everybody, when in fact they have said they did not know and have set out explicitly in this statement when information became available to them.
I commend Senator Hill's statement to the parliament. I am quite sure that anybody who looks at this from a balanced point of view will realise that there is no fault on the part of the Australian government for what happened in Iraq—no fault whatsoever—and that we have done everything we possibly can to make sure that we have fulfilled our obligations to the international community, to the Geneva convention and, importantly, to our armed forces. I commend Minister Hill's statement to the parliament today.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-06-16,"—I also rise to speak in this debate taking note of the statement by the Minister for Defence. Actually, it was not a statement; he refused to make a ministerial statement. Apparently he claimed it was a supplementary answer to questions we asked him three or four weeks ago. He undertook to provide with his statement to the parliament answers to the 60-odd questions taken on notice by Defence, but, certainly at the time of my rising to speak, those have not been provided. That is another commitment the minister made that has not been honoured. Those detailed answers which would have fleshed out his report are not available to us.
What is clear is that Senator Hill's statement to the parliament today does not deliver on the commitment the Prime Minister made to the Australian people to explain what went wrong over Australia's knowledge of, and involvement in, abuse of Iraqi prisoners. The Prime Minister went out and had a press conference and apologised for misleading the Australian people. I accept that he was angry. He made it clear that he felt he had been misled and let down and that he was very concerned about those issues. We expected the minister to come into the parliament yesterday and make a full explanation of what had gone wrong, why the Australian people had been misled month after month and why our knowledge of these matters and our peripheral involvement in them had not been made clear at the time—why what the Prime Minister told the Australian people was misleading and wrong. 
That did not happen. Senator Hill did not do that today. Instead he came in and attempted to whitewash this whole process. He gave us what we already knew. He gave us a report which confirmed the facts which emerged under questioning at the estimates hearings in early June. What he did not do was take any responsibility for having misled the people of Australia and the parliament. He did not provide any explanation for it. He did not answer any of the questions which the Prime Minister assured us he would. The Prime Minister's commitment to the parliament and the people of Australia has not been delivered on by the minister. His statement is a whitewash. It fails to answer any of the key questions. Quite frankly, our view is that Senator Hill has to accept responsibility now and resign his position.
He said in this parliament on 11 May that he would take responsibility. I ask you to flick through the document, read it and point out where Senator Hill takes responsibility. I have not had any success in finding any point where Senator Hill takes responsibility. He does not. He came in, and do you know what he did? He blamed Labor. On the first page he blamed me—this was all my fault because we asked difficult questions and somehow sought to slur the ADF—and on the last page he went back to blaming Labor. Responsibility, in the minister's view, lies with the Labor Party and the media for asking questions. Senator Ferguson's contribution confirmed that. He said that questioning, debate and accountability were issues that we should have nothing to do with in relation to these matters because it was not helpful to the situation in Iraq. That is not the Australian tradition, it is not the role of this parliament and it is certainly not Labor's attitude.
I want to make it very clear that the slurs delivered by the minister—the slurs that Mr Downer has been out there making for the last few weeks and that Minister Hill has supported today—are quite wrong. Labor has never made any accusation against the role of the Australian military. It has never made any accusation that our officers have acted with anything but professionalism and high standards. What it has questioned is our knowledge of, and involvement in, the concerns about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners; why that information was not related to government, as has been claimed; and why our government did not act to address the very serious concerns that we had knowledge of. People were being tortured and abused. We knew about it, and this government did nothing about it. We want to know why, because everything we have seen so far indicates that this government did not care. `It's not our problem. Hear no evil, see no evil,' has been this government's response. We see that again today with the tenor of this report: `It's not our problem. If anyone's to blame, it's the Labor Party and the media.'
The minister said he would take responsibility. Where did he take responsibility? What responsibility has he taken? He has taken none. He was quick to say that it was not General Cosgrove's fault, it was not Secretary Smith's fault and it was not the Prime Minister's fault. Now, it seems, it is not his fault. What is the minister responsible for? What is this government's view of ministerial responsibility if the Australian public can be misled month after month and the Australian parliament can be misled month after month and yet nobody is responsible? That is not acceptable but it seems to be the standard that the Howard government wants to apply. There is no responsibility in this statement. There is no explanation. All we have is the minister crawling into the last refuge of the scoundrel and trying to hide behind the ADF and pretend that somehow their reputations have been impugned. 
Nothing of the sort has happened. We have had a debate about government process, about who knew what and when and about why we did not act to try and end the torture and abuse if we knew about it. That is the key issue. What we know now, and what the government has known for some time, is that Australian legal officers reported back those concerns. They reported back to government the fact that the ICRC had very serious concerns about abuse of Iraqi prisoners, they reported back on their involvement in inspections of Abu Ghraib prison, and they reported back the concerns about the mistreatment of those prisoners—and this government did nothing about it.
Their defence is that it was not brought to their attention. As we go through this it is clear that certainly in the early days that might have been true but it is not a defence that the minister can hold onto later in the period at stake. I will come to that in a minute because I think the minister is directly responsible. He has to accept responsibility and he should resign. Someone has to take responsibility for this fiasco and it seems that the government's attitude is that no-one will. I do not think the Australian public or the Australian parliament should or will accept that. 
This report is a whitewash. It is devoid of new information. It takes no responsibility for what occurred and provides no explanation as to why this sorry state of affairs was allowed to occur. It is very much a minimalist report—a report designed to confirm what we found out at estimates, what we dragged out of the government at estimates. It goes no further. It does not answer most of the key questions, and it is a complete failure in terms of meeting the Prime Minister's commitment to the Australian people to get to the bottom of this matter.
Senator Faulkner did an excellent job in responding to Senator Hill's speech, and I will not try to cover all the issues in the time available to me. I think what this most seriously shows is that Senator Hill has acted with a great deal of political cowardice. He has failed to take responsibility, either at the estimates process or today, for what has occurred. He must take responsibility. What I have seen today—when he slunk in here and tried to get away with not really making a report and not really answering any of the questions—is political cowardice at its worst. We saw it at the estimates process as he sat for a day and a half while officials refused to bring out the full truth. No-one came clean despite the minister and the Prime Minister being briefed earlier in the piece. Certainly the minister knew from the Sunday night that the public defence was in tatters: they knew what had occurred and they had been misleading the Australian public.
 The minister knew but he sat there for a day and a half while officials continued to, in a sense, mislead us by failing to give us the whole story. As we dragged it out bit by bit, as the whole thing crumbled, the minister sat there. He did not take any responsibility; he largely did not participate. He sat there and let the department, the secretary and General Cosgrove be the fall guys. And when it got totally indefensible, when it became clear that the whole case had collapsed around them and that the thing was nothing more than a pretence, Senator Hill organised for the secretary and the general to make a statement. At 12.30 on the second day, after a long first day, he made them go out and take the rap. He sat there while they took the rap because he would have known that half an hour later the Prime Minister was going to go out and dump on the department.  
At 12.30 Secretary Smith asked for permission to make a statement where he accepted responsibility on behalf of himself and General Cosgrove. He was made to accept responsibility for the fact that the government's defence on this issue had collapsed. He gave an abject apology and accepted responsibility. The minister sat there and made no contribution. Again, it was nothing to do with him. That was a gross act of political cowardice—it was nothing to do with him when the department fessed up that what he had been saying for the last few months was completely wrong. Half an hour later, at one o'clock, the Prime Minister went out and dumped all over the minister's department. He dumped all over them, indicated his lack of confidence in them, claimed that they had misled him and expressed his deep disappointment. And again, Senator Hill sat mute: it was nothing to do with him. `Hear no evil, see no evil.' He took no responsibility. Well, that is not good enough. He is a minister of the Crown; he is the Minister for Defence in this country; he has to take responsibility. To try and hide behind General Cosgrove or the Secretary, Mr Smith, is, as I said, an act of complete political cowardice. It does him no credit and he ought to face up to his responsibilities. 
We now know from the record that he should have known—and that he did know from 11 May. What is critical in this whole debate is not the fact that it was such a bumbling, inept performance inside Defence in the early period, that the reports coming back from our legal officers were not acted upon, that the Iraqi task force—which was set up with senior representatives from the PM's department, Foreign Affairs, Defence and Attorney-General's—failed to deal with any of this information. They knew, as in the `children overboard' affair, that you were not supposed to pass on bad news and you were not supposed to deal with Australia's responsibilities seriously if it might embarrass the government's political agenda. It is not those things that most worry me, because those public servants were only responding to the culture and the modus operandi that they know is favoured by the government.
But we know that on 10 May the minister was briefed by Mr Carmody about the existence of the two sit reps from Colonel Muggleton. The minister knew when he came into the parliament on 11 May. The department had prepared him for the first day of parliament. This was in the atmosphere of the photos becoming known and the minister going on the Lateline program and pretending he had not known anything about it until he had seen the photos. In that atmosphere, preparing the minister for question time on the first day back of the parliament, they briefed him. They briefed him on 10 May and told him they had the sit reps from Colonel Muggleton. What do we know of those sit reps? We know that they referred to the ICRC report. They referred to the shock and anger about the ICRC's findings and the serious concern about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. Senator Hill knew on 10 May. That is why, when he came into this parliament and we asked him questions on the matter, he said:
I am not going to split myself from the government. The government became aware of that report—
referring to Red Cross February report—
in February. I accept the responsibilities that flow from that.
He came into the parliament, basically conceded that he had misled the Australian public and accepted that he had to take responsibility—that Defence and the government had known in February. What has he done to accept that responsibility? Between 11 May and 1 June, when we found out about it at estimates by questioning the witnesses, what did he do? Nothing. He maintained the lie. He maintained the misleading of the Australian public. He did not seek to correct the record. He did not seek to change the Prime Minister's public utterances or to change the government's official responses on these issues. 
But he was briefed on 10 May. He knew—and acknowledged in the parliament on 11 May—that they had information inside Defence that made it clear that the ICRC had found serious abuses at Abu Ghraib prison and that our legal officers had reported back to Defence in Canberra that this was a serious issue, which they were involved in and providing advice on, which had rocked the coalition administration inside Iraq. Paul Bremer was quoted as saying how shocked and disturbed he was about the allegations. From that day on, Minister Hill was responsible. He knew. He was briefed. Yet what did he do to correct the public record? What did he do to ensure that the Prime Minister did not continue to mislead the Australian public? He did nothing.
He admits that he was briefed on 10 May. We know his PPQ for 11 May reflected the fact that he had to own up that he had misled the public watching the Lateline program and that he knew of the ICRC report. What we know is that he sat there mute, he sat there quiet, while we questioned witnesses who tried to maintain that in fact they had not known. As we dragged out bits of information, piece by piece, we found out the story that is reflected in his statement today, which the department had access to from at least May 10. The minister may be able to hide behind incompetence and the failure of systems in the department, but he cannot hide behind the fact that for 22 days he failed in his responsibilities: from 11 May to 1 June, when it finally all unravelled and collapsed around them, the minister did nothing to ensure that the record was corrected. He did nothing to ensure that Defence corrected the misrepresentation of the facts—knowing as he did that Defence had been advised of the concerns of the ICRC, had received reports from the legal officers and had had Australian Defence officials reporting on the serious concern about Abu Ghraib.
In my view the minister must take responsibility because he did not take his responsibilities seriously. For 22 days he allowed the Australian public to be misled. He failed the Prime Minister. He failed the Australian public. He failed the parliament. For him to come in today and fail to take any responsibility for that leaves him standing condemned. He has been not only inept but also a political coward. He let his departmental officials carry the can and make a grovelling apology because he did not have the courage to come clean with the Australian public. He did not have the courage to take the information he was briefed about on 10 May, to find the whole story and to correct the record. He has to accept responsibility for that.
The other thing I want to correct in the brief time available to me is the suggestion that is again in today's statement—a reversion to the original government defence—where Senator Hill said:
I would note, however, that the October working paper on the inspections of the Abu Ghraib prison does not contain evidence or allegations of the type of serious abuses which have subsequently come to light from the publication of the photos.
Wrong, wrong, wrong. Lie, lie, lie. It is quite clear that the allegations were of serious abuse. I quote from the ICRC report of February, which the minister accepts the government had information on since February. It refers to their visit to the Abu Ghraib correctional facility in mid-October 2003. It says:
 ... ICRC delegates directly witnessed and documented a variety of methods used to secure the cooperation of the persons deprived of their liberty with their interrogators. In particular they witnessed the practice of keeping persons deprived of their liberty completely naked in totally empty concrete cells and in total darkness, allegedly for several consecutive days. Upon witnessing such cases, the ICRC interrupted its visits and requested an explanation from the authorities. 
So this was not in the dark night when nobody was there; this was when the Red Cross were actually inspecting that they saw these terrible abuses. They go on:
The ICRC documented other forms of ill-treatment, usually combined with those described above, including threats, insults, verbal violence, sleep deprivation caused by the playing of loud music or constant light in cells devoid of windows, tight handcuffing with flexi-cuffs causing lesions and wounds around the wrists. Punishment included being made to walk in the corridors handcuffed and naked, or with women's underwear on the head, or being handcuffed either dressed or naked to the bed bars or the cell door.
This is in a report of the ICRC in October 2003. I do not know fully what is in the report, but the minister knows; he knows because he has got it, but we have not seen it publicly. For him to maintain again that somehow there is a real distinction between the sort of abuse that was occurring in October and the sort of abuse that was occurring in February is directly refuted by the ICRC's February report. Quite frankly, to revert to this low defence of trying to pretend that somehow the complaints in October were not serious does this government no credit at all.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2004-06-16,"—I also rise to speak in this debate taking note of the statement by the Minister for Defence. I follow Senator Evans and his valiant but failed effort to make Senator Hill and the government responsible for the abuses in Abu Ghraib. There are two particular elements in the minister's additional information in relation to the question he was asked on 11 May which I would like to pick up on. Firstly, there is the fact that neither the minister nor the government knew of the isolated and inappropriate treatment of prisoners in Abu Ghraib until after the US authorities had already commenced action against the participants—in fact, after the pictures were published. Secondly, to the extent that some information concerning Abu Ghraib—which is not a particularly pleasant place—was known within Defence, this was not passed to the minister. The minister has explained the process in his statement today.
This possible oversight is now used by those desperate to make Australia somehow responsible for this unacceptable treatment of Iraqi prisoners. This attempt is really humbug and it is politically vexatious. It is also used by those desperate to undermine our mission in Iraq. There is no evidence to suggest that Australians were involved in the abuses or, in fact, in any attempt to cover up. Every opportunity has been taken to suggest through innuendo and kite-flying that Australia is in some way responsible. We are not. We are not the occupying power and we are not the detaining authority. We did not have responsibility for the abuses that took place in Abu Ghraib. To suggest that these abuses were even witnessed by Australians is wrong and to suggest that these abuses were equivalent to the atrocities of the Saddam Hussein regime is again simply vexatious. Those who think that should go and ask the Kurds or the Iranians or the many tortured Iraqis who were strung up by piano wire during the Saddam Hussein 25-year regime. 
The events in Abu Ghraib have happened, unfortunately, and I think that we have to move on. In the broad, they are irrelevant to the overall task and ongoing commitment in Iraq at this time. Iraq's transition to democracy is something that is occurring now and will be one of the most significant global events in most of our lifetimes, certainly in the last decade. The changes that a democratic Iraq will bring to the Middle East and the impact it will have in the war against terror are potentially inspirational and will justify the removal of Saddam Hussein without doubt. Australia has played a part in this and will continue to do so under our coalition government. However difficult the task may be in the next months and years we do not propose to cut and run. That is not the Australian way whatever the temptations might be.  
The present Leader of the Opposition's mantra that we are returning our troops to Australia for the defence of Australia is something out of a Ladybird history book. The defence of Australia is underpinned by our relationship with the United States. I am proud of that relationship and I think that most Australians are comfortable with it and comfortable that it has never been stronger than at this time.
The handover of authority to the sovereign Iraqi interim government on 30 June will be a key milestone in the transition towards a fully representative elected government in 2005. Iraq for first time has an identifiable leadership to take responsibility for the future of their country. This is their opportunity. They should recognise it. They have the support of the United Nations, which voted 17-nil to support the transfer to a sovereign power. They have the support of the Arab League. The Arab League is not a group normally able to agree on much, but they agree that this is an opportunity for Iraq to take control of its own destiny. They have the best wishes of the European community, who are starting for first time to put their hand in their pocket to assist. They have the participation of 32 coalition partners prepared to help as part of the coalition reconstruction of Iraq. 
In short, Australia is not responsible for the abuses that took place in Abu Ghraib. They are very regrettable. They are certainly not helpful for the future development of a democratic and reconstructed Iraq. But it is time to move on. These were isolated abuses that in no way undermine the reasons for removing Saddam Hussein. Australia will continue to support the transition of Iraq commencing with the handover of sovereign power on 30 June 2004. I commend Senator Hill's statement to the parliament and I commend the role that the ADF has played in the removal of Saddam Hussein. Now we move to the rebuilding of Iraq.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-06-16,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of Senator Hill's statement. The general in charge of the Abu Ghraib prison said that she was not informed of the breaches of the Geneva convention which were taking place in her prison. General Karpinski sent down no orders, so far as is known, that the Geneva convention should be upheld at all times. She was kept at arm's length, she maintains. The Australian Minister for Def-ence, Robert Hill, says that he was not informed of the abuses of the Geneva convention taking place in Iraq. We have established through the Senate committees that he did not send orders down the line that at all times Australian personnel would uphold the Geneva convention. He maintains that he was kept at arm's length from knowledge of the serious abuses taking place.
The difference here, besides the obvious ones of proximity and chain of command, is that General Karpinski has been removed from her command, effectively sacked in disgrace. Robert Hill, on the other hand, maintains his line and, without the authority of the Prime Minister being brought in to ensure that this chain of events which led to the Prime Minister misleading the parliament and the people of Australia would not go unchecked, has not removed Robert Hill from the Ministry for Defence. But Robert Hill should resign. He should be relieved of his post. 
It is very easy for a minister in his position to say, `I cannot bear responsibility for what I did not know about,' and he is too clever by half in the way in which he puts that case. I note that, to date, Senator Hill has not tabled the answers to the 60 questions from the Senate inquiry which he had in his hand two hours ago in this chamber. One can presume that, once again, the lateness of release of those answers is deliberately intended to deprive this chamber of the information in those replies which it should have at the moment and which should be part of the debate.
I want to move to Major O'Kane. Remember that this government determined that Major O'Kane, unlike his immediate superior, the colonel in the US armed forces who was brought before the US Senate committee, would not be brought before the Australian Senate committee. However, Senator Hill is speaking for Major O'Kane in today's response. He says in his statement that, subsequent to the estimates hearings, Major O'Kane has again been interviewed about the visit to Abu Ghraib which took place on 4 December last year and has `confirmed that the Red Cross report was being taken seriously by coalition authorities'.
Who is telling the truth here? General Karpinski told her inquisitors that the Red Cross report was met with some hilarity or at least light-heartedly within the prison by the authorities. So we have conflicting reports here from General Karpinski, whom I choose to believe on this occasion, and Major O'Kane. It is very serious that this conflict be resolved, because there are all the hallmarks in the history that we have here that, indeed, the prison authorities whom Major O'Kane visited and responded to were not taking these serious abuse charges seriously. Secondly, according to Senator Hill, Major O'Kane has:
... also confirmed that he raised the contents of the report `paragraph by paragraph' with the appropriate military officials and that the allegations were denied.
I ask: is this sufficient from a trained lawyer responding to Red Cross allegations which came from Red Cross visitations and what the Red Cross officials saw with their own eyes? Is it responsible or acceptable that Major O'Kane says, `In rebuttal of that, I spoke to the military officials, and the Red Cross allegations'—these serious allegations of criminal abuse and breach of the Geneva convention—`were denied'? I think not, Major O'Kane. I do not believe it. And you should not have believed it either. Then Senator Hill says:
As part of his ongoing involvement with the Red Cross, Major O'Kane facilitated the next ICRC visit to Abu Ghraib in January of this year.
Did he really? Let us look at the US News and World Report of 7 June last headlined `Up In The Cell Blocks—a Pentagon memo defines just who gets to see some inmates at Abu Ghraib and when', by Edward T. Pound. It states:
Details on the January Red Cross visit are contained in the memo written by Maj. George O'Kane, an Australian officer who worked for Colonel Warren at U.S. military headquarters in Baghdad. O'Kane wrote that he briefed `MP and military intelligence staff' based at Abu Ghraib on January 2. The purpose: `to ensure a more coordinated visit by the ICRC.' Two days later, O'Kane wrote, he and Maj. Laura Potter, deputy commander of the 205th MI Brigade, briefed the Red Cross visitors. `The purpose of the inspection briefing ... was to control the inspection for security purposes ...' He went on: `It was briefed to the ICRC that their free access would be restricted in accordance' with the Geneva Conventions, `but only to those security internees undergoing interrogations in Units 1A, 1B, and interrogation booths.' 
After negotiations with the 205th MI Brigade, O'Kane said, the Red Cross was denied `free access' only to the `security internees' then being interrogated. The inspectors, he added, were given immediate access to prisoners in 1A and 1B.
Senator Hill, as I have just said, said that Major O'Kane facilitated the next ICRC visit to Abu Ghraib. On the evidence here, that is a deceit of the Senate. What in fact happened was that Major O'Kane became part of a conspiracy to block the Red Cross from its right under the Geneva convention to visit all prisoners at Abu Ghraib when it wanted to and without notice. He went to the prison on 2 January and forewarned the authorities that the Red Cross was seriously alarmed about abuse and was coming again and he had put them off until 4 January. On 4 January he ensured not only that the Red Cross would come to a prison that was warned to get its act in order but, moreover, that the Red Cross would not get access at all to that particular contained part of the prison where the worst abuses had occurred. That is a breach of the Geneva convention. How can Senator Hill come in here and say that Major O'Kane upheld the Geneva convention when he did not? At that time he became part of the problem.
Let me go to General Cosgrove. In the estimates hearings I asked questions of General Cosgrove to ascertain whether it was the case that Australia from the Prime Minister down made sure, seeing we were going into an integrated war operation, that the Australians at the coalface, the Australians who were going to be in the serious position where there could be potential loss of life and limb for themselves or their opponents, would be reminded that they were to act according to Australian standards, which uphold the Geneva convention, no matter what the US or other combatants were doing. I asked General Cosgrove:
Maybe Senator Hill, if not you, General, can answer this question: are you in agreement with the guidelines of the United States, including the rules that I tabled earlier in the day?
These are the rules which allow under authority such things as dogs to be used in the interrogation of prisoners. General Cosgrove answered:
It is a hypothetical question for me to be either in agreement or in disagreement. I do not know the provenance of that. It is fairly cryptic. I do not know the circumstances in which it was meant to be applied. It looks like a PowerPoint slide to me. I would prefer to have a lot more detail before I would be prepared to agree, disagree or comment further. There was a comment about guard dogs and we left it at that.
I then asked General Cosgrove:
There is a problem though, isn't there, where a commanding general issues a cryptic document.
I am talking about the US commanding general issuing this document as the guideline for interrogation of prisoners in Abu Ghraib which, I might add, facilitated the abuse that we now know about. General Cosgrove replied:
There may have been amplification available but I am not aware of it, Senator.
I asked:
Can you find out?
General Cosgrove answered:
No, that is their document. That is a `no foreign' document. I would not embarrass myself by asking the US to release to me what they plainly intend to keep as national information. It is like AUSTEO, in their terms.
Here we have General Cosgrove in charge of the Australian Defence Force determinedly saying that it is not his business to find out what interrogation laws were being applied by the Americans, with whom we went into combat and with whom we helped arrest a number of these prisoners who ended up in internment camps in Iraq—that is not our business. I maintain that it is our business—it is General Cosgrove's responsibility to know what the rules are when we are in an allied war zone interrogating prisoners. It is his absolute responsibility to insist that the Geneva conventions will be upheld and there is no case ever so important as when Australians are integrated into the US effort as Major George O'Kane was integrated into the inspection facility that took place at Abu Ghraib after the Red Cross complaint. I went on to ask: 
Where we have Australian Defence Force personnel working with another country, be it the United States or any other country, how do you draw the line as far as the Australian personnel are concerned? Clearly, cases are going to arise where the defence force with which they are working is going to allow practices which would not be allowed by the Australian Defence Force.
General Cosgrove answered:
There may be cases. Each person is aware of the rules of engagement. They are also aware of their own legal requirements. Fundamentally, the Geneva convention and the other laws of armed conflict guide all of us when we are involved in operations whether we are operating solely within an Australian context or in a coalition context.
I then asked:
Is there concern within the Defence Force or do you have concerns about what has happened at Abu Ghraib?
General Cosgrove answered:
Absolutely. I think some of the reports from Abu Ghraib are horrendous.
I asked.
Do you not have a concern that some of those things may have occurred because they were sanctioned or at least they were not militated against by very clear authority coming down the line and saying, `You must not allow this to happen'?
General Cosgrove answered:
I just refer you back to the minister. You have had that discussion with the minister. I would not seek to comment further on the exchange that you had with Minister Hill on that very same point.
There is General Cosgrove saying that the minister is ultimately the authority here. But I submit to you that both the minister and the general failed in their responsibility in this situation to ensure they passed down the line to Australians in Iraq at all levels that they must at all times abide by the Geneva conventions and, moreover, that if they saw those conventions being abused or had it brought to their attention that those conventions were being abused it would be reported back to the Australian command and to the ministry. What short of that can be allowed?
I submit that you cannot go below that level of responsible practice yet here we have Major O'Kane himself, according to the US News and World Report, making it clear in a report made on the Red Cross complaints that he was not going to allow the Red Cross access to certain prisoners and that as far as the Red Cross visits were concerned they were going to be controlled for inspection and security purposes. I ask: where does controlling for inspection and security purposes not become cover-up? On the face of it, Major O'Kane's involvement is a very serious indictment of the failure of the chain of command to go down the line and insist that the Geneva conventions were upheld. If Major O'Kane, working as a legal officer, cannot understand and enforce to the letter of the law the Geneva convention, where does that leave other soldiers defining without that training at the work face?
Minister Hill in his statement to the Senate today said:
I told the Senate on 11 May:
The abuses I saw in the media about a fortnight ago, I saw for the first time. 
I stand by that statement.
What a clever concoction that is. That leaves me to conclude that he is using this to say: `I did not see the abuse until it came on TV. Therefore, you must not accuse me of knowing about the abuses earlier on.' I submit that he did know. Remember that the minister went to Baghdad knowing that in June last year Amnesty International had held a press conference—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. When Senator Brown contradicts a statement of Senator Hill's and says, `I submit that Senator Hill did know,' that is tantamount to accusing him of lying and that is unparliamentary.
 (Senator Hutchins)—I think it is a debating point, Senator Ferguson. Please continue, Senator Brown.
—I will send the honourable member a set of the standing orders! What we have here is an attempt to defend the indefensible. The statement by Senator Hill is a clever device for trying to duck around the knowledge that he had or should have had about what was happening in Abu Ghraib. This is a very serious cover-up by the minister and a very serious failure in an integrated involvement with US forces in Iraq by the Australian authorities right from the Prime Minister down to ensure that Australian standards were upheld. A lesson has to come out of this: that never again can this situation be allowed in this nation of ours. We are an independent nation, we have our own rules and we uphold the Geneva conventions, regardless of egregious breaches of those conventions by the United States. At all times those people in the defence forces who act in the service of this country deserve leadership which is going to make sure they are protected from infractions of the Geneva conventions by other nations. The Prime Minister, the minister and the defence leadership let our Defence Force personnel down in that regard. (Time expired)

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-06-16,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 4251:
(1)	Clause 5, page 4 (lines 29 to 32) omit paragraphs (1)(b) and (c), substitute: 
	(b)	the person has been elected or re-elected; and
	(c)	the Remuneration Tribunal has not determined that the person should continue to be entitled to parliamentary allowance.
 (2)	Clause 5, page 4 (line 33) to page 5 (line 20), omit subclauses (2), (3) and (4), substitute:
	(2)	For the purposes of this Act, where a senator as at the date in subsection (1) has a term due to expire on 30 June 2008, then the new scheme entry time for that senator, if the person is entitled to a parliamentary allowance beyond 30 June 2008, shall be 1 July 2008, provided that the senator may, in writing to the trustees, opt to agree to the earlier new scheme entry time.
These two amendments are fairly similar in intent to those we debated before lunch. They are very much about trying to ensure that the new superannuation scheme applies to existing MPs. They are also related to a longer series of more detailed amendments on sheet 4252. Combined, these two sets of amendments seek to do a number of things. First, they seek to ensure that from the date of the next election, which is essentially the new entry time, all MPs who have been re-elected will move to the new superannuation scheme. There are, of necessity, two exceptions to that.
The first exception is senators who are part way through their terms. I only raise that because the principle that one should apply this particular change from the date of the next election does not necessarily apply for those who are halfway through their terms, so we have carved them out as a separate exception. The second exception, which was suggested to me by some people in another party, is for senators who have not yet qualified for a pension under the current scheme—in other words, who have fewer than eight years service. It has been suggested to me that, to try to make the transition to the new scheme reasonably acceptable for people, they should be carved out as an exception and be allowed to continue in the scheme until their eight years is attained. Those amendments are contained in more detail in the amendments we have proposed to the other bill.
The two amendments in front of us deal with the issue of trying to ensure that people who are elected at the next election do immediately transfer across to the new scheme, unless they fall within that exception or the exception I mentioned in respect of senators. The Democrats believe that it is a very important principle that the new superannuation scheme should apply to all MPs elected from the next election, regardless of whether they are lucky enough to be in this particular club or in the next club. That is a principle that we have held very dear for quite some time.
As I said before lunch—and I do not particularly want to repeat my arguments in any great detail—we are of the strong view that there is no issue of retrospectivity in the amendments we are moving because it is the decision of each and every one of us whether we offer ourselves for re-election or not. If we do offer ourselves for re-election then, from that date, we are essentially agreeing to the statutory entitlements that the parliament offers us for that particular term. If we choose to change those statutory entitlements, that does not bring into play issues of retrospectivity, contract or constitutional reimbursement or any other issue. For those reasons, the Democrats think these amendments are very reasonable and we commend them to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-16,"—I have a brief question. What is Senator Cherry's intention, in moving these amendments, in respect of current members of the defined benefit fund who will not meet the minimum qualifying period and who will be carved out of the scheme? ",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-06-16,"—These are dealt with in my next set of amendments on sheet 4252. Essentially this is an idea that I think came out of the discussions of the coalition backbenchers committee, where it was suggested that people who had not met the qualifying time should be entitled to meet that qualifying time. I should declare that I am in that category if I am re-elected, which I am sure is the point to which Senator Sherry is referring. It also says that those particular people should be entitled to continue in the old scheme until they have met the qualifying time, which is eight years, as an assumed involuntary retirement and at that stage that would become the date at which they transfer to the new scheme. As I said, it is not a proposal which we developed but one which came from the coalition backbench.
I should also note that our limits also allow people in that category, which would include myself, and senators halfway through a six-year term to opt to move to the new scheme immediately with all other senators. So whilst we are providing that little bit of flexibility for those people who are yet to qualify in the current club, we are at least also giving those people who are yet to qualify the option of moving across with all other MPs as at the date of the new scheme. I should note that the amendments on sheet 4252 also provide that people's current entitlements would be preserved as if they had been involuntarily retired as at the date of the next election and that the percentage calculation of salary at that date would be preserved, as it has been preserved in the amendments the government has moved in respect of MPs who return to parliament at that election. Essentially we are saying that MPs who return to parliament at the next election and MPs who are currently in parliament and who are re-elected will be treated in the same category. We have shamelessly plagiarised the government's own amendments to achieve that outcome.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-06-16,"—I move Democrat amendment (3) on sheet 4251:
(3)	Clause 5, page 5 (after line 20), after subclause (4), insert:
	(4A)	For the purposes of this Act, if a person:
	(a)	 was entitled to parliamentary allowance immediately before and after the date determined in subsection (1); and 
	(b)	the person notifies the trustees of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme of his or her desire to close off his or her entitlement under that scheme and have future service determined under the new scheme; and 
	(c)	the person has less than 18 years service under the old scheme;
		then the new scheme entry time shall be the date the trustees accept the notification.
This amendment seeks to provide what I call the `Andren option', which means that it gives all MPs who are in the class of 2004 and who are re-elected at this election the opportunity to opt out of the old scheme and move into the new scheme. In relation to the amendments which I am moving to the second bill, they would ensure that the benefits of those particular MPs under the current scheme are preserved and that all new service is under the new scheme. At the very least, we should ensure that people have the option of opting out of the current scheme and moving into the new scheme. I think that is a reasonable proposition. There are a lot of MPs in this place who feel very uncomfortable with the current level of benefit, from Mark Latham down, and I think it is essential we at least give those people the opportunity to keep faith with their electorates about moving to community standards and to actually move to a superannuation system more in keeping with community standards.

PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION AND OTHER ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004

3A After subsection 18(9)
Insert:
	(9A)	The rate of additional retiring allow-ance in accordance with paragraph (9)(b) shall not exceed the rate set from time to time by the Remuneration Tribunal in accordance with subsection 6(1) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 for an other Minister in Cabinet.
	(9B)	The application of subsection (9A) is limited to the rate of additional retiring allowance of any person who serves as an other Minister in Cabinet for that period of service as an other Minister in Cabinet that commences after the 40th Parliament.

3B After subsection 18(9)
Insert:
	(9C)	For the purposes of subsection (9A), an other Minister in Cabinet is a Minister in Cabinet other than the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Leader of the Government in the Senate or the Leader of the House of Representatives.
As I have outlined the purpose of the amendments we are dealing with in my speech in the second reading debate, I do not want to take too much time of the chamber. The Labor Party argues that, as is common with many defined benefit funds—private or public and not just in Australia but throughout the world—there are capping provisions that establish a reasonable cap to the entitlement of a defined benefit fund. They do not necessarily reflect total salary including, in this case, the various allowances for office in all circumstances.
It is a capping measure at the level of cabinet allowance. It does affect a number of individuals: the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Leader of the Government in the House of Representatives and Leader of the Government in the Senate, and the manager of business in House of Representatives as well—if that person is not a cabinet minister, I think there is a higher allowance. I have outlined our case for a capping provision. I should indicate that, if this is accepted by the Senate and the government sends the bill back in the form of a message and rejects it, I want to make it very clear that we will not be insisting on the amendments. We are not going to hold up the passage of this legislation in those circumstances. I want that on the record and clearly understood. But this is Labor Party policy and, in terms of the consistency of our approach and the policy announcement that our leader, Mark Latham, made, this was part of that. If it is not successfully carried on this occasion, there will be a future occasion if we are elected to government when we can deal with this matter.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2004-06-16,"—I think the opposition's otherwise relatively honourable and principled approach to this whole issue is sullied and cheapened by what is a fairly tawdry stunt on this particular matter. The opposition attacks—properly—the minor parties for their lack of consistency between the parliamentary scheme and arrangements for public servants in relation to the question of forcing existing members out of the scheme. I think the same principle applies here. It is proper that the superannuation under the existing scheme is related to salary, and we see no role or place for a cap. If the Prime Minister warrants, as I am sure the opposition agree, a higher level of salary—and so should the highest parliamentary officer in the land warrant a higher salary—then the superannuation arrangements should be set accordingly. If the opposition felt that this was such an important principle—to put a cap on it—why aren't they putting a cap on the new accumulation scheme? We see no amendment to cap, at cabinet minister level or any other level, the arrangements that will apply to the new accumulation scheme, and the employer contribution of nine per cent will be set according to salary whatever that salary is, including the Prime Minister's salary. So I think their position is exposed as nothing more than a fairly cheap trick. I am disappointed that they are moving it. It is the government's position that we will not accept it. We do not think it accords to any principle and it is not a principled position. We welcome the fact that the opposition will not insist on this amendment when the bill comes back to the Senate from the House of Representatives but it does mean a delay in the passage of this legislation. If the minor parties should support the opposition on this matter, then that is an unfortunate delay in the process. But I am grateful that at least the opposition will not insist on this amendment should it come back to this chamber. ",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-16,"—I have two very quick points. In terms of the delay, Senator Minchin can hardly claim that a possible day's delay is going to be critical to the passage of this measure over the next two weeks. I do not think that is an issue. He has alleged we have not been consistent in our not moving a cap to the new scheme. The new scheme is a nine per cent accumulation scheme. It is very different with a total outcome that is substantially lower in terms of accumulation compared to the defined benefit scheme.
In concluding my remarks, I emphasise it is commonplace in defined benefit funds to cap at the top end. It is a quite common provision, and that is true of both public and private sector defined benefits. In fact, I should draw Senator Minchin's attention to the fact that we have in this country a retirement benefit limit, which is a cap on the total lump sum and the total pension benefit. That is a cap that imposes a statutory limit on the maximum superannuation benefit, in whatever form. I think it is well over $1 million at the present time. I do not know the precise figure but it is a substantial figure. There is a limit to which we reflect the retirement income of higher income earners through a superannuation fund in the Australian system anyway. The RBL does that, otherwise we would have people saying that if you earnt $2 million a year you should be entitled to two-thirds of $2 million a year in retirement. We think there should be caps. There is a cap on the general system; there should be a cap on the current system in respect of the small number of people that I have indicated. I hope the minor parties will support our proposal but, if the matter is carried here—and I do not know whether the minor parties are going to support it in fact—and it is rejected by the government in the House of Representatives, then our day will come. Whether it is this year or next year, whenever the election is held, our day will come in the House of Representatives when we have a majority and we will be able to implement a reasonable cap in the circumstances. 
I do not think it is a cheap stunt, Senator Minchin. I think it is a reasonable approach. It is certainly not going to be cheap in terms of outcomes for Mark Latham should he be elected Prime Minister. I am frankly very proud of our leader. I am not going to go into the personal conversations we have had on this issue. I think they were a little less fractious than the conversations that occurred in the Liberal party room.
—I am not going to say any more about that—that is your business—but I can say that our leader was very determined that he should set a personal example on this issue. He believed that, given the salary level of the Prime Minister, a cap set at cabinet level was a very reasonable level of retirement income. If it is not passed by the parliament on receipt of a message back, should it enjoy minor party support, the Labor Party's day will come when we are in government and we will deal with the matter then.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-06-16,"—I find myself caught out on this particular amendment: caught out because I agree with Senator Minchin that it is a stunt and caught out because it also exposes the inconsistency in Senator Sherry's argument over the course of this debate. On the one hand we are being told that we cannot change future entitlements because that would be retrospective. On the other hand we are being told we can change them for a small number of ministers in the cabinet—not all of the ministers in the cabinet, I might add, just a small number. So certainly, as I highlighted earlier in the debate, if Mr Garrett ends up a member of the Labor ministry he will end up being paid a lot less superannuation than his colleagues in the ministry like—potentially—Senator Sherry. In fact, he will be getting nine per cent of his officer allowance and Senator Sherry will be getting 60-plus per cent of his officer allowance as an equivalent employer contribution to superannuation. In addition to that, we are going to have a different rate of superannuation for some members in the cabinet and not for others. I think it is a notion which reeks of inconsistency and opportunism. I notice that Senator Sherry, in his contribution, highlighted hats off to Mr Latham for being prepared to take a cut on his superannuation. Hats back on for the rest of the Labor caucus who are not prepared to do the same, in my view. Mr Latham has made it quite clear in his comments that he cannot defend the current scheme because its benefits are excessive. Then why is it the case that for 226 MPs he is prepared to lock that in place?
My party room's intention was to support this amendment on the basis that a little is better than nothing at all in terms of getting some changes in place for reducing the superannuation generosity. But I have just been advised by Senator Sherry that he is not going to insist on the amendment, in which case I wonder why he has bothered moving it in the first place. To me, it highlights the fact that Labor just want to get through this debate and get maximum publicity for minimum damage to their own members, and that is something which, to be honest, I find disappointing. When Mark Latham first raised the issue of parliamentary superannuation as shadow Treasurer last October, I welcomed his comments. The Democrats were very pleased to see that we finally had an MP honest enough to say what no other MP had been prepared to say outside the Labor Party, except Mr Andren, which was that we needed to reform the parliamentary superannuation scheme. What has come through is a very pale reflection of what was actually needed, and I think it reflects very poorly on Mr Latham and the Labor Party that we have these stuntish sorts of amendments coming through and not the comprehensive proper analysis and proper changes that we need to reform the system. 
The Democrats will support this amendment, reluctantly, because we think a little bit of reform is better than none at all. We like to encourage the Labor Party to be a party of reform and to be bold. The small-target strategy will not work for this election, as I am sure they know, and I would encourage them to go further. We will support this amendment because it will give Mr Andren and his colleagues in the other place a chance to make the other place vote on taking these amendments a bit further. We might actually get a bit more attention paid to these matters in both places as a result. From that point of view, we will reluctantly support the amendment, although we express disappointment that the Labor Party have already said they are not going to insist on it.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-16,"—I think Senator Cherry is being a little harsh. I have refrained from anything other than justifiable support for our leader, Mark Latham, who has exercised decisive leadership on this matter. Let us be honest, Senator Cherry: we would not be debating these bills tonight if it were not for the announcement by Mark Latham. Everyone knows it is a fact that we have adopted a significant policy of closing down the current defined benefit fund, and I have outlined the reasons why we have taken that position. The Labor Party made a very significant decision in their policy announcement in February this year. Of course, within a day of the Prime Minister's announcement, the flow-on consequences were immediately obvious with regard to the states that have not changed their schemes—Tasmania and Western Australia had already reformed their schemes. So to argue that this is not a substantial reform is just not right; it is a very significant reform.
I reject the accusations that this is a cheap stunt by our leader, Mark Latham. He exercised strength and leadership on this issue and went publicly where no other political leader in recent times had dared to go. I know from my discussions with him on this issue over some time that he has a very strong view about the level of benefit being capped. It is not some cheap stunt; he holds the view very passionately, I can tell you. He has a very passionate commitment to a reasonable level of capping in the current defined benefits scheme.
Whilst I have made some fair and firm points about the Democrats' and the Greens' approach on this matter, I have resisted—and I resisted in the committee hearings, Senator Cherry, as you will probably recall—attacking individuals and their particular positions in terms of their own benefits. I have strenuously resisted that, because I just do not think that is an appropriate way to deal with this legislation. But I do commend and support fully the stand that Mark Latham has taken with respect to his personal position on the cap. It is not some sort of cheap stunt. It is a very deep and passionate commitment from him. It is the way he feels about this and what he thinks is a reasonable level of defined benefit retirement superannuation savings that he and some other officers and persons who hold high office can live on when they retire.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2004-06-16,"—I do not want to prolong this debate but I want to welcome Senator Cherry's support for my arguments in opposition to this amendment and therefore express my disappointment that, despite that, he is going to support the amendment. Senator Cherry highlighted the extent to which the ALP amendment is riddled with inconsistencies with the positions they are taking on the rest of this legislation. I thought Senator Cherry emphasised that particularly well. 
I have two other quick points. I do think that the status of Prime Minister in this country should be upheld. It is the highest elected office that any Australian can aspire to, and it would be unfortunate if the parliament, in a sense, expressed a devaluation of that office by some sort of legislative cap of this kind. In this country we ought to pay more regard to, and regard with greater reverence, those who have served in the highest elected office in the land. I think that is one of the things we can learn from the American system of government, because they do that very well. Therefore, I do not agree with moves that devalue that office.
I also make the point that if Mr Latham should ever become Prime Minister and retire and go onto a pension, it is always open to him to voluntarily give up part of that pension. He can donate it to charity, give it back to the government or do whatever he likes with it. If he thinks it is excessive he need not take it all, or he can donate it to his favourite cause. That would be a much better course of action than seeking to have the parliament legislate to provide a cap of this kind. I think Senator Cherry is quite right to earmark this as nothing more than a stunt.

I intend to divide on these amendments and on the amendment I shall move next. I do not propose to speak to the next amendment, so we will be able to have those two divisions pretty much simultaneously. I will speak to this set of amendments very briefly because I spoke to them at great length earlier in the debate. These are detailed amendments to ensure that all MPs and senators elected at the next election could transfer at that time to the new contributions scheme and to provide for the preservation of existing benefits on the formula which the government has devised for former parliamentarians who are elected at the next election. Essentially, the amendments say that the election would be treated as if it were an involuntary retirement for the purposes of closing down the current superannuation scheme for existing parliamentarians and that they would be transferred and their benefits preserved at the percentage that would apply if it were involuntary retirement.
The Democrats think this is a reasonable proposition to ensure that we accelerate the process of closing down the current scheme and moving all parliamentarians to the community standard of the new nine per cent scheme—moving from the 67 per cent, which is the current notional employer contribution, to the nine per cent, which is the employer contribution of the new scheme and also the community standard. I think it is very reasonable, for the arguments that we have put in this place. As I said, a Senate committee highlighted unanimously in 1997 that the current public benefit of this superannuation scheme was overly generous. The Leader of the Opposition has said that it is indefensible, and by coming forward with this legislation the government has acknowledged that it is way out of whack with community standards. I think it is a reasonable proposition to put in place a reasonable transition to the new scheme, and that is what we have sought to do with these amendments.
I will speak very briefly to the amendment which I will move shortly. That second amendment is to provide as an alternative, if this set of amendments is defeated, for parliamentarians to at least have the choice of moving to the new scheme—the Andren option, which I have raised before. That amendment would at least ensure that members could choose to move to the new scheme and provide that their benefits under the existing arrangements are preserved to allow that to occur. I propose to divide on both of these amendments because I think it is important that all of us be counted in terms of our views on this. 
I know that the whips usually call a vote on an amendment that is only supported by the Democrats a mickey division, in which case half the senators are often sent out. But I think it would be unfortunate in this case for them to do so, because it is important that all senators be counted in their states as to where they stand on whether they are prepared to vote to exclude themselves from the reform of this superannuation scheme into the future. It is important that all senators make sure that their vote is recorded as to whether they are prepared to excise themselves from this reform and keep their current excessive, above community standard superannuation or whether they believe they should move to the new nine per cent superannuation scheme with a reasonable transition arrangement. I also think all senators should be counted on whether they are at least prepared to give other senators the option of moving to that scheme. I hope that the whips, in calling this division, remind senators that this is a vote on their superannuation scheme and is not a good one to sit outside and not be counted on. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-06-16,"—I move Democrat amendment (7) on sheet 4252, which I have spoken to previously:
(7)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 12 (after line 21), at the end of the item, add:
20 Members may opt not to continue in scheme
	(1)	For the purposes of this Act, if a person:
	(a)	was entitled to parliamentary allowance immediately before and after the date determined in subsection 5(1) of the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004, and 
	(b)	the person notifies the trustees of the Parliamentary Contributory Super-annuation Scheme of his or her desire to close off their entitlement under that scheme and have future service determined under the new scheme; and  
	(c)	the person has less than 18 years service under the old scheme; 
then the new scheme entry time shall be the date the trustees accept the notification.
	(2)	Where a person chooses to leave the scheme under clause, the person is entitled, after the end of the first scheme contribution period, to a retiring allowance (the preserved initial allowance) under this clause at the preserved initial percentage (see subclause (5)) of the rate of parliamentary allowance for the time being payable to a member.
	(3)	For the purposes of the reference in subclause (2) to the rate of parliamentary allowance for the time being payable to a member, any reductions of a particular member's entitlement to parliamentary allowance under Division 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 3 to the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 as a result of salary sacrifice are to be disregarded.
	(4)	The person's entitlement to the preserved initial allowance is suspended for the duration of any later new scheme contribution period of the person.
	(5)	The preserved initial percentage is, from the end of the new scheme contribution period of the person to the start of the next (if any) new scheme contribution period of the person, the percentage that would have been applied to the rate of parliamentary allowance in order to calculate the rate of retiring allowance (other than additional retiring allowance) payable to the person under section 18, or under this clause, if the person had retired involuntarily, immediately before the start of the firstmentioned new scheme contribution period.
	(6)	If the person has served as a Minister of State or an office holder, the person is entitled, after the end of the first scheme contribution period, and in respect of each relevant office, to a retiring allowance (the preserved additional initial allowance) under this clause at the preserved additional initial percentage (see subclause (8)) of the rate, for the time being, of:
	(a)	for an office as a Minister of State—the salary payable to a Minister of State; or
	(b)	for an office as an office holder, the allowance by way of salary payable to an office holder in respect of that office.
	(7)	The person's entitlement to the preserved initial additional allowance is suspended for the duration of any later new scheme contribution period of the person.
	(8)	The preserved additional initial percentage for a relevant office is, from the end of the new scheme contribution period of the person to the start of the next (if any) new scheme contribution period of the person, the percentage that was applied to:
	(a)	for an office referred to in paragraph (1)(a)—the salary payable to a Minister of State; or
	(b)	for an office referred to in paragraph (1)(b)—the allowance by way of salary payable to an office holder in respect of that office;
in order to calculate the rate of additional initial retiring allowance that would have been payable to the person under section 18(9) or under this clause , if the person had retired involuntarily, immediately before the start of the firstmentioned new scheme contribution period.
	(9)	If, immediately before the start of a new scheme contribution period of the person, the person would not have been entitled to have been paid an additional retiring allowance, or would have been paid a reduced rate of additional retiring allowance, because of all or any of the following provisions: 
	(a)	Part VA;
	(b)	subsection 18(10B) or subclause (6) of this clause; 
	(c)	subsection 20(3A);
	(d)	section 21;
	(e)	section 21B;
this clause applies to the person as if the person were, at that time, entitled to be paid the additional initial retiring allowance he or she would have been paid if those provisions had not applied.
	(10)	Nothing in this clause entitles the person to additional initial retiring allowance at a rate that exceeds:
	(a)	if the person is entitled to additional retiring allowance in respect of one relevant office only—75% of the rate, for the time being, at which salary or allowance by way of salary, as the case may be, is payable in respect of that office; or
	(b)	if a person is entitled to additional retiring allowance in respect of 2 or more relevant offices—75% of the rate that is the highest rate, for the time being, at which salary or allowance by way of salary, as the case may be, is payable in respect of either or any of those offices.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-06-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I would like to address tonight, albeit briefly, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's glossy brochure entitled Iraq: the path ahead. I am wondering exactly what is the purpose of this booklet that has been tabled this evening. It is a very glossy—and, no doubt, expensive—book of smiling faces. I am not sure if it depicts the reality of the conflict that has occurred in Iraq. The Democrats have long called for the government to reveal—or perhaps even formulate—an exit strategy in relation to Iraq. We believe that, as one of the countries that invaded Iraq in the first place—and in the context of international criticism when we did so—we as a nation have a special responsibility to assist the people of Iraq during this crucial rebuilding stage. It is not a matter of do we pull out now, do we pull out before Christmas or do we pull out at some date in the future; what we need to be considering is what we achieve before we pull out, what we have to do to ensure that we clean up the mess, if you like, as one of the occupying forces and how we can achieve this as soon as possible.
While this paper does provide some clarification, there is still no clear exit strategy. Perhaps we should be asking President Bush about the exit strategy in relation to Iraq—and indeed to our country and our forces. While this paper accuses the media of providing a distorted account of the situation in Iraq by, for example, publishing images of violence, anyone looking at the pictures in this publication could be forgiven for thinking that Iraq is a utopia of peace. The front cover is a photo of an ADF officer with a young, smiling Iraqi girl, while children's drawings and red love hearts—love hearts!—adorn the walls behind them. There are no pictures of the children who have been detained without charge by coalition forces. Neither is there any indication that children may have been killed or wounded as a consequence of the actions of coalition forces in Iraq.
Of course, there is a picture of our Prime Minister, John Howard, during his fleeting tour of Iraq on Anzac Day. If the government really wants to provide information about and a clarification of its strategy in Iraq, why couldn't it have done so by way of a statement to the parliament or simply a low-cost—perhaps less glossy—brochure? Instead, what we have is a very attractive booklet, no doubt, which actually looks a lot like campaign material. I would not be surprised if it is the kind of thing that gets mailed out to the electorate over the coming months to persuade the electorate that Iraq is not a negative in the polls—as the Prime Minister was insisting yesterday—and to justify, in some way, some of the indefensible actions that have taken place.
The hypocrisy in this paper is startling. For example, it states:
... the onus is on Iraq's new leadership and the Iraqi people to keep progress on track. They must forge an inclusive political environment in which Iraqis see their interests reflected and represented through peaceful debate and negotiation, rather than violence.
If only the coalition countries had demonstrated a commitment to peaceful debate and negotiation, rather than violence, before they went in and wreaked so much havoc. The paper also states that `Australia has always held the view that the United Nations has a crucial role to play in Iraq'. Yet this government completely bypassed the processes of the UN in order to invade Iraq in the first place. I know that the Prime Minister spent months lobbying for a Security Council resolution which would sanction military action against Iraq. I know he flew to Washington in an attempt to convince the President of that country that any attack should occur within the auspices of the United Nations. But when it became too difficult he and others did a complete backflip. On the sole basis that other member states did not concur with the coalition's position, the Australian government suggested that the UN was somehow irrelevant. Instead of putting money into glossy brochures attempting to justify its decision to go to war, the government should be spending this money on desperately needed resources for the Iraqi people. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. 
Leave granted; debate adjourned. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</title>,Documents,29,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2004-06-16,"—I rise tonight to speak about the dysfunctional National Australia Bank board. A lot has been written about the role of independent directors and auditors. This matter has again been brought to the fore with the very public airing of the NAB board's stoush. Indeed, there are seminars galore about corporate governance and their prime focus is on the happenings at the National Australia Bank.
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has taken an interest in the issue of corporate governance in view of the number of high profile corporate failures within Australia. In its report on the review of independent auditing by registered company auditors, it stated that the responsibility for corporate failures should lie ultimately with the company's management and its directors. It thought that the failures pointed to the inadequate nature of corporate governance exercised by some in the business community.
Opinion is divided over the role and the need for independent directors. It seems that a few leading chairmen and directors in Australia disagree with the concept and are of the view that a properly functioning board does not require a person in such a role. They believe that having an independent director on the board actually undermines the role of the CEO-chairman position. On the other side of the coin, fund managers and shareholder groups support the idea as it gives investors better access to boards and should theoretically lead to greater accountability.
It certainly would not be a cure-all for the ills of the NAB board. However, a pill of some sort is needed. The board has been progressively decimated since the $360 million foreign exchange currency trading fiasco, news of which broke on 13 January this year. Reports into the disaster were conducted by both PricewaterhouseCoopers and APRA. Although the board got off relatively lightly, both reports did point out its acquiescence in relation to the mounting losses.
First, Frank Cicutto, the NAB's chief executive who commissioned the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, resigned in February before the report was finalised, and he was followed by the chairman, Charles Allen—each leaving with generous redundancy benefits. Both resignations, I believe, were a mistake. In my opinion they should have remained and been held accountable until the matter had been fully investigated. On the other hand, Mr Cicutto was hardly responsible for Don Argus's earlier misreading of the USA Homeside fiasco. While I do not wish to depreciate Don Argus's effort, it must be remembered that the share price increased fivefold while he was the CEO. The situation was made worse because of the decision to appoint Graham Kraehe to replace Charles Allen as chairman. He was already under a lot of pressure in his position as chairman of the risk management committee. 
Then there was the controversy surrounding Cathy Walter. Quite frankly, I was appalled at the way she brought the whole row to the public's attention and brought the whole board into disrepute. Her fitness for reappointment or indeed appointment to other public boards must now be questioned. After rejecting requests by directors opposing her to stand down, she became embroiled in a bitter conflict with them. I see that she has now had the good sense to stand aside. However, while I do not condone her actions, I do think she had a point in calling for the removal of the directors, particularly the new chairman, Graeme Kraehe, and herself.
The point is that the blame for the fiasco should be shared. Cathy Walter has a very strong background in corporate governance and an eye for detail, and I feel she was probably worried that the PricewaterhouseCoopers report may have focused unduly on her. This may have been the reason why she chose to venture outside the board's solidarity. However, this turned out to be a wrong premonition. In terms of directors' prime responsibilities, the audit committee was headed by Cathy Walter and the risk management committee was headed by Graham Kraehe. Of the two, the risk management committee should have been abreast of the problem areas. Hence, Cathy Walter was quite right in targeting Graham Kraehe. Mr Graham Kraehe has now agreed to remain with the NAB for another 12 months in order to oversee the appointment of new directors.
There is some conjecture as to just how often the risk management committee met once it was established in August 2003. It seems that the first meeting was not held until late November 2003. Given the activities of rogue trader Nick Leeson, operating out of Singapore and bringing down the old English Barings Bank, an ordinary prudent person would have expected all banks to have been ultra cautious. APRA's concern about monitoring limits in trading markets goes back to 2002, because the NAB was not paying enough attention to signals that it was in trouble. By 2003, APRA was of the view that there were sufficient problems with its risk management to warrant it going back to the full board.
The NAB has been criticised for not having the right people with the right mix of skills on its board. I agree with that criticism. To begin with, in my view it is wrong that there is only one person with financial services experience sitting on the board. I also think it is farcical that that person, Mr Tomlinson, can sit on seven boards at the one time while Mr Kraehe has not had a startling career either, particularly if you look at his South Corp Ltd experiences. In my view, the mix of people on many boards is generally not right. There is a need to have people with a wider experience, not just ex-CEOs who are prepared to fearlessly represent shareholders' interests—but that is sometimes questionable.
Sandy Easterbrook, a director of Corporate Governance International said that, in his view, people with a funds management or superannuation fund background or people with relevant industry experience would be ideal. There is also new evidence which now suggests that combining the roles of CEO and chairman leads to stronger performance by the company. One of the reasons for this is that boards would take greater care in selecting them and the increased security of the joint role would allow them to take the necessary risks. However, it is the excessive risk taking or greed that has got so many companies into trouble, so this approach must be severely discounted. 
Another noteworthy issue, not just in relation to the NAB, is that so many executives seem to leave with very generous redundancy payments while the company is being run down. This situation certainly lends credence to the concept of the old boys club. I believe that the other directors need to denounce this idea and challenge these payments, even going so far as to take the matters to court if necessary. Sandy Easterbrook also said:
There is a close correlation in Australia between significant corporate governance issues in companies being followed by significant destruction of shareholder value ...
Other commentators have also suggested that internal fights, such as the very public one going on now in the NAB board, can affect the company's earnings and the confidence that investors have in the company. They are interesting comments, given that I have already been asked by some people about what is happening at the National Bank. I should add my support for the bank: despite the recent shortcomings, it remains particularly strong. A particular strength of the bank has always been in the area of its housing portfolio.
It is good news that John Stewart has been appointed as CEO and he appears to be a breath of fresh air. However, he has a further problem in relation to the expensing of the capitalisation of software development costs, and he has oversight by APRA. APRA are now having a greater involvement looking over the bank's shoulder. There will be more prudence and consequently less risk. The question now that must be asked is whether NAB will be able to maintain its profit growth levels and dividend increases each year. The investing public needs to be reassured that the NAB's current rate of profitability will continue. APRA's involvement with the NAB does deserve praise, unlike some early superannuation fund difficulties with different personnel. I think that is significant, particularly for us as parliamentarians. However, perhaps NAB should consider undertaking a prudential audit every four to five years, just as some of the more progressive superannuation funds do. It would also be wise to place a greater emphasis on its risk management infrastructure with appropriate technology support.
One disturbing thing that came out of Mr Lewis's APRA report in relation to NAB was the culture and subcultures operating in the bank, which certainly appeared to give credence to the idea that it was not a bad thing to exceed limits and to minimise monitoring and hide certain problems in the trade. However, all that bad news is now behind the bank and I wish it well in the future because it is a major financial institution in Australia and when it gets its new board structure I think it has a good future.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Banking: National Australia Bank Board</title>,Adjournment,30,1
