"Oakeshott, Rob, MP",IND,2009-11-24,"—I thank the members on both sides of the House for staying behind to approve this MPI. This is important because the small business community of regional Australia is entering a difficult phase on the back of the year of the global financial crisis with, for example, no cheques arriving in the letterbox in the next couple of months to get them through with retail spending throughout the Christmas period. That is the reason for raising this MPI, along with the end of a range of measures such as the small business tax break at the end of December, which I would ask the government to consider extending until we are very clear that the impacts of the GFC are over, particularly with regard to regional and rural Australia. I want to quote to the House from a report by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations about my region of Australia that was received only this week. It says:
The Mid-North Coast has been one of the most persistently disadvantaged regions in Australia in recent decades and continues to experience high levels of disadvantage. Indeed, a high proportion of the region’s working age population is on income support, while the region’s participation rate of 49.2 per cent in September 2009 remains well below the comparable rate for Australia of 65.1 per cent.
The region’s reliance on at-risk industries, particularly retail trade when the impact of the cash payments begins to recede, and well below average levels of educational attainment suggest that not only is the region currently disadvantaged but may also deteriorate further as the impact of the GFC—
or global financial crisis—
deepens.
So, for all the talk by many over the last month that we are through the worst of the global financial crisis and that we should be winding back the stimulus, I would argue, from a regional perspective and from a small business community perspective, that that is the last thing that government should be doing right now. It is for this reason that this afternoon I put the case for the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, who is at the table, and the executive to consider the argument that the small business tax break in particular should be extended beyond the 31 December date. I ask that to be considered particularly in the interests of regional small business even if the extension is only in respect of businesses with turnovers under $2 million where an asset of over $1,000 that is purchased becomes applicable for the small business tax break. That would be of direct benefit to the small business community in regions such as mine and throughout Australia for the next six to 12 months, providing a buffer against what is still unknown through that period.
From what I have just read out, you would note that DEEWR themselves are expressing concerns about the future of the mid-North Coast—and I am sure many of the regions are in a similar state—and therefore there needs to be some consideration of further assistance and further support, and the most obvious assistance, from a government perspective, is through the use of tax breaks and tax mechanisms. We have seen some very good support through tax schemes such as those for fuel tax credits and for research and development changes applying to the small business community for tax credits. I would argue that while both of those schemes are continuing the small business tax break would sit very well alongside them as a third prong in providing a buffer and some support for the small business community through the next six to 12 months. So I put that to the minister and to the executive to consider, and hopefully we can hear some good news on that soon.
The importance of the small business community to a region such as mine and regional areas generally is without question, and I think the community is generally recognised by both sides of this chamber as the engine room of regional Australia and of regional life. On the mid-North Coast of New South Wales 95 per cent of the business community is small business. The definition of small business that I use is businesses with five employees or fewer. I know we hear from government a whole range of different definitions about small business, from under 100 employees to under 25 and to under 20. These are genuinely small business operators of microbusinesses and home based businesses and therefore they are not normally the ones to be trawling the corridors of this place to gain benefits through the use of lobbyists and the various ways that vested interests can influence public policy. Their businesses are genuinely the engine room of Australia’s economy and its productivity and therefore deserve some good reflection and some good support from ministers and the executive.
I also mention the Fair Work Bill and the fair work process, which came up in question time, with regard to the nationalising of the industrial relations and occupational health and safety systems. I think that is of great significance to regional small business operators if it is done right. It is a quagmire for small business operators to have to work their way through state and federal legal systems, public and private industrial relations systems and occupational health and safety systems and unfair dismissal laws at various levels and industrial relations commissions at various levels. I think it is a significant breakthrough that we have reached a moment in this parliament’s history when we have seen in the last six months a government putting forward a nationalising of laws and an opposition saying they are 99.98 per cent, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, in support of that. This is therefore a significant moment in time. But I put a rider on that by saying that when we get down to the detail of some of this legislation it cannot be at the expense of the small business operators in the regions. I quote the example of the hospitality award and the debate that is going on at the moment about the implications of that award. All the various state awards have been thrown into one document and that is creating huge concerns in regional areas, particularly tourism areas such as the mid-North Coast, where new laws are now coming in that potentially see penalties kick in after seven o’clock every day of the week from Monday to Friday.
That is just not going to work in a regional tourism town. That will see a loss of jobs. It will create the absurd situation where on public holidays, days when everyone wants to go out and enjoy themselves and go to coffee shops and restaurants, the doors will be closed because the penalty rates will be too high. So I again ask the government, the executive and the minister to look at some of the details of these changes. While the overall concept is great and everyone is cheering about finally having a national scheme, if, once we burrow into the detail, it is just an exercise of throwing a whole lot of different state based awards together and hoping for the best, then that is not going to work in the regional small business community’s best interests. I particularly flag the restaurant and catering—the hospitality award—bill that is currently being considered and ask for government to look at it through the eyes of regional restaurants and consider the impacts on them, particularly with regard to penalty rates.
I also put on the record my request for some government consideration of the much spoken about but sadly not acted upon issue of decentralisation. We saw it again in a report delivered in this place last night. An excellent report was brought down by the chair of the infrastructure committee, the member for Ballarat, which considered the question of the impact of the global financial crisis on regional Australia. Recommendation 7 and recommendation 8 basically dragged out the same idea that comes up in every single committee, looking at any topic, when committees head to regional areas—that is, this issue of getting government businesses and government departments into the regions. The word ‘decentralisation’ was not used, but basically the concept was thrown up again. Again, the concept has a great deal of support from regional members on both sides, but it is like pulling teeth to get government departments to recognise the benefits to them in being based in a regional area.
There was an example of it last night: in Victoria a government department went regional and, once it happened, they could not be happier. The workforce is secure, they are happy with their lifestyle and the costs are lower to run a business from a regional location. Once it happens, they realise, ‘My goodness, this is the greatest thing that ever happened.’ But getting it to happen is, as I said, like pulling teeth. So once again I say to the minister in the chair, the minister for small business, and to the executive: look at the whole list of committee reports of the last decade and beyond. Once they start to look in regional locations, the recommendation about decentralisation comes up time and time again. Let us get serious about it. If need be, let us push government departments out the door of Canberra into the regions and we will have better government delivery as a consequence. It is guaranteed.
I also flag the ongoing issue that has been wrapped up in stimulus but was an election commitment from this government. A huge success in the regions that I represent is increases of direct money from the Commonwealth to local government. I know the previous government did it in various roads programs—the Roads to Recovery and the Black Spot programs—and the current government has expanded that into community infrastructure. In regional locations, the councils are in many ways the lifeblood of activity, and so this has been a significant project over the last 12 to 18 months. We have seen 30 to 40 projects in communities with between 50,000 and 100,000 people. That is significant work for the small business community. Once we start heading down the path of coming out of the GFC—we hope—I would like to see this direct financing from the Commonwealth to local government continue and expand further than even where we currently are into a whole range of different projects. The community infrastructure program is an important project that I would hope continues beyond stimulus.
I also mention regional development associations. I am not sure about other regions of Australia, but, after a two-year gap, we have now finally on the mid-North Coast got an RDA up and running. The question of financing is still an open-ended one. While there is some money on the table for administration and small projects, if the RDA process and regional development itself are going to be treated seriously by the Commonwealth, then we need to see more money going into the RDA network. You can argue the rights and wrongs of what happened with the area consultative committee money and Auditor-General reports under the previous government—
—A disgrace!
—The member for New England was caught up very deeply in that. I would hate, to use a cliche, for the baby to be thrown out with the bathwater; I would hate the government to pull money out of that process because the process was distorted by previous governments. If the process of the RDAs is one that the government supports and endorses—bringing the state and federal regional development arms together is eminently sensible—then let us fund it appropriately. Let us get some good money into there, and let us see the small business communities of regional Australia get behind this exercise. Let us let the engine room do its job and let regional small businesses run this country the way they have previously. I would hope the government supports the comments I have made and that we do get some support, particularly, as I said at the start, on the small business tax break.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Small Business</title>,Matters of Public Importance,6,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I am very happy to award the member for Lyne a six.
—You said nine!
—All right, we can negotiate. We will go for a nine. I did not agree with everything he said—
 (Hon. BC Scott)—The minister will not use his prop!
—but I will deduct one out of 10 for the relatively minor things with which I disagreed. I record that they are very harsh judges over there, so even a six would be a distinction by the tough standards that they have applied to me in the past.
I do welcome very much the contribution and initiative shown by the member for Lyne in raising this matter of public importance. Small business truly is a very important matter for debate. I endorse the comments by the member for Lyne about the fiscal stimulus. It does involve more than 70 per cent in spending on infrastructure. The member for Lyne probably did not have time to fit this in, but I refer to one of his media releases earlier this year entitled ‘Oakeshott welcomes over $15 million in primary school infrastructure funding’. So the member for Lyne has never been backward in coming forward in acknowledging the value to his local community of the stimulus package and, in particular, the infrastructure component. He goes on to say:
Also, in this current economic climate it is a great opportunity for local contractors, trades people and suppliers to put their hands up for the work, so they need to register their interest with the NSW Department of Education and Training who will forward their details …
That shows a very active local member taking the initiative to ensure that the local businesses and tradies in his area are aware of the opportunities, and I commend him for doing that.
The short story is that the government has recognised in its two years of government—two years today—the importance of supporting small business in regional Australia and, more broadly, around Australia. Of course, the global financial crisis and the meltdown associated with that could not have been fully anticipated before the election of this government. But when it did arrive we acted early. We were really conscious of ensuring that the benefits of that stimulus spending were spread fairly around Australia. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has been really conscious in ensuring that regional communities do benefit because often, as the member for Lyne will attest, when there is an economic downturn it is our regions that really feel the brunt of it. If it is just an across-the-board policy that is not attuned to the needs of regional Australia, then our small businesses, our tradies and our contractors in those areas will suffer. I come from a small country town in north-west New South Wales called Baradine near Coonabarabran, just on the edge of the Warrumbungles. My father lost his job during a drought in timber quotas in 1970, and that is why I ended up in Sydney and, to cut a very long story short, how I ended up in parliament. It is just another example of how vulnerable regional communities are to an economic downturn. We have always been conscious of that.
I thank the member for Lyne for his support, too, of the small business tax break. It has actually received quite a lot of criticism from the coalition. The last time we had a debate on a matter of public importance it was initiated by the member for Moncrieff. I think he had to do that because he just cannot get a question up. It has been 543 days today since I last had a question from him. In that speech he announced a tax effective investment scheme. The shadow minister for small business said:
From the outset I questioned the wisdom of this policy … we really questioned how many of those 2.4 million small businesses Labor’s policy would actually assist. The answer, as has been played out in the various surveys, is not many at all—the reason being that Labor’s policy requires a small business to have a dollar in order to spend it.
He went on to say:
… the only meaningful expenditure from the small business sector has been on vehicles. So it has hardly been the great economic boost that the Treasurer and the small business minister claim it to be—in fact, it has largely been a flop.
So there is a contrast: the member for Lyne supporting the small business tax break and the coalition describing it as a flop. It is really interesting and timely to report on an MYOB survey that has been released today which indicates that 77 per cent of all business owners report awareness of the tax break and that 71 per cent have taken action or may take action in the future. If six out of 10 is a good number, 71 out of 100 is a beauty. We have the shadow small business minister saying that they are really not going to take it up; only very few have taken it up. Well, 71 per cent is a large number, and the CEO of MYOB says this:
Overall, this latest MYOB Business Monitor finds business improving across Australia, and a good deal more confidence than six months ago. 
He also says:
Support for the Federal Government may have also been boosted by the recent Business Tax Break, which over half … of business owners surveyed say has been or could be helpful to their business.
As I said, it is 71 per cent. So the point there is not really a political point. It is good that the small business community appreciates what the Rudd government is doing, but it is far more important that it is taking advantage of this tax break, and I certainly welcome the support of the member for Lyne.
Figures out yesterday on motor vehicle sales show an increase of 3.7 per cent in October—3.3 per cent higher than a year ago. Market commentary on those figures from the National Australia Bank says:
These data point to businesses on another buying spree into the end of the calendar year when the 50 per cent investment allowance runs out.
And:
… indications that private buyers are stepping into showrooms over recent months to buy attractively priced vehicles as signs of labour market stabilisation accumulates.
What they are saying there is that the showrooms around Australia are doing very well, and I know from my experience in country towns and regional centres that there are always motor vehicle showrooms. They are small businesses. They benefit from the tax break. They have families. They employ people. They should not be derided by the shadow small business minister saying, ‘All this has just involved a few people buying a few cars.’ People buying cars is important. The member for Holt, who is at the table, would attest to that, because in his local area there are car component manufacturers. It is really important in another part of Australia—most particularly, outer urban Victoria, where there are a lot of car component manufacturers. So I would not be criticising or deriding an increase in car sales and activity.
In relation to direct support and advice for small business, I can advise the member for Lyne that we were really conscious of this before the election—so much so that we committed to funding 36 business enterprise centres around Australia. There were around 108 at the time—and we dearly would have loved to have funded all 108. These business enterprise centres are very capable in delivering one-stop shop advisory services. I would like to be able to advise the member for Lyne that there is one in his electorate; but that is not the case, so I will not pretend otherwise. The 36 business enterprise centres that are being funded are spread right around Australia and they are substantially concentrated in rural and regional Australia. In addition, the 34 pre-existing advisory services are being funded through an initiative announced by the Prime Minister at a small business summit in Brisbane in October last year. I know that these are not directly in the member for Lyne’s electorate, but I will just refer to the Clarence Business Enterprise Advisory Service in Grafton and the Enterprise Training Company in Coffs Harbour. It is better than nothing, but, again, we would have liked to have funded more centres.
I think the right way to handle this matter of public importance is by responding to the points the member for Lyne has raised. I am a big fan of decentralisation. I suppose that falls easily from the tongue—and you might say, ‘Well, what are you doing about it?’—but, moving beyond the school modernisation program, much of the infrastructure investment is in rural and regional Australia. In 2006 I wrote a book, Vital Signs, Vibrant Society, which sets out a plan for providing more infrastructure and services in regional Australia. My view is that people will come to regional Australia if the costs are low, the infrastructure is provided and they can move fairly readily back to the cities to see relatives and so on. That would help make regional Australia that much more attractive. I would recommend it to the member for Lyne. It is not rocket science, but it is an endorsement of the sorts of policies that he is talking about.
In terms of direct funding for local government, I think the point the member for Lyne made is that it is effective. But you need to take some care about it. It is not just about giving money unconditionally. Again, this government has been quite systematic in doing that—through the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. We have had two major local government soirees, big meetings, here in Canberra, and they have been very well received and well attended. So, again, we are in the groove with the member for Lyne there. Similarly with regional development authorities and so on, it is a model that the Minister for Trade was very keen on when he was the shadow minister for industry and regional development.
In respect of award modernisation, I would point out that 4,000 different awards and instruments are being collapsed into just 121. This is a major microeconomic reform that will be of benefit to small businesses. Of course there are some grumbles about some of the details. I know that Restaurant and Catering Australia, through John Hart, have made strong representations. They were sufficiently persuasive that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations asked for a new consideration of the award by Fair Work Australia. So we are receptive to legitimate concerns. But let us not lose sight of the overall magnitude of this reform. Collapsing 4,000 awards and other instruments into 121 awards is a mammoth task. It is something that previous governments have talked about. The complexity of the award system has been the subject of complaint by the previous government and by business organisations around Australia. This task is now nearing its end. There is a five-year transition period to address some of the issues that were raised by the member for Lyne. But I put it to this chamber that this is a major reform of large net benefit to small business.
I want to go on to the whole area of a single, national industrial relations system. Just think of the absurdity of incorporated businesses being in the national industrial relations system—which they are now—while unincorporated businesses are caught in the state systems. That is where we are at the moment. The former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was a very big supporter of a national system. He spoke glowingly of the pressing need for reform in this area. Speaking at the Sydney Institute in 2005, he said:
… six different industrial relations systems is an anachronism for a nation of 20 million people in a region that will be the world’s economic centre of gravity in the 21st century. It is time they recognised that a single system of workplace laws is in the national interest.
Well, we do—but now the coalition do not; now the coalition are opposing it. I think that is a tragedy because, as the minister mentioned during question time, this could be a once-in-a-generation opportunity because those referrals would have to be done a second time. So we really are saying to the coalition: stop being opportunistic and get in there because small businesses will benefit from being in a single system, as the member for Lyne so eloquently explained. As small businesses grow from being a partnership or a sole trader to being a company, they would have to shift out of the system that they have been in, which would just be ridiculous.
I thank the member for Lyne for his initiative and for the quality of his debate. It was definitely a six, probably a six-plus, and going all the way up to a nine. It was a very elegant contribution indeed. Thank you.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Small Business</title>,Matters of Public Importance,6,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2009-11-24,"—I thank the minister for his comments in relation to some of the issues raised by the member for Lyne. And I would ask him to return my documentation at some stage; otherwise, I will have to rate him fairly low!

Dr Emerson interjecting—
—The minister will not provoke the member for New England!

Dr Emerson interjecting—
—No—the member for New England has the call. The minister will sit there in silence.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. It becomes very difficult sometimes, as you are probably aware. I thank the member for Lyne for this matter of public importance. I pick up on a theme that has been reflected through the two speakers, particularly in relation to decentralisation. I listened with interest to the minister’s comments. I have been in public life since 1991, with a period of time in the state parliament until 2001 and here, obviously, since then. There have been a lot of words in terms of decentralisation over those years and not a lot of action. In fact, one of the reasons for standing for the federal arena was the concerns I had directly in relation to competition policy and the way in which it impacted on smaller communities and smaller businesses. Two people on both sides of the political fence have stood out in a sense. The minister for small business mentioned one of them, the member for Hotham. I can remember in the early nineties that the member for Hotham—and I believed this at the time—was a real champion in terms of regional development processes and decentralisation. The other, who some members in this chamber may not know, was the Leader of the Liberal Party at one stage in New South Wales, Peter Collins. He had not dissimilar ideas about how you could actually drive the processes of decentralisation and the policy initiatives you could put in place to encourage people to go to the country and set up businesses.
Two very distinct things are happening at the moment and they are both quite current within this parliament. One is the population debate, which is locked in with some of the climate change issues and water issues, and where people will live. The other is the broader debate about the national broadband rollout. Those two things combined, in my view, really need to be explored under the one policy umbrella. If we are serious about encouraging decentralisation, encouraging small business to develop in country areas and growing our population in country areas, in areas where water and other issues are not a problem, we have to get serious about rolling out the National Broadband Network at a level where it is equitable to all people across the nation. It is the one thing, if it is done correctly, that negates distance as a disadvantage by being a country resident. It changes the playing field. Competition policy and other things have centralised the playing field. Decentralisation rolls off the tongue, as the minister said, but the policy mix that we have been focusing on for the last two decades has been a centralist policy mix, where you develop—and some people have heard me say this before—a feedlot mentality, where the cheapest way to provide the highest number of services to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible cost is to put them in a feedlot.
The National Broadband Network—and this is why I have been very supportive of what Senator Conroy is attempting to do—can break that nexus. When I say ‘can’, that does not mean it will—it can. If we can get the system right so that people who live in the country—or irrespective of where they live—share a common denominator in terms of the rollout of broadband services. Particularly given the population debate that is happening at the moment, we have to start to put some of those things into a policy mix rather than all the different silos we have, where it is a good idea to have this and a good idea to have that and where there is no real focus on what that means in terms of population growth, urban development, country towns, water supply and a whole range of related issues—but they are unrelated issues because of the way they are dealt with by the political process.
There are a few things that I would like to mention. I suggest to the minister for small business: other than the bankers, the people who really know what is going on in the country are the accountants. I would encourage you to talk to the Institute of Chartered Accountants and others, who really know the bottom line in terms of numbers, to find out the sorts of things that need to be encouraged to make sure that decentralisation does occur on some issues. I agree with the member for Lyne when he talked about local government and some of the local government drivers that are out there that are encouraging growth in some of those areas.
I also support the member for Lyne’s call for an extension to the investment allowance. I was in farming—and I still do a bit of farming—when Malcolm Fraser brought out the investment allowance. In hindsight, I do not think that was a good thing to have done because it drove up the price of machinery. We were buying equipment at different times, replacing harvesters and things, and a lot of people were doing the same, which was good for small business, but it drove up the price of the item that we were purchasing. Deputy Speaker Scott, you may remember that particular time. I think this is a different circumstance. Normally I would argue against the investment allowance, as it stood at that particular time, but this is a different circumstance in the economics of the nation. I think it is working. There are a lot of people who are taking advantage of it. We have heard suggestions that you have to be paying tax to take advantage of it, and obviously that is the case, but it flows through the community. If someone buys a tractor, the person who sells the tractor gets the benefit, as does the person who repairs the tractor. A whole chain of events occurs. In terms of stimulating small business and business activity, in this case the investment allowance has been a quite successful venture. I encourage the government to look closely at furthering it.
An unrelated matter, but something that I would say to the two gentlemen at that table, is that, whilst we are reviewing taxation and incentives, can someone do something about the baby bonus? Surely we can spend that money in a better way than the unfettered way it has been spent, in terms of the encouragement of various activities that the man who has now left the building, Peter Costello, set up to encourage. Surely there has to be a better way of helping families and children than to perpetuate the ridiculous arrangement of paying young people and others $5,000 to have more babies.
In conclusion, I reiterate: talk to the Institute of Chartered Accountants; talk to people who actually understand the mathematics of what is going on in regional and country areas of Australia; make sure that the broadband rollout occurs in a way in which it will actually deliver equity of services. The minister spoke about tradies, et cetera. Minister, you should look very closely at what is happening to TAFE. TAFE is in all our towns. It provides the skills in a lot of our communities. Look closely at what is happening—and this is a continuation of the previous government—and at modelling in terms of competition for certain aspects of the training. In theory that is a good thing. In practice, what it could mean is that a lot of the capacity to train young people in a lot of country towns where TAFE has existed in the past may well be negated by the cherry picking that occurs from time to time with the private sector. I am not saying do not have both, but be careful that we do not, over time, wipe out a service delivery and then have nothing to replace it because it has moved on to other taller cherry trees to pick.
In conclusion, I urge the minister and the government to revisit the theme that occurs from time to time of zonal taxation, and the minister himself would be aware of that. There are drivers of tax policy—the Henry review is coming up—and there are a number of initiatives that that review should look at if we are serious about driving some of the changes needed in country policy.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I thank the member for Lyne for proposing this matter of public importance. There are nearly four million Australians engaged and employed in small business, and there are a further 1.2 million non-employing small businesses. About 1.9 million Australians are engaged in small business operations—and I was one of them. At 26 years of age I took a punt and decided to be involved in small business. I was in a legal practice which grew into a very large operation over many years, and I pay tribute to my various partners over the years. But it was a punt. Every day in small business you take a risk—every single day. You do not get any protections; you do not get sick pay; you do not get long service leave or annual leave or penalty rates. You get nothing. Instead, in many ways, you are stuck with red tape and bureaucracy that governments of both persuasions have historically imposed upon small business.
This government recognises the challenges and difficulties of small business, particularly in rural and regional Australia. In my electorate of Blair, which is an electorate of about 5,300 square kilometres, moving up to 6,400 with the redistribution, I am currently servicing about 70 per cent of the city of Ipswich, just about all of the Fassifern Valley, the Lockyer Valley and now the Somerset region. It is a large area. I talk to the farmers and I talk to the small business operators in those areas and I know the challenges.
In my consideration and belief, small business has been advantaged by previous Labor governments. The Whitlam government brought in the Trade Practices Act to give small business a chance to compete against big business. The Trade Practices Act in the 1970s was a very, very important legislative reform. I was involved in cases in my legal practice that saw small business operators advantage themselves through that legislation to help them to enjoy a degree of equality and equalise the power imbalance. The reduction of tariffs, I think, was an important opening-up of the economy. The Hawke and Keating governments floated the dollar, opened up the economy to allow it to become a market-driven economy, allowed the entry of foreign banks into this country, brought in in a really considered way—in consultation with the trade union movement—enterprise bargaining, and brought in for the first time a great national treasure and initiative which was the superannuation scheme which so many Australians benefit from.
Small business is the backbone of our economy. Sadly, those opposite mouth the words that they are on the side of free enterprise—but they are not. The truth is that they are forever on the side of big business, forever on the side of oligopoly, and always have supported high tariff walls of protection which result in high prices for consumers. Open, competitive markets and removing barriers improve the economy and make it fitter and more competitive, and that helps small business. That allows small business to invest. It gives us a chance. The coalition’s idea to help small business was to put upon them the sclerotic burden and rigidity of Work Choices, and of course they imposed the GST on them.
The truth is that we are engaged in a nation-building enterprise. My area has been neglected for many, many years. Indeed, the mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale, often said that the last real, serious investment—until this Rudd government came to power—was in fact the Ipswich Civic Centre in Whitlam’s day. Now we see a massive amount of money injected into the local economy, and that is because of the Nation Building and economic stimulus strategy of the Rudd government—876 projects in the federal electorate of Blair, $203 million, 313 projects in 85 schools. Lest you think that that is just academic, let me tell you what Mal Jacobsen of Paynter Dixon said to me when they were opening up Cabanda Link in Rosewood, which is an aged-care facility which his company was working on, and they were also involved in the Rosewood State Primary School BER funding initiative. He sent me an email indicating that 625 people had jobs by virtue of those two projects—money from this government going into the small community of Rosewood in the rural parts of the city of Ipswich. That is the kind of thing that will help those small business operators in Johns Street, the main street of Rosewood.
We are also seeing thousands of jobs created by the most important infrastructure project in South-East Queensland, in my view, and that is the Ipswich Motorway upgrade. There are 4,000 jobs being created. It is the most important road that leads west of Brisbane. It links into the Warrego Highway, which the member for Maranoa talks about all the time, and the Brisbane Valley Highway, which leads north-west. The truth is that this initiative will make a huge difference to small businesses—the farmers in the Lockyer Valley, the Fassifern Valley and the Somerset region. How can they get their produce to Brisbane on a road that is clogged? They cannot. They have often told me that their produce has decayed because they could not get it there on time. They find that difficult. They cannot get their employees to business appointments in Brisbane because of the infrastructure bottlenecks that were created by the Howard government, with their inertia, inaction and idleness in failing to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway. It is not just the Ipswich Motorway; it is Redbank Plains Road, the Warrego Highway and the Cunningham Highway—important road infrastructure in South-East Queensland—helping small business operators in towns like Kalbar, Boonah, Laidley, Gatton, Esk and Fernvale. This is what government can do to help small business in rural and regional Queensland.
Helping small business can be done in a number of ways; for example, through the $2 million we are giving to Bremer TAFE in Ipswich—a great initiative—and the $10 million from the Better Regions Program to help revitalise the city of Ipswich. Those things are very important—real assistance. I acknowledge also the member for Rankin. The Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy is here today. I remembered vividly his coming to the electorate of Blair in the last federal election campaign to announce that we would be funding the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre. That centre is servicing not just Ipswich; it is part of a $46 million project servicing all those rural areas that I talked about. It involves mentoring and giving advice. It is a one-stop centre, giving assistance, running seminars and helping all those types of operators in those rural areas outside Brisbane and Ipswich. I have spoken to many business operators and people involved in chambers of commerce in those areas, and they warmly acknowledge and applaud the government’s initiative to help small business in their area. Tony Axford, the manager of the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre, has told me how important he has felt and how warmly he has been received by so many people when he has been running seminars in that area. That is a $1.2 million initiative across many years.
The member for Lyne was talking about Regional Development Australia committees. We have appointed one in the federal electorate of Blair and across Oxley, Forde and Dickson. It is the Ipswich and West Moreton Regional Development Australia committee, looking at big infrastructure projects, what we can do about regional hospitals and what we can do to help small business. We have the Hon. Dr David Hamill as the chair of our local RDA committee. We have Councillor Kathy Benstead from the Scenic Rim area, a great community champion in that area, as the deputy chair, and we have some great people from the rural parts, as well as Ipswich, involved in that project.
I know that the farmers and the small business operators in those rural communities are looking forward to the National Broadband Network being created. That is an important infrastructure project for regional Australia. It is particularly important in terms of e-health. It is important for rural hospitals in places like Boonah, Esk, Laidley and Gatton—not just Ipswich but the rural areas outside it. Making broadband fast and affordable is critical. It will also make us globally competitive. It will help farmers in those rural areas. It will make sure that people who live in Kalbar will have the same rights to operate as the people who live in Melbourne; the people who live in Boonah the same as Brisbane; the people who live in Laidley the same as Adelaide. It is helping small business operators and farming communities, and I warmly commend that program.
I thank the member for Lyne for bringing forward this matter of public importance. It is terrific that he has raised this issue. It is very important for all our areas. (Time expired)

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2009-11-24,"—The previous speaker spoke about the free market policies being wonderful for us. Honestly, I do not know how these people can come in and make such stupid statements! In the motor car industry, we had 72 per cent of the market before Keating started on this stupidity, which was completed by—

Mr Neumann interjecting—
—Don’t claim the credit for it, because you must share the credit for it with Costello. You must share the blame. From 72 per cent, we dropped down to 14 per cent. Hardly any motor cars are produced in Australia now—no stoves, no fridges, no anything. And you are telling us it is a good thing. You say it is good for the consumers. Do you know what the price of a car was in 1984? Do you know what it is today? I will tell you. It is nearly 70 per cent higher in real terms. There is the outcome for your consumers.
I am very interested in the outcome for the consumers and for small businesses—because that is what our farmers are—after the deregulatory policies that came in. For a litre of milk, the farmer and the factory get 65c and the retailer gets $2. That is a Coles docket. This is after deregulation. Was it good in the field of sugar, something we use every day, or every second day, of our lives? The farmer and the miller get 39c and the retailer gets $1.35. Is this a good outcome for the consumers? With potatoes, the farmer gets 62c and the retailer gets $2.46. Is that a good outcome? These are all small business men, these farmers. With eggs, the farmer gets $1.40 and the retailer gets $4.85. That is a 230 per cent mark-up. The last speaker said this was wonderful for us.
Pre deregulation, three of those were on a fairness tribunal, the same as the arbitration commission. When we had our own arbitration commission, there was only an 80 per cent mark-up. The farmers benefited and the consumers benefited. Under this disastrous free market regime, the big sharks eat the little fishes. That is the outcome. That is the outcome for Holden motor cars and that is the outcome for food in Australia.
I very strongly back the member for Lyne in saying that the small business tax breaks and the investment allowance should stay. They are absolutely, dramatically important for people. In Queensland, Woolworths and Coles have run amok. Two publicans in my hometown of Cloncurry said to me, ‘If you want to close down a town, bring Woolworths and Coles to it.’ What is the state government doing about this? The federal government has done nothing to restrain Woolworths and Coles. The last federal government was in power for 13 years, and its members get up in this place and have the hypocrisy to talk about being for small business. You smashed small business in your 13 years of government. In 1991 Coles and Woolworths had 50.5 per cent of the marketplace—that is all they had. After you had completed your work, Woolworths and Coles had 76.7 per cent in 2002. According to their own figures, they now have 85 per cent of the market—and you congratulate yourselves on that.
I will tell you what happened on the ground in my hometown of Cloncurry. We owned a row of shops in the town. There were four businesses, with our business making that five businesses located in these shops. Where those five businesses used to stand, only one business stands now. That is all that is left. The two publicans said, ‘If you want to close down a town, bring Woolworths and Coles to it.’ We brought in Woolworths and they closed everything in the town. There is not a single business left in the town. I like to walk in the streets of small country towns when I am campaigning, and in Cloncurry there are no doors to businesses for me to knock on. They have all gone—service stations, butchers shops. Everything has gone. That is what happens to a town.
Woolworths and Coles are now applying for 24-hour trading at Mission Beach and Mount Isa and half the other towns in Queensland. It is not enough for them to have 85 per cent of the marketplace. They want everything. There is no limit to their greed. Is there any limitation placed on them by this House? It is a disgrace. In a so-called inquiry by this place, the nearest country in the world had 22 per cent share of the marketplace. In Australia, Woolworths and Coles hold 85 per cent, and they are about to be given 24-hour trading in places like Mount Isa and Mission Beach. My son is on the council in Mount Isa. When he was rung up about this situation, he said, ‘If you want two doors left to walk through in Mount Isa then agree to 24-hour trading because that will be all that is left in a town of 26,000 people. The only businesses that will be left there will be Woolworths and Coles.’ (Time expired)

"Cheeseman, Darren, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I rise today to speak about the importance of small business in regional and rural Australia. Small businesses and independent contractors are the backbone of a number of our rural communities and regional centres, including my own region of Corangamite. Small businesses are today the powerhouse of our region, with Corangamite now having more small businesses than the neighbouring seat of Corio, which takes in the vast bulk of the City of Geelong. It is no coincidence that small business has grown in our region and the strength of our economy has grown with their dominance. Today, we have one of the best performing regions in Australia.
Even in normal economic conditions, small business enterprises need to work very hard to achieve commercial success. Each small business takes a risk in going out on their own—especially those who are self-employed take that risk. In the current economic climate, the difficulty in maintaining a small business has been dramatically exacerbated. This government’s sound economic management has Australia leading the world out of the global financial crisis—and that has been a great outcome for small business.
With the Rudd government’s decisive economic policies, the Australian economy is now the envy of the world. We are the first developed economy to emerge from the global financial crisis. Much of this resilience in the Australian economy has been because of the strength of the small business sector. However, we as a government are not going to rest on our laurels. We still have a long way to go. The rest of the world is still caught in the worst economic depression since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Nearly every major world economy is still in recession.
The Rudd government took decisive and early action to protect the economy for small businesses and independent contractors. The government’s economic stimulus packages were designed to assist small business; they were squarely in our mind. Local small business, especially retailers, have benefited from the cash stimulus payments to families, the stimulus spending on materials for school building projects and the other public infrastructure projects. Tradespeople, independent contractors and other small business people are the beneficiaries of 70 per cent of the stimulus package that was spent on infrastructure, including the biggest school modernisation program in the nation’s history.
Local economies have also benefited from the housing grants, bringing new home buyers to our regions. The government understands that cash flow is clearly very important for small business. We are assisting in that regard with pay-as-you-go instalments for small business through 2009-10. To support small businesses this summer, the Rudd government is also providing $100 million in the form of the Apprentice Kickstart program. The Apprentice Kickstart program is a part of the government’s economic stimulus package and is designed to support up to 21,000 young Australians entering traditional trades. Between 1 December 2009 and 28 February 2010, the Australian government will provide a $3,350 Apprentice Kickstart Bonus to employers, small businesses, who take on young persons aged 19 years and under into a traditional trade—(Time expired)

"Washer, Dr Mal (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)",N/A,2009-11-24,"—The Speaker’s attention has been drawn to the proposed Senate amendments (1) and (10). On behalf of the Speaker, I inform the House of the constitutional questions raised by the amendments. As I understand it, advice has been provided that the amendments, if enacted, would have the effect of increasing amounts that would be payable under a standing appropriation in the Health Insurance Act 1973 and would be construed as appropriating money.
There is doubt that the Senate may proceed in these circumstances by way of amendment because of section 53 of the Constitution. Among other things, this section prohibits the Senate from amending any bill so as to increase any proposed change or burden on the people. The view has been taken that, where revenue or moneys are to be appropriated in these circumstances, section 56 of the Constitution requires that the proposed appropriation must be recommended by a passage from the Governor-General. The House will need to consider the way in which it should proceed to deal with matters raised in the Senate amendments. If the House wishes to entertain the proposal reflected in the amendments, it may choose to proceed by alternative means.
Ordered that the amendments be considered immediately.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I would like to indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments (2) through to (9) be agreed to and that amendments (1) and (10) be disagreed to. I suggest, therefore, that it might suit the convenience of the House first to consider amendments (2) through to (9) and, when those amendments have been dealt with, to consider amendments (1) and (10). Accordingly, I move:
That Senate amendments (2) to (9) be agreed to.
I am going to speak briefly on these amendments as they have been agreed to between the government and the opposition, also with the work of the minor parties. The reason I want to speak briefly to them, however, is that the bill which is being amended is a compliance bill. It is an important part of the government’s determination to protect the integrity of Medicare, which the public benefit from and, as people in this House would know, had an expenditure of $14 billion in the 2008-09 financial year. These measures in the compliance bill intend to enhance Medicare Australia’s program. I will not go through all of the details of the way that Medicare Australia will be given power to require the production of documents, et cetera, where there have been concerns about claims made to Medicare but I want to flag that amendments (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) deal with that substantive matter.
We have had productive discussions with the opposition. As a result, the government is prepared to accept these eight amendments. They deal with a tightening of the notification process. They have been issues raised by professional groups about their involvement in the process. It allows me to specify that Medicare Australia can consult with particular professional organisations in dealing with the compliance matters. Given that we have a different view on the remaining two amendments, which I will speak to in a moment, it is worth the House noting that these are substantial changes in a complex area, making sure that we are protecting the integrity of a significant amount of taxpayers’ money, ensuring that for the small number of medical professionals and other health professionals who might do the wrong thing, there is a mechanism for Medicare to be able to investigate those matters. So it is an important initiative which the government regards as one that is necessary to protect the integrity of Medicare. Therefore, we were quite happy to work with professional groups and with the opposition.
I would like to thank Minister Bowen, Minister for Human Services, who had the carriage of the implementation issues, for the work he has done. He is overseas at the moment and has asked me to pursue this matter. So I would like to speak in support of the bill and to thank all those who have been involved in dealing with what is a technical area and putting forward suggestions which the government thinks will enhance the process.",REPS,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,8,1
"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2009-11-24,"—I would like to thank the government for accepting our amendments to make this bill more effective, while ensuring patients’ privacy. It is important to listen to stakeholders and that is exactly what the opposition have done. In relation to this particular issue, we have always put patients first and we did in our consideration of these amendments as well. We thank the government for accepting our amendments and for the way in which negotiations were conducted.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I move:
That Senate amendments (1) and (10) be disagreed to.
The reasons the government are disagreeing to these amendments are several. One has already been referred to in the brief statement that was made by you, Mr Deputy Speaker Washer, on behalf of the Speaker—that there is a serious issue about the constitutionality of these amendments being moved in the Senate. We have, of course, been on this merry-go-round before. The amendments were moved in a different way in the Senate and we received advice that it was not constitutional. We have already flagged that before. I said in the chamber previously that I was happy to provide that advice. We then received information that governments—ours and previous governments—have always had longstanding advice not to release the actual advice. I have released a minute from the department which details the advice. I have also released and presented to the Senate both that minute and some general advice about the presentation and introduction of items in the Senate that do have financial consequences. So we are having a little bit of a groundhog day again because the opposition are determined to oppose the reduction in the rebate payable for cataract surgery.
We disagree strongly with the opposition’s view on that matter. Nevertheless, if the opposition wants to continue to take that approach on those particular regulations, it is clearly a political stunt. It would be a stunt to try to use any other health bill that might be before the parliament at any time in the future to try to move amendments that are completely unrelated to the substance of that bill. We engaged with the opposition in good faith to negotiate amendments that related to this bill. I think the public would be pleased that the parliament could work in a way to change and improve legislation that is being debated. To use this as an opportunity to pursue another argument totally unrelated to the matter detailed in this bill in a way that is unconstitutional really shows some odd obsession of the opposition with this issue. Senators have given notice that they intend to seek to disallow the measure in the Senate in the coming days. Of course, we will oppose that, but using this sort of legislation—and potentially derailing the introduction of this important compliance measure while we have a fight and argument over something totally unrelated to the bill before us—does not do the opposition or the parliament any credit.
We feel very strongly that it is important for us to be able to, in a bill like the one that is before the parliament now, make sure we protect the integrity of the system. Of course, on many separate occasions, we will be before this House seeking to extend Medicare rebates, pay them for new items and introduce them for new technologies and we will want to be able to reduce the rate that is payable for a Medicare rebate if there are circumstances that show that it is being paid at a rate that is no longer appropriate. If we do not do that, the sustainability of the Medicare system long term will be under threat. The ability of the current government or of governments of the future to fund new initiatives if we can never reap the savings of the benefits of technology, advances in research or breakthroughs et cetera will be hampered. We will have a financial situation and a financial burden in the health system that will not be manageable. As someone who in the previous government held a position of some responsibility for financial matters, I would have thought that the member for Dickson would have absolutely understood this.
I think it was put very well by Dr Rob Walters, as reported in the Canberra Times. Dr Walters is a GP. It is very difficult for people in the medical profession to speak out. They are not interested in attacking each other or in pointing the finger about the sorts of incomes that people earn, but he made this very clear and important point. He said:
The real issue here is the sustainability of public funds—in other words, the Medicare pie … When technology catches up and makes the procedure, as in this case, easier then you move the lines in the pie so funds are available for other health services.
I think that sums up the position that the government take. It is quite clear that we do not support the opposition’s amendments. I think it is obvious that the opposition is this week trying to divert attention onto every possible issue other than the CPRS. That was just another stunt in the Senate. They wasted several hours that could have been used for a better purpose.",REPS,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,8,1
"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2009-11-24,"—The Senate’s amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009 were an opportunity for the government to see common sense, to admit that its cuts to Medicare rebates for cataract surgery were ill-conceived, ill-considered, short-sighted and punitive to patients, in particular to older Australians. This is now the second opportunity the coalition and crossbench senators have given this government and in particular this minister to reconsider and to restore rebates to their previous levels for what is critically important surgery to many Australians. The Minister for Health and Ageing and the government knew their plans to slash these rebates by 50 per cent were not acceptable to the Senate. They knew for months. Indeed, they have known since 8 September, when the coalition and Senators Xenophon and Fielding announced publicly that they would vote to disallow such drastic cuts to these Medicare rebates. The minister’s response was to do nothing for weeks. Then she started a scare campaign, a deliberate attempt to frighten patients, to say that there would be no rebate at all if the Senate disallowed her changes. That was a claim that directly contradicted evidence given by a senior staff member of her department in Senate estimates hearings. The staff member said that, if the Senate disallowed the changes, rebates would revert back to their old levels. So confusion reigned at the highest levels in the minister’s office and among her senior departmental staff, where there were differing opinions.
The coalition took a responsible course to ensure that there was no confusion and ensure that rebates would be restored. We initiated a private member’s bill that would restore any disallowed rebates to previous levels. We gave the government a simple way out of the mess it had created with its bloody-minded determination to force people to pay hundreds of dollars more for cataract treatment. What was the government’s response? It refused to debate the bill. The minister came into the House to claim that she had legal advice that the bill was unconstitutional. The minister said that she was happy to provide that advice and to this day has refused to make public her so-called legal advice. The coalition has advice from the Clerk of the Senate that directly refutes the minister’s assertion. The Clerk of the Senate said the Health Insurance Amendment (Revival of Table Items) Bill 2009—and, as such, these amendments—was perfectly legitimate and that it was in no way unconstitutional. Further, independent legal advice given to the AMA supported that view. Both of those views are on the public record, while the minister’s so-called legal advice is not.
When the Senate refused to allow the government to go ahead with its savage cuts to the rebates and disallowed them, the minister decided she would ignore the will of the majority of senators. She then introduced a new rebate that amounted to a 46 per cent cut to the rebates rather than the 50 per cent reduction outlined in the government’s budget. So, instead of facing extra costs of just over $300, older patients in particular but patients in general in need of cataract surgery were to be just under $300 worse off. That is where things remain today. Australians needing cataract surgery are having to pay $300 or more for treatment than they did just a month ago. Who are these Australians? As I say, they are mostly senior citizens—pensioners, the people who can least afford to pay more for a treatment that is incredibly beneficial to them and allows them to maintain an independent lifestyle. They are cancelling appointments. They are learning that the alternative is to have the surgery carried out in a public hospital and they are learning that they will wait months and months for treatment.
That is what this government has done. It is punishing patients. Its reason for the halving of rebates is that technology has made treatment ‘quicker, easier and cheaper’, in its words. It argues that greedy doctors are being paid too much. But what does it do in the end? It does not punish the doctors; it punishes the patients. It makes them pay more—and all of this at the same time that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is declaring that in his portfolio there will be an increase in the rebate payable for cataract surgery for veterans in need of that surgery. It is completely at odds with the advice that the health minister is providing as part of this debate.
Tomorrow, again, the Senate will tell the government that it is unacceptable. Tomorrow the Senate will disallow the government’s hard-hearted reductions of Medicare rebates to patients. Today the government again is being given the opportunity to reverse its course and restore the rebates to the levels of a month ago. The amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009 moved by the coalition and Independent senators Xenophon and Fielding will ensure that Medicare rebates for cataract surgery revert to the higher level. (Extension of time granted)

These amendments have the same effect as the Health Insurance Amendment (Revival of Table Items) Bill 2009. Specifically, they seek to ensure, as did the private member’s bill, that the disallowance process is workable in relation to the General Medical Services Table. The government can end the pain and anxiety it is causing for thousands of senior Australians by agreeing to these amendments. If it refuses, the impacts of its ill thought through measures are on its head. It will stand condemned for its intransigence on this matter and the thousands and thousands of people—in particular, the older Australians—who need cataract surgery will not forget the government’s attitude to them.
The coalition along with the Independent senators will be insisting on this amendment in the Senate. We put the government on notice. They have had plenty of time to sort this mess out. They have refused to negotiate in good faith with the ophthalmologists to try to deliver a better outcome to patients. I am concerned that the government have not been able to put forward any advice in relation to supporting the minister’s advice that these operations are taking much shorter periods of time. There is no evidence the minister has been able to put on the table to back up those claims. This is a perfectly legitimate way for the opposition to proceed in relation to these matters. We are going to hold the government to account, because this is a very serious outcome for older Australians in particular but for those patients who need cataract surgery in general.
I seek leave to table advice from Harry Evans, Clerk of the Senate, which confirms the view that this is a constitutional course of action; and also the advice that has been provided to me that had been provided by Blake Dawson—again confirming the claims made by the opposition in relation to the constitutionality of the action that we have taken.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I will speak briefly on some of the additional matters that the shadow minister has raised, because I know that it is to the House’s convenience for us not to debate these at length, given that I think we are all aware that there will be another opportunity in another place and again in the House to do that in the future.
Obviously both the member for Dickson and I have been in this House long enough to know that there are on occasions differences of view between the House and the Senate. Thinking that the will of the Senate, therefore, must be agreed to within the House seems to be turning the idea of democracy on its head somewhat. Similarly, we cannot require that the Senate always share the view of the will of the House. It is a matter that the government will not support. We do disagree to these amendments. We do not believe that they are constitutional. We do not believe, in any case, that they are the mechanism that should be used to deal with a disallowance, which will no doubt be before the Senate again tomorrow.
It will not be a surprise to anyone, either, that on occasions not only are the will of the Senate and the will of the House different but the legal advice from the clerks and provided to the clerks might on occasion be different too. We have, as we have advised the Senate, advice from the Government Solicitor. The Deputy Speaker read advice that had been provided—or obtained; I am not privy to that—by the Speaker. We can argue back and forth about the constitutionality for as long as we like, but the substance of this measure is not agreed to by the government because (1) we do not believe that it is appropriate to delay the introduction of a compliance bill which is in no way related to the level of rebate paid for cataract treatment and (2) we do not believe that taxpayers should be unable to reap the benefit of technological advances when they become available. We can look at international comparisons—I can speak for another half an hour on these—but those issues are all already on the record and I do not think it will further debate today. But it is very important for that to be acknowledged.
I did meet last week with the ophthalmologists—both the college and the association. We are continuing to have discussions with them. Of course, fairly strong disagreements have been registered, but that does not mean that people do not think they can be mature enough to work through to see if there is another way to resolve this matter. It is not going to be resolved by an amendment which means that forever and a day a government is unable to change a rebate for a Medicare item when it has spent $14 billion just in the last financial year. Taxpayers expect us to have good scrutiny to make sure every one of those dollars is spent well and to the best advantage. For those reasons, the government opposes amendments (1) and (10).
Question agreed to.
—I present the reasons for the House disagreeing to the Senate amendments (1) and (10), and I move:
That the reasons be adopted.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the sixth report for 2009 of the committee relating to the proposed redevelopment of the Villawood Immigration Detention Facility.
Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.
—by leave—The sixth report for 2009 of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works addresses the Villawood Immigration Detention Facility project, jointly sponsored by the Department of Finance and Deregulation and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship at an estimated cost of $186 million.
The Villawood Immigration Detention Facility is an essential component of Australia’s immigration detention infrastructure and is in urgent and critical need of an upgrade. The committee found that the current centre is largely inappropriate for housing people who are under administrative detention. It looks and feels like an antiquated prison, offering little recreation space or individual privacy. The committee is well aware of the importance of this facility to Australia’s migration system and was concerned to ensure that the redeveloped centre would both be operationally effective and respect the rights of detainees. The report’s nine recommendations focus on this outcome.
The committee has recommended that the works proceed, with some recommendations to be implemented immediately, including providing a lockable space for each detainee and ceasing use of the loudspeaker paging system, as it breaches detainees’ privacy. However, the committee has reserved its judgement over certain elements of the project, recommending that the final designs and costings be brought to the committee prior to construction commencing. This is because the committee is not confident that the existing buildings can be adequately retrofitted to afford dignity to detainees or cope with surge conditions. In addition, the committee was concerned that no decision has been made on the stage 1 high-security facility, which will be phased out of use. This facility is so inappropriate that the committee has recommended that it be demolished. The committee has also recommended that, in line with the centre’s being renamed the Villawood Immigration Detention Facility, accommodation sections within the facility be renamed—less formally—to help break down some of the institutional culture of the facility.
The committee was pleased to note that as a result of its 2005 inquiry into the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Facility the department now has written standards for the design of immigration facilities. In recognition of the importance of this document the committee has recommended that it be accredited by Standards Australia to ensure that all future facilities are of the highest possible standard.
The committee received submissions from local residents concerned about security and site management and has recommended that the proponent agencies work more closely with the local council and residents throughout the redevelopment. The committee met with a group of detainees at the centre. This meeting informed much of the committee’s deliberations on the state of the current centre, and the committee is grateful for the detainees’ input.
On a personal note, I find some satisfaction in this report as I was involved in the review of detention centres by the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I say to all senators that I think it is high time that the eight hours of in camera evidence from the department and from detainees should finally be released. I thank the members and senators on the committee for their work in relation to this inquiry and commend our very professional committee secretariat staff, who have done a wonderful job. I commend this report to all honourable members.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,9,1

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2009-11-24,"—I rise to speak on the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. I say from the outset that the coalition does not oppose this bill. This bill will, if passed by both houses, ensure that the existing sector-specific long service leave arrangements for the coalmining industry can continue beyond 1 January next year. Currently, the sector-specific long service leave provisions to which this bill relates are contained in industry-specific awards. These awards require the payment of a levy to the relevant fund by an employer from which the employer may seek reimbursement where they have made a payment of long service leave to an eligible employee. This bill is necessary as from 1 January next year Labor’s system of so-called ‘modern awards’ will apply. These awards do not contain a provision for long service leave. It is the understanding of the opposition that the government intends that long service leave become one of its national employment standards.
We were told, during the debate on the Fair Work Bill and subsequent legislation, that the government, in conjunction with the particular department and state governments, will be developing standards provisions for long service leave entitlements around the country. On this point, a question that looms large in my mind is exactly how these standardised provisions for long service leave will apply. I ask this question as, when you take even a cursory glance at the various long service leave provisions around the country that are currently contained within state legislation, you can easily see that they contain different entitlements and different provisions with respect to the taking of long service leave. I want to list those differences to give the House some sort of idea about why this is a difficult process and why we have concerns that the government will handle it as badly as it has handled other national standardised policies, such as the ‘modern awards’ process, which has been completely botched and bungled from the very outset.
I will move firstly to the New South Wales situation. In that state the entitlement is for two months leave after 10 years of continuous service. Thereafter, there is one month of leave for each subsequent five years of continuous service. I note that the entitlement on termination in New South Wales is that if an employee terminates for any reason then they will receive a full payment of their entitlement after 10 years of service. A pro rata amount applies for the five-year period immediately after the 10-year service trigger. I also note that for between five and 10 years of service an employee might be eligible for pro rata long service leave on termination of employment if that termination occurs at the initiative of the employee—on account of illness, incapacity or domestic or other pressing necessity—or where an employer terminates an employee for any reason other than serious or wilful misconduct. And I note that in New South Wales, unless the employee has had five years of service, there is no obligation for an employer to pay any entitlement to long service leave.
In Victoria, the system is reasonably similar, but there are still some minor differences. For example, in Victoria there is no entitlement for long service leave for any employee that has had less than 10 years of service. For between 10 and 15 years of service, an employee can receive a payment for their accrued long service leave on termination for any cause and for any reason, other than if the employer terminates the employee for serious or wilful misconduct. And, after 15 years of service, an employee who terminates for any reason will receive the payment of long service leave.
In Queensland there are differences as well. In that state, the Queensland Industrial Relations Act provides that employees will receive over 8½ weeks—8.6667 weeks, to be precise—on completion of 10 years continuous service. Further leave is available for each additional five years of continuous service. On termination after 10 years, an employee is entitled to receive the payment of their long service leave entitlement for any cause. However, in relation to an employee who has completed less than 10 years of service but more than seven years of service, they may be eligible for pro rata leave should they be terminated by their employer for any reason other than the employee’s conduct, capacity and performance, or by death of the employee for whom the entitlement has accrued. However, where an employee has completed less than seven years of service there will be no entitlement. This is different to the Victorian and New South Wales systems.
In South Australia, the entitlements to long service leave are different. In my home state of Western Australia, there are also subsequent variations. The same goes for Tasmania, as it does in both of the territories. So in all of the eight jurisdictions around Australia there are slight differences in how an employee can accrue long service leave. I bring these differences to the attention of the House because, based on what we have seen about how Labor operates in government, we hold concerns, given this existing patchwork of legislation that currently exists throughout Australia, about how the government will go about standardising a system of long service leave.
In particular, the opposition is concerned about what guarantee the government will give in relation to either employers or employees going backwards with respect to long service leave entitlements and conditions. As I have detailed, there are substantial differences between the amounts of accrual, the circumstances upon which the entitlements can be paid out to workers and in particular the pro rata provisions applying in each state or territory. We are concerned that, if the government seeks to standardise long service leave arrangements across the country, it will result in a situation akin to the intentions and the promises made by Labor with respect to the bungled and botched modern award process.
I need not remind the House that, after introducing the fair work legislation into parliament, the minister gave us a promise that workers would not be worse off as a result of those changes. Subsequently we were given a promise, or the Australian people were given a promise, that the aims and intentions of the modern award system would include a requirement that no increase in labour costs would be borne by employers. There was a dual promise given to this House and to the Australian people, firstly, that no employee would be worse off as a result of the changes through the modern awards and, secondly, that no employer would face increases in their cost base.
We have seen, since these promises have been given, that they have been nothing more than hollow and false promises that the government has failed to deliver on. Australian workers and business have every right to feel ripped off as result of the award modernisation process and the outcomes it has delivered. We have seen business, particularly small business, very concerned about the increased labour costs they will be facing as a result of the award modernisation process. Retailers in New South Wales will have increased operating costs of up to 22 per cent per year. The pharmacy sector have indicated that they will have to curb trading hours for that sector, resulting in reduced services to the community and reduced service for people seeking access to medical assistance and the advice of a registered pharmacist.
The hotel sector in Western Australia is predicting that as a result of the modern award process it will lose, within that sector alone and within the one state of Western Australia, between 300 and 400 employees. The Queensland Newsagents Federation has stated that as a result of modern awards a newsagent employing just one casual employee will have a cost increase of over 31 per cent per year. I can continue to list these adverse results from the award modernisation process, but I have detailed those concerns extensively in the House before. However, I wanted to highlight them again in relation to the government’s desire to standardise long service leave arrangements around the country and to say that the opposition remains very concerned about how they are going to go about this. We remain very concerned that they will not go down the same path that they have adopted in relation to modernising the award system.
We would be very concerned, as an opposition, if the process of standardising long service leave entitlements resulted in further spin and further hollow promises about the effects that it will have on workplaces. We are very concerned on behalf of business, particularly small business, that their costs may increase as a result of seeking consistency regarding the application of long service leave. We would also be most distressed if Labor’s attempts to standardise these provisions resulted in workers being worse off. To this end we call for the government to make it clear to the Australian people, and everybody in Australian workplaces, exactly what their intentions are with respect to the standardisation of long service leave. We seek from the minister some guarantees and an undertaking that the botched and bungled approach that she has taken to modernising the awards system will not be repeated in relation to such an important entitlement as long service leave.
These concerns aside, I note that this bill continues the existing scheme applicable in the coalmining industry for workers and employers. Had this bill not received the support of the opposition, it would have resulted in a circumstance from the beginning of next year where employers and employees might not have been covered by an appropriate system of long service leave regulation. It is likely that they would have had to revert to their relevant state systems.
We are pleased that this bill is a result of discussion between industry representatives—the Minerals Council and the relevant mining unions. I am also pleased that other stakeholders potentially affected by this legislation, including the Australian Mines and Metals Association and the Australian Industry Group, have not indicated that they hold any concerns about this legislation. However, our position on this bill should not be taken to represent any future view that we have with respect to long service leave generally and, in particular, any system of portable long service leave. Whilst we do recognise that in this particular sector there have been longstanding arrangements and agreements between stakeholders about long service leave arrangements, they are specifically applicable to this industry and it is not the case for all other sectors. We will reserve our position in relation to any future development in that area. However, we will not be opposing this bill.
We do believe that it is necessary to reiterate the call to the government and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to make sure that when developing a standardised system of long service leave there is a degree of consultation and cooperation between stakeholders—including the opposition—at all levels. This is something the minister consistently fails to do. We see today she has run around expecting the opposition to make up for her inability to manage the government’s legislative program. There needs to be an underlying fundamental approach taken to this standardisation and it must be different from the bungled modern awards process. We do not want to hear more hollow rhetoric and spin from this minister. We do not want her to make promises to the Australian people that she cannot keep, and we will be watching very closely as her proposals to develop standardised long service leave arrangements are developed.",REPS,<title>COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I rise today to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. This bill shows the Rudd Labor government’s continued commitment to the coalmining industry and, particularly, to those thousands of men and women, who are the backbone of the industry, working in coalmines and to the coalmining communities of the Bowen Basin in my electorate. The coal industry has a unique set of arrangements for the accrual and payment of long service leave entitlements, dating back to 1949. This bill will guarantee the continuation of the long service leave arrangements in the black coal mining industry. Specifically, the amendments will clarify that the long service leave entitlements that have been preserved within the Fair Work Act 2009 will be covered by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992. This bill means that employees in the black coal mining industry can be secure in the knowledge that their long service leave entitlements remain unchanged. Employers know that they will continue to be reimbursed by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Fund for long service leave payments that they make to individual employees.
The bill will establish definitions of ‘black coal mining industry’, ‘employee’ and ‘employer’ and also adjust the definition of ‘eligible employee’ in the funding act to ensure that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. As we have heard, in the coalmining industry employees are entitled to long service leave based on their time in the industry, not their time with an individual employer. Mobility of the workforce has always been a feature of the coalmining industry, and the ever-increasing demand for skilled miners will make it even more likely that miners will move from mine to mine and employer to employer as opportunities open up for them. The scheme was designed to accommodate this mobility as well as protect the entitlements of miners in the event of company insolvency. That is not such a problem these days, but it was a definite consideration in the original establishment of the scheme.
Funding for long service leave is maintained by an industry scheme created by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 and related legislation. Under this act, employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Fund for any long service payments that are made to an employee. From January 2010 the current industry awards covering long service leave will be taken over by ‘modern awards’ under the Fair Work Act 2009. Modern awards will not include long service leave entitlements. Instead, existing award based entitlements will be preserved as a statutory entitlement under the National Employment Standards, pending development of national long service leave arrangements. Due to these changes, and as the funding act does not currently cover entitlements determined by the National Employment Standards, employers will not be entitled to reimbursement for the fund in respect of the long service payments they make to employees. This bill will ensure that this situation is rectified.
The amendments that this bill represents will ensure that as of 1 January 2010 employers will be entitled to reimbursement from the fund in respect of long service payments that they make to employees pursuant to the preserved entitlements in the Fair work Act. This is in addition to the current arrangements for reimbursement of entitlements paid under industrial instruments and contracts. The changes in this bill will not affect an employee’s long service leave or an employer’s long service leave fund obligations. It guarantees that employees will not lose their current long service leave entitlements.
This bill contains only minor technical amendments but, in doing so, provides certainty and security for employers and employees in the black coal industry. It recognises—and the government recognises—the unique history of the industry and its special significance to regions like Central Queensland. There can be no doubt that the government recognises the vital importance of the coal industry as our biggest exporter, a major employer and a driver of economic growth.
I remind the House that, contrary to the scare campaign mounted by the Australian Coal Association in recent months, the latest Treasury modelling shows the coal industry growing by at least 50 per cent by the year 2050. Consistent with that, we will see 10,000 new jobs created in the coal industry in the next 10 years. The ads paid for by the coal companies might be convincing if it were not for these and other independent predictions, and the evidence all around us in Central Queensland, that the industry is strong and is in fact gearing up for further growth.
As members know—and they know because I keep telling them—there have been some major announcements for the Central Queensland coal mining industry in the last few months. Only last week the Rudd Labor government granted major project facilitation status to Waratah Coal’s proposed northern export facility infrastructure project. This gives support to a $7.5 billion commitment to develop a new coalmine as well as associated rail and port facilities in the Galilee Basin, near Alpha, which is just west of my electorate of Capricornia. This mine will service the international export market for thermal coal. In addition to the mine, the project will involve construction of a railway potentially in excess of 400 kilometres long, depending upon the option chosen, to transport processed coal to an expanded facility at Abbot Point, near Bowen, or to a new export terminal to be established at Dudgeon Point. New major water and power supply infrastructure would be necessary to service the mine and port. The proposed open-cut mine is expected to be developed in stages and have an initial export capacity of 30 million tonnes per annum with a mine life in excess of 30 years. Initial exports are targeted for 2013. Construction of the mine will involve an estimated 6,000 jobs.
This is a massive investment in the mining industry in Central Queensland. Importantly, it is another example of the disconnect between the claims of the Coal Association and those opportunists who see political advantage in opposing the CPRS and the reality of what is happening in the coal industry, where companies are backing their belief in the future of the coal industry with substantial amounts of money. Talk in this debate is cheap—unless you are talking about the Coal Association’s ads—but the big-dollar investments going on all around us tell the real story.
Members who have heard me speak in the last few weeks will know that there is even more to the story. Just two weeks ago a new coalmining deal was announced between Stanwell, a power generator in my electorate, and Wesfarmers. This will see the Curragh mine, at Blackwater, expanded, creating up to 300 construction jobs. This agreement will also create 90 full-time positions in a long-term boost for the Central Queensland economy. The new deal allows coal from Stanwell’s excess reserves to be mined by Wesfarmers, with Stanwell to share in the revenue generated from the export of the coal.
There is also more to come for Central Queensland, with Xstrata accelerating its proposal to build Queensland’s fourth coal port, at Port Alma, along with its plans for a new billion-dollar harbour between Gladstone and Rockhampton. This would service the Wandoan Coal project, which has the potential to become Australia’s most productive coalmine. This terminal would provide 100 full-time jobs and could export up to 100 million tonnes of coal. Extensive environmental impact investigations have already been done on this area. If all goes well, work will commence as early as 2012 and Port Alma may be able to ship coal by 2014.
As you can see, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, there are great developments happening in the coalmining industry in Central Queensland that will create jobs and continue to boost our economy. We on this side of the House believe that coal has a strong future. We also want it to have a sustainable future. That is why the government is making huge investments in accelerating the development of clean coal technology through its support for carbon capture and storage. We are contributing millions of dollars towards carbon capture and storage projects and demonstrating international leadership through the establishment of the Global Carbon Institute.
The Rudd Labor government is committed to securing the future of the coal industry through these investments in research and development. All the evidence tells us that coal will continue to be a major source of energy for the world well into the future, but we cannot ignore the imperative to reduce carbon emissions. The future for Australia’s coal industry lies, therefore, in exporting not just coal but also the technology that will enable our overseas customers to generate low-emission energy.
The government’s support for the coal industry cannot be questioned. It was further confirmed today in the offer made to the opposition to amend the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to increase transitional assistance to coalmines. Overall, we are putting forward a total of $1.5 billion for the coal industry over the first five years of the scheme. As announced by the Minister for Climate Change and Water earlier today, there will be two components to this assistance—if it is agreed to by the opposition, of course. The Coal Sector Adjustment Scheme will provide free permits to the most emissions intensive mines. This will enable the fugitive emissions carbon liability for the most gassy mines to be reduced from around $20 per saleable tonne of coal to around $5 per tonne at a carbon price of $25 per tonne. I stress that this refers to the most gassy mines. We should not forget that many mines will face a carbon liability of less than $1 per tonne of saleable coal under the CPRS.
I noted in a speech last week—and, Madam Deputy Speaker, I think you were in the chair when I made the speech—that Macarthur Coal reported a drop in its profits. The losses were attributed to unexpected demurrage costs for ships waiting to load from Dalrymple Bay coal loading facility. They also referred to the impact of the strong Australian dollar. I mention that because it highlights the many factors that go into the profitability of coalmines and puts into perspective the additional cost that carbon permits represent for companies. It is less than $1 per tonne for some mines. When companies are selling coal for $65 or $80 per tonne, or even more, and are subject to many more costs—not to mention state government royalties—that does not sound like the end of the world for the majority of mines.
Of course, the CPRS has always included compensation targeted to the most gassy mines, and today’s announcement represents an offer to increase that targeted compensation. In addition, there will be a coalmining abatement fund within the Climate Change Action Fund. The coalmining abatement fund will be increased by $20 million to a total of $270 million. It will fund coalmine abatement projects and capital grants, with priority for waste coalmine gas electricity generation projects. Coal companies in my electorate have already entered into successful partnerships with waste coal gas generators such as Energy Development Ltd and Envirogen to use their fugitive emissions to generate electricity, thus abating fugitive emissions while also displacing emissions intensive coal fired power generation.
I welcome the measures put forward by the government to facilitate the expansion of such partnerships because I know there is real scope for that to create jobs and benefit communities in my electorate as well as making a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions. Specifically, I support the possibility, announced today, of a review of the renewable energy target, through the COAG process, to consider whether new waste coalmine gas projects should be eligible under the renewable energy target.
On this the second anniversary of the election of the Rudd Labor government I want to assure all coalminers and their families, particularly the members of the CFMEU, that I have not forgotten the tremendous support you gave me in our fight against Work Choices. It was a mighty battle and a successful one. Work Choices is gone and the Labor government wants to provide to workers in the coalmining industry the security they deserve as they work hard to bring this country unprecedented prosperity. This bill adds to that security by preserving the coalmining industry long service leave arrangements that have served employers and employees in the coalmining industry well for so long. I commend the bill to the House and, by the way, I also commend to the House the government’s offer to amend the CPRS.",REPS,<title>COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2009-11-24,"—I also rise to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. I listened closely to what the member for Capricornia had to say. Some of it was not quite related to the bill, but that may give me some degree of licence in the Deputy Speaker’s mind.
 (Ms AE Burke)—I think that is up to me to determine, Member for New England! Please proceed.
—The coal industry is on everybody’s lips at the moment, I guess, with the current debate in relation to emissions trading and other issues. The coal industry, as the member for Capricornia said, is a very important industry in a lot of our electorates. The coal industry has been active for well over 100 years in various parts of the electorate of New England and west of the electorate, more towards the Gunnedah Basin. There are a number of initiatives, some of which the government is looking to assist with. As most members would know, the electorate of New England—or the Boggabri, Gunnedah, Quirindi coal basin—is just over the Liverpool Range from the Hunter Valley, which is the member for Hunter’s electorate. That links our area with the Port of Newcastle. The Port of Newcastle has had quite massive expansion in coal loading capacity. From memory, with a third load, they will be able to handle something like 120 million to 130 million tonnes of coal annually, which will make it the biggest coal exporting port in the world, I am told. So the Hunter Valley, Newcastle and the lower part of New England in particular—although there is some exploration of coal reserves going on in the northern part of New England—will be very significant contributors to the export earnings of the state of New South Wales.
Currently there is a proposal before the Australian Rail Track Corporation. Minister Albanese is well aware of this. Some hundreds of millions of dollars were set aside in various infrastructure programs to rebuild a pathway through the Liverpool Range which will increase the capacity of the trains coming out of the New England area and down into the Hunter. Currently there is a range, which is at the top of the Murray-Darling system, which I will refer to in a moment, and a tunnel where trains have to be physically pushed and pulled. There have been a range of incidents there over the years. The capacity of those trains is quite restricted because of the height of the tunnel through the range. The Australian Rail Track Corporation have in train a number of feasibility arrangements to look at proposals—some above the ground and some below ground by way of a tunnel—which will increase the capacity. I would encourage the government—particularly the minister who made certain assurances in here that this would be part of the stimulus package—to make sure that this program goes ahead, not only for the coal industry and for the workers who will be receiving long service leave through this legislation but for the economy of Newcastle and other areas, as well as the nation.
The other issue that I would like to mention is the long-term future of the coal industry and where it locates. I am aware that in Queensland there are issues in some parts about the granting of exploration licences to coal companies in what some people would view as fairly sensitive lands. Some people in the chamber and those listening may well have watched the Four Corners program about two months ago that looked at exploration licences that were granted to BHP Billiton and a Chinese company called Shenhua that were proposing to explore for coal on what is called the Liverpool Plains. The Liverpool Plains are part of the flood plain that comes off the Liverpool Range that I talked about a moment ago where the new tunnel is being looked at. That particular range is at the top of the Murray-Darling system in that part of the world. The drainage system that comes off the Liverpool Range onto the Liverpool Plains—which, in fact, over hundreds of thousands of years has formed this magnificent flood plain, interspersed with a degree of sandy ridges—has magnificent soil, some of the best soil in the world. There is a current debate about the granting of the coal mining exploration licences to BHP and the Chinese company Shenhua. There is great concern about the impact of particularly longwall mining, which BHP proposed to put in place, but also of the open-cut mine that Shenhua is looking at. There is great concern about the impact that the mining plans could have on the underground water systems. There are quite large underground aquifers in that area that are currently used for irrigation in a sustainable way. A major adjustment process took place earlier this century.
The proposal to mine some of that land is of great concern to landholders in the immediate area who are normally affected by coalmining. I am not against coalmining. I live within a kilometre of a coalmine and I do not have any issues with them. In fact, as a state member I assisted them to develop in other parts of the electorate. The issue here really is not about whether or not coalmining is a good thing; it is about the impact of an activity such as coalmining, and maybe other activities, on the demeanour of the land form that may well be mined—in this case an alluvial flood plain underpinned with these massive groundwater resources. The critical point, and the question that is yet unanswered, is the need for an independent scientific water study to ascertain the relationship between the land and the water—the groundwater systems that are there—and how they are interconnected as well as their relationship with the Murray-Darling system through the Namoi River. That was the point that the Four Corners program took. We need to ascertain the science of these systems before a disturbance from an activity such as mining takes place; otherwise, the damage that we do could in fact be irreparable.
There are massive coal reserves in these two exploration sites—over a billion tonnes between the two sites and the two sites are only about 10 kilometres apart. It is massive, and it is massive dollars. The sites are massive groundwater systems and they have some of the best soils in the world. So we have this collision point that is going to occur in this place, even though the granting of mining licences is essentially a state issue. The collision point will be in this building rather than the state building because of the legislation that was passed last year on the Murray-Darling Basin arrangements, putting in place a process for the future whereby the basin is actually looked at as one rather than as part of four states.
There is great concern that, if mining proposals do go ahead before the science of the hydrology of the system—the hydraulics of the groundwater systems—is fully understood, there could be irreversible damage done to the connectivity of those systems, the quality of the water in those systems and part of the recharge area of the surface water system itself. In a sense it makes a mockery of the Murray-Darling Basin arrangements. I do not blame them for this—they have been given their riding instructions—but they are trying to put together a water audit with end-of-valley caps which will eventually end up with a plan for the basin whereby certain extraction activities can occur. Then the allocations et cetera will flow from there, and the environmental benefits will be gauged as one catchment. The Haystack Plain area on the Darling Downs is a similar area with slightly different problems but, nonetheless, is part of the Murray-Darling system.
If we allow these mining activities to occur in these very sensitive areas, it could have enormous implications for water quality, particularly given the much higher salt levels which could be extracted from that mining area even than the methane gas that is also there. We need to fully understand the science of the hydraulic nature of the Namoi system and the proposed coal activities. As I explained in another speech, the Liverpool Range provides the hydraulic push for the groundwater systems. Through this enormous valley, the surface water ends up going through a neck of land about six kilometres wide and then fans out again as it goes towards Gunnedah. You have about 150 kilometres of this system and we have very little knowledge of the groundwater and surface water issues.
Right at the worst possible point, we have a potential proposal from BHP Billiton to long-wall mine across this system. I have absolutely no idea of what that will do to the hydraulics of the system or the hydrology or the quality of the system. I know that if you long-wall a mine under a flat plain it falls in. That has a whole range of other issues as well which, under the Murray-Darling arrangements will probably not be allowed to occur. BHP is suggesting that they might just mine in the ridges and they fully do not understand—no-one does—the relationship between one side of the ridge and the other as to the groundwater that is being driven through that system.
I raise those issues just so that the parliament is aware that there is great concern out there. If we want people working in a sustainable farming system and a sustainable mining system into the future where people can access their long service leave for long periods of time into the future, we really need to look at these systems and the need, particularly within the Murray-Darling system, for what is called a bioregional assessment. The Commonwealth again might well have to provide a lead role here. The Commonwealth has taken the lead role in the Murray-Darling system itself and what we may need to do now is actually plan the activities, or risk assess the activities, which can and cannot occur within various parts of that catchment. I suggest that on the Liverpool Plains in particular, because of the sensitive nature and the relationships between water, soil and food production in one of the best food-producing areas in the nation, we should tread very lightly on this. If need be, we should not allow these activities to occur before we do a comprehensive and proper bioregional assessment of the assets that are there and the potential risk to those assets of certain other activities—in this case, mining.
The other issue that I will raise briefly is the failure of the planning system in New South Wales to really address issues such as mining in some of these sensitive areas. Currently, as most people are probably aware, part 3A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act is the trigger mechanism for allowing a mine plan to proceed from an exploration licence through to something that is real and focused. That legislation—and some of the other legislation that impacts on mining approval—does not mention water once. The word ‘water’ is not included in that process once. We really have not looked at how the state legislation and approval processes and the new Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the federal Water Act are going to react, if in fact they do run into each other in terms of legislative assessment. We need to do that.
Essentially what the state based planning process does is assess a mining application: look at the site, make sure that nothing can get away from that site and, if something goes wrong, it is held within that site, and look at the land immediately adjacent to the site. In some cases, the miner may have to buy that adjacent land so that the disturbances to neighbours et cetera are taken care of. It is a fairly simplistic process. But when you are dealing with an underground water system like the one that feeds the Murray-Darling system, the impacts may well occur hundreds of kilometres away from the mine. The argument is, ‘If something goes wrong, you just compensate the people around you—pay them some money or come to some arrangement.’ But that does not allow for the unknown nature of the science in terms of the push, the drive, on those systems from the Murrurundi range right through to Walgett, which is probably 350 kilometres—and it probably goes further that we do not even understand. You cannot have a state based process that only looks at the small area where the mining activity is going to occur, if it is in an area where you have these other systems.
I am pleased to see the Minister for Resources and Energy here. I am about to conclude. It is very difficult when we do not have a full understanding of the science of those groundwater systems. The minister would be aware of these issues, so I will not bore him with them, but the relationship between the state based mining approval processes and the Murray-Darling Basin arrangements really does need to be addressed. A possible solution for the mining companies, the farm organisations and the farmers themselves in the communities is an appropriate bioregional assessment of the assets—mine wise, food wise and water wise—in these regions so that we can assess them for the benefit of all into the future. I support the legislation.",REPS,<title>COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Trevor, Chris, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I wish to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009, a bill that will ensure the unique long service leave arrangements that are already in place in the black coal mining industry will continue to operate as effectively as they have been. The bill will clarify that the existing long service leave entitlements preserved by the Fair Work Act 2009 will be covered by the funding act and will effectively preserve existing arrangements for hardworking employees in the black coal mining industry with respect to long service leave. The bill will also ensure employers that make long service leave payments to employees are reimbursed from the fund. Other changes include the introduction of definitions of ‘black coal mining industry’, ‘employee’ and ‘employer’ and the amendment of the definition of ‘eligible employee’ to make certain that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry.
The bill is about providing certainty for the workers and employers of the black coal mining industry. It is about providing rock-solid legislation that will not only preserve the current security that is felt by the workers of the industry with regard to their long service leave entitlements and the reimbursement of employers in the industry for long service leave payments but also ensure its future longevity. This bill will update the laws to allow them to work cooperatively with the modernisation of the workplace relations systems and guarantee a secure, certain future for the employers and employees of the black coal mining industry in relation to long service leave.
Under the current legislation, long service leave entitlements are dictated by industrial instruments, namely awards and workplace agreements, and from contracts of employment. The important factor to note is that, unlike in many other industries, the eligibility of an employee in the black coal mining industry for long service leave entitlements is determined by their length of service in the industry, not their service with a particular employer. Their length of service with a particular employer has no impact on their eligibility for long service leave entitlements. It is determined independently by their length of service in the industry. Currently this is supported by an industry scheme established by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 and other related legislation, including the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992. The bill today is amending the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 and the other legislation I have just mentioned.
The amendments in this bill aim at ensuring that the long service leave scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. This will be achieved by introducing a definition for ‘black coal mining industry’ in the funding act, which flows through to the other related legislation. This definition has been added to align the act’s definition with the definition in the coal award, which will effectively provide consistent coverage. In particular, this amendment will ensure that the reimbursement of employers from the fund for long service payments made to an eligible employee are matched over time by contributions into the fund with respect to that employee. It will also make sure that the long service leave entitlements of employees are portable.
The bill will also introduce definitions for ‘employee’ and ‘employer’ and will amend the definition of ‘eligible employee’. These definitions will be made more accurate by these changes to provide clarity as to their meaning and make certain that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry.
Another change that this bill will bring that will assist further with the universal application of this long service leave scheme for all workers in the black coal mining industry pertains to the allocation of the Coal Mining Industry (Production and Engineering) Consolidated Award 1997 to be extended to all eligible employees who do not otherwise have long service leave entitlements derived from an award. This effectively means that all eligible employees who do not have an award-derived long service leave entitlement will be deemed to have such an entitlement by reference to the main industry award. This will ensure that the bill will apply to all workers in the black coal mining industry by providing scope for more people to have coverage for their long service leave entitlements, which will in turn ensure that more employees of the industry can receive their long service leave entitlements and all employers of these eligible workers can be reimbursed for the long service leave payments that they make to them.
These amendments and additions aim at ensuring that all employees in the black coal mining industry are granted the long service leave entitlements they deserve. Industry stakeholders have suggested to the government that these definitions and changes will provide greater certainty to the scope and definition of the existing scheme, which seems logical and sensible and is thus the reason they have been included.
Another of the major amendments in this bill aims at protecting employers within the black coal mining industry by ensuring they are reimbursed for any long service leave payments they make to eligible employees in respect of their long service leave entitlements. In the past, employers have been reimbursed for these payments from the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund, as stipulated in the funding act. The issue that has arisen with this particular aspect of the legislation is that once the present industry awards are superseded by the modern awards under the Fair Work Act 2009, which will not include long service leave entitlements, the funding act will not cover the reimbursement. This is because of the change in legislation covering long service leave entitlements. Existing award based entitlements will be preserved as a statutory entitlement under the National Employment Standards, pending of course on the development of national long service leave arrangements. As the funding act does not currently cover entitlements determined by the National Employment Standards, employers will not be entitled to the reimbursements.
Fortunately, the amendments in this bill will change this and prevent the situation from occurring. The changes ensure that employers will be entitled to reimbursement from the fund for any long service leave payments they make to employees pursuant to the preserved entitlements in the Fair Work Act 2009, which is in addition to the current arrangements for their reimbursement of entitlements paid under industrial instruments and contracts. Although this is a vital change, it will have absolutely no impact on employees’ long service leave entitlements or employers’ long service leave fund obligations; it is merely correcting a technicality.
The amendments in this bill will act to preserve the arrangements already in place for employees in the industry. For the people of Flynn, where numerous deposits of black coal are located, this is an extremely positive step towards maintaining the conditions they are currently operating under. It will ensure that the hardworking men and women of Flynn who are working in coal will continue to receive their long service leave entitlements and that many new workers in the black coal mining industry can accumulate and achieve their long service leave entitlements as well. It will mean that they will not miss out on their entitlements, and it will also mean that employers will continue to be reimbursed for the payments of these entitlements to eligible employees. Overall, this means more employees in the black coal mining industry will be covered in terms of long service leave and their employers will continue to be reimbursed by the fund for long service leave payments made to eligible employees. The black coal mining workers and employers not only in my home electorate of Flynn but across Australia will benefit from this bill. This is great news.
It seems obvious that passing this bill is a positive step towards retaining the current arrangements with regard to the long service leave entitlements for both the employers and the employees in the industry. It has the best interests of the men and women working for, and the employers of, the industry. The bill has the support of key stakeholders from the industry. By passing the bill, we can put in place measures to make certain that the scheme that is already in place continues to ensure these workers do not miss out on their entitlements, irrespective of how many different employers they work for in the industry. The government has considered the best interests of all the stakeholders involved with the issue and it has their support.
The changes in the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009 are vital to ensure the preservation of long service leave entitlements for the workers of the black coal mining industry and the reimbursement of employers from the fund with respect to these payments to eligible employees. It is for all of these reasons that I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Bidgood, James, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I rise to speak in favour of the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. As always, I like to say that the Labor Party is the miners’ friend. It has always been and always will be the miners’ friend because it is the party that delivers for the mining industry.
In speaking in favour of this bill, we are here to make sure that workers’ rights and entitlements are protected—unlike those on the other side of this House. This bill will amend the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1999—known as ‘the funding act’—and related legislation, including the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992.
This bill ensures the portability of long service leave entitlements for all employees in the black coal industry. The scheme applies universally to all workers in the black coal mining industry. Amendments made by the bill will commence on 1 January 2010. Employees in the coalmining industry are entitled to long service leave on the basis of service in the industry, rather than their service with a particular employer. Funding of long service leave entitlements is supported by an industry scheme established by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1999, the funding act, and related legislation, including the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992, as I previously mentioned.
Under the funding act employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund for any long service payments they make to eligible employees in respect of their long service leave entitlements. Firstly, the amendments will clarify that the existing long service leave entitlements preserved by the Fair Work Act 2009 will be covered by the funding act. Secondly, the amendments also extend the current long service entitlements in the industry award to all eligible employees who do not otherwise have an award-derived long service leave entitlement. Thirdly, the bill will also introduce definitions of ‘black coal mining industry’, ‘employee’ and ‘employer’ and amend the definition of ‘eligible employee’ in the funding act to ensure that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. Fourthly, the bill has the support of key stakeholders in the coalmining industry, including employer and employee representative bodies.
If workers for whatever reason do not have an award-derived long serve leave entitlement, they will have one from next year. We are about providing for workers entitlements; we will never be about stripping them away. We will ensure that workers have their rights. Bills such as these are the kinds of protections that a Rudd Labor government is delivering for Dawson and for workers in the coal industry. I am proud that this government truly does look after workers, particularly workers in the mining industry which is so prominent in my electorate. The Rudd government firmly recognises the importance of the coal industry to our local economy and our local jobs.
The Rudd government believes in a coal industry with a future and is investing strongly in its future, for both the industry and the workers in the industry. I have listened to coal workers and their families. I meet them all from time to time on the street, at mobile offices, at markets and at schools. They email me and they call my office. They tell me very clearly that they want a coal industry with a future. They want what is best for their kids. They want job security and they want a government that delivers for their communities and will into the future.
As far as communities go, coal towns are relatively new communities but they are dynamic communities. The Bowen Basin coalfields have been producing coal and growing communities for over 30 years. Communities which border my electorate like Moranbah, Dysart, Middlemount, Nebo and Coppabella are mining towns with schools, hospitals, sporting clubs, pubs, small businesses and community groups. There are workers in those communities who have been there from day one. There are workers there who have only just been put on. All these workers will be protected by these new laws being debated today. These laws protect all workers in the black coal industry.
We on this side of the House will always stand up for workers in the coal industry. Unlike those opposite, we will never stick up the white flag of surrender on the industry and its workers in Australian coal fields, we are proud of this industry and proud of its workers.
We stand in this place to make laws that protect and provide a strong future for these workers. We make laws in consultation with and for the benefit of all stakeholders, including the workers’ representatives like the unions and the employers, through providing certainty and predictability. Unlike the Liberal and National parties, we are about protecting the rights of workers in the coal industry. Workers know that, unlike those opposite, we did not support Work Choices and AWA’s in the mining industry, Work Choices and AWAs which unashamedly stripped away workers’ rights. Workers know that in government we have delivered on our promises by abolishing AWA’s and Work Choices.
We support the coal industry’s existence because, unlike the Liberal and National parties, we do not support a nuclear future for Australia. Unlike some of those opposite, we do not want 50 nuclear power stations dotted across the continent—absolutely no way. That is the Howard government way and they made it clear that it had not ruled out a nuclear future for Australia; nor do the current members of the Liberal and National parties. They want a nuclear future. As little time ago as last week, we had the National Party’s Senator Joyce making it clear in the media yet again—Senator Joyce is the man who wants to mine for oil in Antarctica—rehashing his idea that shire councils should decide whether their communities should be home to nuclear plants. Can you imagine being a counsellor on a regional council in Mackay, in the Whitsundays, in the Burdekin or Townsville Regional Council going to your council chamber and saying, ‘I want a nuclear power station in my backyard and all that comes with it’? I do not think so. Barnaby Joyce has lost contact with his community, he has lost contact with the people he purports to represent in rural communities. I know we do not want a nuclear power station in Dawson and I do not want to see any nuclear power stations anyway around Australia. That is not the road we are going down. We are not going to go down the nuclear road; we are going to go down the renewable energy road, the sustainable energy road. That is the way forward for Australia.
To have a Leader of the Opposition who wants Australians to adopt the French attitude towards nuclear power in Australia is simply unbelievable. How out of touch can you get? By embracing a nuclear future for Australia, those opposite are saying that they are giving up on a future for coal. Look at the European experience, where nuclear power stations proliferate. There is virtually no coalmining industry left in the UK. There is virtually none in France or across the rest of Europe. Why? It is because of nuclear power. I tell you what: you may cut emissions but you will cut dead the coal industry if you go nuclear in Australia. The mineworkers know that very clearly. I do not see them campaigning—as Barnaby Joyce would want—their local shire councils and saying, ‘We want a nuclear power station in the backyard of Dawson.’ No way. It is not going to happen on my watch.
We reject a nuclear future for Australia and I support a future for coal that is clean—that is, a future for coal with a international market now and into the future. That is the way to go, to embrace clean coal technologies and export those technologies to developing countries so that they can continue to use coal fired power stations. We believe in new technologies and innovations for coal, like carbon capture and storage. In fact, the government has contributed $2 billion for carbon capture and storage technologies to help clean up the industry, to support other infrastructure projects and to help improve our export capacity. The difference between the Labor and the Liberal and National parties is that we know and understand that many of the workers in the industry are in it for the long haul. It is their career. Mining is their livelihood and their children’s livelihood, and we owe it to them to protect it, to grow it and to ensure there is a market for coal internationally and into the future.
Coal and its associated industries are a major driver not only for the Australian economy but also for the economies in my electorate of Dawson. Many of the working families in the mining sector live in Mackay, Bowen and the Whitsundays, and they want a government that will stand up for them now and stand up for them in the future. Mining communities know just how important coal is for Australia’s economy, for jobs and for the bottom line of the wealth of this nation. Workers and their families know that under a Labor government the coal industry will always continue to grow. Treasury modelling shows that the coal industry will continue to grow by 50 per cent by 2050. Workers know that under a Labor government we will always see a future for coal. It will be an optimistic, clean future for one of our national exports. We see a future for coal. That is why we have invested $14 million in the Mining Technology Innovation Centre, based in Mackay in my electorate of Dawson. I wish to commend Peter van Iersel, the Centre Director, for doing a fantastic job in helping firms from around the nation support the mining industry in cutting edge innovation and new, smart business practices.
In conclusion: mining communities in Central Queensland—in Dawson, in Capricornia and in Flynn—will not forget John Howard and his Work Choices laws. Workers will not forget the threat that these laws posed to workers’ entitlements such as long service leave. We are instead about delivering for workers, not taking away their rights. I fully and wholeheartedly commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I rise to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. The aim of the bill is to ensure that, from 1 January 2010, employers who make long service payments to employees can be reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund and to define the ‘black coal mining industry’ in the funding act and related legislation to align with the modern award and ensure that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. In particular, this amendment will ensure that the reimbursements of employers from the fund for long serve leave payments to an eligible employee are matched over time by contributions into the fund in respect of that employee. It will also ensure the portability of entitlements for employees. The bill provides that the Coal Mining Industry (Production and Engineering) Consolidated Award 1997, which is the main industry award, applies to all eligible employees who do not otherwise have an award-derived long service leave entitlement. From 1 January 2010 this will become an applicable award-derived long service leave term for the purpose of section 113 of the Fair Work Act. In effect, all eligible employees who do not have an award-derived long serve leave entitlement will be deemed to have such an entitlement by reference to the main industry award. Amendments made by this bill will commence on 1 January 2010.
I will endeavour shortly to look with some detail into what exactly this bill does, but first I would like to examine the background of this bill—that is, long service leave generally. Long service leave is an almost uniquely Australian product. For a history of the scheme I looked at a research paper from the Labour Ministers Council. It said that long service leave was a period of paid leave granted to employees after a period of continuous employment with the one employer. In certain industries, such as construction, stevedoring and coalmining, policymakers in the past have allowed the entitlement to vest after a period of continuous service in that industry, regardless of the number of employers. Hence its portability between employers. The entitlement has its origins in the 19th century Victorian and South Australian civil service acts. These provided for civil service officers who had completed at least 10 years of service to be granted leave of absence with pay for periods of six to 12 months. The purpose of the leave was to reward those who had performed long and faithful service in the colonies by providing an opportunity for them to return to the United Kingdom. All state and Commonwealth public servants were subsequently granted the entitlement. It was then gradually extended to other public sector employees.
Long service leave began to be included in federal awards by consent in the late 1940s. It did not become a standard employment condition for all employees until the passage in the 1950s of long service leave legislation in all states. The purpose of such legislation, according to parliamentary debates prior to the introduction of the Long Service Leave Act 1955 in New South Wales, was to reduce labour turnover, provide a reward for long, faithful service and enable employees halfway through their working lives to recover their energies and return to work renewed, refreshed and reinvigorated.
In 1964 the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission arbitrated its first long service leave award to provide what has become the standard provision for non-Public Service employees—that is, 13 weeks leave after 15 years service, with a pro rata payment in lieu on termination of employment after 10 years. State legislation and existing awards were amended to provide the same entitlement. South Australia later introduced a 10-year qualifying period for the full 13-week entitlement, but this has not been followed by other states. Public sector employees generally have more long service leave entitlements. Whilst long service leave entitlements are currently predominantly provided for under state laws, the Commonwealth makes legislative provision for long service leave entitlements for those employed in the Commonwealth Public Service.
You can see that there is quite a long history of this particular provision in Australia, and the next stage in the evolution of this almost uniquely Australian entitlement of long service leave is being developed now. We are developing a national employment standard in long service leave. This next step will apply to all employers covered by the Fair Work Act. Long service leave is one of the 10 national standards to be introduced by this government. The others will be a standard 38-hour week, annual leave, parental leave, flexible work for parents, sick leave, community service leave, public holidays, information in the workplace, notice of termination and redundancy pay.
Of course, talking about coalmining and long service leave in one breath was unheard of back in the days of early coalmining. As a reflection, a recent report published by the University of Queensland on the Australian coal industry said:
Work in early Australian coal mines was hard. In convict times, being sent to Newcastle was a punishment, above and beyond ordinary transportation, and the early Newcastle mines were dangerous places, with poor ventilation and inadequate drainage.
—It’s true.
—And I acknowledge the member for Newcastle, who is in the chamber at the moment. Workplace conditions today, of course, have improved dramatically, and we must always be looking to improve conditions even more, especially in places such as underground coalmines, with the inherent difficulties and dangers that they have.
I now turn back to the bill we are debating today, which is about coalmining industry workers—and which, I might add, has the support of key stakeholders in the industry. Employees in the coalmining industry are entitled to long service leave on the basis of service in the industry rather than service with a particular employer. Funding of long service leave entitlements is supported by an industry scheme established by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 and related legislation, including the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992. Under the funding act, employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Fund for any long service payments they make to eligible employees in respect of their long service leave entitlements.
From 1 January, the present industry awards prescribing long service leave will be superseded by modern awards under the Fair Work Act 2009. Modern awards will not include long service leave entitlements. Rather, existing award based entitlements will be preserved as a statutory entitlement under the National Employment Standards pending the development of national long service leave arrangements. As a consequence of these changes, because the funding act does not currently cover entitlements determined by the National Employment Standards, employers will not be eligible for reimbursement from the fund in respect of the long service payments they make to their employees.
The amendments contained in this bill address this situation. The amendments ensure that from 1 January 2010 employers will be entitled to reimbursement from the fund in respect of long service payments they make to employees pursuant to the preserved entitlements in the Fair Work Act, in addition to the current arrangements for reimbursement of entitlements paid under industrial instruments and contracts. This is a technical amendment which will not affect employees’ long service leave entitlements or employers’ long service leave fund obligations.
The current long service leave entitlements in the Coal Mining Industry (Production and Engineering) Consolidated Award 1997 will be extended to all eligible employees who do not otherwise have an award-derived long service leave entitlement. The bill also aligns the definition of ‘black coal mining industry’ in the funding act with the definition in the coal award, amends the definition of ‘eligible employee’ and introduces definitions of ‘employee’ and ‘employer’ to ensure that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry.
Let us not forget what employees in the coalmining industry faced back in the bad old days of Work Choices—and those bad old days were not all that long ago. In a newsletter to its members in June 2006, APESMA, the union covering engineers, scientists and the like, had a question and answer article about long service leave, which I will just take a few quotes from to show how they saw the effects of Work Choices on long service leave. The first question was:

What happens if my employer is not bound by the Award, or if I move to a new mine site?


Answer: WorkChoices means that to access the all-important legally enforceable entitlement of Long Service Leave staff at any new mine site not bound by the Award as at 27 March 2006 do not have access to an Award Long Service Leave entitlement. Instead staff must rebargain for the Coal Mining Industry standard Long Service Leave in an enterprise agreement.
The next question was:

I have an entitlement to long service leave in my contract—isn’t this enough?


Answer: Should there be a disagreement about bridging your service between one employer to another, or deeming your service, then your common law contract doesn’t provide the answer. This is because the only way a Tribunal can determine bridging or deeming if there is no agreement, is if the legal power to determine the dispute is given to them via the Award or enterprise agreement.
The third question was:

My employer is paying into the Long Service Leave Fund anyway, so why should I have a problem in getting my long service leave?


Answer: All employers in the Coal Mining Industry are bound to pay into the Long Service Leave Fund pursuant to the Long Service Leave Funding Act. That Act puts the responsibility on the employer to make contributions to the fund. Unfortunately, that Act does not provide employees with a legally forcible entitlement, and a way to solve disputes where there is disagreement about bridging or deeming.
You can see that there were all sorts of issues that were being faced by coalmining industry employees under Work Choices in relation to their long service leave. In fact, what they were being faced with, quite simply, was the possibility that their entitlement was going to be much diminished. The issue of portability, which is so crucial in this industry, was very much under threat. Yet there are still many of those opposite who would not hesitate to bring back Work Choices if they could.
We saw in this chamber only last week the debate on legislation to bring about a national workplace relations system. That is something that the previous government said they believed in, but we faced the incredible situation of those opposite opposing this position even though they said it was one of the key motivations behind Work Choices. In fact, they went to the High Court in relation to the corporations power to have a national system, and they said that that was fundamental. But what we found here was that there was a more overriding principle that has always lurked beneath the opposition’s psyche and that was that they actually still believe in Work Choices more than the philosophy of a national system. That is why they voted against the national system. The opposition spokesperson made it clear that one of the two reasons they did not want the legislation that was here before this place last week and that the opposition voted against was they did not like the fact that the new system did not have many of the principles of Work Choices.
Between the member for Stirling and the member for O’Connor, they listed the three key issues that they thought should be in a national industrial relations system before they would support it. The first was the reintroduction of AWAs, and employees in the coal industry in particular were subject to more AWAs than almost any other industry. They wanted those to be returned. The member for O’Connor said that he did not believe in penalty rates and if there were penalty rates in any system then he could not support it. Then the issue of flexibility of hours generally was also raised by the member for O’Connor. The position of the opposition spokesperson on workplace relations, the member for Stirling, was that any system that provided unfair dismissal rights was a system that he could not support.
They are three fundamental issues that the Australian people voted on in the last election, and they voted overwhelmingly to support this side of parliament’s position in terms of the type of industrial relations system they wanted—making sure that there was fair access to unfair dismissals, making sure that individual contracts were no longer part of the system and making sure that penalty rates were not stripped away. These three issues are fundamentally the issues that those opposite want to see returned to any industrial relations system and that caused them to make the extraordinary decision to oppose a national industrial relations system in legislation that was there before.
It is little wonder that it is this side of the House that is left to make sure that the long service leave entitlements of those working in the coal industry are protected, because we know quite clearly, from the actions of those opposite in the past and the actions of those opposite only last week, that they would be looking at ways in which they could strip back entitlements from workers in all industries but in particular in relation to this industry. We need to make sure that we are protecting those long service leave entitlements for those who work in the coalmining industry.
The coalmining industry will remain important in this country for many years to come. To give you an idea of just how significant an employment role the industry continues to play, projections are that demand for skilled labour in coalmining, even based on various assumptions about energy use, will remain very high over the longer term. The government’s energy white paper released earlier this year stated that the projected demand for skilled labour in the coalmining industry will rise from over 35,000 in 2008 to about 55,000 in the year 2020. This is an increase of 19,000 or 53 per cent. These projections are based on mineral output projections for Australia’s current major mining commodities to 2020 and they take full account of global market conditions and domestic market conditions such as the proposed emissions trading scheme that is obviously plaguing the opposition’s party room right through all of today.
There are strong partnerships in place to improve the industry’s safety and efficiency. In November 2007, to specifically address the domestic energy supply industry and the demand for skilled labour, the Australian government committed to work with the state and territory governments in the energy sector to improve the consistency of state based regulations such as occupational health and safety requirements that apply to the energy sector. In June 2008 the Ministerial Council on Energy agreed to establish the Energy Technical and Safety Leaders Group to develop a plan to harmonise state and territory electricity and gas supply industry technical and safety regulations. Harmonisation would facilitate greater labour mobility and swifter emergency response in the energy supply industry especially in the context of skilled labour shortages. The leaders group is shortly due to deliver its final plan to the ministerial council. So you can see that the coal industry remains important to Australia, and this government recognises that.
To sum up, the effect of the bill is to preserve existing arrangements for employees in the black coal mining industry with respect to long service leave and also to ensure the reimbursement of employers from the fund with respect to long service leave payments they make to eligible employees. The government considers that this is a desirable measure that recognises the unique historical circumstances surrounding long service leave in the black coal mining industry. This government is about making sure that workers’ rights are preserved. This stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who look at every opportunity they can to strip back and take away employees’ rights. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I too rise today to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. The coalmining industry is intrinsically tied to my electorate of Newcastle and to the Greater Hunter region. I am the granddaughter of a coalminer and, although we are now a dynamic and diversified city, I think you may still struggle to find any Novocastrian who is not linked to somebody involved in the coal industry in one way or another. Just as coal originally laced the beds of the Hunter River, coal is in the bloodstream of our region, and that is the case for many regions around this country. That is something that this government recognises, and the government and I will always make sure we legislate for the benefit of this great industry, of those who work in it and of those who depend upon it.
This legislative amendment looks at improving and streamlining the long service leave funding agreement in the national coal industry and preserving the continued operation of existing unique long service leave arrangements in the black coal industry. To quote from the legislation:
Employees in the coal mining industry are entitled to long service leave on the basis of service in the industry, rather than their service with a particular employee. Funding of long service leave entitlements is supported by an industry scheme established by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1999 (the Funding Act) and related legislation, including the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992.
In the black coal industry formerly, long service leave was always portable, moving with the individual miner. That has been the case since 1949, as recognition that often miners work between one mine and another, depending on the scaling up or scaling down. The legislation continues:
Under the Funding Act employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Fund (the Fund) for any long service payments they make to eligible employees in respect of their long service leave entitlements.
However, from 1 January next year the present industry awards prescribing this long service leave are set to be superseded by more modern awards in line with the Australian government’s Fair Work Act 2009. These awards are not permitted to include long service leave entitlements. Rather, existing award based entitlements will be preserved as a statutory entitlement under the National Employment Standards pending development of national long service leave arrangements. Our movements towards some harmonisation have been very well received. But, because the funding act does not currently cover entitlements determined by the National Employment Standards, employers will not be entitled to reimbursements from the fund in respect of the long service payments that they make to employees. This is obviously not a desired outcome for coal industry employees.
The amendments contained in this bill address this situation. They ensure that from 1 January 2010 employers will be entitled to reimbursement from the fund in respect of long service payments they make to employees pursuant to the preserved entitlements in the Fair Work Act in addition to the current arrangements for reimbursement of entitlements paid under industrial instruments and contracts. This is a technical amendment which will not affect employees’ long service leave entitlements or employers’ long service leave fund obligations. The bill also aligns the definition of ‘black coal mining industry’ in the funding act, which flows through to related legislation, with the definition in the coal award. It amends the definition of ‘eligible employee’ and introduces definitions of ‘employee’ and ‘employer’ to ensure that the scheme applies universally in the black coal industry.
I wish to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and the Rudd government for recognising the unique historical circumstances surrounding long service leave in the black coal mining industry and ensuring through this amendment that existing arrangements are present and preserved for employees and that employers are reimbursed from the fund in respect of the long service leave payments that they make to eligible employees. I would also like to put on the record my appreciation to Graham Kelly, the Secretary of the United Mineworkers Federation (Northern District), for his strong advocacy on this issue on behalf of coalminers in the Hunter Valley.
We are all aware of the importance of the coal industry to our local, state and national economy. The mining of black coal is one of Australia’s most important industries, creating significant employment in regional Australia, providing fuel for low-cost electricity generation and steel making, and creating vital export income. Australia is the world’s biggest coal exporter and black coal is Australia’s largest export. The coal industry in Newcastle is thriving. The Rudd government contributed $580 million to improving the coal chain between the Hunter Valley and the port of Newcastle, one of the most important arterial freight lines in the country. The construction at the port of the third coal terminal, the NCIG terminal, is almost complete, and there are plans for a fourth terminal with Port Waratah Coal Services. There has been significant private investment, with $1.4 billion for the expansion of coalmines under way as well as for rolling stock and export infrastructure, and negotiations are happening now around a further possible $5 billion expansion.
Some recent articles from the MiningCoal website shed further light on the bright outlook for the coal industry in Newcastle. The website reported in September that coalmining companies that use the port of Newcastle say they are confident of doubling exports within seven years—that is, going from the current 100 million tonnes to 200 million tonnes. There are also longer term plans to triple coal exports from our port to 300 million tonnes. The news came following the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s re-approval of the port’s coal export quota system. A further report in October said that coal exports from Australia’s Newcastle port have jumped 35 per cent as mining shipments with Japanese utilities increase.
There has been a scaremongering campaign coming from some within the coalmining industry regarding the impact an emissions trading scheme would have on the industry. I have talked about it in the House before, so I will not go into all that again; however, when you note the developments and expansion that the industry is planning for in Newcastle and the Hunter—$1.4 billion now and a further $5 billion over the next decade—then you can see that coal and the coalmining industry are strong and sustainable in the Hunter region. One need only turn to perhaps the real representatives of the coal industry, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, to see that much of what has been said about the ETS by the business end of the industry is unfounded. In an article that appeared in the Australian newspaper last month written by Matthew Stevens, CFMEU president, Tony Maher, accused the Australian Coal Association of running a deceptive scare campaign. Maher said the coal industry would continue to grow with an ETS, even if not as quickly.
Today I congratulate the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Climate Change and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change in releasing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in its now revised form—in particular, its support for the coal sector. A total of $1.5 billion in transitional assistance will be provided to the coal sector over five years. This is an increase from the $750 million previously—so a doubling—and the government will commit $270 million to the coalmine abatement fund through the Climate Change Action Fund to assist gassy coalmines reduce their emissions. In addition, the current COAG renewable energy target review process will consider whether the new waste coalmine gas project should be eligible. This is a considerable investment into the future of people like those in Newcastle and the people of the Hunter Valley. It is very welcomed and it gives us great confidence.
Resistance to the ETS—and it has been considerable—is something that I am amazed at. I represent the city of Newcastle and we just commemorated the 10-year anniversary of the closure of the BHP steelworks. At that time it was said that we were ruined—our economy would be ruined. It was said that the loss of jobs would be staggering and that we would never recover. At that time, state and federal governments provided some adjustment funds. I now point to our economy which shows 4.4 per cent unemployment during a global financial crisis; I point to the productivity and growth within Newcastle and the fact that its greatest employment sectors and growth sectors are knowledge based.
We have nothing to fear from an ETS and much to embrace. It will be the catalyst for wonderful change. It will be the catalyst for new investment, productivity, efficiency and innovation. It is something in our region that we have been preparing for for some time. In valuing our coal industry while also appreciating that there will be pressures on energy provision, we have invested—as has this government—into the clean energy sector and the renewables sector. We are preparing. We know what it is like to be resilient and adaptive. An ETS will provide that adjustment catalyst for industry to make those adjustments, to diversify, to enrich their efficiency and innovation, to value add to their activities and to remain totally productive and to potentially create greater industries around the country.
I have to say to the many people who have feared for the loss of their job, because of the Australian Coal Association’s campaign, that we do not have anything to fear from our adapting to this changing world environment and to change that is supported so strongly through our ETS and, in this case, with particularly strong support for the coal industry. This bill being debated , though, is further demonstration of the commitment by the Rudd government to supporting not just the coal industry but the jobs and employment rights of people around this country. It is recognition of the importance of the coal industry to our nation’s economy and to my region’s economy. It will provide invaluable support and assistance to those involved in the industry and it will give them comfort that their entitlements—ones that they have been entitled to since 1949—will be protected and that their long service leave provisions will not be diminished in any way. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I thank members for their contribution to the debate on the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. This bill implements a series of measures that have been agreed to by the coalmining industry working party, which consists of both employer and employee stakeholders. The measures in the bill will apply portable long service leave entitlements and the supporting funding arrangements universally in the black coal mining industry from 1 January 2010.
The black coal mining industry has a long-standing, unique arrangement whereby employees have accessed portable long service leave entitlements under the terms of federal awards since 1949. The long service leave entitlement set out in the Coal Mining Industry (Production and Engineering) Consolidated Award 1997—13 weeks after eight years continuous service in the industry—was established in 1966. The funding arrangements administered by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation have been in place since 1993. Given these historical circumstances and the joint representations made by industry and unions to government requesting that the existing long service leave entitlement arrangements for the industry are maintained and administered consistently throughout the entire industry, the government is pleased to put forward this legislation. I am glad to see that it has the support of all members of this place, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2009-11-24,"—It is very disappointing that my favourite Rudd government minister is not able to stay for my contribution this evening to the debate on the ACIS Administration Amendment (Application) Bill 2009.
—It better be good!
—And, to the member for Wakefield, the contribution will be short. Thank you for the intro. As I understand it, this bill corrects a technical error in a piece of legislation that we discussed not too long ago in this place. The government’s New Car Plan for a Greener Future committed to providing motor vehicle producers with a smooth transition to the new Automotive Transformation Scheme by providing increased assistance under ACIS in 2010. It was also the government’s decision that this additional assistance be conditional on the enactment of the Automotive Transformation Scheme Act 2009, which occurred on 29 September 2009.
The amendment corrects, as the government has termed it, the unintended consequence arising from the link between the ACIS Administrative Amendment Act 2009 and the commencement of the Automotive Transformation Act 2009. It is a technical amendment that would give formal effect to the legislation already considered in parliament and would honour the original intent of the legislation.
The bill clarifies that the commencement date for the ACIS act is 1 January 2010 and not 1 July 2010. The coalition do not oppose this piece of legislation. We do have some questions, which I will put in Hansard for the consideration of the minister. How was the unintended consequence of the original legislation overlooked? When was the mistake found? Was this due to a lack of consultation with industry? And was it, as we see with so many pieces of Rudd government legislation, a last-minute rush job which resulted in this error? These are issues which, I am sure, the minister will address in his summing up of this bill, which fixes an administrative error.
Obviously, over the 11½ years of the coalition government the car industry received an enormous amount of support, particularly in my home state of South Australia, including Holden, which is located in the member for Wakefield’s electorate and which employs many people who live in the member for Makin’s electorate, and also Mitsubishi, which was in the member for Boothby’s electorate. However, it decided not too long ago to terminate its operations in Australia. I think that highlights a potential issue we will have going forward with this industry as the challenges become greater than they are today. As we said in the debate on the original legislation, this place and the government of the time will need to consider just how much assistance this country is willing to give to this industry. I acknowledge that it is an important industry in certain parts of Australia, but it is also a lot of money that we are paying.
The amendments that we moved in the consideration in detail stage of the original bill provided transparency, and it was a pity that the government did not see the reasons for those amendments. It is something that is worth while considering, because they are large sums of money we are talking about with this industry and there are important considerations for employment in certain areas. There is a very thick set of jobs in certain areas and we are seeing that, with the assistance packages for Holden workers, more are taking them up than was expected.
It will be a challenging time for not only the car industry but also the associated industries and communities. I suspect that this subject is difficult and touchy for many people and it is very difficult to manage. I know that the member for Wakefield is intensely interested in this issue, and we all look forward very much to his contribution to this debate, as we do to the contribution of the member for Makin. On that note, I will conclude my remarks.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I take this opportunity to speak about the ACIS Administration Amendment (Application) Bill 2009. I note with interest that the three speakers on this amending legislation are all from South Australia, which I suspect indicates, at least, the level of support for the automotive industry via the South Australian representatives in this chamber. That is certainly the case in respect of the member for Wakefield, who is in the chamber, and me because there is no question that we believe the automotive industry is absolutely vital to the long-term future prosperity of South Australia and, in particular, to those families which are employed and which, in many cases, have been for a long time, at the GM plant at Elizabeth.
The bill corrects an anomaly that would have resulted in automotive manufacturers receiving a lower amount of money than was intended under the Australia Competitiveness and Investment Scheme during the transition period until the Automotive Transformation Scheme came into effect. This was an unintended consequence. The Automotive Transformation Scheme was implemented and during the transition phase it became obvious that automotive manufacturers would have in fact been paid less than they would otherwise have expected under the old ACIS. The importance of those payments should not be understated at all. By way of background, the automotive industry in Australia directly employs some 63,000 people across the country and there would be around another 100,000 employed in the supply chain and support industries to the automotive manufacturers. The industry contributes $7.7 billion a year to the Australian economy, and we still have automotive plants in Victoria and South Australia—manufacturing Toyotas and Fords in Victoria and manufacturing Holdens in South Australia.
What is just as important in respect of the automotive industry is that certainly in South Australia, and I expect it is the case in Victoria, it underpins invaluable research, design, innovation and engineering right across the manufacturing sector. Without a viable automotive sector, many of those smaller industries involved, whether it is in research, design, innovation or engineering, would simply not be able to survive. In fact, if we lost the automotive industry the result would undoubtedly be an undermining of the ability and capacity of Australia to continue to manufacture goods. To its credit, the Howard government recognised this and, in 2001, introduced the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. After being in place for only one year, the scheme was extended for a further 10 years and was due to continue to 2015. This, quite rightly, highlighted the importance of the automotive sector to the Australian economy.
When the Rudd government came to office, time had moved on. We had seen tariffs reduced in 2005, from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, which in turn had some impact on the industry. The Rudd government commissioned the Bracks inquiry, which resulted in A New Car Plan for a Greener Future for Australia. The Rudd government committed $6.2 billion towards ensuring that the plan can be implemented over the next decade, and within that funding is, of course, the $3.4 billion associated with the Automotive Transformation Scheme.
We all know that the global financial crisis has literally decimated the automotive industry across the world, particularly in the Western countries. When you combine that with the competition that automotive manufacturers in the Western world are now experiencing from new car plants in developing countries, you can understand why this is an industrial sector that has some real challenges ahead. Schemes such as the Automotive Transformation Scheme and the ACIS scheme are vital to the survival of the automotive industry in Australia and will be even more so when tariffs are reduced from 10 per cent to five per cent from 1 January 2010.
The GM plant in the northern region of Adelaide—and I note that the member for Wakefield is in the chamber and I am sure he will speak in a similar vein in a moment on this matter—has been there since the mid-1940s. I cannot recall the exact date but it has been there for around 60 years. For the last 60 years it has been the critical industry that has sustained that region. Whilst over the years that region has expanded and many other industries have also been established there, the fact is that they were all drawn to the region because of the presence of the GM operations in Elizabeth.
Only yesterday, when I was speaking on the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009, I referred to the case of the Bridgestone plant in Salisbury, which opened in 1964 but, sadly, is planned to close in April next year, with the loss of some 600 jobs. Only recently the member for Wakefield, the member for Port Adelaide, the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator the Hon. Mark Arbib, representatives of the ETU, the AMWU and the LHMU and I attended the Bridgestone plant to ensure that the employees there are being provided with the necessary support as part of transitioning to other employment and in respect of any redundancy payments due. I reiterate what I said yesterday: I compliment the work of all those unions and, in particular, David Di Troia, the secretary of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, who along with his team has been working diligently to ensure that all of the people at that plant, the majority of whom are members of his union, are given their rightful entitlements. In that respect, I also acknowledge the contribution made by the federal and state governments of $5.7 million—over $4 million of which came from the federal government—to support those workers. That is a classic case of the importance of the GM operations to that region. I have no doubt that it was a result of the downturn in production at the GM plant that contributed to the closure of the Bridgestone plant. So you do not have to go very far to understand the importance of the automotive manufacturers to the regions, wherever they are established in Australia.
On a positive note, I was pleased to read that the GM operation at Elizabeth has begun to increase its production of motor vehicles. I understand that production has in fact now risen from 310 vehicles per day to 340. That is encouraging. But none of that would have been possible had GMH not been supported by the federal government over the last decade. Again, the previous government needs to be recognised for that, and certainly the Rudd government’s $6.2 billion automotive restructuring plan will ensure that we continue to have a viable automotive industry.
There is, of course, another element to ensuring that we continue to have a viable automotive industry. The proposal we are looking at, A New Car Plan for a Greener Future—and the title quite rightly says, ‘a greener future’—is all about designing and building cars that create lower emissions. That goes hand in glove with the very issue we are confronted with in Australia and across the world in reducing carbon emissions—a matter that is the subject of debate before this parliament right now and which will be debated in Copenhagen next month. As the Prime Minister has said time and time again, it is a matter that is in the national interest. If we can support car manufacturers in this country, it will ensure not only that there is some economic benefit but also that, simultaneously, there will be the benefit of producing lower emission vehicles than are currently being produced. Unless they do that, the reality is that they will find themselves coming under increased competition from overseas manufacturers and designers who are doing exactly that and who are perhaps gradually increasing their market share in Australia because they are manufacturing cars that produce lower emissions.
I represent an electorate where many of the families who work at the GM operations at Elizabeth live. They are very much dependent on the future survival of that plant. This amendment bill, as I said, corrects an anomaly in the legislation that was introduced into this House earlier. In so doing it will enable the GM operations, particularly at this point in time when they have some very serious challenges ahead of them, to continue their operations.
I support the amendment. The member for Mayo talked about whether this amendment arises because of a lack of consultation at the time that the original legislation was introduced. Can I say, as someone who has taken the trouble to read this legislation in detail and to look at exactly the way in which the New Car Plan for a Greener Future and the Automotive Transformation Scheme are structured, that this is a very complex matter. It is not surprising and it is not unusual that unintended consequences are highlighted once a piece of legislation is brought into the House. That is exactly what has happened here. The fact of the matter is that the legislation will correct that anomaly. It will correct it in time, before the Automotive Transformation Scheme payments come into effect. Therefore, there has been no detriment to the automotive industry at all. The very fact that it has been brought into this House at this point of time shows that the government is on the ball with this legislation. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—It is a great honour to follow my colleague the member for Makin, who always speaks in a very intelligent manner and with a great deal of knowledge and street smarts. He was a great mayor of the great council of Salisbury. I was happy to be a resident of Salisbury and happy to vote for you Tony too, on occasion. You always did a great job by those in my electorate and also by those in the electorates of Port Adelaide and Makin. You have a long history of serving the northern suburbs.
It is also always interesting to follow the member for Mayo, who has departed to the party room for the CPRS debate—no doubt to participate in that cage match that they are having. It is a bit of a cage fight. It reminds me of that movie Fight Club. Do you remember Fight Club? Underground boxing by people who should know better but do not? Young men just punching on, I think is the expression. There is no doubt that a Liberal Party meeting is a lot like that at the moment. But I digress and I should be discussing the importance of manufacturing in Australia.
This industry is tremendously important to Australia. It produces billions of dollars in export revenue, it directly employs over 50,000 people and it indirectly employs thousands more. These people need our support and encouragement to keep making the great products that they make. This government knows that if you do not have car manufacturing—if your country does not have a car manufacturing industry—then generally you have very little manufacturing full stop. This is a government and a Prime Minister that want to see Australia as a country that makes things, that makes elaborately transformed manufactures. As Paul Keating used to often say: ‘We don’t just want to be a mine or a quarry or a beach for the rest of the world. We want to make things and we want to export things.’
This industry is tremendously important to South Australia. I cannot stress its importance enough. Despite all the tribulations of the previous decade—losing Mitsubishi and losing many component firms associated with car and other forms of manufacturing—manufacturing is still the heart and soul of the South Australian economy. Defence manufacturing is increasingly important and it is interesting to note that the Rann government has won some $44 billion worth of defence contracts in recent times. Manufacturing has been tremendously important to the wine industry, which has a big impact as an employer and an exporter in my electorate and the areas adjacent to it.
Of course car manufacturing is where it all began, when Sir Thomas Playford, a great Liberal premier of our state, went out to the world in his own particular fashion. It is hard to imagine a more humble man—he was a cherry farmer from the Adelaide Hills—but he marched into various boardrooms and convinced them to invest in South Australia. That is why a lot of companies like Holden and Bridgestone set up in South Australia. There are a lot of great stories about the foundation of manufacturing in South Australia. In my heartland in northern Adelaide, in the city of Playford and the city of Salisbury, one in four workers is a manufacturing worker. The income they earn is tremendously important to their families. Manufacturing jobs tend to be well paid, they tend to have good conditions and, despite what some people say, they do have good secure futures. If you doorknock places like Salisbury, Elizabeth or Gawler or even the country towns to the north, like the town I grew up in, Kapunda, you will find vehicle industry workers from Holden, Bridgestone, Futuris and the hundreds of small engineering firms that get their business from manufacturing either in the food area, in cars or in defence. Manufacturing has been important to the identity and the culture of the northern suburbs of Adelaide. Holden is still a major sponsor of the Central District footy club.
—Premiers!
—Boo!
—The premiers this year, as we are many years. I hear the member for Adelaide, who would be disappointed of course because a couple of years ago the Bays, of which her family are great supporters, went down in a screaming heap yet again. It will happen one day for the Bays, I am sure, as it will happen one day for Sturt or North Adelaide—one of them. One of them will win, eventually. But I digress again.
This government has been tremendously supportive of the manufacturing industry, and our New Car Plan for a Greener Future contains the Automotive Transformation Scheme, which works in tandem with the ACIS Administration Amendment (Application) Bill. It starts in 2010. It provides $3.4 billion in grants to industry for research and development to improve environmental outcomes and work skills development. It is all about renewing this industry and making sure it has a future in Australia. It is all about helping it to adjust to a greener economy.
This assistance also takes into account the reduction in automotive tariffs from 10 per cent to five per cent in January 2010. This reduction will mean that Australia’s tariffs on passenger vehicles are amongst the lowest in the world. In fact, we will have the fifth most open market for cars in the world, and that is an important signal to the rest of the world about free trade. It is an important message at the moment about learning the lessons from the Great Depression and avoiding protectionism, particularly during a period of economic crisis and declines in world trade. That is obviously a larger global issue. We often wait for other nations to practically implement some of their rhetoric around free trade and not just talk about it. I have told the House a few times of my reservations about rapid tariff reductions, and I still hold those reservations. Australia does lead by example in this area, and my electors hope that the rest of the world follows at Doha. It is tremendously important to the world’s economic growth, but it is also important for the rest of the world to match Australia’s performance in this area.
This bill does correct an unintended consequence that would have produced a three-month gap in support from 1 January 2010 to 31 March 2010, which occurred through the linking of this scheme, ACIS, with the Automotive Transformation Scheme. Such things happen; you just have to get on and fix them. Nobody is immune to oversights or mistakes, and we are correcting this one.
The content of the bill basically delinks assistance from a calculation based on an ever-declining tariff rate to a new calculation based on the flat rate of 7.5 per cent, and it treats the value of cars the same, regardless of whether they are produced for domestic or export markets. That is an important thing to do.
As I conclude, I would like to make a few remarks about Bridgestone and about some of the economic dislocation that is occurring in the western and northern suburbs of Adelaide. Even before Bridgestone, we had faced over 3,000 redundancies, and a lot of those jobs were manufacturing jobs. If you want to know about the toll of the economic crisis then you need to come to western Adelaide or northern Adelaide.
It is tremendously damaging to people’s lives and to their families to lose a job and have to go on the hunt for a new one. It produces uncertainty and economic hardship, and it unsettles families and communities. We want to avoid that at all costs, which is one of the reasons why we have invested in the economy and put stimulus into the economy, because we know that, without that, thousands more would join the job queue. And that figure does not include Bridgestone; it does not include the 600 who will face an uncertain future as they come to the end of that plant’s life.
Many of these workers devoted decades of their lives to this plant, and it is not just a job for them; it is a way of life. Making tyres is a way of life. It is about their workmates and friends, who are more like a family than any other relationship. It is about losing stability and certainty about where they work and what they earn. Many of those workers face an uncertain future, and no-one in this House or outside of it can predict the individual paths that they will take from here.
We have unions fighting for better wages. The government has visited the plant and has pledged resources for retraining. We have an excellent local employment coordinator, a lady named Pippa Webb, on the ground drumming up enthusiasm and putting employers who do want to employ Bridgestone workers together with those workers. There are some employers who have come to the party already, and I certainly congratulate them. But, in the end, no-one can predict the future for these workers, and such circumstances breed worry, anxiety and anger, and it is perfectly justified that these workers feel this way.
When we visited the plant, along with the members for Makin and Port Adelaide and the Minister for Employment Participation, Mark Arbib, we took a tour through the plant. Such tours are always a little stage-managed by companies, I think it would be fair to say, and workers are never entirely frank. But we did have a few interactions with some of these workers that just brought home what they face.
One fellow who we stopped to talk to had previously had a WorkCover injury—he had an injured arm—but he was still working. The first thing he said to us was, ‘I want to work; I am a worker,’ and you could just tell that, for him, that was the priority—that he get another job and have the dignity of looking after himself and his family. He did not want to go on the dole. He did not want a redundancy. He did not want to have to face uncertainty and unemployment. And I think that is commendable. These are the people that you are dealing with—good people; working-class people.
Another worker I met had to suffer the indignity of hearing from a relative that his job was gone. He was a night-shift worker. His brother-in-law rang him to tell him that the plant was closing; he had seen it on the news. I think that is a terrible indignity for anybody to have to endure—to be told by a friend or a relative who has seen it on the news before you have heard it yourself. And if there is one message I want to give to companies, it is this: there is absolutely no excuse in this day and age for a worker to hear from someone else or from the news about their job being finished. These days, with text messages, emails and telephone calls, communication is instantaneous. You can have instantaneous communication with your workers—and Holden does this. When Holden has a significant change to any part of its plant or its production schedule, they make sure the workers know before the media know—that the workers know before anybody else knows. That is a really empowering thing to do. It is the decent thing to do. And it is in the company’s self-interest, too, because you get the one message going out to workers; they are not left in the dark.
I have seen many redundancies—at John Martins, at places like Harris Scarfe, and at textiles factories like Levi’s in Adelaide. It is always a terrible process; it is always a difficult process. It is never pleasant for employers or employees. But it can be done properly, which means telling workers first, giving them accurate information and giving them certainty about their entitlements, about production schedules, about retraining options, about time off for a new job and about the method of paying redundancies—whether they can leave for a new job and still get their redundancy. These are all important things to do. Communicating with workers is an important thing to do. It makes a difficult process more bearable and it allows people to leave their jobs with some dignity and without bitterness or anger.
It is my hope that Bridgestone adopt a best practice approach to their closure, but I am very fearful that they will not. I am very fearful that this company will get it wrong and that there will be a bitter taste left in these workers’ mouths. Despite all the efforts of their unions and of this government, that is my fear. If there is one message I would like to leave the House and Bridgestone with it is that you have to actually do this right. It is not good enough to just pack up and leave Australia and leave these workers in the lurch and not to a good job in saying goodbye. If it has to be goodbye, then do it properly.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I thank those who have spoken on the ACIS Administration Amendment (Application) Bill 2009: the member for Groom, the member for Mayo, the member for Makin and the member for Wakefield. I do not know the member for Wakefield all that well, although I am getting to know him. I do know, though, that he—
—Don’t get too close!
—I am being urged not to get to know him to well. Fortune favours the brave and I will stick on my present course—
 (Ms JA Saffin)—Ignore the interjections, Minister.
—They are very disruptive, that is right. I do know that he has represented vulnerable workers during most of his working life before coming into this parliament and he has had to experience and work through the sort of dislocation that he has just described in respect of Bridgestone with textile, clothing and footwear workers. You have heard from the member for Wakefield some of the human costs associated with the dislocation and closure of plants and so on. When there is a story of human turmoil, the family is often badly affected. I think his call for businesses to be as sensitive and helpful and supportive as possible should be endorsed by everyone in the chamber. I know the member for Makin would join me in making those observations and urging that we always need to be mindful of the terrible consequences for families of people losing their jobs—and he told of the loss of the dignity of work in one particular story.
In summing up the bill I point out that the bill does amend the ACIS Administration Amendment Act 2009 to correct an unintended consequence arising from the act’s link with the commencement date of the Automotive Transformation Scheme Act 2009. Under a New Car Plan for a Greener Future, the government announced additional support through the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme to smooth the transition to the Automotive Transformation Scheme. The additional support, estimated at $79.6 million, delinks the assistance rate for cars produced in 2010 from the general tariff rate and replaces it with a flat rate of 7.5 per cent. It also equalises the treatment of cars produced in 2010 for the export market with cars produced in 2010 for the domestic market. The unintended consequence, if not corrected by this bill, would be that not all the additional support would be provided, and this would diminish the ability of Australian vehicle producers to continue their recovery from the global economic crisis.
I would quickly point out, too, that figures on motor vehicle sales in Australia came out yesterday and they are quite encouraging. I would add that the commentary on motor vehicle sales from the National Australia Bank points to the influence of the small business tax break and the fact that businesses appear to be getting in on that tax break before its expiry date of 31 December.
I was asked by the member for Mayo to provide information to the parliament on when this oversight was detected and whether there was ample industry consultation. The advice to me is that the oversight was detected on 12 November and that there was ample industry consultation.
By including an application provision, the bill clarifies that the government is providing additional assistance under ACIS for motor vehicle production from 1 January 2010, not 1 July 2010, as currently provided by the act. This amendment delivers the certainty promised to this vital manufacturing industry as it moves into a new area where economic sustainability is driven by investment in innovation. I commend the bill to the House.
Question agreed to.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2009-11-24,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009. The purpose of this bill is to establish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, ACRE—that is, the board and the position of chief executive officer. ACRE is an initiative under the government’s Clean Energy Initiative, CEI, and will complement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the expanded renewable energy target by supporting the research, development and demonstration of low-emission and renewable energy technologies.
The Clean Energy Initiative, announced in the 2009-10 budget, also includes the Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships Program, involving funding to support the construction and demonstration of large-scale integrated carbon capture and storage projects in Australia; the Solar Flagships Program, involving funding to support the construction and demonstration of large-scale solar power stations in Australia; and the Australian Solar Institute, which will support solar research and development and encourage collaboration between Australian researchers and with international solar researchers and institutes.
The previous coalition government made a substantial investment of more than $2 billion in renewable and clean energy sources, including the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund of $500 million, of which $350 million was committed to projects; Australian Asia-Pacific projects, worth $100 million, with a further $50 million committed for 2007 and beyond; the Renewable Energy Development Initiative, which was $100 million; and the mandatory renewable energy target, or MRET, which stimulated $3.5 billion in renewable energy investment after its introduction in 2001. Domestic level support included a photovoltaic rebate program, worth $202 million; a solar hot water rebate, at $252.2 million; the Green Vouchers for Schools program, at $336.1 million; and Solar Cities, at $75 million.
The coalition’s commitment to renewables was further evidenced in our successful negotiations earlier this year on the renewable energy target. The coalition supports Australia’s transition to a lower emissions economy. But this transition must take place in a manner that does not jeopardise our energy security. Australia will need ongoing investment in alternative energy sources. We must consider, firstly, how to best make the transition to low emissions technology without risking jobs or investment and, secondly, what role Australia will play in the international supply of clean energy.
Debate in Australia has been about both of these issues but has been almost exclusively confined to the context of clean coal development. Sure, it is an important technology, not least of all because 37 per cent of the world’s power supply comes from coal. In Australia, 80 per cent of our energy comes from coal. The Rudd government must face up to the very real questions about how soon clean coal technology will be available for commercial use, what it will cost per megawatt hour and how much taxpayers will need to pay to subsidise the technology. Data released by the Rudd government’s own Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute shows that clean coal power stations are unlikely to be viable until at least 2030.
There is still no commercial scale clean coal power station anywhere in the world. Because we are the world’s largest exporter of coal, our future is undeniably bound up with the viability of the coal industry. We cannot sweep under the carpet legitimate questions about how Australia’s baseload energy requirements can be met at the same time as a reduction in emissions from coal. Australia’s rapidly expanding gas industry has the ability to provide cleaner energy, and renewables will deliver 20 per cent of Australia’s energy by 2020. However, to ensure Australia’s energy security, a comprehensive mix is required. Gas, geothermal, solar, wind and clean coal research all have a role to play.
We are not alone in facing the challenges of a transition to low emissions technology that does not compromise standards of living. But Australia is increasingly isolated in terms of the Rudd government’s blatant refusal to consider the possibility of nuclear energy. All but four of the other G20 member countries use nuclear energy. Sooner or later Australia must have an open-minded and full debate about the role of nuclear energy. It is a question that the community should have full ownership of, but it is one the Rudd government is determined to smother. Australia needs serious clean energy alternatives that can be delivered at an affordable price in the short, medium and long term. The establishment of a national body such as ACRE by this government could not come sooner for the energy and resources sectors and the science community—in fact, for all Australians wanting to support renewable energies in Australia. It is hoped that the Rudd government is capable of ensuring that ACRE achieves the objectives it is designed to accomplish, those being strategies to develop, commercialise and use renewable energy technologies.
Australia is home to one of the most diverse landscapes in the world, with each state responsible for exploring, researching and developing its own energy resources. These investments by each state in gathering information on renewable energy rightly ensure that residents and state businesses reap the benefits. However, this approach lessens the positive impact of information sharing between the states. The silos of information held within the states are traditionally guarded by the relevant agencies and the establishment of an umbrella authority, at least in theory, will ensure a cohesive arrangement of information sharing between the states. ACRE’s intention is to address this very real lack of national coordination amongst renewable energy technology programs, and it is strongly hoped that the government will ensure the integrity of ACRE is not compromised to the same degree as the government’s Energy Efficient Homes package. This scheme provided ceiling insulation worth up to $1,600, prior to its being wound back to $1,200, for Australian householders, including owner-occupiers, landlords and tenants of currently uninsulated homes or homes with very little ceiling insulation.
The Energy Efficient Homes package is currently the subject of a Senate inquiry. This inquiry is into, but not limited to, the rorting and abuse of the rebate; the waste, inefficiency and mismanagement within the program; what advice was provided to the government on safety matters, particularly in relation to fire and electrocution risks; and to what degree the government acted on this advice. By the way, submissions for this inquiry should be received by 18 December this year and the inquiry is due to report by 30 March 2010. One of the most blatant rorting scams to emerge under the Rudd government’s controversial pink batts program was when $1,600 was paid to insulate a house set for immediate demolition. After it had been insulated, the house was vacated to make way for a new bus way. Imagine the shock for the former owner when she received a letter from Peter Garrett’s department confirming it had just paid $1,600 to an installer to insulate the property. The house was demolished just a week after the insulation was claimed to have been installed in July. Reports of a couple receiving separate quotes—$300 and $1,600—for the same job is another example of the Rudd government’s mishandling of the Energy Efficient Homes package. Reputed to be a billion-dollar blow-out, this package reeks of waste and rorting.
Industry leaders warned earlier this year that inexperienced and ill-trained installers would put themselves and homeowners at risk of electrocution and fire with their shoddy work. With one installer electrocuted and numerous others receiving serious shocks, this advice, which was not acted upon, has come back to haunt the Labor government. Authorities have also issued warnings after dozens of house fires have been started by incorrectly installed ceiling insulation. In fact, fire and consumer bodies in five states have warned of fires caused by insulation placed over hot downlights or ceiling fans.
Upon the eventual admittance that there were huge problems associated with the installation, the Rudd government finally set up a program to randomly check the work of the insulation installers. The checking is done by people with little or no insulation installation experience who sit through an induction lasting 30 to 45 minutes before they are sent out with a ladder and a torch to check on the installers. So from beginning to end this whole insulation debacle has demonstrated why we are right to call a Senate inquiry into the government’s wasteful insulation program.
With mounting evidence of a lack of cohesion and harmony within the Rudd government towards their policies, it is imperative that the government listen to all stakeholders and not give free rein to themselves in an area that is as important as renewable energy. It is with pride that I acknowledge the ongoing contribution of Western Australia to this new and exciting chapter in Australia’s energy and resources sector, despite the many failed promises made to ordinary Western Australians by this government. In Western Australia, in which my electorate of Kalgoorlie encompasses the largest electoral landmass in Australia in addition to being one of the most resource-rich areas in Australia, there are currently five areas of major initiative being undertaken with regard to renewable energy projects. These areas of renewable energy are hydro, wind, biomass and solar energy—photovoltaic and solar thermal. In addition, wave energy technology is being tested with some degree of success.
We look forward in the very immediate future to huge increases in the demand for renewable power. We are greatly concerned about the issue of climate change or weather change. We are also concerned about energy security. Perhaps I should say we ought to be more concerned about energy security because, as we move to legislate to make the generation of coal fired power less palatable and more costly—and I remind you that 80 per cent of Australia’s power currently comes from coal power production—we need to be very careful indeed that ACRE does its jobs, and I will refer to one of the jobs that it might do, and do well, given its objectives. I remind you, Madam Deputy Speaker, of what ACRE’s objectives are, and I will quote them:
ACRE’s objectives will be to promote the development, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy …
Specifically, amongst other things, it will do this by:
managing the cost effective delivery of Government funded renewable energy and enabling technology programs;
…            …            …
fostering collaboration between governments, industry and the research community on renewable energy projects;
…                     …                   …
any other activities that it is directed to do by the Government to support renewable energy and enabling technologies.
The elephant in the room undeniably in relation to greenhouse gas emissions reduction is the generation of electricity by the use of nuclear energy. The purists will argue that nuclear energy is not renewable energy because we only have a certain amount of uranium resources. But it is generally accepted at this point in time that Australia has some 40 per cent of the world’s known uranium resources, and it would seem fairly obvious to even a blind man that, given the richness of this resource within Australia, Australia—and especially this government—ought be at least considering, with all of the hullabaloo going on about reducing greenhouse gases, the use of nuclear energy. Many critics of nuclear energy—and I am talking about the informed critics of nuclear energy; I am not talking about those who remain with their head firmly in the sand—will suggest to you, quite rightly, that, with the competition of brown coal as a source of energy, nuclear energy is not financially viable, and I accept that.
But we are moving to an era where it is becoming more and more popular to embrace those energy sources that do not produce greenhouse gases. If we in this place could enlarge our minds for a moment, we need to consider another problem that this great nation of ours is facing: the issue of a shortage of water, and more specifically potable water. We have a major issue of wanting to avoid the generation of greenhouse gases. We have the major issue of guaranteeing water supply, specifically potable water supply. And we have the detractors suggesting we cannot have nuclear energy because we do not have the mass necessary to justify a plant of a size whereby there is economy of scale.
I put it to the House that in addition to those two problems, with nuclear energy we could solve a third one. Currently the largest of our cities, at certain times of the year, have to suffer the problem of smog and exhaust gas created hazardous atmospheres. If we were to locate somewhere within a coastal region of south-eastern Australia a very safe generation IV nuclear power plant, we could size that power plant to a point whereby excess energy, excess electricity created—not required by those populations within easy transmission reach—could be used to extract hydrogen from water. And with the development of the hydrogen fuel cell and the development of motor vehicles using that form of energy conversion, we could be running cities with hydrogen fuel cell driven vehicles that would generate no pollution whatsoever. The only conversion that takes place is that oxygen is taken from the atmosphere and electricity and water are produced. We could perhaps either keep the water onboard to water the garden when we get home, or we could dampen down the streets for dust suppression. But it is a very simple solution. That is just one part of a possible justification of building nuclear power plants to a critical mass size. Perhaps I should not use ‘critical mass’ in the same speech that is talking about the use of nuclear energy.
The problem with potable water supply and the recognition today that desalinated water is going to be our saviour in the future for cities’ potable water supply, that is what a generation IV nuclear power plant can do most efficiently—that is, to take seawater or saline water and produce potable water. Given that we are looking at population increases, given that we are looking at the change in the weather and the fact that we want to guarantee our water supply, including potable water supply, and given we want to clean up the atmosphere in cities, I suggest to this place that the great solution as we move into the future contemplating many forms of non-polluting energy sources, including renewable energy sources—if we are fair dinkum in this place about coming up with solutions and enabling technology to occur for the benefit of this nation and for the benefit of the people who live in this nation—then we must consider nuclear energy, nuclear power generation as a justifiable addition to the mix.
To that end, the coalition supports this bill’s recognition of and intent to address the lack of coordination within governments with regard to renewable energy technology programs which have evolved over a number of years. With the current government’s dismal track record, it is imperative that the ACRE’s aspirations are not jeopardised so as to ensure that Australia’s energy future features a mix of technologies to guarantee we can make the transition to a lower emissions economy without compromising our energy security.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—The purpose of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009 is to establish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy and the position of chief executive officer. ACRE is an initiative under the Clean Energy Initiative. It will complement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the expanded renewable energy target by supporting the research, development and demonstration of low emission and renewable energy technologies.
It is very timely that we have a debate about renewable energy today. Whatever the political pressures we are under concerning a move away from carbon based energy, and no doubt they are significant, we have a duty to take a science based, evidence based approach. I note that Senator Nick Minchin recently said on Four Corners that climate change:
For the extreme left … provides the opportunity to do what they’ve always wanted to do, to sort of de-industrialise the western world. You know the collapse of communism was a disaster for the left, and the, and really they embraced environmentalism as their new religion.
Let me observe that I do not hear anyone proposing that we de-industrialise the Western world, and I hope that Senator Minchin looks closely at this bill when it gets to the Senate. Proposals to move to solar, wind and geothermal energy, or for greater energy efficiency or for electric cars, do not represent an atom of deindustrialisation. Proposals for solar panels and rainwater tanks promote the kind of household self-reliance one would expect a champion of rugged individualism to be enthusiastic about. More worrying, it suggests that Senator Minchin is so stuck in the Cold War battles of the past, locked in time with the fall of the Berlin Wall 20 years ago, that he is going to see this issue through ideological blinkers rather than look at the science, look at the evidence, look at the facts. Apparently he would rather see his own city of Adelaide sizzle and burn than admit that the Left might be right about this issue.
Contrary to the propaganda of commentators like Senator Minchin, most people who seek to protect the environment do not want to lower their standard of living; what they seek to do is to put their lifestyle on a sustainable basis. It is true that some aspects of our lifestyle have become extravagant and excessive and that there is plenty of scope to reduce our consumption of electricity, water and vehicle fuels. But our need for electricity, for water and for cars is not going to go away, and it does not need to. What is needed is to generate that electricity, deliver that water and power our vehicles from energy sources in a way that does not trash the planet. That is why we need to move to renewable energy and that is why we need this bill.
It is said that renewable energy is not capable of meeting Australia’s baseline power needs. This is quite misleading, on three counts. First, much of the increase in power use, and therefore the increase in carbon emissions, arises at peak periods—for example, the use of air-conditioners on hot summer days. This is precisely the time at which solar power works best. Renewable energy which meets peak demand is extremely important in meeting our future energy needs. Secondly, while any given renewable energy source may be intermittent, the fact is there are many different energy sources located across many different areas of Australia. In combination, they are capable of meeting large chunks of Australia’s power needs in a predictable, reliable way. The existence of the national electricity grid facilitates this. Thirdly, it is not a matter of all or nothing. For example, wind power can operate in concert with gas fired power stations to produce power with much fewer carbon emissions than our present coal fired arrangements.
People who claim that renewable energy can only operate at the fringe of electricity generation are quite wrong. Professor Ian Lowe has pointed out that renewables now account for a quarter of the installed energy capacity of California, half of Norway’s and three-quarters of Iceland’s. Grid connected solar energy is growing at 60 per cent per annum worldwide and renewable energy industries now employ nearly two million people. These are examples of just some of the renewable technologies which are presently being applied.
Solar thermal power plants generate electricity using heat. Much like a magnifying glass, reflectors focus sunlight onto a fluid filled vessel, generating heat that drives a turbine to produce electricity. The United States and Spain are developing this technology—ironically, originally conceived in the early 1990s at the University of Sydney—with plans for over 5½ thousand megawatts of new capacity to come online by 2012. The output from these plants would be enough to power one-quarter of Australian homes. Solar photovoltaics, solar PVs, use semiconductors to convert sunlight energy into direct current electricity. Excess energy is stored in batteries for later use. It can also be fed back into the electricity grid. Australia receives enough solar energy in one day to supply half a plant’s annual energy use, but countries like Germany and Japan are way ahead of us in using this technology. There is solar hot water, which is mandatory in Israel. There is wind power. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in wind into mechanical energy.
The Texas state government is driving an effort to build 23,000 megawatts of wind-generating capacity, the equivalent of 23 coal fired power plants—enough to meet the residential needs of half of Texas’s population. It would take 4,200 wind turbines to meet all of South Australia’s energy needs. Denmark, which is two-thirds the size of Tasmania, has already installed 5,000 turbines. Then there is bioenergy generated from organic matter. This is suitable for electricity, heating and transportation. It is important to note that growing crops for bioenergy purposes should not compromise global food production or degrade native forests. Unfortunately, there is evidence of this occurring in emerging countries such as Brazil and Indonesia.
I want to say a little bit more this evening about geothermal energy. It does not get discussed much in the parliament, but it is potentially the largest source of energy in the world today. Unlike solar energy, which comes to the earth from the sun, geothermal energy comes from deep within the planet itself. Like solar energy and wind power, geothermal energy could, if properly developed, match all of the energy available from coal, oil and gas combined. Indeed, the amount of geothermal energy potentially available is, according to the United States Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, effectively unlimited. And Al Gore’s most recent book says that the amount of geothermal power available is so frequently underestimated primarily because its use as a source of electricity has long been associated with the few locations where hot water bubbles or spouts to the surface. In fact, the global geothermal resource base of stored thermal energy is very large. According to the United Nations world energy assessment report, the geothermal resource is roughly 280,000 times the annual consumption of primary energy in the world. Moreover, geothermal power has numerous advantages over any other form of energy. Unlike coal, oil and gas geothermal energy has virtually no CO2 emissions. Geothermal plants are modular and scalable. They have the smallest environmental footprint on the surface.
Like solar power, geothermal resources are available virtually everywhere on earth. It is underneath developing countries as well as wealthier countries. It is not intermittent. Once it is in place it provides power 24 hours a day. There are two kinds of geological areas where geothermal resources have traditionally been most easily located. The parts of the earth where the temperature beneath the surface gets hottest are usually located at the boundaries where tectonic plates come together and where active volcanoes are often found. There is a new and growing excitement about geothermal electricity, based on new technologies, that makes it possible to exploit sites deep in the earth that have enormous amounts of heat but lack one or more of the characteristics found in hydrothermal reservoirs. For example, many of these sites do not have water. Capturing the energy from these new non-hydrothermal resources has led to new approaches. This new technology for making geothermal power is called ‘enhanced’ or ‘engineered’ geothermal systems.
By using new technology that exploits the advances in drilling and reservoir stimulation—developed in part as a result of the frenzy of oil and gas exploration in the 20th century to create active reservoirs that emulate the properties of hydrothermal systems—geologists and engineers believe that they have found ways to produce extremely large sources of geothermal power from regions several miles deep in the crust of the earth. The geothermal resources worldwide are usually associated with volcanic activity, but we also have geothermal resources in Australia associated with heat-producing granites. Development work is underway in the Eromanga Basin in South Australia and Queensland as well as in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. The potential geothermal resource is estimated at 450 times Australia’s total energy needs. Geothermal energy could directly replace coal fired power, as it provides a constant power source.
I think that this parliament and this country need to put a greater investment of energy and effort into exploiting this great potential resource. The fact is that Australia has a lot of potential—a lot of unrealised potential—in relation to renewable energy. Australia currently sources just eight per cent of its electricity from renewable energy, down from 10 per cent in 1997. Australian electricity consumption has increased more rapidly than renewable electricity supply. This compares very unfavourably with Germany, which has 25 times more wind energy installed than Australia. Even though their wind sites are less windy than Australia’s worst commercial sites, they have six times more wind energy per person than Australia. Japan and Germany each have 24 times more solar-electric panels installed than Australia despite having significantly poorer solar resources. At the end of 2005 both of those countries had 1,400 megawatts, compared to Australia’s 60 megawatts.
So, although Australia has unrivalled solar, wind and geothermal resources and led the world in the development of solar technology, we have not been using these natural advantages in the way that we should. We have had companies move overseas for want of market support. In a 2006 review of international markets’ attractiveness to renewable energy investors, Australia ranked 16th—that is, fourth from the bottom. This is unfortunate. Globally, there is a lot of investment in renewable energy. In 2005, worldwide investment in new renewable energy was worth US$38 billion. In 2005, grid connected solar-PV power grew by 55 per cent and wind power grew by 24 per cent.
I also believe we need to look at vehicles. In June this year we saw General Motors in America go into bankruptcy. This company basically failed to see where petrol prices were going and failed to see where consumers were going. Our car manufacturers need to think seriously about manufacturing cars that run only on electricity. China, Israel and Denmark are doing this. There are companies that have produced a business plan involving the construction of car battery recharging stations at parking spaces and billing motorists online for the electricity they use. Fully charged cars would be able to travel around 160 kilometres, and for longer trips motorists would pull into stations resembling car washes and exchange their spent batteries for new ones.
The Silicon Valley based company Better Place has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and entered into agreements with Israel, Denmark, a number of governments in the United States, Renault and Nissan. Under the Better Place model, consumers can either buy or lease an electric car from the French auto maker Renault or the Japanese car maker Nissan and then purchase miles on their electric car battery in the same way people purchase mobile phone time from a mobile phone carrier. The cars are sold at a relatively low price and owners are charged operating fees. The total cost of owning an electric car, including the upfront prices and ongoing operating expenses, is expected to be less than for a conventional car.
China is seeking to become the leading producer of hybrid and all-electric cars within three years. It is behind the United States, Japan and other countries when it comes to making gas-powered vehicles, but it is skipping the current technology and hoping to get a jump on the next one. Of course, electric cars that use electricity from traditional sources produce carbon, but, if we move to renewable energy such as solar, wind, geothermal and other carbon-free methods of producing electricity, we could obviously get around this problem. That would give drivers freedom from petrol price fluctuations, and Australia would get a sustainable future for our car industry, an improved trade balance and energy independence.
Finally, I want to note that it is not just about renewable energy, it is also about energy efficiency. It is important that we have a balanced approach to this issue. I commend to the parliament the formation of the Australian Alliance to Save Energy, which intends to raise the profile of Australia’s opportunities in energy efficiency in a concerted and sustained way. Its operating model is drawn directly from the Alliance to Save Energy, headquartered in Washington, DC, and it has had senior representatives from Washington advising it during its formation phase. The Alliance to Save Energy has been at the centre of energy policy debates in the United States for over 30 years and has helped design, implement and evaluate a range of domestic and international demand-side programs and distributed-energy programs.
The government has been very active on the renewable energy front. We have had the initiatives in the 2009-10 budget, including a $4.5 billion clean energy initiative. We have had the renewable energy target legislation, which we debated and passed earlier this year. And, finally, we now have the establishment of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. I commend the government on its renewable energy initiatives and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2009-11-24,"—I have never seen a debate where there is so much hot air and so little science. I do not know why people do not actually sit down with scientists and go over this in detail. Madam Deputy Speaker, imagine that four of my Akubra hats are up on the ceiling and that the ceiling above us is a giant fluorescent light. Would those four Akubra hats stop this room from being illuminated? Clearly, they are going to have virtually no effect at all. But that is what you are saying. You are saying that 400 parts per million of carbon is going to reflect light back to earth. Let us have a look at the science of this. You have CO2 molecules floating around and you have photons—light—going upwards from the earth. The photons from the sun’s rays rebound and go back up again, and they hit the CO2 molecules.
A tiny bit of that energy is absorbed by the molecule, but basically the photon is deflected. It continues on to outer space. If you throw a rock at a boulder that is poking up, the rock will continue to go forward unless you actually hit the boulder right in the centre—otherwise, it will continue its forward momentum. It will not come back down to earth; it will continue in forward momentum. You do not have to be a scientist to work all of this out.
I am not a global warming sceptic; I am a global warming anti, as I have said on many occasions in this place. If you do not like that position, then for heaven’s sake argue the science of it in this place. This is where it needs to be argued. Having said that, we have a dramatic increase, and that is occurring at an increasing rate. We have an exponential growth here in the problem. So, whilst there is no global warming now—and I could not really see a serious problem arising for another century or two centuries, as far as global warming goes; and it is not the case in the oceans—if you increase the CO2 level of the atmosphere, you will increase the CO2 level in the oceans by exactly the same rate.
I scouted around and found out that Dr Katrina Fabricius at the Institute of Marine Science is one of the world’s renowned scientists in this field. I was told she is one of the top scientists in the world in this field—she is a very self-deprecating person and she denied that, but I think it may be true. We know the pH levels in the earth are seven—seven is neutral. Seawater is 8.1. It has a logarithmic change. A change of only 0.1 of a pH unit will result in a 30 per cent increase in hydrogen ions. They are ionic and I think they would be referred to as free radicals. Whilst I do not want to get too carried away with the science, if you have CO2 plus H2O you end up with H plus ions plus HCO3, moving on to CO3, CO2 minus, plus 2H plus.
What that means to a layman like me is that at this pH level there is a decreased number of CO3 ions because they have now become HCO3. No CO3 is available to form calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate comes from the shell of shellfish. A vast area of all ocean biodiversity is in fact shellfish. The food supply chain has at its very basis biovalves, if you like, which are shellfish. They cannot be seen by the naked eye. We can dig up eugaries under the bridge, but biovalves are very small particles—the same sort of thing but infinitely smaller. I asked: has any hard research been done? Dr Fabricius said yes. She pulled out a study, which I refer to the House: ‘Marine biocalcifiers exhibit mixed response to CO2 induced ocean acidification’. Justin Ries, Anne Cohen and Daniel McCorkle are the authors of the paper. It was in Geology, in December 2009. It is a very honest document in so far as five of the sea life that have been analysed do not show any negative response as a result of increasing carbon dioxide in the seawater, but, of the 18, the rest of them do. There is a very serious change in calcium carbonate growth as a result of the increasing carbon dioxide in the ocean.
What all that means is that we do have a problem that we may have to look at seriously in the immediate future. I think that every member of parliament in this place—even a person who may be described as being at one extreme of the debate—would say, and even I would say, that we need to take a bit of a pull on the reins. How would you do that? I had the privilege of being the mines and energy minister in the Queensland government. No greenie am I—I can assure you. I am just the opposite of a greenie and my government was an anti-greens government. We resolved to go to solar hot water systems in all of the government houses in Queensland. If we did that, over the next 10 years—and I think it was more likely to be over the next six or seven years—we would not have to build a 1,000-megawatt power station, which was about one-fifth of our generating capacity in Queensland at that stage. So what I was doing was saving the taxpayers of Queensland $1,000 million.
You might well ask: ‘Hold on a minute. You’ve got the cost of the solar hot water systems.’ They were government houses. If you added the rent and the electricity charges together, we would increase the rent to pay for the solar hot water system and of course the electricity costs would come down. The net result would be a reduction in the cost to the householder. This may sound like magic but it was no magic. We were a very hard-nosed government that could add up—almost all of us were people from private business; some of us made a lot of money and some of us had lost a lot of money as well as having made a lot of money. We knew what it was like to make an economic decision. The economic decision was taken that we would move to solar hot water systems. Very regretfully, we lost government the next year and the scheme was abandoned by the incoming Labor government—the people who come in here and preach to us about how we should be saving the planet! A CSIRO gentleman—I think it was Dr Sacher; I may stand corrected on that—got a lot of publicity for saying that the government proposal will not work. The government proposal being put up here simply will not work. It will not work because you cannot avoid being honest at some stage in government.
The government is being honest and says it will have to let them plant trees. I for one am desperately opposed to massive monoculture. On the scale that we are talking about here, literally millions of hectares would be required. That is what is going to happen. Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, your area and my area are suffering as a result of tree plantations. We are losing jobs left, right and centre because of the managed investment schemes which the last government failed to control and the current government is failing to control. An awful lot of these investors are simply looking for a way not to meet their tax burden and they are putting their money into trees. To give you some idea of what is going to happen, thousands of acres were wiped out in Ingham in the last flood. People do not understand that trees take a hell of a lot of looking after. The environments in which they are being planted, where you can have millions of hectares, are not naturally kind to trees. Trees will grow there but at a very, very restricted rate of growth, unless you can apply some irrigation to them. We planted a million trees in the most wonderful tree-friendly regime in the world in Far North Queensland during the Greening Australia campaign and I am reliably informed that only 28,000 of those trees are left.
What will happen here is that you will see the Macquarie Banks and the Goldman Sachs and all of those people growing wealthy through buying and selling securities out there, because the new security will be the carbon credits that you will buy and sell. They will be a tradeable commodity worth thousands of millions of dollars, and these people will get hundreds of millions of dollars, if not thousands of millions of dollars, for trading these securities backwards and forwards. If there is something that we are absolutely notorious for in this country, it is gambling. It comes from the fact that almost all of our forebears who were here before the Second World War and all the miners before the Boer War came out during the gold rushes. There is no doubt that built into our culture is a bit of a gambling culture. If you put thousands of millions of dollars worth of securities out there, all we are going to be doing once again in Australia is playing russian roulette with securities. We are going to plant a whole stack of trees that simply will not be there in 30 or 40 years time. We will have wasted all of this time, money and effort and we will not have reduced the CO2.
The CSIRO officers—I must praise them very highly but I do not want to embarrass them by mentioning their names—believe most profoundly that their own government is on the wrong track here. They believe that the government should be taking positive action to reduce the CO2, not relying upon the marketplace. Surely in this country we have woken up to the fact that marketism is dead—and it has almost killed Australia with it. There is no doubt about that. Manufacturing has gone and agriculture in this country is two-thirds gone. There is nothing left except the mining regime, which is now going to be destroyed by having to carry a burden and a handicap that no-one else on earth has to carry. It is going to be 25 per cent of the cost of mining. I rang three of the biggest mines in Australia to confirm this figure: 25 per cent of the cost of mining is in electricity. There seems very little doubt, and no-one is denying, that the cost of electricity is going to go through the roof when this occurs.
Let us look at the options. I refer to Professor Szokolay’s book The Solar Home. It is a book that is highly respected throughout the world. It is on the reading list of many universities around the world but particularly in the United States. The book says that 40 per cent of domestic energy consumption is in the heating of water. So we could reduce by 20 or 30 per cent domestic consumption in one hit. Madam Deputy Speaker, your area and my area are quite capable of producing 20 per cent, maybe 30 per cent, of Australia’s petrol needs. I hold up to you, as I have done many times in this House, the government’s own graph of oil production and the graph shows that up until almost 2002 we were self-sufficient in oil. As the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, has pointed out in this place on numerous occasions, that graph rapidly divides now and by 2014 Australia will have only one-third of its oil requirements met by its own indigenous reserves.
Surely we are going to do something about a situation which will cause another massive blowout in the current account and make us totally dependent upon Indonesia and the Middle East for our source of oil. That can transform itself immediately into 60 per cent indigenous if we move to ethanol. We highly praise the New South Wales government for the initiatives they are taking. I am deeply depressed to tell you that no such initiatives are coming out of Queensland. There is a lot of hot air and rhetoric—they have been promising it now for about 11 years—but nothing has transpired. On the other side of the document I am holding here, as I have held up on many occasions in this House, is a picture of a very handsome fellow in a big white Akubra hat in Sao Paulo in Brazil filling up his Holden motor car at 74c a litre. The price in Australia at the same time was 124c a litre. Unfortunately, I lost the picture of me filling up a motor car in Minnesota for 84c a litre. The United States and Brazil have ethanol; this country does not. Why doesn’t it? Because the government listens to the big corporations. The political parties are in the hands of the big corporations. That is the only reason this country, which is so suited to ethanol, has not gone there.
If we switch to an ethanol regime, no less a person than Al Gore—the greenies patron saint—nominates on I think page 136 of An Inconvenient Truth the first solution as corn ethanol. Corn ethanol is only one-third the value—it is only 29 per cent—and is only one-third as good as sugar ethanol, which is available in the electorates of the honourable member for Richmond, who has just stood down from the chair, the member for Dawson and the member for Leichhardt and my electorate. We can do it tomorrow if we get the cooperation of the government. But the government is spending $120 million on building a solar energy research centre in Canberra. What in heaven’s name? The last place on earth I would put a solar energy research centre is in Canberra. I have not got time, unfortunately, to outline to the House just what dumbness has come out of this place, but let me just give you one example.

"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2009-11-24,"—I want to raise a very important issue that concerns a substantial majority of my electorate. In particular it concerns the veterans of the Ryan electorate. This is an issue that, quite frankly, neither political party has taken to heart. It is an indictment of both parties. I regret to say that, during the time of the Howard government, we did not give this front and centre attention. But the now Labor federal government, led by Prime Minister Rudd, has been especially dismissive and should be especially sanctioned because, during the 2007 election campaign, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, told the veterans of Australia and of the Ryan electorate that, if he were elected, he would make it a priority to ensure that there was equity, fairness and justice in relation to military superannuation and the pensions of veterans.
I want to read into the Hansard the words of a very distinguished Ryan constituent, a former brigadier of the Australian Army, who is widely respected in Ryan for his service to our nation wearing the uniform and for his continued commitment to equity, fairness and justice, not just for himself but for many veterans who do not have the voice, the eloquence and the status that he has as a former brigadier. I refer to his letter to me because it reflects the scores of emails to me from veterans and their families who see this as an issue of equity, fairness and justice. This is what Brigadier Brian Wade AM—and I should say very clearly for the record that he has been awarded an AM by this country—of Taringa said to me, writing on 31 October:
Dear Michael,
I am writing to express my extreme displeasure in relation to the Government’s decision to adopt the recently released Matthews Report into the indexation of Military and other Commonwealth Superannuation.
This is a matter which is of considerable importance to all of the current and retired Military community and the purpose of this letter is to ask you to take some action.
The effect of the implementation of this report is that Military Superannuation Pensions will remain indexed to the CPI, whereas Welfare and Age Pensions are indexed at a higher rate, namely the greater of CPI or Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Costs Index (PBLIb) or Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE), and pre-2004 MP’s and High Court Judges Pensions are wage based indexed to the salaries of serving backbench MPs.
I have seen credible statistics and graphs which show that, in the period 1989 to 2008, Military Superannuation Pensions rose by 68%, while Age Pensions rose by 110% and those of retired MP’s rose by 131 per cent!
Put another way, a person who had served our country in uniform and retired in 1989 on a Superannuation pension of $30,000 would, in 2008 be receiving $50,400. Compare that to $63,000 for a welfare recipient and $69,300 for a politician! Hardly fair by any measure.
I do not know if those figures are 100 per cent accurate. I will not challenge them for their absolute accuracy, but, even if they are only partially accurate, I cannot stand by, as the member for Ryan, as the son and grandson of veterans from different theatres, at different times, who wore the uniform for their different countries, and say that we are satisfied with the current position. We must do something.
For the record, I want to make it very clear that I intend to continue to raise this issue of fairness, equity and justice in my party and in the parliament, because this is the right thing to do. If it requires substantial allocation of funds and the withdrawal of funds from elsewhere, then I am prepared to work with anybody in government or in the bureaucracy to find those billions of dollars, because there is great waste in this government. There is great waste in budgets. There is an opportunity for us to find money for a more equitable, more just and more fair cause. The country must honour those who have worn the uniform in our name and served under our flag. We must honour them. (Time expired)

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2009-11-24,"—Last Friday I was pleased to attend the launch of the City of Belmont’s CCTV Alarm Assist project in my electorate of Swan. I have followed the progress of this project closely over the last couple of years and was pleased to be at the launch. The basis of Alarm Assist was actually a coalition promise before the last election. Of course, Labor did a ‘me too’ on the issue. However, I am pleased they did it because it is a worthwhile initiative. Crime is a problem in the Belmont area and I receive a particularly high number of calls from Rivervale residents who are concerned about this issue.
I have always encouraged innovative solutions to the crime issue, and I believe the Alarm Assist program falls into this category. The scheme will embrace CCTV technology across the city of Belmont. The hope is that a better CCTV network will make it easier for police to catch criminals, serve as a visible deterrent and make the people of Belmont feel safer. According to a police website:
Still images and video footage are considered to be one of the best ways to prove who did what and when. Images of this nature can cut down investigation time and may also guide us to very swift outcomes. Some images and video may be presented as evidence in a court.
There are two specific components to the City of Belmont Alarm Assist program. The first is the installation, monitoring and response to business and residential alarms in the city. The second is the installation of CCTV systems in the city of Belmont that interconnect to a private alarm system and other triggers. As part of the program, the council are rolling out 400 low-cost RAC intruder alarm systems for residents and businesses to install. The systems that will be fully installed by the RAC include a fire smoke detector, a duress button and movement door sensors. I understand that in the event of an alarm activation the City of Belmont’s Neighbourhood Watch security will attend the premises.
I am also pleased to say that the program will be coordinated with the Blue Iris program, an initiative of the WA Police. Under the Blue Iris scheme, businesses and residents are encouraged to register their CCTV systems with the police. When the police are investigating a crime in a particular area, they will use this database of CCTV cameras to track and, hopefully, catch the offenders. Congratulations to the City of Belmont and, in particular, crime prevention officer Shaun Nancarrow, who has driven this from the start.
Whilst I am enthusiastic about the prospects of this project, we must keep up the fight against crime on all fronts. There are a number of local schemes in WA that I am keen to promote in the community. The first is the seniors security rebate being run by the Liberal-National government in WA. Under the scheme, WA seniors card holders can claim up to $200 for buying or installing home intruder alarms, security screen doors, security window screens, security sensor lights and door deadlocks. Local governments also have some good crime prevention programs. I would like to make particular mention of the City of Belmont and the town of Victoria Park. Programs like Alarm Assist complement these policies. I will be following the progress of this scheme with interest. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the mayor, Glenys Godfrey, and the Minister for Home Affairs, who were also at the launch. (Time expired)

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2009-11-24,"—I rise to provide some comments into the inquiry of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into financial products and services in Australia. Whilst I do, let me thank the secretariat for their good work; the member for Oxley, Bernie Ripoll, who led the committee; Senator Brett Mason, who was deputy chair; and the Hon. Chris Pearce, the member for Aston, and shadow minister for financial services, superannuation and corporate law.
Hard-earned funds, totalling $70 billion, of Australians have been lost. In the last 18 months corporate collapses such as Storm, Opes Prime, Great Southern and Timbercorp, as well as other companies, have gone under. No banks have failed. Indeed, of only eight AA-rated, or above, banks in the world, four of them are Australian. Our banking system has proven to be the most robust in the world. Despite the catastrophic loss of equity in savings, with most people’s superannuation savings being halved, with many people realising losses through selling down shares, our financial services regime, based principally on chapter 6 and 7 of the Corporations Act and on the financial areas of the ASIC Act, continues to be the strongest and most robust in the world. Over 150 banks have failed and we lost none. Compare that to the crisis of the late eighties and early nineties when more than five banks in Australia failed.
However, there is much that we as a nation and indeed as a parliament—a body of legislators—can learn from the last 18 months. We have already seen some of those lessons being learnt through margin-lending legislation, whereby there is now a requirement upon margin lenders to inform both the client and their adviser of a margin call. Evidence before the committee showed that, in September 2008, there were 2,000 margin calls per day being issued against Australians. It appeared that the vast majority of clients were informed of those margin calls and had the opportunity to make restoration and bring the margins back into loan-to-value ratios. There is one glaring example and that of course is Storm Financial where, for upwards of eight, nine, 10 and, in some cases, 12 weeks clients of Storm were, in many cases, unaware of a margin call requirement—the end case of course being the Commonwealth selling down and closing the Storm index funds and losing over $5 billion of hard-earned funds of Australians.
The financial devastation that the collapse of the likes of Storm and Opes Prime, Timbercorp and Great Southern has caused cannot be underestimated. Collectively, over $10 billion of life savings of ordinary Australians was lost. These included pensioners, who were, some say, duped into actually mortgaging their home for an excessive margin loan into a Storm Financial or other product, only to find out they had lost everything. The toll of human wreckage goes into the thousands. Within such an environment—praising God that, indeed, our nation did not fall into recession, in most part due to the way we started, the strength of our financial services regime, the lack of debt and the robustness of that financial services regime—as we now move into growth it is important to look back and learn the lessons of the past and to look at how we as legislators can actually improve the financial services regime. No matter how good it may be, it can improve; hence the inquiry into financial products and services in Australia had that charter and, indeed, has produced 11 recommendations to achieve that end state: to improve the financial services regime.
Whilst the 11 recommendations cover a range of areas, from disclosure to education to working with industry as it seeks to address the issue of commissions, there is no more important, no more wide-ranging recommendation than the first one—that is, that the Corporations Act be amended to explicitly include a fiduciary duty requiring financial advisers operating under an AFSL to place their clients’ interests ahead of their own. The committee has recommended that we amend chapter 7 of the Corporations Act to require a fiducial duty of care from advisers, a legal duty of care, a legal responsibility that advisers put the interests of their clients, without fear or favour, before any of their own interests. This will put the legal requirements of financial advisers on a par with lawyers and accountants. It will lift the financial services industry into a proper, robust and professional space with full legal requirements. It will require that advisers duly consider the statement of advice they give, knowing full well that that statement of advice may well be admissible in court because of their fiducial duty of care. It will require advisers to think very carefully about their remuneration structures, especially any commissions or payments they are getting from a product provider at the back-end, because those remuneration structures, those commissions may well be admissible in a court of law as per their fiducial duty of good faith.
Financial advisers will now need to rethink exactly how they engage with clients, the statement of advice that they provide and what has caused them to come to that statement of advice, and, if need be, they will need to defend that statement of advice. That is a sweeping, all-encompassing change to how the financial services industry is operating. In fairness to the industry, many parts of it are already operating along those lines, with a sense of good faith behind them. For many firms, recommendation 1, no matter how sweeping, will be somewhat passe because that is the way they already operate their businesses. For others, it may well be a requirement to look very closely into the mirror and determine exactly how they provide their advice.
The industry has stated through the FPA, IFSA and AFA that they are looking at the issue of commissions. They are looking at how financial advisers are remunerated. Recommendation 4 is that the government consult with and support industry in those sorts of moves. The committee believes it would be inappropriate to regulate and say that commissions are banned. People need to have choice. Advisers need to have choice. We need to ensure that financial advice is readily available for all people, not just for those on high incomes. Recommendation 4 allows the industry time to work with its members, with its clients and, if need be, with legislative support work through how they look at commissions.
The committee has done an excellent job and I thank the members of the committee from both sides of the House who produced a truly bipartisan report and who worked through the dreadful issues of the financial losses of so many families and their wrecked and shattered lives, many of whom will never recover. The committee looked at how we can improve the system. Noting that the financial services regime is already robust, how do we improve it to ensure that it is better placed for the storms that will come again?
Do the recommendations mean that no financial services firm will collapse in the future? No, they do not. Storm Financial did not have any commissions back to product providers. Many of its advisers had masters degrees; however, what Storm Financial, and perhaps others, did not do was to ensure that their fiducial duty of care was enacted when dealing with their clients. What Storm and others did was to leverage upon leverage their clients’ interests into the market. They treated all clients in the same way through super leveraging themselves into a bull and growing market and then leveraging unrealised gains back into that market. When the market eventually fell, as all markets do, Storm was unable to recover the assets of their clients.
I certainly commend the report to the government. It makes a range of very solid and very sound recommendations. I look forward to working with the industry going forward as it seeks to continue to enhance its professionalism and provide services to the Australian community.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Corporations and Financial Services Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I am pleased to speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report on its inquiry into financial products and services in Australia. In many ways this was a difficult inquiry not just because of its content but because of the nature of some of the witnesses. Many of the witnesses had lost significant amounts of money, sometimes all of their savings and more, particularly through Storm Financial and Opes Prime and a small number of other companies in recent years. It was a difficult inquiry for us. From listening to them it was perhaps an even more difficult inquiry for them, telling their stories in such a public way.
There is no doubt that the recent controversies, such as the collapse of Storm Financial and Opes Prime and the subsequent dire circumstances of many small investors, have dented confidence in the financial advice industry. The consequences for many people have been dire. The committee heard evidence from people who lost everything and much more in investment schemes that were, by any stretch of imagination, out of line with their life circumstances. We heard from pensioners with no possibility of earned income who had invested everything they owned and geared further in investment schemes which carried considerable risk. Many of those people lost everything.
Our job was not to assign blame, although it was very tempting to do so. Our job was to consider the issues associated with those collapses. We heard from time to time that the problems were caused by the global financial crisis. I want to comment on that. Of course, it is true that there was a financial collapse in 2008 and that there were going to be losers. But the collapses exposed problems within the sector, which led to people making investment decisions that were profoundly inappropriate for their circumstances. It is also clear that many of those people were unaware of the risks associated with their decisions. While the submissions exposed some questionable behaviour on the part of the companies that collapsed, our role was not to forensically identify illegal behaviour. That role is for others to take—and they are doing so. But we did identify industry-wide practices that have grown over time and that seemed not to lead to advice and decisions in the best interests of the client.
While I do not want to provide any excuses for the sector, I do want to reflect on the way that the world in which advisers operate has changed over the last 10 to 15 years. Australia is in many ways in a unique position. We have one of the largest per capita investment rates in the world largely due to superannuation funds and recent demutualisations, which quite often see people who are in the later years of their lives and who have no investment experience at all receive significant amounts of money. An incredibly large number of people are coming to investment late in life having received large superannuation payouts or literally receiving cheques or shares in the mail because of demutualisations. That makes us unique. You can see in the pattern of margin lending, for example, the change in the way Australians have engaged in investment. Ten years ago, in 1999, less than $5 billion had been borrowed through margin loans. By December 2007, some 8½ years later, that figure had skyrocketed to over $37 billion—a 700 per cent increase in 10 years. It grew not just in numbers but also, significantly, in the range of investors that took out margin loans. The growth also happened through the years of boom. It is not strictly true that it was impossible to lose money but it is probably true to say that people made money and also, arguably, that the people who were exposed to inappropriate risk or who did not fully comprehend the nature of their investments were insulated from the consequences by upward trends for a number of years. That of course all came to a halt in the middle of 2008. At the same time as the number and range of investors grew, there was a massive growth in financial industries and the number of advisers. Collapse or not, it would have been timely now to review the way that financial advice industries operate.
The government has already moved to regulate margin lending, and that is a very good thing. That will already make a difference to the way that financial advice is offered to retail investors in particular. The minister has also flagged further intentions in his initial acknowledgement of the report last night. He outlined at a recent FPA national conference that any regulatory changes by the government will be guided by the following two key principles: firstly, that the financial advice that people get must be in their best interests—distortions to remuneration, which misalign the best interests of the client and the adviser, should be minimised; and, secondly, in minimising these distortions, we need to ensure that we do not put financial advice out of the reach of those who would benefit from it. They are both very strong statements. They coincide significantly with the views of the committee as expressed in the report, even though this statement was made prior to its release.
The committee has made a number of recommendations and, in broad terms, they are in the areas of raising standards of advice; making disclosure more effective; removing conflicted remuneration practices; ensuring better transparency, competency and accountability through the licensing system; reforming lending practices; limiting access to complex and/or risky investment products; and introducing a last-resort statutory compensation scheme for investors.
Standards of advice vary considerably, and so do the conditions under which clients receive it. A number of witnesses outlined concerns about the effect of conflict of interest on the quality of advice provided by financial advisers. There were proposals put in three main areas: imposing a higher legislative standard through a fiduciary duty for financial advisers to place clients’ interests first; providing consumers a distinction between sales-based advice and independent advice; and improving enforcement of current advice standards through annual reports to ASIC and/or risk-based auditing.
There can be no doubt, in listening to the evidence provided by a number of investors and organisations representing the industry, that there is a view that compensation packages through commissions are largely not understood by the client base, and similarly that quite often a financial adviser is acting more as a salesperson for one product or another than as an independent adviser. So there is considerable confusion in the industry from the client perspective about what they are actually getting when they go and see a financial adviser.
The committee made a very strong recommendation concerning fiduciary duty, and it is probably the most powerful recommendation in the report. It states that:
The committee recommends that the Corporations Act be amended to explicitly include a fiduciary duty for financial advisers operating under an AFSL, requiring them to place their clients’ interests ahead of their own.
I would assume that many people who have sought financial advice prior to this report being delivered would have assumed that the adviser actually already was providing advice in the client’s best interests, but that is not required under current regulations and there was clear evidence given by a number of people that it is not always the case.
There is also evidence—and ASIC is probably one of the strongest exponents of the view—that the imposition of a legislative fiduciary duty would likely change remunerative practices without even placing a ban on commissions. They state:
… once you are in a fiduciary relationship, if you are going to take commissions or some other benefit, that benefit belongs to your client. … So the change we would see to industry practice would be that a lot of the front-end, trail and ongoing commissions would probably not sit well with a clarification of that duty.
Ultimately, the definition of ‘fiduciary duty’ will be determined by the courts, but there were very strong indications of industry views that remuneration practices through commissions will be problematic under that regulation change.
The second recommendation—also an important one—is that:
… the government ensure ASIC is appropriately resourced to perform effective risk-based surveillance of the advice provided by licensees and their authorised representatives. ASIC should also conduct financial advice shadow shopping exercises annually.
This is an incredibly important recommendation that ensures that ASIC is keeping an eye on the behaviour of the industry, particularly over the time that these changes would take place—assuming that they are adopted by the government, of course.
The third recommendation—also an incredibly important one given the lack of understanding by many clients of advisers of the way in which their relationship actually plays out—is that the Corporations Act be amended to require advisers to disclose prominently in marketing material restrictions on the advice they are able to provide consumers and any potential conflicts of interest. Again, this recommendation came about because of the clear evidence that many advisers are taking commissions or other fees and many are in fact only representing a small number of products, which means again a person can go to a financial adviser believing that they are receiving open and independent advice and are really talking to a person who is only able to provide advice concerning a small range of products. It is an incredibly important recommendation that will make a substantial difference to investors.
The inquiry attracted considerable debate about whether banning commission-based remuneration is required to overcome the conflict of interest that it creates. Some argued that disclosure and conduct requirements have failed to adequately manage those conflicts and that a ban is now warranted, while others claimed that removing these payment methods would increase the cost and decrease the accessibility of advice for consumers. There was also discussion about whether enabling payments to be made as a percentage of funds under management represented an effective compromise between removing conflicts and maintaining affordability. This is an incredibly difficult issue. In the end, the committee resolved to recommend that the industry and the government work together to find the most appropriate mechanism by which to cease payments from financial product manufacturers to financial advisers. This is a very difficult issue. The industry is currently essentially supported by the flow of commissions, trail commissions and you name it, from product providers. This would be a substantial change within the industry and would require considerable consultation to ensure that it did happen in a way that did not put the price of advice out of the range of consumers. The asset-based fees were also criticised, most effectively by Choice magazine, who were very strong in their criticism of that particular kind of fee structure.
The committee also recommended that the government consider the implications of making the cost of financial advice tax deductible for consumers as part of its response to the Treasury review into the tax system, also an important consideration if we are to keep advice affordable.
There are a number of other recommendations that I will not cover because I am going to run out of time but I would like to cover recommendation 11, which concerns financial literacy. It is an issue everywhere but it is particularly important in Australia, where we have so many inexperienced investors, that we work hard to improve the level of financial literacy. I suspect that most members of parliament through the financial crisis have met with constituents who have lost everything who had all of their assets in investments which were so inappropriate it is almost unimaginable that any reputable adviser could have advised them to do so. There were people who took all of their workers compensation payouts, for example, and put them in one company—Rio Tinto in the case of one constituent. People find themselves in appalling circumstances because of a complete lack of understanding of risk. One man who lost all his money in the share market did not actually understand that his money was not in the bank. He wanted to know where his money was and I was not able to get through to him that there is a difference between a bank deposit and buying shares. This is a man who had invested his entire superannuation payout and lost it all, with no understanding at all of what he was actually doing in making that decision. There is no doubt that we have to make strong efforts here to improve the financial literacy of our population, particularly targeted to groups in the community who are likely to be seeking financial advice for the first time.
This is a very good report. It makes a number of recommendations that will make real differences should they be accepted by the government, and I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Corporations and Financial Services Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I am very pleased to speak on the report of the Inquiry into Financial Products and Services in Australia by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The report has received a great deal of attention and arises from events that also received a great deal of attention, particularly the recent collapses of, for example, Storm Financial and Opes Prime. The strength of the committee’s recommendations rests on over 400 submissions that were received, more than half of which came from people affected by the collapse of Storm Financial. I think everyone knows the reality of the tragedy experienced by people and how devastating the effect was when people made decisions on advice that led to considerable loss. I praise the committee for their patience and sensitivity in dealing with so many individuals who were prepared to come forward and share their personal stories. It was not a case of their always being misled or of their not being aware of the risks—sometimes they were, sometimes they were not—but we have found that honest pricing, analysis or disclosure of risk has been a real issue in terms of the false confidence that preceded the global financial crisis. It certainly distorted behaviours both in the financial sector and by investors, and it certainly had a devastating impact when things went drastically wrong.
My colleagues who have spoken on this have said that we were not a judge or jury, and we were not. We were not there as a court and we were not there to be the final arbiter on these matters, but we certainly were there to expose the issues, to draw attention to the factors that caused these losses and to try to recommend better ways forward, ways that would not just strengthen the financial services industry but also protect the interests of Australian investors and Australians who avail themselves of financial services.
In our final deliberations we said that, for some individuals, there was clearly inappropriate advice and we noted that there was a preference by financial advisors and an acceptance by lenders of a one-size-fits-all approach. That is never the best case for the interests of the individual and, in drawing attention to those sorts of practices, I hope we have perhaps made people scrutinise their responsibility when looking at vulnerable individuals or the customers and clients who come to them, and their understanding that each of them has individual circumstances and should be assessed individually.
There was a lot of evidence around the shifting of responsibility, perhaps too casually and too carelessly, or around the failure by some to accept that they had a responsibility, whether it was the banks, the financial advisors, the lenders or even the investors. As a result, all those I have mentioned now know that they could have done better. We cannot wind back the clock, nor can we change what did occur for people, and we can never develop or guarantee an absolutely failsafe system. But we can expose the issues and the problems and we can get people to account for their behaviour, which is very hard to do. So I congratulate the Chair, who is sitting beside me, because to have all our banks present in public hearings was quite an achievement. I know that behind the scenes he, and our secretariat, worked very hard to make sure that those who had played a role were there to account for themselves.
The committee’s overall recommendations are there to improve the system. They are designed to improve professionalism, behaviour and, hopefully, outcomes. They deal with setting up a better regulatory framework around financial advice and overcoming conflicts of interest. I have been very pleased to listen to the chairman, Bernie Ripoll, speaking in the media today and last night around the area of fiduciary duty. It is not acceptable that conflict of interest exists between investors and financial advisers. There will always be the greatest protection when there is an acceptance that the interests of the investor must go before the interests of the adviser. There cannot be a conflict of interest. If financial advisers and planners are to be taken seriously then they must take seriously their responsibility to their clients’ interests and put them first. So our major recommendation is a very appropriate one.
There has been discussion about whether we can make people do things and make the industry do things. There is some problem with standards, and we have encouraged the industry itself to be involved in improving those standards so that there is public confidence in services provided. There has been a lot of discussion about how financial advisers set their fees and the relationship they have with their client around that. I spoke at the Newcastle chapter of the Financial Planning Association, and they shared with me their concerns. Often financial advisers are very small operators. They explained to me some of the complexity around deciding how fees are set. I do praise the committee’s report for allowing some flexibility in regard to the choice of fees and some self-regulation in that way. An excellent measure that we also recommended was that there can be no kickbacks—commissions—from a product developer who obviously gives incentives to financial planners and advisers to sell their products to an ordinary investor. That is a very, very strong recommendation, I agree, and I am very pleased that that is there. If you take the conflict of interest measure and the requirement to take no kickbacks or fees, and you commit to that, I think that is a very good way forward.
We have also recommended that the government consider the implications of making the cost of financial advice tax deductible. I have been on previous committees that looked at this issue, and I can only say that one committee I was on recommended that young people, particularly in their first job or on first joining a superannuation fund, should be given at least one session of tax-free financial advice. But in our report we are looking at it in a more holistic way, and I would very much welcome the study of that by the government.
We have also recommended that ASIC step up. It is really important for ASIC to have a strong role to play, to be resourced, to be the enforcer, to be able to look at competencies and standards for the industry and to be able to effect change and improvement. So we have proposed some more effective regulatory enforcement measures, and I must praise the government for its reforms under the Corporations Act.
We have also recommended around financial literacy. I have strong views that some of the methods we use do not reach the most vulnerable groups, and we know that vulnerable groups are people who perhaps have cash in their hands—be it a lump sum, retirement money, a superannuation payout or a redundancy. They have got money to invest, and I do think that ASIC should do more around that area. But we have also recognised that ASIC understands the problem. We have made recommendations to lower the threshold for ASIC to remove individuals and licensees from the industry.
To protect investors when collapses do occur, we did recommend that some statutory last-resort compensation funds for investors be considered. We have seen that the professional indemnity insurance scheme has a great number of deficiencies when it comes to protecting the interests of investors.
Our work around margin loans and margin calls was noted by the government. Their reform measures in the Corporations Act preceded our report but I think was certainly shaped by our report. That has been the wonderful thing about this inquiry. I think the government was listening, ASIC was listening, consultations were constant and the government were responding. I congratulate all the members. I know that the Queensland members, in particular, were seriously concerned for many of their constituents who suffered losses. I know that the chairman, in his relationships with the sector, and the people who submitted strengthened our reputation and our status and the quality of this report. I hope that that will be recognised by the government when they respond to our recommendations.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Corporations and Financial Services Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—by leave—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, and to the opposition, for allowing me the time to speak. History is a hard lesson to learn again. That is something that I always have in the back of my mind. In 1927 the internationally renowned economist John Maynard Keynes categorically said, ‘We will not have any more crashes in our time.’ This profound observation just before the greatest market crash of all time teaches us that making sweeping statements or being overly excited about one’s self-importance are both recipes for disaster. Today many will expect legislators to find the silver bullet that prevents the likes of the Storm Financials of the world and others from ever happening again in the future. But history should teach us that a complete cure is elusive while meaningful reform and progressive improvement are the best medicine, although I have got to say that they are not quite as colourful at the time.
Reform in the financial services sector has been evolving continuously over the past 30 years. But rarely does an event on the scale of the global financial crisis give us the opportunity to accelerate reform in a sector crying out for a fresh direction. Some would argue that because Australia fared better than most in the global financial crisis then reform is only necessary at the margins or that investors should be better informed. Unfortunately, this is the case of the selective analysis, where some are all too willing to forget the catastrophic lessons learned by many unfortunate souls.
Of course short memory is not new and the status quo always suits some more than it does others. But I am certain that that would not be the view of the tens of thousands of investors that have lost in agribusiness management investment schemes, lost their life savings and more with Storm Financial, and all those caught up in the Opes Prime Stockbroking swindle along with dozens of other similar enterprises. Court cases, legal action and compensation schemes aside, people are seeking acknowledgement of their circumstances and someone with authority to recognise the devastating impact of what has happened to them. People want simple answers and they want practical solutions. While the basic principles of life and money have never changed—the only things that are guaranteed are death and tax; if it is too good to be true then it usually is; don’t put all your eggs in one basket; and don’t believe everything you read or hear—we also need to recognise that life is not always that clear or that transparent.
Everyone at some point in time needs protection from those that would take advantage of all of us—the vulnerable, the elderly or those without sufficient understanding. Hence there is the need to regulate markets, behaviour and corporations in this sector, which I think is essential. No-one should argue that without the rules or in a free-for-all environment not much would work in any effective manner. Survival of the fittest sometimes also equals survival of very few. Of course too much of this good thing—regulation—can also be a bad thing. Striking a balance between the cost of regulation and a free market is always the challenge of governments and industry. This is not a question of how much regulation but how well it works and how efficient it is for the sector that makes any real sense in the end.
Under reforms from past governments and regulators the financial services sector has made good progress, albeit with the expected cries of concern at the time for the end of the sector as we know it with tens of thousands of jobs at risk—similar to the cries you will hear at other times of reform. Of course this is to be expected and does not reflect in any way the reality either in the industry or in the growth in products and innovation or jobs that are created through progressive reform.
That is exactly what the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services aimed at delivering, and I believe did deliver. The report on the financial services sector lays down clear markers and a plan for the future about direction, about the quality of advice and about the appropriateness of remuneration models. With current research indicating that only two to three people get advice at all, it is clear that something in the sector does not work today. It indicates the problems faced by the sector are wide ranging and require a rethink. My view has always been that rather than squabble over the small industry pie we must consider serious reform for growth to capture the other 75 per cent and to understand why they cannot afford financial advice or do not see the possible value in it in the first place.
Reform at its core must be principles based, with a focus on consumer protection and value for money. An industry standard of financial services that are a fair exchange of a fee for a service based on actual work performed must be the basis of the relationship between client and adviser, not between manufacturer and adviser. This, in concert with an explicit obligation to have a fiduciary responsibility—that is, a responsibility for those in a special position of trust—will drive the lifting of standards, drive the lifting of the quality of advice and remove the conflicts of interest that currently exist. As with most things in life, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately for many in recent years, they got more than they bargained for and are still left wearing the cost.
I had a short opportunity in the House recently to introduce the report, and I know that most people are focused on just a few of the recommendations, but I want to turn in the few minutes I have left to the other recommendations of the report, which I think are as significant as the major recommendations which underpin what needs to take place. Certainly I think that the heart of this report is about the fiduciary responsibility. It is about making clear to people in the advice industry that they have a responsibility to their clients and that that responsibility extends to the fact that it should be their clients’ interests first, ahead of their own interests. I think that is an important principle. Coupled with that principle is that of a complementary remuneration model, one that is fair. It is based on a fee—something that is tangible and understood, something that can be turned on or off and something that is a deal or a bargain between the client and the adviser, not something that is hidden, embedded or complicated into some product and that cannot be disentangled. I think that those two principles, along with quality of advice, form the basis of what this report is about.
But I want to turn also to ASIC. We certainly believe that ASIC ought to have much more focused attention on its role in this very complex area. ASIC covers a vastly greater proportion of people than APRA. It really regulates the consumer market and, as such, faces a much more difficult task. But we believe that ASIC has the appropriate people, the skills, the knowledge and the history to be able to do more in these areas. There is an expectation that ASIC as the regulator do more, and that is our expectation as well. That is not so much a critique of ASIC but just our expectation of what it ought to do in the future. We have made a number of recommendations around the regulator specifically.
That is coupled with extending the powers of ASIC to ban individuals from the sector, because all too often what we heard during this inquiry was that you had ‘bad people’—it is always the few rotten apples that make it bad for the whole sector. Unfortunately, they finish work on a Friday in a particular organisation—whether forced to leave or otherwise—and end up on a Monday morning working for somebody else down the road and continuing their poor practice. The industry say to me that that has to stop, and we agree with them. We think that has to stop. If there are bad people in the sector, they ought to go, because in the end it ought to be the client’s interests that are ahead of the adviser’s interests.
We believe that, in particular in relation to agribusiness MI schemes, those schemes ought to demonstrate a sufficient working capital to meet their current obligations. We saw the disaster of Great Southern and Timbercorp, which left more than 60,000 investors out of pocket. That is not good enough, and I think that there ought to be rules that reflect a better regulatory environment to make sure that people have confidence in the people that manage these schemes on their behalf.
We also agreed with ASIC, the regulator, that they could deny an application for a licence on the basis that a licensee may not comply with regulation or the law. That is a fairly big step forward but I think an important one in a preventative measure. All too often we have heard from the regulator that they can only act after the fact, after the incident or after a complaint. We believe that some more powers in this area are appropriate and can be well managed by the regulator. We also believe that having a strong, independent, industry based professional standards body that works in complement with the regulator would be a huge step forward in making regulation and compliance in the sector—which we acknowledge is very complex—an easier task.
We went further to say that we believe that there does exist a circumstance where an absolute last resort statutory compensation scheme could benefit some investors. We understand the moral hazard but we also believe that where particular organisations or individuals do the wrong thing, they are no longer covered by their insurance and investors should still have some minimal compensation in those circumstances. We took note of the great work done by the Financial Ombudsman Service and in the United Kingdom in this particular area.
All of these recommendations, if taken as a totality or as a whole, do work together. They work as complements to each other; they work in concert and can deliver a much more effective industry that is focused on consumer protection first. It is focused on standards and it is focused on lifting the educational levels within the sector. We have also made recommendations in terms of ASIC working more closely with the sector to develop those educational activities to be targeted at the right people. In particular the advisers themselves need to have a higher standard of education as the current standard is just far too low, as is acknowledged by the sector. All of these things coupled together can produce some real significant change, a real difference. It can restore credibility to financial services in this country and can provide the confidence that consumers need.
If we get all of those things right we can grow the market. I think that 25 per cent of people in Australia seeking financial advice is way too low. I know the industry agrees with me; it is too low. But currently there is nothing being done at a wholesale level which will actually take that 25 per cent of people to 50 per cent. I believe that people should have more ability to be independent in their retirement beyond what is provided as a safety net through a pension system provided by the government. There needs to be a little bit more and people do that through superannuation, through their own savings and through their home. They need to be more involved and more independent. They can do that through getting good, solid, sound financial advice about how to manage their savings and how to have a more independent retirement. That is an important thing.
But to do all of that you have to get the principles right in the sector first. I acknowledge how much work is being done currently in the sector by representatives—I will not mention any because I know if I leave some out the others will be cranky with me. There is some really good work being done to make sure that we lift those standards and make those improvements. If we get all of that right, not only will we grow the market, not only will we protect consumers but we will make a more effective and more efficient financial services sector in Australia. It can really be seen as a financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific region, which is where I believe there is huge growth potential for jobs in this country.
Lastly—and I have left it to last because I think it is significant that I mention it last in terms of the tax deductibility issue—unless we get all of those things right first we cannot get to the tax deduction. For me, I see it as the big carrot or the big opportunity for the financial services sector and for each individual person who works in it whether they are a licensee themselves or an authorised representative. If they want that big carrot in order to be able to deliver for individuals and grow that market then they need to get the rest of it right first. The regulatory system needs to be more effective and efficient. We have understood, in the work that we have done, that there is a cost to regulation. This is not about more regulation; it is about effective regulation. It is about setting the goals and the markers. I want to see a thriving financial services sector in the next five to 10 years. I want to see the base grow from 25 per cent to 50 per cent but I want to see it done in the right way. I believe that with the principles we have put down in this report we will achieve that.

Mr Laming interjecting—
 (Mr S Georganas)—Are you seeking an intervention, Member for Bowman?
—Mr Deputy Speaker, would the member for Oxley accept a question?
—Will the member for Oxley accept an intervention?
—Yes.
—Would the member provide his advice on whether he supports the shift from commission-based to fee-based remuneration for financial advice?
—Absolutely, and I thank the member for his question. Recommendation 4 in the committee report is very clear. I will read it. It says:
The committee recommends that the government consult with and support industry…
I think that is really important.
… in developing the most appropriate mechanism by which to cease payments from product manufacturers to financial advisers.
What that clearly says is to stop payments, all payments, whatever form they take. People can decide for themselves. We did not limit ourselves to one type of payment but the committee decided unanimously that it was all the payments. That can be volume bonuses, shelf fees, soft dollar incentives and commissions right across the board. We felt there was inherent conflict of interest that existed with a person being paid to sell you something. Often it is not clear that you are actually being sold a product rather than being provided advice. That is the clear point.
You can separate the two. People can genuinely pay to receive advice, and that advice does not need to be attached to a product. You can receive advice and have a product as well, and as long as that is transparent and clear you can live in both worlds. But currently there is a problem. There is a big grey area where often people who advise actually do not know whether it is advice or whether it is a product, and all too often we have seen people get caught up in that problem.
I am very happy with the recommendations in this report. I want to thank the Liberal Party, National Party and Labor Party members of the committee for their great work. (Time expired)

Debate (on motion by Ms King) adjourned.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Corporations and Financial Services Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2009-11-24,"—I rise to provide some comments into the inquiry of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into financial products and services in Australia. Whilst I do, let me thank the secretariat for their good work; the member for Oxley, Bernie Ripoll, who led the committee; Senator Brett Mason, who was deputy chair; and the Hon. Chris Pearce, the member for Aston, and shadow minister for financial services, superannuation and corporate law.
Hard-earned funds, totalling $70 billion, of Australians have been lost. In the last 18 months corporate collapses such as Storm, Opes Prime, Great Southern and Timbercorp, as well as other companies, have gone under. No banks have failed. Indeed, of only eight AA-rated, or above, banks in the world, four of them are Australian. Our banking system has proven to be the most robust in the world. Despite the catastrophic loss of equity in savings, with most people’s superannuation savings being halved, with many people realising losses through selling down shares, our financial services regime, based principally on chapter 6 and 7 of the Corporations Act and on the financial areas of the ASIC Act, continues to be the strongest and most robust in the world. Over 150 banks have failed and we lost none. Compare that to the crisis of the late eighties and early nineties when more than five banks in Australia failed.
However, there is much that we as a nation and indeed as a parliament—a body of legislators—can learn from the last 18 months. We have already seen some of those lessons being learnt through margin-lending legislation, whereby there is now a requirement upon margin lenders to inform both the client and their adviser of a margin call. Evidence before the committee showed that, in September 2008, there were 2,000 margin calls per day being issued against Australians. It appeared that the vast majority of clients were informed of those margin calls and had the opportunity to make restoration and bring the margins back into loan-to-value ratios. There is one glaring example and that of course is Storm Financial where, for upwards of eight, nine, 10 and, in some cases, 12 weeks clients of Storm were, in many cases, unaware of a margin call requirement—the end case of course being the Commonwealth selling down and closing the Storm index funds and losing over $5 billion of hard-earned funds of Australians.
The financial devastation that the collapse of the likes of Storm and Opes Prime, Timbercorp and Great Southern has caused cannot be underestimated. Collectively, over $10 billion of life savings of ordinary Australians was lost. These included pensioners, who were, some say, duped into actually mortgaging their home for an excessive margin loan into a Storm Financial or other product, only to find out they had lost everything. The toll of human wreckage goes into the thousands. Within such an environment—praising God that, indeed, our nation did not fall into recession, in most part due to the way we started, the strength of our financial services regime, the lack of debt and the robustness of that financial services regime—as we now move into growth it is important to look back and learn the lessons of the past and to look at how we as legislators can actually improve the financial services regime. No matter how good it may be, it can improve; hence the inquiry into financial products and services in Australia had that charter and, indeed, has produced 11 recommendations to achieve that end state: to improve the financial services regime.
Whilst the 11 recommendations cover a range of areas, from disclosure to education to working with industry as it seeks to address the issue of commissions, there is no more important, no more wide-ranging recommendation than the first one—that is, that the Corporations Act be amended to explicitly include a fiduciary duty requiring financial advisers operating under an AFSL to place their clients’ interests ahead of their own. The committee has recommended that we amend chapter 7 of the Corporations Act to require a fiducial duty of care from advisers, a legal duty of care, a legal responsibility that advisers put the interests of their clients, without fear or favour, before any of their own interests. This will put the legal requirements of financial advisers on a par with lawyers and accountants. It will lift the financial services industry into a proper, robust and professional space with full legal requirements. It will require that advisers duly consider the statement of advice they give, knowing full well that that statement of advice may well be admissible in court because of their fiducial duty of care. It will require advisers to think very carefully about their remuneration structures, especially any commissions or payments they are getting from a product provider at the back-end, because those remuneration structures, those commissions may well be admissible in a court of law as per their fiducial duty of good faith.
Financial advisers will now need to rethink exactly how they engage with clients, the statement of advice that they provide and what has caused them to come to that statement of advice, and, if need be, they will need to defend that statement of advice. That is a sweeping, all-encompassing change to how the financial services industry is operating. In fairness to the industry, many parts of it are already operating along those lines, with a sense of good faith behind them. For many firms, recommendation 1, no matter how sweeping, will be somewhat passe because that is the way they already operate their businesses. For others, it may well be a requirement to look very closely into the mirror and determine exactly how they provide their advice.
The industry has stated through the FPA, IFSA and AFA that they are looking at the issue of commissions. They are looking at how financial advisers are remunerated. Recommendation 4 is that the government consult with and support industry in those sorts of moves. The committee believes it would be inappropriate to regulate and say that commissions are banned. People need to have choice. Advisers need to have choice. We need to ensure that financial advice is readily available for all people, not just for those on high incomes. Recommendation 4 allows the industry time to work with its members, with its clients and, if need be, with legislative support work through how they look at commissions.
The committee has done an excellent job and I thank the members of the committee from both sides of the House who produced a truly bipartisan report and who worked through the dreadful issues of the financial losses of so many families and their wrecked and shattered lives, many of whom will never recover. The committee looked at how we can improve the system. Noting that the financial services regime is already robust, how do we improve it to ensure that it is better placed for the storms that will come again?
Do the recommendations mean that no financial services firm will collapse in the future? No, they do not. Storm Financial did not have any commissions back to product providers. Many of its advisers had masters degrees; however, what Storm Financial, and perhaps others, did not do was to ensure that their fiducial duty of care was enacted when dealing with their clients. What Storm and others did was to leverage upon leverage their clients’ interests into the market. They treated all clients in the same way through super leveraging themselves into a bull and growing market and then leveraging unrealised gains back into that market. When the market eventually fell, as all markets do, Storm was unable to recover the assets of their clients.
I certainly commend the report to the government. It makes a range of very solid and very sound recommendations. I look forward to working with the industry going forward as it seeks to continue to enhance its professionalism and provide services to the Australian community.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,18,2
"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I am pleased to speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report on its inquiry into financial products and services in Australia. In many ways this was a difficult inquiry not just because of its content but because of the nature of some of the witnesses. Many of the witnesses had lost significant amounts of money, sometimes all of their savings and more, particularly through Storm Financial and Opes Prime and a small number of other companies in recent years. It was a difficult inquiry for us. From listening to them it was perhaps an even more difficult inquiry for them, telling their stories in such a public way.
There is no doubt that the recent controversies, such as the collapse of Storm Financial and Opes Prime and the subsequent dire circumstances of many small investors, have dented confidence in the financial advice industry. The consequences for many people have been dire. The committee heard evidence from people who lost everything and much more in investment schemes that were, by any stretch of imagination, out of line with their life circumstances. We heard from pensioners with no possibility of earned income who had invested everything they owned and geared further in investment schemes which carried considerable risk. Many of those people lost everything.
Our job was not to assign blame, although it was very tempting to do so. Our job was to consider the issues associated with those collapses. We heard from time to time that the problems were caused by the global financial crisis. I want to comment on that. Of course, it is true that there was a financial collapse in 2008 and that there were going to be losers. But the collapses exposed problems within the sector, which led to people making investment decisions that were profoundly inappropriate for their circumstances. It is also clear that many of those people were unaware of the risks associated with their decisions. While the submissions exposed some questionable behaviour on the part of the companies that collapsed, our role was not to forensically identify illegal behaviour. That role is for others to take—and they are doing so. But we did identify industry-wide practices that have grown over time and that seemed not to lead to advice and decisions in the best interests of the client.
While I do not want to provide any excuses for the sector, I do want to reflect on the way that the world in which advisers operate has changed over the last 10 to 15 years. Australia is in many ways in a unique position. We have one of the largest per capita investment rates in the world largely due to superannuation funds and recent demutualisations, which quite often see people who are in the later years of their lives and who have no investment experience at all receive significant amounts of money. An incredibly large number of people are coming to investment late in life having received large superannuation payouts or literally receiving cheques or shares in the mail because of demutualisations. That makes us unique. You can see in the pattern of margin lending, for example, the change in the way Australians have engaged in investment. Ten years ago, in 1999, less than $5 billion had been borrowed through margin loans. By December 2007, some 8½ years later, that figure had skyrocketed to over $37 billion—a 700 per cent increase in 10 years. It grew not just in numbers but also, significantly, in the range of investors that took out margin loans. The growth also happened through the years of boom. It is not strictly true that it was impossible to lose money but it is probably true to say that people made money and also, arguably, that the people who were exposed to inappropriate risk or who did not fully comprehend the nature of their investments were insulated from the consequences by upward trends for a number of years. That of course all came to a halt in the middle of 2008. At the same time as the number and range of investors grew, there was a massive growth in financial industries and the number of advisers. Collapse or not, it would have been timely now to review the way that financial advice industries operate.
The government has already moved to regulate margin lending, and that is a very good thing. That will already make a difference to the way that financial advice is offered to retail investors in particular. The minister has also flagged further intentions in his initial acknowledgement of the report last night. He outlined at a recent FPA national conference that any regulatory changes by the government will be guided by the following two key principles: firstly, that the financial advice that people get must be in their best interests—distortions to remuneration, which misalign the best interests of the client and the adviser, should be minimised; and, secondly, in minimising these distortions, we need to ensure that we do not put financial advice out of the reach of those who would benefit from it. They are both very strong statements. They coincide significantly with the views of the committee as expressed in the report, even though this statement was made prior to its release.
The committee has made a number of recommendations and, in broad terms, they are in the areas of raising standards of advice; making disclosure more effective; removing conflicted remuneration practices; ensuring better transparency, competency and accountability through the licensing system; reforming lending practices; limiting access to complex and/or risky investment products; and introducing a last-resort statutory compensation scheme for investors.
Standards of advice vary considerably, and so do the conditions under which clients receive it. A number of witnesses outlined concerns about the effect of conflict of interest on the quality of advice provided by financial advisers. There were proposals put in three main areas: imposing a higher legislative standard through a fiduciary duty for financial advisers to place clients’ interests first; providing consumers a distinction between sales-based advice and independent advice; and improving enforcement of current advice standards through annual reports to ASIC and/or risk-based auditing.
There can be no doubt, in listening to the evidence provided by a number of investors and organisations representing the industry, that there is a view that compensation packages through commissions are largely not understood by the client base, and similarly that quite often a financial adviser is acting more as a salesperson for one product or another than as an independent adviser. So there is considerable confusion in the industry from the client perspective about what they are actually getting when they go and see a financial adviser.
The committee made a very strong recommendation concerning fiduciary duty, and it is probably the most powerful recommendation in the report. It states that:
The committee recommends that the Corporations Act be amended to explicitly include a fiduciary duty for financial advisers operating under an AFSL, requiring them to place their clients’ interests ahead of their own.
I would assume that many people who have sought financial advice prior to this report being delivered would have assumed that the adviser actually already was providing advice in the client’s best interests, but that is not required under current regulations and there was clear evidence given by a number of people that it is not always the case.
There is also evidence—and ASIC is probably one of the strongest exponents of the view—that the imposition of a legislative fiduciary duty would likely change remunerative practices without even placing a ban on commissions. They state:
… once you are in a fiduciary relationship, if you are going to take commissions or some other benefit, that benefit belongs to your client. … So the change we would see to industry practice would be that a lot of the front-end, trail and ongoing commissions would probably not sit well with a clarification of that duty.
Ultimately, the definition of ‘fiduciary duty’ will be determined by the courts, but there were very strong indications of industry views that remuneration practices through commissions will be problematic under that regulation change.
The second recommendation—also an important one—is that:
… the government ensure ASIC is appropriately resourced to perform effective risk-based surveillance of the advice provided by licensees and their authorised representatives. ASIC should also conduct financial advice shadow shopping exercises annually.
This is an incredibly important recommendation that ensures that ASIC is keeping an eye on the behaviour of the industry, particularly over the time that these changes would take place—assuming that they are adopted by the government, of course.
The third recommendation—also an incredibly important one given the lack of understanding by many clients of advisers of the way in which their relationship actually plays out—is that the Corporations Act be amended to require advisers to disclose prominently in marketing material restrictions on the advice they are able to provide consumers and any potential conflicts of interest. Again, this recommendation came about because of the clear evidence that many advisers are taking commissions or other fees and many are in fact only representing a small number of products, which means again a person can go to a financial adviser believing that they are receiving open and independent advice and are really talking to a person who is only able to provide advice concerning a small range of products. It is an incredibly important recommendation that will make a substantial difference to investors.
The inquiry attracted considerable debate about whether banning commission-based remuneration is required to overcome the conflict of interest that it creates. Some argued that disclosure and conduct requirements have failed to adequately manage those conflicts and that a ban is now warranted, while others claimed that removing these payment methods would increase the cost and decrease the accessibility of advice for consumers. There was also discussion about whether enabling payments to be made as a percentage of funds under management represented an effective compromise between removing conflicts and maintaining affordability. This is an incredibly difficult issue. In the end, the committee resolved to recommend that the industry and the government work together to find the most appropriate mechanism by which to cease payments from financial product manufacturers to financial advisers. This is a very difficult issue. The industry is currently essentially supported by the flow of commissions, trail commissions and you name it, from product providers. This would be a substantial change within the industry and would require considerable consultation to ensure that it did happen in a way that did not put the price of advice out of the range of consumers. The asset-based fees were also criticised, most effectively by Choice magazine, who were very strong in their criticism of that particular kind of fee structure.
The committee also recommended that the government consider the implications of making the cost of financial advice tax deductible for consumers as part of its response to the Treasury review into the tax system, also an important consideration if we are to keep advice affordable.
There are a number of other recommendations that I will not cover because I am going to run out of time but I would like to cover recommendation 11, which concerns financial literacy. It is an issue everywhere but it is particularly important in Australia, where we have so many inexperienced investors, that we work hard to improve the level of financial literacy. I suspect that most members of parliament through the financial crisis have met with constituents who have lost everything who had all of their assets in investments which were so inappropriate it is almost unimaginable that any reputable adviser could have advised them to do so. There were people who took all of their workers compensation payouts, for example, and put them in one company—Rio Tinto in the case of one constituent. People find themselves in appalling circumstances because of a complete lack of understanding of risk. One man who lost all his money in the share market did not actually understand that his money was not in the bank. He wanted to know where his money was and I was not able to get through to him that there is a difference between a bank deposit and buying shares. This is a man who had invested his entire superannuation payout and lost it all, with no understanding at all of what he was actually doing in making that decision. There is no doubt that we have to make strong efforts here to improve the financial literacy of our population, particularly targeted to groups in the community who are likely to be seeking financial advice for the first time.
This is a very good report. It makes a number of recommendations that will make real differences should they be accepted by the government, and I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,18,2
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—I am very pleased to speak on the report of the Inquiry into Financial Products and Services in Australia by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The report has received a great deal of attention and arises from events that also received a great deal of attention, particularly the recent collapses of, for example, Storm Financial and Opes Prime. The strength of the committee’s recommendations rests on over 400 submissions that were received, more than half of which came from people affected by the collapse of Storm Financial. I think everyone knows the reality of the tragedy experienced by people and how devastating the effect was when people made decisions on advice that led to considerable loss. I praise the committee for their patience and sensitivity in dealing with so many individuals who were prepared to come forward and share their personal stories. It was not a case of their always being misled or of their not being aware of the risks—sometimes they were, sometimes they were not—but we have found that honest pricing, analysis or disclosure of risk has been a real issue in terms of the false confidence that preceded the global financial crisis. It certainly distorted behaviours both in the financial sector and by investors, and it certainly had a devastating impact when things went drastically wrong.
My colleagues who have spoken on this have said that we were not a judge or jury, and we were not. We were not there as a court and we were not there to be the final arbiter on these matters, but we certainly were there to expose the issues, to draw attention to the factors that caused these losses and to try to recommend better ways forward, ways that would not just strengthen the financial services industry but also protect the interests of Australian investors and Australians who avail themselves of financial services.
In our final deliberations we said that, for some individuals, there was clearly inappropriate advice and we noted that there was a preference by financial advisors and an acceptance by lenders of a one-size-fits-all approach. That is never the best case for the interests of the individual and, in drawing attention to those sorts of practices, I hope we have perhaps made people scrutinise their responsibility when looking at vulnerable individuals or the customers and clients who come to them, and their understanding that each of them has individual circumstances and should be assessed individually.
There was a lot of evidence around the shifting of responsibility, perhaps too casually and too carelessly, or around the failure by some to accept that they had a responsibility, whether it was the banks, the financial advisors, the lenders or even the investors. As a result, all those I have mentioned now know that they could have done better. We cannot wind back the clock, nor can we change what did occur for people, and we can never develop or guarantee an absolutely failsafe system. But we can expose the issues and the problems and we can get people to account for their behaviour, which is very hard to do. So I congratulate the Chair, who is sitting beside me, because to have all our banks present in public hearings was quite an achievement. I know that behind the scenes he, and our secretariat, worked very hard to make sure that those who had played a role were there to account for themselves.
The committee’s overall recommendations are there to improve the system. They are designed to improve professionalism, behaviour and, hopefully, outcomes. They deal with setting up a better regulatory framework around financial advice and overcoming conflicts of interest. I have been very pleased to listen to the chairman, Bernie Ripoll, speaking in the media today and last night around the area of fiduciary duty. It is not acceptable that conflict of interest exists between investors and financial advisers. There will always be the greatest protection when there is an acceptance that the interests of the investor must go before the interests of the adviser. There cannot be a conflict of interest. If financial advisers and planners are to be taken seriously then they must take seriously their responsibility to their clients’ interests and put them first. So our major recommendation is a very appropriate one.
There has been discussion about whether we can make people do things and make the industry do things. There is some problem with standards, and we have encouraged the industry itself to be involved in improving those standards so that there is public confidence in services provided. There has been a lot of discussion about how financial advisers set their fees and the relationship they have with their client around that. I spoke at the Newcastle chapter of the Financial Planning Association, and they shared with me their concerns. Often financial advisers are very small operators. They explained to me some of the complexity around deciding how fees are set. I do praise the committee’s report for allowing some flexibility in regard to the choice of fees and some self-regulation in that way. An excellent measure that we also recommended was that there can be no kickbacks—commissions—from a product developer who obviously gives incentives to financial planners and advisers to sell their products to an ordinary investor. That is a very, very strong recommendation, I agree, and I am very pleased that that is there. If you take the conflict of interest measure and the requirement to take no kickbacks or fees, and you commit to that, I think that is a very good way forward.
We have also recommended that the government consider the implications of making the cost of financial advice tax deductible. I have been on previous committees that looked at this issue, and I can only say that one committee I was on recommended that young people, particularly in their first job or on first joining a superannuation fund, should be given at least one session of tax-free financial advice. But in our report we are looking at it in a more holistic way, and I would very much welcome the study of that by the government.
We have also recommended that ASIC step up. It is really important for ASIC to have a strong role to play, to be resourced, to be the enforcer, to be able to look at competencies and standards for the industry and to be able to effect change and improvement. So we have proposed some more effective regulatory enforcement measures, and I must praise the government for its reforms under the Corporations Act.
We have also recommended around financial literacy. I have strong views that some of the methods we use do not reach the most vulnerable groups, and we know that vulnerable groups are people who perhaps have cash in their hands—be it a lump sum, retirement money, a superannuation payout or a redundancy. They have got money to invest, and I do think that ASIC should do more around that area. But we have also recognised that ASIC understands the problem. We have made recommendations to lower the threshold for ASIC to remove individuals and licensees from the industry.
To protect investors when collapses do occur, we did recommend that some statutory last-resort compensation funds for investors be considered. We have seen that the professional indemnity insurance scheme has a great number of deficiencies when it comes to protecting the interests of investors.
Our work around margin loans and margin calls was noted by the government. Their reform measures in the Corporations Act preceded our report but I think was certainly shaped by our report. That has been the wonderful thing about this inquiry. I think the government was listening, ASIC was listening, consultations were constant and the government were responding. I congratulate all the members. I know that the Queensland members, in particular, were seriously concerned for many of their constituents who suffered losses. I know that the chairman, in his relationships with the sector, and the people who submitted strengthened our reputation and our status and the quality of this report. I hope that that will be recognised by the government when they respond to our recommendations.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,18,2
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2009-11-24,"—by leave—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, and to the opposition, for allowing me the time to speak. History is a hard lesson to learn again. That is something that I always have in the back of my mind. In 1927 the internationally renowned economist John Maynard Keynes categorically said, ‘We will not have any more crashes in our time.’ This profound observation just before the greatest market crash of all time teaches us that making sweeping statements or being overly excited about one’s self-importance are both recipes for disaster. Today many will expect legislators to find the silver bullet that prevents the likes of the Storm Financials of the world and others from ever happening again in the future. But history should teach us that a complete cure is elusive while meaningful reform and progressive improvement are the best medicine, although I have got to say that they are not quite as colourful at the time.
Reform in the financial services sector has been evolving continuously over the past 30 years. But rarely does an event on the scale of the global financial crisis give us the opportunity to accelerate reform in a sector crying out for a fresh direction. Some would argue that because Australia fared better than most in the global financial crisis then reform is only necessary at the margins or that investors should be better informed. Unfortunately, this is the case of the selective analysis, where some are all too willing to forget the catastrophic lessons learned by many unfortunate souls.
Of course short memory is not new and the status quo always suits some more than it does others. But I am certain that that would not be the view of the tens of thousands of investors that have lost in agribusiness management investment schemes, lost their life savings and more with Storm Financial, and all those caught up in the Opes Prime Stockbroking swindle along with dozens of other similar enterprises. Court cases, legal action and compensation schemes aside, people are seeking acknowledgement of their circumstances and someone with authority to recognise the devastating impact of what has happened to them. People want simple answers and they want practical solutions. While the basic principles of life and money have never changed—the only things that are guaranteed are death and tax; if it is too good to be true then it usually is; don’t put all your eggs in one basket; and don’t believe everything you read or hear—we also need to recognise that life is not always that clear or that transparent.
Everyone at some point in time needs protection from those that would take advantage of all of us—the vulnerable, the elderly or those without sufficient understanding. Hence there is the need to regulate markets, behaviour and corporations in this sector, which I think is essential. No-one should argue that without the rules or in a free-for-all environment not much would work in any effective manner. Survival of the fittest sometimes also equals survival of very few. Of course too much of this good thing—regulation—can also be a bad thing. Striking a balance between the cost of regulation and a free market is always the challenge of governments and industry. This is not a question of how much regulation but how well it works and how efficient it is for the sector that makes any real sense in the end.
Under reforms from past governments and regulators the financial services sector has made good progress, albeit with the expected cries of concern at the time for the end of the sector as we know it with tens of thousands of jobs at risk—similar to the cries you will hear at other times of reform. Of course this is to be expected and does not reflect in any way the reality either in the industry or in the growth in products and innovation or jobs that are created through progressive reform.
That is exactly what the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services aimed at delivering, and I believe did deliver. The report on the financial services sector lays down clear markers and a plan for the future about direction, about the quality of advice and about the appropriateness of remuneration models. With current research indicating that only two to three people get advice at all, it is clear that something in the sector does not work today. It indicates the problems faced by the sector are wide ranging and require a rethink. My view has always been that rather than squabble over the small industry pie we must consider serious reform for growth to capture the other 75 per cent and to understand why they cannot afford financial advice or do not see the possible value in it in the first place.
Reform at its core must be principles based, with a focus on consumer protection and value for money. An industry standard of financial services that are a fair exchange of a fee for a service based on actual work performed must be the basis of the relationship between client and adviser, not between manufacturer and adviser. This, in concert with an explicit obligation to have a fiduciary responsibility—that is, a responsibility for those in a special position of trust—will drive the lifting of standards, drive the lifting of the quality of advice and remove the conflicts of interest that currently exist. As with most things in life, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately for many in recent years, they got more than they bargained for and are still left wearing the cost.
I had a short opportunity in the House recently to introduce the report, and I know that most people are focused on just a few of the recommendations, but I want to turn in the few minutes I have left to the other recommendations of the report, which I think are as significant as the major recommendations which underpin what needs to take place. Certainly I think that the heart of this report is about the fiduciary responsibility. It is about making clear to people in the advice industry that they have a responsibility to their clients and that that responsibility extends to the fact that it should be their clients’ interests first, ahead of their own interests. I think that is an important principle. Coupled with that principle is that of a complementary remuneration model, one that is fair. It is based on a fee—something that is tangible and understood, something that can be turned on or off and something that is a deal or a bargain between the client and the adviser, not something that is hidden, embedded or complicated into some product and that cannot be disentangled. I think that those two principles, along with quality of advice, form the basis of what this report is about.
But I want to turn also to ASIC. We certainly believe that ASIC ought to have much more focused attention on its role in this very complex area. ASIC covers a vastly greater proportion of people than APRA. It really regulates the consumer market and, as such, faces a much more difficult task. But we believe that ASIC has the appropriate people, the skills, the knowledge and the history to be able to do more in these areas. There is an expectation that ASIC as the regulator do more, and that is our expectation as well. That is not so much a critique of ASIC but just our expectation of what it ought to do in the future. We have made a number of recommendations around the regulator specifically.
That is coupled with extending the powers of ASIC to ban individuals from the sector, because all too often what we heard during this inquiry was that you had ‘bad people’—it is always the few rotten apples that make it bad for the whole sector. Unfortunately, they finish work on a Friday in a particular organisation—whether forced to leave or otherwise—and end up on a Monday morning working for somebody else down the road and continuing their poor practice. The industry say to me that that has to stop, and we agree with them. We think that has to stop. If there are bad people in the sector, they ought to go, because in the end it ought to be the client’s interests that are ahead of the adviser’s interests.
We believe that, in particular in relation to agribusiness MI schemes, those schemes ought to demonstrate a sufficient working capital to meet their current obligations. We saw the disaster of Great Southern and Timbercorp, which left more than 60,000 investors out of pocket. That is not good enough, and I think that there ought to be rules that reflect a better regulatory environment to make sure that people have confidence in the people that manage these schemes on their behalf.
We also agreed with ASIC, the regulator, that they could deny an application for a licence on the basis that a licensee may not comply with regulation or the law. That is a fairly big step forward but I think an important one in a preventative measure. All too often we have heard from the regulator that they can only act after the fact, after the incident or after a complaint. We believe that some more powers in this area are appropriate and can be well managed by the regulator. We also believe that having a strong, independent, industry based professional standards body that works in complement with the regulator would be a huge step forward in making regulation and compliance in the sector—which we acknowledge is very complex—an easier task.
We went further to say that we believe that there does exist a circumstance where an absolute last resort statutory compensation scheme could benefit some investors. We understand the moral hazard but we also believe that where particular organisations or individuals do the wrong thing, they are no longer covered by their insurance and investors should still have some minimal compensation in those circumstances. We took note of the great work done by the Financial Ombudsman Service and in the United Kingdom in this particular area.
All of these recommendations, if taken as a totality or as a whole, do work together. They work as complements to each other; they work in concert and can deliver a much more effective industry that is focused on consumer protection first. It is focused on standards and it is focused on lifting the educational levels within the sector. We have also made recommendations in terms of ASIC working more closely with the sector to develop those educational activities to be targeted at the right people. In particular the advisers themselves need to have a higher standard of education as the current standard is just far too low, as is acknowledged by the sector. All of these things coupled together can produce some real significant change, a real difference. It can restore credibility to financial services in this country and can provide the confidence that consumers need.
If we get all of those things right we can grow the market. I think that 25 per cent of people in Australia seeking financial advice is way too low. I know the industry agrees with me; it is too low. But currently there is nothing being done at a wholesale level which will actually take that 25 per cent of people to 50 per cent. I believe that people should have more ability to be independent in their retirement beyond what is provided as a safety net through a pension system provided by the government. There needs to be a little bit more and people do that through superannuation, through their own savings and through their home. They need to be more involved and more independent. They can do that through getting good, solid, sound financial advice about how to manage their savings and how to have a more independent retirement. That is an important thing.
But to do all of that you have to get the principles right in the sector first. I acknowledge how much work is being done currently in the sector by representatives—I will not mention any because I know if I leave some out the others will be cranky with me. There is some really good work being done to make sure that we lift those standards and make those improvements. If we get all of that right, not only will we grow the market, not only will we protect consumers but we will make a more effective and more efficient financial services sector in Australia. It can really be seen as a financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific region, which is where I believe there is huge growth potential for jobs in this country.
Lastly—and I have left it to last because I think it is significant that I mention it last in terms of the tax deductibility issue—unless we get all of those things right first we cannot get to the tax deduction. For me, I see it as the big carrot or the big opportunity for the financial services sector and for each individual person who works in it whether they are a licensee themselves or an authorised representative. If they want that big carrot in order to be able to deliver for individuals and grow that market then they need to get the rest of it right first. The regulatory system needs to be more effective and efficient. We have understood, in the work that we have done, that there is a cost to regulation. This is not about more regulation; it is about effective regulation. It is about setting the goals and the markers. I want to see a thriving financial services sector in the next five to 10 years. I want to see the base grow from 25 per cent to 50 per cent but I want to see it done in the right way. I believe that with the principles we have put down in this report we will achieve that.

Mr Laming interjecting—
 (Mr S Georganas)—Are you seeking an intervention, Member for Bowman?
—Mr Deputy Speaker, would the member for Oxley accept a question?
—Will the member for Oxley accept an intervention?
—Yes.
—Would the member provide his advice on whether he supports the shift from commission-based to fee-based remuneration for financial advice?
—Absolutely, and I thank the member for his question. Recommendation 4 in the committee report is very clear. I will read it. It says:
The committee recommends that the government consult with and support industry…
I think that is really important.
… in developing the most appropriate mechanism by which to cease payments from product manufacturers to financial advisers.
What that clearly says is to stop payments, all payments, whatever form they take. People can decide for themselves. We did not limit ourselves to one type of payment but the committee decided unanimously that it was all the payments. That can be volume bonuses, shelf fees, soft dollar incentives and commissions right across the board. We felt there was inherent conflict of interest that existed with a person being paid to sell you something. Often it is not clear that you are actually being sold a product rather than being provided advice. That is the clear point.
You can separate the two. People can genuinely pay to receive advice, and that advice does not need to be attached to a product. You can receive advice and have a product as well, and as long as that is transparent and clear you can live in both worlds. But currently there is a problem. There is a big grey area where often people who advise actually do not know whether it is advice or whether it is a product, and all too often we have seen people get caught up in that problem.
I am very happy with the recommendations in this report. I want to thank the Liberal Party, National Party and Labor Party members of the committee for their great work. (Time expired)
