"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-05-10,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:31):  In Australia we are lucky enough to take aviation safety for granted. We have an impeccable safety record that is the envy of the world, but that is something that we must never be complacent about. It is fair to say that in the last few years the aviation sector has been under increasing pressure. There is a concern by those who care about safety the most—pilots and cabin crew—that there are matters that need to be addressed. That is why the Senate Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee undertook a comprehensive inquiry last year into aviation safety issues and made a number of key recommendations which, unfortunately, the government has not accepted, particularly in relation to ensuring that pilots who are in control of a large passenger capacity jet aircraft have at least 1,500 hours experience before they are in the cockpit. There is real concern that it is something that needs to be maintained.


The 2011 rural affairs and transport committee's inquiry into pilot training and aviation safety issues, unfortunately, raised more questions than it answered. Since then, the more answers I have tried to find, the more questions I have been forced to ask. Aviation Australia is a far cry from the organised, diligent system it appears. During that first inquiry, a pilot said to me privately, 'Better a Senate inquiry now than a royal commission later.' It is a thought that bears deep contemplation. We have reached the stage where if we do not act, if we do not do all that must be done, that appreciably materially compromises aviation safety in this country. That is the motivation behind this bill, the Air Navigation and Civil Aviation Amendment (Aircraft Crew) Bill 2011, and the Qantas Sale Amendment (Still Call Australia Home) Bill 2011 that will be debated shortly.


Last year I was contacted by Jetstar cabin crew over their concerns about how Thai based Jetstar crew were being treated. These crew were based in Thailand but regularly worked on flights travelling between Australian domestic airports and carrying domestic passengers. Even though they were flying domestic routes on Australian planes, often working side-by-side with Australian crew, they were employed under Thai contracts. That meant their pay was a fraction of what their Australian colleagues were earning and their contracts were not subject to Australian workplace conditions. Shifts of up to 20 hours straight with no limits on duty extensions meant that these flight attendants were so exhausted they doubted whether they could react appropriately in an emergency.


On average Thai based flight attendants get paid a base salary of $258 a month. For each hour they fly they get an additional $7 plus allowances. In fairness to the CEO of Jetstar, Mr Bruce Buchanan, with whom I have had some constructive discussions about this, he says that the base pay is not a fair comparison because they do get those extra allowances. But their pay would still be about one-third of that of an Australian based crew for the same sort of work. They do not have sick leave entitlements and they have about half the annual leave of their Australian counterparts. When they do take leave, they are only paid $9 a day on top of their base wage.


These flight attendants approached me via Australian based crew who were concerned about their conditions. They are terrified of the consequences and terrified of repercussions if they speak out. They are employed by a company called Tour East Thailand which has contracted workers to Jetstar. The approach of the Qantas group in relation to this is to say, 'It's a separate entity; we didn't know what was going on.' Well, Tour East Thailand is 37 per cent owned by Qantas. Qantas is a substantial shareholder in that company. 


As it turned out, the cabin crew were right to be frightened. In April last year five Thai based crew pulled out of a domestic flight between Sydney and Melbourne because they were exhausted after a series of international and domestic flights, including back of clock operations where they were literally up all night as part of their duties. Typically it could be Sydney-Denpasar-Sydney, which is an 18- to 19-hour shift from the time they are picked up from their hotel to the time they are dropped off. Instead of being supported in their decision not to risk passenger safety, they were threatened with dismissal by Tour East Thailand. They were admonished; they were threatened with repercussions if they ever did that again. The letter they received from Tour East Thailand stated that 'poor time management' was not accepted and that the company required an undertaking that they would not 'repeat these behaviours in the workplace'. That is simply outrageous. It is unacceptable because, when it comes to issues of fatigue and aircraft safety, it is important that cabin crew are there primarily—as they remind us, as they should—for our safety in the event of an emergency. If crew are simply so fatigued that they would not be able to function in the event of an emergency, that is a serious concern. What concerns me is that CASA, our regulator, which does have a significant and onerous task in dealing with aircraft safety in this country, is still working on issues of fatigue management and is proceeding slowly. The sooner there are regulations and rules in place specifically in relation to fatigue management for cabin attendants the better off we will all be.


This bill's purpose is to create a level playing field for those crew members and to stop airlines exploiting foreign labour to cut costs. In response to concerns raised during the committee stage of the bill, I have circulated amendments that will alter the bill to amend the Fair Work Act to ensure that overseas based cabin crew working on domestic legs of international flights come under the jurisdiction of this act. The second amendment introduces a requirement for all holders of Australian aircraft operators certificates to have a fatigue risk manage­ment system in place. That is long overdue. These are sensible and fair measures to ensure both passenger and crew safety.


It is worth reflecting on a story on the ABC1 Latelineprogram on 30 September last year, which revealed that a Jetstar worker had quit over conditions and safety concerns. A former flight attendant told Latelinethat he quit his job at Jetstar because of safety concerns over long shifts for cabin crew and about staff not being able to answer safety questions. This piece of investigative reporting revealed that a clause in the contract of Singapore based Jetstar crew states that they can be forced to work shifts that are longer than 20 hours—something an Australian based crew cannot do, nowhere near that. Two weeks before quitting, former Jetstar flight attendant Dallas Finn filed an incident report about fatigue after flying five return international flights in five days. He said:


The majority of these flights were quite busy. I found that my sleeping patterns were drastically affected to the point of fatigue. Clearly there are safety issues here pertaining to cabin crew if an emergency situation arises on the return flight from Saigon or Manila where the duty is 12 to 13 hours return.


Mr Finn told Lateline that cabin crew were forced to work long hours. He said:


The majority of the flights out of here from Darwin are all back of the clock, so you're leaving early evening and you're not getting back till quite early the next morning.


He then described how the Ho Chi Minh flight could be 12 to 13 hours. But Mr Finn said it was a flight that he shared with Singapore based staff that gave him more cause for concern. He said:


Before we actually get on a flight we have to go through a briefing; one is ... the questions are on emergency procedure, on occupational health and safety procedure, and a medical question.


I went to answer the emergency and the medical question when the cabin manager stopped me to get the Singapore crew to actually answer the questions, and basically they couldn't answer the emergency procedure and they couldn't actually answer the medical question.


It was the first time I've ever been scared of actually flying because if something went down I didn't know if that crew would be able to back me up.


Jetstar says that they comply and that there are no issues for concern. But, when pilots from Jetstar have told me—and I am very grateful to those pilots for contacting me on a regular basis to tell me about their concerns—that there are cabin crew they have concerns about, where they actually have had to say, 'I don't think you should be flying,' that is a real concern in terms of the way Australian aviation operates.


Jetstar is now under investigation by Fair Work Australia due to these practices. In response, Jetstar has said that it will cap the number of domestic routes that overseas crew can fly. So in a sense it is fair to say that Jetstar has been caught out and that it has now changed some of its practices, which is welcome. I do welcome the dialogue I have from time to time with Mr Buchanan, the CEO of Jetstar. I will be able to expand on that in the other bill. Their concern is that aviation is a very tough international environment and that, in order to survive, they need to take these sorts of operational decisions in order for Jetstar to be competitive. But I beg to differ in relation to that, given that the cost of cabin crew as a proportion of an airline's total operating expenses is a very small fraction of what it costs to run an airline. If the cost of paying people one-third of the Australian wages on a domestic flight is upped to Aussie conditions, I cannot see how that would add a punitive onus on that airline.


The current laws and regulations are not tight enough to make sure that a company cannot wriggle out of its obligations. That is my concern. Currently, flights are tagged with identifying numbers that show whether they are international or domestic, but the numbers are assigned by the airlines themselves and they do not appear to have any strict regulations or criteria to determine what constitutes a domestic versus an international flight. When I asked a question in the Senate about this, I think the minister was genuinely trying to be helpful but it did not really answer the question in that it was left to the discretion of the airlines. For instance, a flight that originates in Adelaide and is tagged with an international number can fly to Melbourne and then to Sydney and then on to Brisbane before it leaves on its international leg, and that is not prevented under the current rules. All of that is fine, but problems arise when the airline carries domestic passengers on those legs. If all the passengers that get on the plane at each domestic airport are going to stay on the flight until it reaches its international destination, it can properly be considered an international flight. I have no issue with that. But, if a passenger gets on in Melbourne and flies the domestic leg to Sydney, is it still a truly international flight? Is it appropriate for some of those cabin crew to be paid one-third of what their Australian counterparts are getting?


Overseas based cabin crew who operate on flights with domestic tags are required to hold 457 visas. These visas come with various rules in relation to pay and workplace conditions. Importantly, these visas can only be granted where an employer can demonstrate that there is a genuine need that cannot be filled with Australian workers. However, overseas based cabin crew working on Australian flights with international tags are paid under a special visa designed to facilitate their entry into the country since, reasonably enough, they are not expected to stay for long periods. This visa does not carry any of the conditions of a 457 visa, and the decision of which visa to grant relies almost solely on what tag number the flights have. The tag number, as I mentioned earlier, is chosen by the airlines themselves and is apparently not subject to any regulations. It should be, and that is what this bill is trying to deal with. An airline can use this loophole to save a few dollars in wages without any difficult workplace relations conditions to get in the way.


I acknowledge the work and the contribution of my colleagues Senator Gallacher and Senator Sterle to the Senate inquiries into this matter. They both have long and esteemed careers in the transport industry and know a thing or two about it. My plea to Senators Sterle and Gallacher is that this loophole needs to be addressed. It is a loophole that has been fixed up in shipping, which I will refer to shortly, but not in relation to this. In fact, the savings that can be made through this loophole are apparently so great that, according to Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce—who I do not think is any relation to Senator Joyce—




Senator Joyce:
  He might be. You never know.




Senator XENOPHON:
  He might be. Senator Joyce has a cheeky grin on his face; I do not think they are related. They might be, but very distantly. According to Alan Joyce, the Qantas Group would have to quite simply pull out of its Darwin and Cairns operations. That is scaremongering of the highest order. It is misleading, and the Qantas Group, to my understanding—and Senators Sterle or Gallacher can correct me on this—has not given us details of how much the cabin crew make as a proportion of their costs. I think Senator Sterle is saying that is the case; it has not provided that information, as it indicated that it would during the Senate inquiry.


This threat, made in the Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee's 6 February 2012 hearing into the bill raises the question: is the Qantas Group so dependent on underpaid workers that it will fold a number of its routes if it has to pay people a fair wage? It has been estimated that cabin crew costs make up less than 10 percent of aircraft operating costs, according to an article from the Economic Times in January 2010, and, as I said we are still waiting for that information.


I have asked questions of the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in the Senate to see if the circumstances surrounding visas could be clarified. They could not. There appear to be stricter rules applying to international airlines with international crew, but little that applies to international crew on Australian airlines. I strongly urge that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship investigate these circumstances because it is not right, and it is not fair that overseas workers be exploited to make an Australian airline a quick buck.


During the committee inquiry process I faced accusations that I had something against Qantas and did not want it to succeed. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I was on a Qantas flight this morning. Like most Australians, I feel an incredible sense of pride in the flying kangaroo. There is nothing better than sitting in a foreign airport and catching sight of that red tail as the plane thunders past. There are few companies that inspire such fierce loyalty among its employees and its passengers. The very reason I fought so hard for these changes is I share that same loyalty. I do not want a truly Australian Qantas to be a thing of the past, and I do not want Australia's safety reputation to be in any way compromised as a result of cost-cutting measures.


The true intention of this bill is not just to protect overseas workers from being exploited. It is also to make sure there are regulations in place to stop staff being pushed to their limits and into a physical and mental state that is just not safe; not to them and not to the passengers they are there to protect in the event of an emergency. In an emergency, cabin crew must react instinctively to direct passengers and operate safety equipment—they must not be physically and mentally exhausted from excessively long hours. There are also the post-flight conditions to think of. For years, cabin crew members have been complaining to Jetstar about excessively long duties that have left them too tired to travel home safely. I have heard a number of stories of people having accidents on their way from a long shift because they were simply too fatigued.


I also note the similarities between the circumstances I have outlined and changes that the government has made in a similar area. 'Flags of convenience' are almost universally popular in the shipping industry. Essentially, your ship abides by the rules of whichever country it is registered in—hence the popularity of Panama and similar countries, where the laws relating to everything from safety and maintenance to workplace conditions are far more lax and, in some cases, virtually non-existent.


In 1992, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure published a report titled Inquiry into ship safety: ships of shame, which detailed stories of crews paid a pittance or not at all, of unseaworthy vessels, of uncertified crew and poor safety equipment, of falsified documents and of brutal treatment. The committee found that commercial pressures were the major factor behind these problems. A further report in 1995 revisited the issue because the exposure of the first report had 'not ended the exploitation, denial and physical abuse of seafarers'.


Finally, some changes came into effect in January 2010, with the regulations for the Fair Work Act specifically stating that vessels with continuous voyage permits and those with three or more single voyage permits issued in a 12-month period are covered by the Fair Work Act. If the government has deemed it reasonable to take this step there is no reason it cannot deem it reasonable to take similar steps for the aviation industry. Effectively, if a foreign registered ship is travelling from Sydney to Melbourne and is carrying domestic cargo it must pay Australian rates and conditions. What difference is there when we are talking about an Australian aircraft flying a domestic route and carrying domestic passengers, but not paying its workers on that flight Australian rates and conditions? It is as simple as that. If we can deal with 'ships of shame' we should be able to deal with 'planes of pain'.


The government must take action on this. It is not fair. It is not acceptable. It is, quite simply, unjust. It is exploiting overseas workers and it is also taking away Australian jobs in circumstances where they should not be taken away. This is only one small aspect of the problems facing Australia's aviation industry, but it is an important one not just in terms of safety but also in terms of people's rights.


I said earlier that my involvement in these issues has raised more questions than answers. This is one of the very few answers; this bill and the amendments circulated do not place an undue burden on airlines. This is about fixing an anomaly—a loophole—that needs to be sorted out here and now. This is an opportunity for this chamber to deal with it. This is an opportunity to remedy a clear loophole that must be sorted out once and for all.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2012-05-10,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (09:51):  I think Senator Xenophon has raised some very valid concerns on behalf of some very concerned people. Unfortunately, we just do not believe that the bill is the way to go in respect of resolving those issues. Essentially this bill seeks to impose new conditions on international airline licences and air operator certificate holders with the intention of ensuring that all flight and cabin crew employed by related airline companies are offered the same terms and conditions as Australian based crew employed directly by that airline.


The scope of the bill is very broad. It applies to a wide range of business relationships, and the cost implications of the bill would threaten the viability on a range of routes. I will highlight some of those routes later on. Senator Xenophon's proposed amendments rewrite the bill but continue to raise issues for the commercial operations of our airlines and pre-empt CASA's work in relation to fatigue management as well as departmental consideration of matters raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport in its report on the bill. The government does not support the bill.


The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport has examined the bill, proposed amendments to it and has recommended against passing it. The bill is in breach of our international obligations. The bill would significantly restrict Australian airlines in their capacity to operate internationally and to form very important strategic partnerships with other carriers. Wages and conditions of employees of Australian airlines are matters for the Fair Work Act 2009, consistent with the approach the government has taken in other industries. Safety issues such as fatigue management are being addressed by the safety regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, following advice received from the International Civil Aviation Organisation on relevant standards and further recommended practices.


Essentially, as I have said, this bill would severely restrict the ability of Australian based airlines to compete in the international aviation market. The committee did take evidence from Virgin and Qantas in respect of specific areas of that restriction. A requirement to offer Australian wages and conditions to crew employed by codeshare partners in other countries would effectively limit Australian carriers to a very small number of routes on which they provide direct services. As a result, the choices for the Australian travelling public would be very much restricted. For example, the bill would effectively prevent Australian airlines offering codeshare services to destinations such as Nashville, Dusseldorf, Dunedin, Miami and probably quite a number of others. This would reduce the choices for the Australian travelling public.


There are also serious concerns in respect of international law, as the bill imposes Australian workplace laws on foreign airlines operating in foreign countries. The government notes that the proposed amendments have been circulated in an attempt to address some of these issues, but the bill would still have an impact on Australian airlines' ability to compete with international rivals and undermine the work already being done to manage fatigue among cabin crew. The government supports the committee recommendation not to pass the bill.


The government has paid careful consideration to the issues raised in the Senate committee inquiry into the bill in relation to fair pay for the crew of safe airlines. The government recognises that concerns have been raised about the wages and conditions that are offered to foreign based airline crew flying in Australia. These issues are related to concerns about fairness and the way airlines manage fatigue among cabin crew. But the bill makes it virtually impossible for our airlines to compete in the international aviation market. The government will be accepting the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport's recommendation that the bill not be passed.


While the proposed amendments completely change the bill, the revised bill is unnecessary in light of the ongoing work that government is progressing to address these issues. The government is currently undertaking an independent review of the Fair Work Act. The independent panel is due to provide a report to the government on 31 May. The government will consider the review panel's report and determine whether amendments to the Fair Work Act are required.


The scope of this bill is very wide. It applies to a wide range of commercial arrangements. Virgin Australia and Qantas would need to ensure that the crew employed by their codeshare partners are offered wages and conditions comparable to their own crew. This would have a significant adverse effect on the commercial competitiveness of Australia's international airlines in an increasingly difficult operating environment. This also raises serious concerns in relation to international law, our bilateral air service agreements and our mutual recognition of aviation regulatory arrangements with New Zealand, due to the extraterritorial implica­tion or application of workplace conditions.


The bill also attempts to deal with concerns in relation to the management of fatigue amongst cabin crew. Safety issues such as fatigue management are being appro­priately addressed by the safety regulator, CASA, and following advice from the International Civil Aviation Organisation on the relevant standards and recommended practices. CASA released a draft proposal on flight crew fatigue for public comment on 1 May, and a draft proposal for cabin crew fatigue is scheduled for later this year. Legislation is therefore unnecessary in light of CASA's ongoing work to provide better systems for fatigue management.


Senator Xenophon's amendments completely rewrite the bill. However, the amendments do not address the concerns with the original bill. The proposal to require AOC holders to develop a system of fatigue management is unnecessary in light of the ongoing work by ICAO and CASA. The revised bill also amends the Fair Work Act 2009 to extend the Australian workplace relations framework to all aircraft crew performing work in Australian domestic aviation.


The Fair Work Act principally regulates employment relationships. In contrast, the revised bill would impose workplace relations obligations and circumstances where there is no employment relationship. Because of this and a number of technical issues with the bill, the government does not support the revised bill. However, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations is currently considering whether the Fair Work Act covers foreign airline crew working on Australian domestic flights and whether any legislative change is required.


In short, the bill would significantly restrict Australian airlines in their capacity to operate internationally and to form strategic partnerships with other carriers, and it would certainly reduce the choices available to the Australian travelling public. Wages and conditions of employees, in Australia, of Australian airlines are matters for the Fair Work Act 2009, consistent with the approach taken across industries. Safety is the business of CASA. The amended bill is unnecessary in light of CASA's ongoing work to provide better systems for fatigue management.


I would like to say a number of other things. It is very clear that there are some widely held and deeply felt concerns amongst flight crew in the operations in Australia. They have been raised very visibly, very publicly and very appropriately by Senator Xenophon. The fact that he has been able to elevate these concerns and this dispute to this place is a significant achievement for those people. A number of them gave evidence about their fear of possible retribution, lack of promotion, lack of job opportunities and the loss of their entire career. Those people were fair dinkum and their evidence was fair dinkum. The fact that the matter has been elevated to debate in this place is a good thing, and credit is in no small part due to Senator Xenophon.


The push for cheaper and cheaper fares puts pressure on all of the airline industry operations, and on no-one more than on pilots and aircrew. The questionable practices in relation to the Thai based labour hire company are just an example of the result of the never-ceasing drive to give Australians cheaper airfares. But amongst all that you have got to remember that the reason we have flight attendants on a plane is that, when things happen, you have got to get off in 90 seconds. They are the people that have trained and trained to deal with the unlikely event of a plane coming down in a hurry. When the lights are off, there is an emergency and the slides are operating, you have got to follow the instructions of your flight crew. To push them beyond the limits of normal fatigue management is an absolute dereliction of managerial responsibility. To combine that with a miserable attempt at a salary on what is clearly a domestic Australian flight is a disgrace. Jetstar may tag their flights from Darwin to Sydney as international flights, but the reality is that the customer gets off, goes through customs and wanders away, and other people get back on, not through customs, just boarding a normal domestic service, and the flight crew who have operated the international sector then continue on the domestic sector. For those people not to be paid the same as Australian workers under the Fair Work Act is a disgrace.


If you want to take the push a bit further and, in search of cheaper fares, lower the very high pilot standards that Australia has enjoyed then there is probably a risk to that. The risk is that a person without the appropriate number of flying hours that we have required over the years may make a mistake. If you want to combine that lack of experience with fatigue and low wages then there are possibly grave concerns arising. I commend Senator Xenophon for raising that.


What I am saying, though, is that CASA and the Fair Work Act and the appropriate organisations that can represent people should have these matters resolved to the satisfaction of those people that have raised the issues with their company in the first instance. The evidence that was given to the hearing with CASA had no resolution. At least one of the witnesses made a statement that they thought that CASA would solve the problems, and, after repeated efforts, they had no resolution. That is up to CASA to respond to, but that was certainly given in evidence to the hearings. So I actually share Senator Xenophon's concerns in respect of some of these matters that have been raised. I just do not believe that this amended bill is the way forward.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-05-10,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:05):  I will not leave you in suspense, Mr Acting Deputy President. We will not be supporting the Air Navigation and Civil Aviation Amendment (Aircraft Crew) Bill 2011, for a range of reasons. Senator Gallacher went through them. We have to allow a company the capacity to deal in the markets that it operates in. If we were to pursue overseas an equivalence with the terms and conditions in Australia, the ultimate result would be that overseas flights would be stopped because we would be uncompetitive. The margins that airlines are on—you can see it around the world—are extremely tight, and we note quite a number of airlines going broke. It is a regular occurrence. So lumbering them up with more regulation and conditions which just will not cut the mustard and will not compete in overseas markets would in many instances be a short-term solution before that route was actually withdrawn.


I heard the sympathies that were well articulated by Senator Gallacher. My query is: if you hold those views so dearly, why don't you support the bill? What is your position? Is that the position of your party or is it the position that you hold?


There are a range of issues that are coming to light, and we can see them in regard to the lockout. A company has to be able to deal with its disputes as they arise. We want this organisation, Qantas, to remain a viable organisation in Australia. We should recognise how tight the margins are, especially with the Australian dollar where it is at the moment and the pressures that are on at the moment and also noting, really, the fact that its profit, for the capital that it has got employed, is very low. But it still exists, and we are seeing other airlines in other places currently shutting down.


I have briefly perused the Senate report. I note the emphatic and well-meaning endorsement by Senator Xenophon. If Alan Joyce were not my brother, I would probably consider—no, I am no relation!




Senator Sterle:
  I knew it!




Senator JOYCE:
  No, I am no relation to Alan.




Senator Birmingham:
  And that's a great relief to Alan!




Senator JOYCE:
  Yes, I know. I am taller, so I must be older! But, on a more serious note, issues of safety are something that the coalition are very aware of. If we genuinely believed that we were compromising the safety of people flying on an airline for which we had jurisdiction in some way then we would definitely be doing something about it. We believe that that is more in the realms of CASA and we will continue to rely on CASA to make sure that the safety of those who fly on these aircraft is maintained. There really is not much more to say that has not already been articulated in the coalition's dissenting report. As such, I will not hold the chamber up any longer. I just note that we will not be supporting the bill.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-05-10,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (10:09):  I rise to speak on the Air Navigation and Civil Aviation Amendment (Aircraft Crew) Bill 2011. This bill seeks to reverse the long-term successful trend of Australian governments in progressively opening up the Australian economy to international competition. I oppose this bill as it will unduly hamper what are successful Australian businesses. This bill will undermine the aviation industry, an industry which is amongst the most competitive, open and transparent in the world.


This bill amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 and the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to provide that an Australian airline, or a subsidiary of an Australian airline, is not issued an international aviation licence unless it provides the same wages and conditions to overseas based flight and cabin crew operating its flights as if they were directly employed by the airline. In essence, this bill undermines what should be the reciprocal opportunity for Australian airlines to compete with foreign businesses in their own markets.


Why on earth are those supporting this bill trying to impede Australian businesses from competing in foreign markets on the same terms as any other Australian business? As the coalition have always maintained, the management of private—and indeed public—companies and the decisions determined during the course of running their businesses should be the exclusive remit of those companies. This bill illegitimately impinges on the ability of a company—including our iconic and much-loved flying kangaroo—to make decisions in order to facilitate the effective management and running of its businesses. Individuals and Australian businesses should not be subjected to any legislation that removes their paramount and indisputable right to run themselves and to compete internationally as they see fit.


As a means by which to fully understand the opportunity that lies before Australia, it is imperative that we reflect on Qantas's value to the Australian economy both past and present. The history of Qantas is an extraordinary Australian success story. Established in the Queensland outback in 1920, Qantas has become Australia's largest domestic and international airline. It is held in high regard all over the world and considered one of the very best and safest long-distance carriers. The flying kangaroo is one of the strongest and most recognisable brands, which represents so much more than just a company; it represents the optimism and the success of Australian enterprise. Qantas has a strong reputation for safety, operational reliability, engineering and maintenance, and customer service.


Of the almost $15 billion of income earned by Qantas in the financial year 2010-11, the overwhelming portion was generated within the Australian economy under our laws and industrial relations rules. Qantas employs approximately 35,700 people, with 93 per cent of them based within Australia. The company is inextricably linked with the development of civil aviation in Australia and represents the confidence we have in Australian businesses to compete successfully in a globalised economy. From the humble beginnings operating fragile biplanes that carried only one or two passengers in open cockpits, Qantas, the flying kangaroo, now proudly operates the new Airbus A380s, flying some 450 people halfway around the world in a day. One would be hard pressed to find a better advertisement for Australian enterprise and our nation as a whole. Qantas's employees, shareholders and indeed Australia's national interest will all be well served in the long run if it can fully grasp the unprecedented opportunity for growth so often deemed the 'Asian century'.


There are a number of flaws in this bill that would have implications for its enforcement and negatively impact on the profitability of airlines operating in Australia. Firstly, the bill is extraterritorial in its scope. There is uncertainty about whether the bill imposes Australian employment conditions extraterritorially, forcing airlines to offer Australian wages and employment conditions to employees based outside of Australia—in Thailand, Singapore and so on. This may mean that it is inconsistent with Australia's bilateral air services arrangements. This bill has serious implications for airlines operating in Australia and their international competitiveness and profitability in both domestic and international markets. It is not reasonable or fair to expect any business but particularly airlines not to be able to compete in foreign markets on the same terms as other businesses competing in that market.


This bill also misguidedly uses air operators certificates, or AOCs, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Air Navigation Act 1920 to attempt to regulate industrial relations issues. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority was highly critical of the bill in this regard, stating in the CASA submission to the committee inquiry:


… CASA is seriously concerned that the addition of a workplace relations function would oblige CASA to become involved in negotiations between AOC holders and their employees on pay and working conditions … The perception of CASA as an independent safety regulator could be compromised if it were to become involved in vetting the pay and working conditions of AOC holder’s employees.


It simply does not make sense. CASA has long been held in this country as an organisation that is solely dedicated to the safety of Australians and to ensuring that AOC holders operate in the air with safety standards second to none elsewhere in the world. On the issue of fatigue management and safety, the airlines disputed the need for additional regulation. CASA stated that it was 'not aware of any negative safety trends' regarding AOC holders' foreign based crew.


The bill also contains a number of terms and conditions that are vague and would lead to uncertainty for those affected by the bill and for organisations such as CASA, who would have to implement certain functions. This makes it difficult to implement and an unnecessary burden on industry.


The Qantas grounding last year was nothing more than the culmination of protracted industrial action by trade unions against Australia's national airline. Make no mistake: this dispute was all about—




Senator Sterle:
  Oh, rubbish!




Senator EDWARDS:
  guerrilla tactics by trade union leaders—



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  and now we hear from those across the chamber—determined to get more pay and better perks for their members, at a time when Qantas was trying to survive in a difficult business environment. Before the grounding in October, industrial action by the union bosses caused disruptions and delays to Qantas's flight schedules, which cost the airline an estimated $68 million. Senator Sterle: one of the union officials was reported in the press at the time as saying, 'We will bake them slowly'—unprecedented. The Transport Workers Union was determined to oppose any move by Qantas to launch a new airline in Asia. Its national secretary, Tony Sheldon, said he was not going to allow Qantas to become 'Asianised'; those were his words. What Qantas management was forced to do was ground the airline so it could regain control.



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  I am not xenophobic, Senator Sterle. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said back in February that, in the months leading up to the grounding, flight timetables were being massively disrupted because of the unions' tactics. The dispute had to be brought to a head, otherwise Qantas would have died a slow economic death, suffocated by the union stranglehold. The head of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association—I referred earlier to his now infamous 'bake them slowly' quote—predicted the dispute would last for 'at least 12 months', flagging that the unions were prepared to undertake a 12-month strategy to debilitate the company. More menacingly, he promised to 'sort out' chief executive Alan Joyce and mused, in a reference to that great book, The Art of War:


If you live near a river, take a seat and eventually the dead bodies of your enemies will come floating by.


This Labor government was quite happy for militant union leaders to hold Qantas to ransom and did not intervene until Qantas grounded its entire fleet. But, eight months after the grounding came to an end, what has changed? Qantas is back in the air, the union bosses are no doubt planning their next assault on the airline's management under the pretext of looking after their members, and Labor senators are licking their lips over another opportunity to grill Alan Joyce.


This bill comes on top of the increase in airfares imposed by the Labor government in their budget delivered just this week. Labor are increasing the airport tax by $8 to $55 per passenger as of July. They tried to hide this away in the budget, but their panicked desperation to squeeze as much revenue as possible out of successful Australian businesses and the flying public has been exposed as nothing more than a cynical tax grab of more than $1.3 billion over four years. This bill and Labor's steep hike in airport taxes should of course be put in context: they will both impose a serious additional burden on those Australian companies, who are already trying to work out just how and why they must navigate the increased expenses associated with this Labor government's destructive and ultimately ineffective carbon tax. The coalition cannot support a proposed mechanism of making ideological industrial relations changes by stealth under the guise of aviation safety.

"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2012-05-10,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (10:21):  I will be supporting Senator Xenophon's bill, which addresses the unfair and dangerous conditions being imposed on cabin crews of international and domestic flights, predominantly by Jetstar, an airline controlled by the Qantas Group. The Air Navigation and Civil Aviation Amendment (Aircraft Crew) Bill 2011 is designed to protect the workplace conditions of foreign or overseas flight or cabin crews who are working on Australian owned airlines or their subsidiaries. My understanding is that overseas based crews from a number of countries such as Thailand and Turkey can be used on the domestic legs of international flights by Australian Airlines. In other words, an Australian airline may have a flight from Bali to Perth, then on to Sydney, before returning to Perth and back overseas. During the two international and two domestic legs of these flights the cabin crew can be used as an overseas based crew. 


Most if not all of these overseas based crews are not employed directly by the Australian airline but are in fact employed under foreign contracts either by a third party or by the overseas subsidiary of the Australian airline in which they are used as cabin crew. Because they have been employed under foreign contract arrangements, they are paid well below the amount any Australian owned airline worker would accept and at a level that Australian unions would consider outrageous if offered to their members. Why is it we have continued in Australia in recent years to race to the bottom of the barrel? Why is it that we do not value our safety standards? Why is it that we do not value the fact that people fought for better conditions, better rates of pay and safety? What was it that put our Australian icon, Qantas, ahead of all the others? It was the attention to detail and the attention to safety.


When Australians get onto a Qantas plane—and, for that matter, on Jetstar, a subsidiary of Qantas—they expect a certain level of care, diligence and maintenance. How do we ensure Australians are getting value for money? Why is it Australians choose to fly Qantas? What is it that gives them confidence to fly Qantas and to fly Jetstar? It is because of safety and because we believe they offer a better product. Why we would trash that product is beyond me.


It has been reported that these crews will regularly have to work shifts as long as 20 hours, not just occasionally but regularly. We know—it is a fact—that when people suffer sleep deprivation they do not work safely or economically and you do not get the best out of your staff. Jetstar requires these crews to fly return shifts on lengthy flights without an overnight stay. What happens if there is an emergency on one of these flights? I hope to God I am not one of those flights but I hope it is no other person. I do not wish to see us standing in this chamber for a condolence motion when a plane drops out of the sky and people are killed. What price do we put on human life and what price do we say is too much to pay for safety?


All of us in the Senate fly regularly. I have never enjoyed flying but I do appreciate knowing that the Qantas flight crews and cabin crews are well trained. They are professional and capable of handling a difficult emergency situation, should it arise. However, I would not enjoy flying around Australia with a crew who are continuously battling fatigue and whose judgment, if not seriously impaired, would be considered well below that expected of a crew responsible for hundreds of lives in an emergency situation. 


Think of the last flight you took to get here. I hope you noticed the crew. They are workers who, as a rule, do their jobs extremely well and make a flying experience as comfortable as possible. Did you watch the emergency procedures as demonstrated by the cabin crew? Are you aware that, should an emergency situation occur—we all hope that will never be the case—the cabin crew who serve you and make your flight a comfortable one will all of a sudden be responsible for ensuring you and the other 200-odd people around you on the flight are kept safe and that panic does not ensue. This is not something we would identify with a fatigued and underpaid workforce. How many of us would be happy in an emergency situation to find the hospital workers, emergency services workers or police on whom we rely have been working regular 20-hour shifts for wages we ourselves would refuse? I doubt you would want the care of your family, your friends or yourself left up to the judgment of people suffering fatigue when well rested alternative crews are available.


One-third of Jetstar staff are employed overseas. A company by the name of Tour East Thailand employs the Bangkok cabin crews for Jetstar. Under the contract I believe these crews are required to sign, they must agree to work shifts up to 20 hours long but, as the contract states, 'The planned limit of operational extensions may be extended by the employer'. In other words, 'You'll work the hours we say.' I would like to see them try to get that past the TWU. To force anyone to work those hours would be a disgrace. We do not expect Australian workers to accept such conditions, and to expect foreign workers to accept those conditions on our shores would be nothing less than a form of slavery. 


As an Australian Democratic Labor Party senator, I cannot remain quiet when such an outrageous exploitation of workers, Australian based or foreign based, goes on under our very noses. How can anyone working in this country be expected to live on wages less than the average wage when I was an apprentice? How can anyone working in this country be expected to work under conditions less than those expected by our own factory workers before Federation? And how can we be expected to see the safety standards on Australian airlines reduced to a level never accepted in this country? Anyone who works in this country should enjoy the protection of Australian laws and Australian standards. Australians should always be protected by Australian laws and Australian standards. To use loopholes in the immigration laws, to have foreign based crews working under conditions we would never accept and to put lives at risk in doing so is unforgivable. Senator Xenophon has given us examples of the conditions these foreign based crews are working under. I am personally disgusted that any company that calls itself Australian can employ people under these conditions, although in fairness to the Qantas group they do not expect to be an Australian airline in anything but name shortly. Maybe that it is why they can do this to their cabin crews.


Just recently we have heard about the possible shipping of our heavy maintenance offshore. How can that possibly be in the national interest? How can we possibly expect that we are going to maintain the levels of safety and maintenance that we all expect when we get on a plane? Do we honestly think in this house that once we have lost the ability to maintain the heavy engineering side of airlines in this country that we can flick a switch—when everything goes to hell and it all falls in a heap—and automatically overnight we can rebuild these manufacturing maintenance facilities in this country? It will not happen. We are kidding ourselves if we think it will. We heard earlier about the high Australian dollar. It has been 110 years since Federation and our currency has had its ups and downs. This is not a new phenomenon. Over 110 years we have had booms and busts—we have had mining booms and busts—but nobody seems to be looking at that. It has continually been used as a crutch, an excuse. 


We also hear attacks on the union movement. Why is it that in 2012 we continue with an adversarial relationship between bosses and unions, between companies and unions. The good unionists need to hold the bad unionists to account, and the good employers need to hold the bad employers to account. They are only a minority on both sides, but it is continually brought up to go on a union-bashing exercise. It is always one side's fault. There is never acceptance of the fact that this is a joint problem. We all own part of this problem and yet we do not address it.


How can we be expected to see the safety standards on Australian airlines reduced to a level that has never been accepted in this country? Even if I cannot get through to senators that the basic principles of decency, justice and fairness demand we stop this blatant exploitation of workers in pursuit of higher profits, I hope I can get through to senators on the basis of expected standards of safety for the Australian public. If this continues, it is inevitable that a situation will arise in which a crew cannot perform its duties in an emergency. Then we will all be up in arms. How was this allowed? Who is to blame for this? Why wasn't something done about it? It was allowed because we have allowed it. We are to blame for the situation so far and it is up to us to do something about it. Senator Xenophon has given us one of the tools necessary to stop this appalling and increasingly dangerous situation. If we do not take up the opportunity we are provided with in this bill, then we will all be culpable when, God forbid, a disaster does occur.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-05-10,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:33):  I thank my colleagues for their contributions, some more than others, to this debate on the Air Navigation and Civil Aviation Amendment (Aircraft Crew) Bill 2011. I want to address some of the contributions because they cannot be allowed to go unanswered. Firstly, Senator Gallacher says that this is not the way to go, but I note the senator's long interest and passionate advocacy in the transport industry. We have no dispute about that, but what I take issue with is the government's approach that says this is not the way to go. It raises a whole range of other issues and it pre-empts CASA on team management as well. When did CASA first raise the issue of team management? There was a discussion paper released on 25 August 2004. I reckon it is coming up to eight years; I think that is more than enough time. The fact is that the parliament has an obligation to act where there is a loophole. The parliament has an obligation to fix a problem that needs to be fixed. This is a problem that needs to be fixed.


It is fair to say that the government has fundamentally misunderstood the intent and the scope of this bill, as has Senator Edwards. The amendments were moved as a result of the committee process—and the committee process was a valuable one—to say that this was simply too broad. That is why I have introduced those amendments: to narrow the scope of the bill, to sort out the loophole that it is intended to fix. That loophole is: if you are on an Australian registered aircraft, a VH designated aircraft, on a domestic route that carries domestic passengers, then that cabin crew should be subject to the Fair Work Act; they should be subject to Australian terms and conditions. Anything less than that would be exploitation of those crews that are based overseas; anything less than that is actually taking away Australian jobs in circumstances where there appears to be an abuse of the special visas that are issued, because they would not be able to get a 457 visa in those circumstances. The amendments are the key to this and the amendments arose as a result of a committee process. That is something that this place does best: in a Senate committee we can rigorously assess legislation and subject it to scrutiny. I readily acknowledge that the legislation needed to be amended to narrow its scope and to remedy the mischief, if you like, of what is occurring right now. 


Enough is enough. CASA has been talking about this for years. CASA does have a lot of work to do. I am not being critical of CASA, but I think it is unfair for CASA to throw its hands up and say that this is unnecessary in its amended form. I am not sure that that is what it is saying, but in any event the parliament has a role to sort this out. 


Senator Joyce says that this bill will compromise the capacity of an airline to deal in the market it operates in and that it burdens airlines with more regulations and conditions. The key to this is the market in which these airlines operate. If it is a domestic flight—if it is carrying domestic passengers—it ought to be paying Australian wages and conditions or be subject to those rules, including fatigue management rules. The fact is if you have a flight with Etihad or United Airlines between Sydney and Melbourne, they cannot carry domestic passengers. They cannot, because rules of cabotage apply. They cannot do that, but Australian registered carriers can. That is a loophole that allows cabin crew to be paid much less than their Australian counterparts. What is worse, they are not subject to the same rules for fatigue management, and that is a real concern. As Senator Madigan pointed out so well, there is a real issue here with fundamental matters of safety. Senator Gallacher made the point that, if there is an emergency, you have to get people off an aircraft within 90 seconds. When you have cabin crew that have come forward to say, 'We are not safe to operate on an aircraft because we are so fatigued, because we are simply so exhausted, because we are simply so sleep deprived,' how on earth is that reasonable?


I thank Senator Edwards for his contribution, but he says that this is about an Australian company opening up its markets overseas. I think that criticism would be valid if we were talking about the bill in its original form, but the amendments sort that out once and for all. They unambiguously set out that the intent of this bill is to deal with domestic legs of flights where you are carrying domestic passengers and the way that they can be tagged as international flights. It is being abused, it is a loophole, people are being exploited and, what is more, it is taking away Australian jobs.


Senator Edwards mentioned that Qantas is a strong, iconic brand. I have no issue with Senator Edwards saying that. But why is it that so many of this company's 30,000 employees are fundamentally unhappy with the direction of the airline? Why is it that so many of the terrific men and women that work in Qantas on the ground and in the air, do the maintenance, fly the planes and crew the cabins are so fundamentally in despair over the direction that this airline is taking? Why is it that when something like 150 catering jobs were lost in Adelaide, those employees found out about it through the media? I think that shows disdain for the workforce, which must be noted.


These are matters that must be dealt with. Senator Edwards referred to the issue of the Qantas grounding; I will refer to that in speaking on the next bill. I think Senator Ludlam will also be making a contribution on the next bill. I thank the Australian Greens for their support of this bill and I thank Senator Madigan from the Democratic Labor Party for his support.


I wanted to reflect on the mischief here and on what the safety issues are. Government agencies in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom have recently responded with increasing vigour to what has been described as a 'call to arms' to address the largesse of concerns that indicate that they collectively may have been complacent rather than chronically uneasy about underlying threats to and weaknesses in the modern aviation industry. This loophole is one of these weaknesses. Yet here in Australia the government response to the June 2011 report of the Senate Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into pilot training and airline safety was one of almost disdain for the issues unearthed, and we barely scraped the surface of those issues in that inquiry.


When you consider that those who have been at the forefront of raising these concerns are cabin crew and flight crew, I think that more than anyone they have a vested interest in the safety of their passengers. I want to back the concerns of pilots and cabin crew when it comes to issues of genuine safety concerns. For that matter, how well did Qantas, as a significant shareholder in Tour East Thailand, communicate its corporate ethos in regard to staff relationships, safety and fatigue management and just culture—that is, the culture of being able to complain about safety issues without fear of recrimination—to its crew? I can tell you, they did not. Those crew based in Thailand are by and large terrified of repercussions if they speak out on safety issues. They are terrified of taking sick leave even if they are unwell or injured. They are terrified of speaking out about fatigue issues. Qantas says, 'It is not our company,' but they have a 37 per cent shareholding in it.


I also want to reflect on what will happen if we do not act on this. If we do not act on this we will continue to unnecessarily put the lives of passengers at risk with fatigued crew. We will continue to have a situation where there are two classes of crew on a Jetstar aircraft—or indeed any other aircraft of an Australian airline—that is flying domestic routes tagged as an international flight. If an Australian Labor Party government can sort out the issue of our coastal trade, our shipping, to ensure that there are fair wages and conditions paid on a domestic shipping route where you are carrying domestic cargo, why on earth can't this be fixed? This should really be a straightforward matter.


While fatigue in pilots is the most obvious risk to flight safety, there are other personnel who may be required to make decisions or act in some way to preserve, or certainly not endanger, the lives and wellbeing of the travelling public and those who may, for however brief a moment, be under the flight path of an aircraft. It seems that the government and its aviation portfolio agencies think that these things are not important. Perhaps the opposition still thinks that the bill is an unnecessary interference in the conduct of business. Fortunately, the Fair Work Ombudsman does not share that view and has chosen to prosecute Jetstar over its entirely messy exploitation of cadet pilots under sham arrangements via New Zealand contracts of employment. Of course, the Fair Work Ombudsman has yet to report on its other active investigation into foreign cabin crew employment practices, but let us wait and see what that inquiry reveals.


Finally, I want to thank a person that I have relied on for good advice in relation to this, someone who I believe has great integrity—that is, Captain Dick MacKerras, who used to be chief checking captain for Cobham Airlines. He has also been giving advice to AIPA, the Australian and International Pilots Association. He is Adelaide based. As a former CASA employee dealing with these issues, he knows his regulations. I am very grateful for his technical expertise and wise advice in relation to these matters. Captain MacKerras is, like so many others in the airline industry, passionate about safety, passionate about getting it right. And right now we are making a mess of things when it comes to cabin crew, fatigue issues and so-called tagged flights being completely exploited in the context of saving a few bucks. That saving of a few bucks potentially compromises safety, but fundamentally it is wrong in the way that it exploits those workers who are based overseas and who work under lesser conditions on what are essentially domestic flights. That needs to stop. That is what this bill is about. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-05-10,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:31):  In Australia we are lucky enough to take aviation safety for granted. We have an impeccable safety record that is the envy of the world, but that is something that we must never be complacent about. It is fair to say that in the last few years the aviation sector has been under increasing pressure. There is a concern by those who care about safety the most—pilots and cabin crew—that there are matters that need to be addressed. That is why the Senate Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee undertook a comprehensive inquiry last year into aviation safety issues and made a number of key recommendations which, unfortunately, the government has not accepted, particularly in relation to ensuring that pilots who are in control of a large passenger capacity jet aircraft have at least 1,500 hours experience before they are in the cockpit. There is real concern that it is something that needs to be maintained.


The 2011 rural affairs and transport committee's inquiry into pilot training and aviation safety issues, unfortunately, raised more questions than it answered. Since then, the more answers I have tried to find, the more questions I have been forced to ask. Aviation Australia is a far cry from the organised, diligent system it appears. During that first inquiry, a pilot said to me privately, 'Better a Senate inquiry now than a royal commission later.' It is a thought that bears deep contemplation. We have reached the stage where if we do not act, if we do not do all that must be done, that appreciably materially compromises aviation safety in this country. That is the motivation behind this bill, the Air Navigation and Civil Aviation Amendment (Aircraft Crew) Bill 2011, and the Qantas Sale Amendment (Still Call Australia Home) Bill 2011 that will be debated shortly.


Last year I was contacted by Jetstar cabin crew over their concerns about how Thai based Jetstar crew were being treated. These crew were based in Thailand but regularly worked on flights travelling between Australian domestic airports and carrying domestic passengers. Even though they were flying domestic routes on Australian planes, often working side-by-side with Australian crew, they were employed under Thai contracts. That meant their pay was a fraction of what their Australian colleagues were earning and their contracts were not subject to Australian workplace conditions. Shifts of up to 20 hours straight with no limits on duty extensions meant that these flight attendants were so exhausted they doubted whether they could react appropriately in an emergency.


On average Thai based flight attendants get paid a base salary of $258 a month. For each hour they fly they get an additional $7 plus allowances. In fairness to the CEO of Jetstar, Mr Bruce Buchanan, with whom I have had some constructive discussions about this, he says that the base pay is not a fair comparison because they do get those extra allowances. But their pay would still be about one-third of that of an Australian based crew for the same sort of work. They do not have sick leave entitlements and they have about half the annual leave of their Australian counterparts. When they do take leave, they are only paid $9 a day on top of their base wage.


These flight attendants approached me via Australian based crew who were concerned about their conditions. They are terrified of the consequences and terrified of repercussions if they speak out. They are employed by a company called Tour East Thailand which has contracted workers to Jetstar. The approach of the Qantas group in relation to this is to say, 'It's a separate entity; we didn't know what was going on.' Well, Tour East Thailand is 37 per cent owned by Qantas. Qantas is a substantial shareholder in that company. 


As it turned out, the cabin crew were right to be frightened. In April last year five Thai based crew pulled out of a domestic flight between Sydney and Melbourne because they were exhausted after a series of international and domestic flights, including back of clock operations where they were literally up all night as part of their duties. Typically it could be Sydney-Denpasar-Sydney, which is an 18- to 19-hour shift from the time they are picked up from their hotel to the time they are dropped off. Instead of being supported in their decision not to risk passenger safety, they were threatened with dismissal by Tour East Thailand. They were admonished; they were threatened with repercussions if they ever did that again. The letter they received from Tour East Thailand stated that 'poor time management' was not accepted and that the company required an undertaking that they would not 'repeat these behaviours in the workplace'. That is simply outrageous. It is unacceptable because, when it comes to issues of fatigue and aircraft safety, it is important that cabin crew are there primarily—as they remind us, as they should—for our safety in the event of an emergency. If crew are simply so fatigued that they would not be able to function in the event of an emergency, that is a serious concern. What concerns me is that CASA, our regulator, which does have a significant and onerous task in dealing with aircraft safety in this country, is still working on issues of fatigue management and is proceeding slowly. The sooner there are regulations and rules in place specifically in relation to fatigue management for cabin attendants the better off we will all be.


This bill's purpose is to create a level playing field for those crew members and to stop airlines exploiting foreign labour to cut costs. In response to concerns raised during the committee stage of the bill, I have circulated amendments that will alter the bill to amend the Fair Work Act to ensure that overseas based cabin crew working on domestic legs of international flights come under the jurisdiction of this act. The second amendment introduces a requirement for all holders of Australian aircraft operators certificates to have a fatigue risk manage­ment system in place. That is long overdue. These are sensible and fair measures to ensure both passenger and crew safety.


It is worth reflecting on a story on the ABC1 Latelineprogram on 30 September last year, which revealed that a Jetstar worker had quit over conditions and safety concerns. A former flight attendant told Latelinethat he quit his job at Jetstar because of safety concerns over long shifts for cabin crew and about staff not being able to answer safety questions. This piece of investigative reporting revealed that a clause in the contract of Singapore based Jetstar crew states that they can be forced to work shifts that are longer than 20 hours—something an Australian based crew cannot do, nowhere near that. Two weeks before quitting, former Jetstar flight attendant Dallas Finn filed an incident report about fatigue after flying five return international flights in five days. He said:


The majority of these flights were quite busy. I found that my sleeping patterns were drastically affected to the point of fatigue. Clearly there are safety issues here pertaining to cabin crew if an emergency situation arises on the return flight from Saigon or Manila where the duty is 12 to 13 hours return.


Mr Finn told Lateline that cabin crew were forced to work long hours. He said:


The majority of the flights out of here from Darwin are all back of the clock, so you're leaving early evening and you're not getting back till quite early the next morning.


He then described how the Ho Chi Minh flight could be 12 to 13 hours. But Mr Finn said it was a flight that he shared with Singapore based staff that gave him more cause for concern. He said:


Before we actually get on a flight we have to go through a briefing; one is ... the questions are on emergency procedure, on occupational health and safety procedure, and a medical question.


I went to answer the emergency and the medical question when the cabin manager stopped me to get the Singapore crew to actually answer the questions, and basically they couldn't answer the emergency procedure and they couldn't actually answer the medical question.


It was the first time I've ever been scared of actually flying because if something went down I didn't know if that crew would be able to back me up.


Jetstar says that they comply and that there are no issues for concern. But, when pilots from Jetstar have told me—and I am very grateful to those pilots for contacting me on a regular basis to tell me about their concerns—that there are cabin crew they have concerns about, where they actually have had to say, 'I don't think you should be flying,' that is a real concern in terms of the way Australian aviation operates.


Jetstar is now under investigation by Fair Work Australia due to these practices. In response, Jetstar has said that it will cap the number of domestic routes that overseas crew can fly. So in a sense it is fair to say that Jetstar has been caught out and that it has now changed some of its practices, which is welcome. I do welcome the dialogue I have from time to time with Mr Buchanan, the CEO of Jetstar. I will be able to expand on that in the other bill. Their concern is that aviation is a very tough international environment and that, in order to survive, they need to take these sorts of operational decisions in order for Jetstar to be competitive. But I beg to differ in relation to that, given that the cost of cabin crew as a proportion of an airline's total operating expenses is a very small fraction of what it costs to run an airline. If the cost of paying people one-third of the Australian wages on a domestic flight is upped to Aussie conditions, I cannot see how that would add a punitive onus on that airline.


The current laws and regulations are not tight enough to make sure that a company cannot wriggle out of its obligations. That is my concern. Currently, flights are tagged with identifying numbers that show whether they are international or domestic, but the numbers are assigned by the airlines themselves and they do not appear to have any strict regulations or criteria to determine what constitutes a domestic versus an international flight. When I asked a question in the Senate about this, I think the minister was genuinely trying to be helpful but it did not really answer the question in that it was left to the discretion of the airlines. For instance, a flight that originates in Adelaide and is tagged with an international number can fly to Melbourne and then to Sydney and then on to Brisbane before it leaves on its international leg, and that is not prevented under the current rules. All of that is fine, but problems arise when the airline carries domestic passengers on those legs. If all the passengers that get on the plane at each domestic airport are going to stay on the flight until it reaches its international destination, it can properly be considered an international flight. I have no issue with that. But, if a passenger gets on in Melbourne and flies the domestic leg to Sydney, is it still a truly international flight? Is it appropriate for some of those cabin crew to be paid one-third of what their Australian counterparts are getting?


Overseas based cabin crew who operate on flights with domestic tags are required to hold 457 visas. These visas come with various rules in relation to pay and workplace conditions. Importantly, these visas can only be granted where an employer can demonstrate that there is a genuine need that cannot be filled with Australian workers. However, overseas based cabin crew working on Australian flights with international tags are paid under a special visa designed to facilitate their entry into the country since, reasonably enough, they are not expected to stay for long periods. This visa does not carry any of the conditions of a 457 visa, and the decision of which visa to grant relies almost solely on what tag number the flights have. The tag number, as I mentioned earlier, is chosen by the airlines themselves and is apparently not subject to any regulations. It should be, and that is what this bill is trying to deal with. An airline can use this loophole to save a few dollars in wages without any difficult workplace relations conditions to get in the way.


I acknowledge the work and the contribution of my colleagues Senator Gallacher and Senator Sterle to the Senate inquiries into this matter. They both have long and esteemed careers in the transport industry and know a thing or two about it. My plea to Senators Sterle and Gallacher is that this loophole needs to be addressed. It is a loophole that has been fixed up in shipping, which I will refer to shortly, but not in relation to this. In fact, the savings that can be made through this loophole are apparently so great that, according to Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce—who I do not think is any relation to Senator Joyce—




Senator Joyce:
  He might be. You never know.




Senator XENOPHON:
  He might be. Senator Joyce has a cheeky grin on his face; I do not think they are related. They might be, but very distantly. According to Alan Joyce, the Qantas Group would have to quite simply pull out of its Darwin and Cairns operations. That is scaremongering of the highest order. It is misleading, and the Qantas Group, to my understanding—and Senators Sterle or Gallacher can correct me on this—has not given us details of how much the cabin crew make as a proportion of their costs. I think Senator Sterle is saying that is the case; it has not provided that information, as it indicated that it would during the Senate inquiry.


This threat, made in the Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee's 6 February 2012 hearing into the bill raises the question: is the Qantas Group so dependent on underpaid workers that it will fold a number of its routes if it has to pay people a fair wage? It has been estimated that cabin crew costs make up less than 10 percent of aircraft operating costs, according to an article from the Economic Times in January 2010, and, as I said we are still waiting for that information.


I have asked questions of the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in the Senate to see if the circumstances surrounding visas could be clarified. They could not. There appear to be stricter rules applying to international airlines with international crew, but little that applies to international crew on Australian airlines. I strongly urge that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship investigate these circumstances because it is not right, and it is not fair that overseas workers be exploited to make an Australian airline a quick buck.


During the committee inquiry process I faced accusations that I had something against Qantas and did not want it to succeed. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I was on a Qantas flight this morning. Like most Australians, I feel an incredible sense of pride in the flying kangaroo. There is nothing better than sitting in a foreign airport and catching sight of that red tail as the plane thunders past. There are few companies that inspire such fierce loyalty among its employees and its passengers. The very reason I fought so hard for these changes is I share that same loyalty. I do not want a truly Australian Qantas to be a thing of the past, and I do not want Australia's safety reputation to be in any way compromised as a result of cost-cutting measures.


The true intention of this bill is not just to protect overseas workers from being exploited. It is also to make sure there are regulations in place to stop staff being pushed to their limits and into a physical and mental state that is just not safe; not to them and not to the passengers they are there to protect in the event of an emergency. In an emergency, cabin crew must react instinctively to direct passengers and operate safety equipment—they must not be physically and mentally exhausted from excessively long hours. There are also the post-flight conditions to think of. For years, cabin crew members have been complaining to Jetstar about excessively long duties that have left them too tired to travel home safely. I have heard a number of stories of people having accidents on their way from a long shift because they were simply too fatigued.


I also note the similarities between the circumstances I have outlined and changes that the government has made in a similar area. 'Flags of convenience' are almost universally popular in the shipping industry. Essentially, your ship abides by the rules of whichever country it is registered in—hence the popularity of Panama and similar countries, where the laws relating to everything from safety and maintenance to workplace conditions are far more lax and, in some cases, virtually non-existent.


In 1992, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure published a report titled Inquiry into ship safety: ships of shame, which detailed stories of crews paid a pittance or not at all, of unseaworthy vessels, of uncertified crew and poor safety equipment, of falsified documents and of brutal treatment. The committee found that commercial pressures were the major factor behind these problems. A further report in 1995 revisited the issue because the exposure of the first report had 'not ended the exploitation, denial and physical abuse of seafarers'.


Finally, some changes came into effect in January 2010, with the regulations for the Fair Work Act specifically stating that vessels with continuous voyage permits and those with three or more single voyage permits issued in a 12-month period are covered by the Fair Work Act. If the government has deemed it reasonable to take this step there is no reason it cannot deem it reasonable to take similar steps for the aviation industry. Effectively, if a foreign registered ship is travelling from Sydney to Melbourne and is carrying domestic cargo it must pay Australian rates and conditions. What difference is there when we are talking about an Australian aircraft flying a domestic route and carrying domestic passengers, but not paying its workers on that flight Australian rates and conditions? It is as simple as that. If we can deal with 'ships of shame' we should be able to deal with 'planes of pain'.


The government must take action on this. It is not fair. It is not acceptable. It is, quite simply, unjust. It is exploiting overseas workers and it is also taking away Australian jobs in circumstances where they should not be taken away. This is only one small aspect of the problems facing Australia's aviation industry, but it is an important one not just in terms of safety but also in terms of people's rights.


I said earlier that my involvement in these issues has raised more questions than answers. This is one of the very few answers; this bill and the amendments circulated do not place an undue burden on airlines. This is about fixing an anomaly—a loophole—that needs to be sorted out here and now. This is an opportunity for this chamber to deal with it. This is an opportunity to remedy a clear loophole that must be sorted out once and for all.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2012-05-10,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (09:51):  I think Senator Xenophon has raised some very valid concerns on behalf of some very concerned people. Unfortunately, we just do not believe that the bill is the way to go in respect of resolving those issues. Essentially this bill seeks to impose new conditions on international airline licences and air operator certificate holders with the intention of ensuring that all flight and cabin crew employed by related airline companies are offered the same terms and conditions as Australian based crew employed directly by that airline.


The scope of the bill is very broad. It applies to a wide range of business relationships, and the cost implications of the bill would threaten the viability on a range of routes. I will highlight some of those routes later on. Senator Xenophon's proposed amendments rewrite the bill but continue to raise issues for the commercial operations of our airlines and pre-empt CASA's work in relation to fatigue management as well as departmental consideration of matters raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport in its report on the bill. The government does not support the bill.


The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport has examined the bill, proposed amendments to it and has recommended against passing it. The bill is in breach of our international obligations. The bill would significantly restrict Australian airlines in their capacity to operate internationally and to form very important strategic partnerships with other carriers. Wages and conditions of employees of Australian airlines are matters for the Fair Work Act 2009, consistent with the approach the government has taken in other industries. Safety issues such as fatigue management are being addressed by the safety regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, following advice received from the International Civil Aviation Organisation on relevant standards and further recommended practices.


Essentially, as I have said, this bill would severely restrict the ability of Australian based airlines to compete in the international aviation market. The committee did take evidence from Virgin and Qantas in respect of specific areas of that restriction. A requirement to offer Australian wages and conditions to crew employed by codeshare partners in other countries would effectively limit Australian carriers to a very small number of routes on which they provide direct services. As a result, the choices for the Australian travelling public would be very much restricted. For example, the bill would effectively prevent Australian airlines offering codeshare services to destinations such as Nashville, Dusseldorf, Dunedin, Miami and probably quite a number of others. This would reduce the choices for the Australian travelling public.


There are also serious concerns in respect of international law, as the bill imposes Australian workplace laws on foreign airlines operating in foreign countries. The government notes that the proposed amendments have been circulated in an attempt to address some of these issues, but the bill would still have an impact on Australian airlines' ability to compete with international rivals and undermine the work already being done to manage fatigue among cabin crew. The government supports the committee recommendation not to pass the bill.


The government has paid careful consideration to the issues raised in the Senate committee inquiry into the bill in relation to fair pay for the crew of safe airlines. The government recognises that concerns have been raised about the wages and conditions that are offered to foreign based airline crew flying in Australia. These issues are related to concerns about fairness and the way airlines manage fatigue among cabin crew. But the bill makes it virtually impossible for our airlines to compete in the international aviation market. The government will be accepting the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport's recommendation that the bill not be passed.


While the proposed amendments completely change the bill, the revised bill is unnecessary in light of the ongoing work that government is progressing to address these issues. The government is currently undertaking an independent review of the Fair Work Act. The independent panel is due to provide a report to the government on 31 May. The government will consider the review panel's report and determine whether amendments to the Fair Work Act are required.


The scope of this bill is very wide. It applies to a wide range of commercial arrangements. Virgin Australia and Qantas would need to ensure that the crew employed by their codeshare partners are offered wages and conditions comparable to their own crew. This would have a significant adverse effect on the commercial competitiveness of Australia's international airlines in an increasingly difficult operating environment. This also raises serious concerns in relation to international law, our bilateral air service agreements and our mutual recognition of aviation regulatory arrangements with New Zealand, due to the extraterritorial implica­tion or application of workplace conditions.


The bill also attempts to deal with concerns in relation to the management of fatigue amongst cabin crew. Safety issues such as fatigue management are being appro­priately addressed by the safety regulator, CASA, and following advice from the International Civil Aviation Organisation on the relevant standards and recommended practices. CASA released a draft proposal on flight crew fatigue for public comment on 1 May, and a draft proposal for cabin crew fatigue is scheduled for later this year. Legislation is therefore unnecessary in light of CASA's ongoing work to provide better systems for fatigue management.


Senator Xenophon's amendments completely rewrite the bill. However, the amendments do not address the concerns with the original bill. The proposal to require AOC holders to develop a system of fatigue management is unnecessary in light of the ongoing work by ICAO and CASA. The revised bill also amends the Fair Work Act 2009 to extend the Australian workplace relations framework to all aircraft crew performing work in Australian domestic aviation.


The Fair Work Act principally regulates employment relationships. In contrast, the revised bill would impose workplace relations obligations and circumstances where there is no employment relationship. Because of this and a number of technical issues with the bill, the government does not support the revised bill. However, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations is currently considering whether the Fair Work Act covers foreign airline crew working on Australian domestic flights and whether any legislative change is required.


In short, the bill would significantly restrict Australian airlines in their capacity to operate internationally and to form strategic partnerships with other carriers, and it would certainly reduce the choices available to the Australian travelling public. Wages and conditions of employees, in Australia, of Australian airlines are matters for the Fair Work Act 2009, consistent with the approach taken across industries. Safety is the business of CASA. The amended bill is unnecessary in light of CASA's ongoing work to provide better systems for fatigue management.


I would like to say a number of other things. It is very clear that there are some widely held and deeply felt concerns amongst flight crew in the operations in Australia. They have been raised very visibly, very publicly and very appropriately by Senator Xenophon. The fact that he has been able to elevate these concerns and this dispute to this place is a significant achievement for those people. A number of them gave evidence about their fear of possible retribution, lack of promotion, lack of job opportunities and the loss of their entire career. Those people were fair dinkum and their evidence was fair dinkum. The fact that the matter has been elevated to debate in this place is a good thing, and credit is in no small part due to Senator Xenophon.


The push for cheaper and cheaper fares puts pressure on all of the airline industry operations, and on no-one more than on pilots and aircrew. The questionable practices in relation to the Thai based labour hire company are just an example of the result of the never-ceasing drive to give Australians cheaper airfares. But amongst all that you have got to remember that the reason we have flight attendants on a plane is that, when things happen, you have got to get off in 90 seconds. They are the people that have trained and trained to deal with the unlikely event of a plane coming down in a hurry. When the lights are off, there is an emergency and the slides are operating, you have got to follow the instructions of your flight crew. To push them beyond the limits of normal fatigue management is an absolute dereliction of managerial responsibility. To combine that with a miserable attempt at a salary on what is clearly a domestic Australian flight is a disgrace. Jetstar may tag their flights from Darwin to Sydney as international flights, but the reality is that the customer gets off, goes through customs and wanders away, and other people get back on, not through customs, just boarding a normal domestic service, and the flight crew who have operated the international sector then continue on the domestic sector. For those people not to be paid the same as Australian workers under the Fair Work Act is a disgrace.


If you want to take the push a bit further and, in search of cheaper fares, lower the very high pilot standards that Australia has enjoyed then there is probably a risk to that. The risk is that a person without the appropriate number of flying hours that we have required over the years may make a mistake. If you want to combine that lack of experience with fatigue and low wages then there are possibly grave concerns arising. I commend Senator Xenophon for raising that.


What I am saying, though, is that CASA and the Fair Work Act and the appropriate organisations that can represent people should have these matters resolved to the satisfaction of those people that have raised the issues with their company in the first instance. The evidence that was given to the hearing with CASA had no resolution. At least one of the witnesses made a statement that they thought that CASA would solve the problems, and, after repeated efforts, they had no resolution. That is up to CASA to respond to, but that was certainly given in evidence to the hearings. So I actually share Senator Xenophon's concerns in respect of some of these matters that have been raised. I just do not believe that this amended bill is the way forward.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-05-10,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:05):  I will not leave you in suspense, Mr Acting Deputy President. We will not be supporting the Air Navigation and Civil Aviation Amendment (Aircraft Crew) Bill 2011, for a range of reasons. Senator Gallacher went through them. We have to allow a company the capacity to deal in the markets that it operates in. If we were to pursue overseas an equivalence with the terms and conditions in Australia, the ultimate result would be that overseas flights would be stopped because we would be uncompetitive. The margins that airlines are on—you can see it around the world—are extremely tight, and we note quite a number of airlines going broke. It is a regular occurrence. So lumbering them up with more regulation and conditions which just will not cut the mustard and will not compete in overseas markets would in many instances be a short-term solution before that route was actually withdrawn.


I heard the sympathies that were well articulated by Senator Gallacher. My query is: if you hold those views so dearly, why don't you support the bill? What is your position? Is that the position of your party or is it the position that you hold?


There are a range of issues that are coming to light, and we can see them in regard to the lockout. A company has to be able to deal with its disputes as they arise. We want this organisation, Qantas, to remain a viable organisation in Australia. We should recognise how tight the margins are, especially with the Australian dollar where it is at the moment and the pressures that are on at the moment and also noting, really, the fact that its profit, for the capital that it has got employed, is very low. But it still exists, and we are seeing other airlines in other places currently shutting down.


I have briefly perused the Senate report. I note the emphatic and well-meaning endorsement by Senator Xenophon. If Alan Joyce were not my brother, I would probably consider—no, I am no relation!




Senator Sterle:
  I knew it!




Senator JOYCE:
  No, I am no relation to Alan.




Senator Birmingham:
  And that's a great relief to Alan!




Senator JOYCE:
  Yes, I know. I am taller, so I must be older! But, on a more serious note, issues of safety are something that the coalition are very aware of. If we genuinely believed that we were compromising the safety of people flying on an airline for which we had jurisdiction in some way then we would definitely be doing something about it. We believe that that is more in the realms of CASA and we will continue to rely on CASA to make sure that the safety of those who fly on these aircraft is maintained. There really is not much more to say that has not already been articulated in the coalition's dissenting report. As such, I will not hold the chamber up any longer. I just note that we will not be supporting the bill.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-05-10,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (10:09):  I rise to speak on the Air Navigation and Civil Aviation Amendment (Aircraft Crew) Bill 2011. This bill seeks to reverse the long-term successful trend of Australian governments in progressively opening up the Australian economy to international competition. I oppose this bill as it will unduly hamper what are successful Australian businesses. This bill will undermine the aviation industry, an industry which is amongst the most competitive, open and transparent in the world.


This bill amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 and the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to provide that an Australian airline, or a subsidiary of an Australian airline, is not issued an international aviation licence unless it provides the same wages and conditions to overseas based flight and cabin crew operating its flights as if they were directly employed by the airline. In essence, this bill undermines what should be the reciprocal opportunity for Australian airlines to compete with foreign businesses in their own markets.


Why on earth are those supporting this bill trying to impede Australian businesses from competing in foreign markets on the same terms as any other Australian business? As the coalition have always maintained, the management of private—and indeed public—companies and the decisions determined during the course of running their businesses should be the exclusive remit of those companies. This bill illegitimately impinges on the ability of a company—including our iconic and much-loved flying kangaroo—to make decisions in order to facilitate the effective management and running of its businesses. Individuals and Australian businesses should not be subjected to any legislation that removes their paramount and indisputable right to run themselves and to compete internationally as they see fit.


As a means by which to fully understand the opportunity that lies before Australia, it is imperative that we reflect on Qantas's value to the Australian economy both past and present. The history of Qantas is an extraordinary Australian success story. Established in the Queensland outback in 1920, Qantas has become Australia's largest domestic and international airline. It is held in high regard all over the world and considered one of the very best and safest long-distance carriers. The flying kangaroo is one of the strongest and most recognisable brands, which represents so much more than just a company; it represents the optimism and the success of Australian enterprise. Qantas has a strong reputation for safety, operational reliability, engineering and maintenance, and customer service.


Of the almost $15 billion of income earned by Qantas in the financial year 2010-11, the overwhelming portion was generated within the Australian economy under our laws and industrial relations rules. Qantas employs approximately 35,700 people, with 93 per cent of them based within Australia. The company is inextricably linked with the development of civil aviation in Australia and represents the confidence we have in Australian businesses to compete successfully in a globalised economy. From the humble beginnings operating fragile biplanes that carried only one or two passengers in open cockpits, Qantas, the flying kangaroo, now proudly operates the new Airbus A380s, flying some 450 people halfway around the world in a day. One would be hard pressed to find a better advertisement for Australian enterprise and our nation as a whole. Qantas's employees, shareholders and indeed Australia's national interest will all be well served in the long run if it can fully grasp the unprecedented opportunity for growth so often deemed the 'Asian century'.


There are a number of flaws in this bill that would have implications for its enforcement and negatively impact on the profitability of airlines operating in Australia. Firstly, the bill is extraterritorial in its scope. There is uncertainty about whether the bill imposes Australian employment conditions extraterritorially, forcing airlines to offer Australian wages and employment conditions to employees based outside of Australia—in Thailand, Singapore and so on. This may mean that it is inconsistent with Australia's bilateral air services arrangements. This bill has serious implications for airlines operating in Australia and their international competitiveness and profitability in both domestic and international markets. It is not reasonable or fair to expect any business but particularly airlines not to be able to compete in foreign markets on the same terms as other businesses competing in that market.


This bill also misguidedly uses air operators certificates, or AOCs, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Air Navigation Act 1920 to attempt to regulate industrial relations issues. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority was highly critical of the bill in this regard, stating in the CASA submission to the committee inquiry:


… CASA is seriously concerned that the addition of a workplace relations function would oblige CASA to become involved in negotiations between AOC holders and their employees on pay and working conditions … The perception of CASA as an independent safety regulator could be compromised if it were to become involved in vetting the pay and working conditions of AOC holder’s employees.


It simply does not make sense. CASA has long been held in this country as an organisation that is solely dedicated to the safety of Australians and to ensuring that AOC holders operate in the air with safety standards second to none elsewhere in the world. On the issue of fatigue management and safety, the airlines disputed the need for additional regulation. CASA stated that it was 'not aware of any negative safety trends' regarding AOC holders' foreign based crew.


The bill also contains a number of terms and conditions that are vague and would lead to uncertainty for those affected by the bill and for organisations such as CASA, who would have to implement certain functions. This makes it difficult to implement and an unnecessary burden on industry.


The Qantas grounding last year was nothing more than the culmination of protracted industrial action by trade unions against Australia's national airline. Make no mistake: this dispute was all about—




Senator Sterle:
  Oh, rubbish!




Senator EDWARDS:
  guerrilla tactics by trade union leaders—



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  and now we hear from those across the chamber—determined to get more pay and better perks for their members, at a time when Qantas was trying to survive in a difficult business environment. Before the grounding in October, industrial action by the union bosses caused disruptions and delays to Qantas's flight schedules, which cost the airline an estimated $68 million. Senator Sterle: one of the union officials was reported in the press at the time as saying, 'We will bake them slowly'—unprecedented. The Transport Workers Union was determined to oppose any move by Qantas to launch a new airline in Asia. Its national secretary, Tony Sheldon, said he was not going to allow Qantas to become 'Asianised'; those were his words. What Qantas management was forced to do was ground the airline so it could regain control.



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  I am not xenophobic, Senator Sterle. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said back in February that, in the months leading up to the grounding, flight timetables were being massively disrupted because of the unions' tactics. The dispute had to be brought to a head, otherwise Qantas would have died a slow economic death, suffocated by the union stranglehold. The head of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association—I referred earlier to his now infamous 'bake them slowly' quote—predicted the dispute would last for 'at least 12 months', flagging that the unions were prepared to undertake a 12-month strategy to debilitate the company. More menacingly, he promised to 'sort out' chief executive Alan Joyce and mused, in a reference to that great book, The Art of War:


If you live near a river, take a seat and eventually the dead bodies of your enemies will come floating by.


This Labor government was quite happy for militant union leaders to hold Qantas to ransom and did not intervene until Qantas grounded its entire fleet. But, eight months after the grounding came to an end, what has changed? Qantas is back in the air, the union bosses are no doubt planning their next assault on the airline's management under the pretext of looking after their members, and Labor senators are licking their lips over another opportunity to grill Alan Joyce.


This bill comes on top of the increase in airfares imposed by the Labor government in their budget delivered just this week. Labor are increasing the airport tax by $8 to $55 per passenger as of July. They tried to hide this away in the budget, but their panicked desperation to squeeze as much revenue as possible out of successful Australian businesses and the flying public has been exposed as nothing more than a cynical tax grab of more than $1.3 billion over four years. This bill and Labor's steep hike in airport taxes should of course be put in context: they will both impose a serious additional burden on those Australian companies, who are already trying to work out just how and why they must navigate the increased expenses associated with this Labor government's destructive and ultimately ineffective carbon tax. The coalition cannot support a proposed mechanism of making ideological industrial relations changes by stealth under the guise of aviation safety.

"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2012-05-10,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (10:21):  I will be supporting Senator Xenophon's bill, which addresses the unfair and dangerous conditions being imposed on cabin crews of international and domestic flights, predominantly by Jetstar, an airline controlled by the Qantas Group. The Air Navigation and Civil Aviation Amendment (Aircraft Crew) Bill 2011 is designed to protect the workplace conditions of foreign or overseas flight or cabin crews who are working on Australian owned airlines or their subsidiaries. My understanding is that overseas based crews from a number of countries such as Thailand and Turkey can be used on the domestic legs of international flights by Australian Airlines. In other words, an Australian airline may have a flight from Bali to Perth, then on to Sydney, before returning to Perth and back overseas. During the two international and two domestic legs of these flights the cabin crew can be used as an overseas based crew. 


Most if not all of these overseas based crews are not employed directly by the Australian airline but are in fact employed under foreign contracts either by a third party or by the overseas subsidiary of the Australian airline in which they are used as cabin crew. Because they have been employed under foreign contract arrangements, they are paid well below the amount any Australian owned airline worker would accept and at a level that Australian unions would consider outrageous if offered to their members. Why is it we have continued in Australia in recent years to race to the bottom of the barrel? Why is it that we do not value our safety standards? Why is it that we do not value the fact that people fought for better conditions, better rates of pay and safety? What was it that put our Australian icon, Qantas, ahead of all the others? It was the attention to detail and the attention to safety.


When Australians get onto a Qantas plane—and, for that matter, on Jetstar, a subsidiary of Qantas—they expect a certain level of care, diligence and maintenance. How do we ensure Australians are getting value for money? Why is it Australians choose to fly Qantas? What is it that gives them confidence to fly Qantas and to fly Jetstar? It is because of safety and because we believe they offer a better product. Why we would trash that product is beyond me.


It has been reported that these crews will regularly have to work shifts as long as 20 hours, not just occasionally but regularly. We know—it is a fact—that when people suffer sleep deprivation they do not work safely or economically and you do not get the best out of your staff. Jetstar requires these crews to fly return shifts on lengthy flights without an overnight stay. What happens if there is an emergency on one of these flights? I hope to God I am not one of those flights but I hope it is no other person. I do not wish to see us standing in this chamber for a condolence motion when a plane drops out of the sky and people are killed. What price do we put on human life and what price do we say is too much to pay for safety?


All of us in the Senate fly regularly. I have never enjoyed flying but I do appreciate knowing that the Qantas flight crews and cabin crews are well trained. They are professional and capable of handling a difficult emergency situation, should it arise. However, I would not enjoy flying around Australia with a crew who are continuously battling fatigue and whose judgment, if not seriously impaired, would be considered well below that expected of a crew responsible for hundreds of lives in an emergency situation. 


Think of the last flight you took to get here. I hope you noticed the crew. They are workers who, as a rule, do their jobs extremely well and make a flying experience as comfortable as possible. Did you watch the emergency procedures as demonstrated by the cabin crew? Are you aware that, should an emergency situation occur—we all hope that will never be the case—the cabin crew who serve you and make your flight a comfortable one will all of a sudden be responsible for ensuring you and the other 200-odd people around you on the flight are kept safe and that panic does not ensue. This is not something we would identify with a fatigued and underpaid workforce. How many of us would be happy in an emergency situation to find the hospital workers, emergency services workers or police on whom we rely have been working regular 20-hour shifts for wages we ourselves would refuse? I doubt you would want the care of your family, your friends or yourself left up to the judgment of people suffering fatigue when well rested alternative crews are available.


One-third of Jetstar staff are employed overseas. A company by the name of Tour East Thailand employs the Bangkok cabin crews for Jetstar. Under the contract I believe these crews are required to sign, they must agree to work shifts up to 20 hours long but, as the contract states, 'The planned limit of operational extensions may be extended by the employer'. In other words, 'You'll work the hours we say.' I would like to see them try to get that past the TWU. To force anyone to work those hours would be a disgrace. We do not expect Australian workers to accept such conditions, and to expect foreign workers to accept those conditions on our shores would be nothing less than a form of slavery. 


As an Australian Democratic Labor Party senator, I cannot remain quiet when such an outrageous exploitation of workers, Australian based or foreign based, goes on under our very noses. How can anyone working in this country be expected to live on wages less than the average wage when I was an apprentice? How can anyone working in this country be expected to work under conditions less than those expected by our own factory workers before Federation? And how can we be expected to see the safety standards on Australian airlines reduced to a level never accepted in this country? Anyone who works in this country should enjoy the protection of Australian laws and Australian standards. Australians should always be protected by Australian laws and Australian standards. To use loopholes in the immigration laws, to have foreign based crews working under conditions we would never accept and to put lives at risk in doing so is unforgivable. Senator Xenophon has given us examples of the conditions these foreign based crews are working under. I am personally disgusted that any company that calls itself Australian can employ people under these conditions, although in fairness to the Qantas group they do not expect to be an Australian airline in anything but name shortly. Maybe that it is why they can do this to their cabin crews.


Just recently we have heard about the possible shipping of our heavy maintenance offshore. How can that possibly be in the national interest? How can we possibly expect that we are going to maintain the levels of safety and maintenance that we all expect when we get on a plane? Do we honestly think in this house that once we have lost the ability to maintain the heavy engineering side of airlines in this country that we can flick a switch—when everything goes to hell and it all falls in a heap—and automatically overnight we can rebuild these manufacturing maintenance facilities in this country? It will not happen. We are kidding ourselves if we think it will. We heard earlier about the high Australian dollar. It has been 110 years since Federation and our currency has had its ups and downs. This is not a new phenomenon. Over 110 years we have had booms and busts—we have had mining booms and busts—but nobody seems to be looking at that. It has continually been used as a crutch, an excuse. 


We also hear attacks on the union movement. Why is it that in 2012 we continue with an adversarial relationship between bosses and unions, between companies and unions. The good unionists need to hold the bad unionists to account, and the good employers need to hold the bad employers to account. They are only a minority on both sides, but it is continually brought up to go on a union-bashing exercise. It is always one side's fault. There is never acceptance of the fact that this is a joint problem. We all own part of this problem and yet we do not address it.


How can we be expected to see the safety standards on Australian airlines reduced to a level that has never been accepted in this country? Even if I cannot get through to senators that the basic principles of decency, justice and fairness demand we stop this blatant exploitation of workers in pursuit of higher profits, I hope I can get through to senators on the basis of expected standards of safety for the Australian public. If this continues, it is inevitable that a situation will arise in which a crew cannot perform its duties in an emergency. Then we will all be up in arms. How was this allowed? Who is to blame for this? Why wasn't something done about it? It was allowed because we have allowed it. We are to blame for the situation so far and it is up to us to do something about it. Senator Xenophon has given us one of the tools necessary to stop this appalling and increasingly dangerous situation. If we do not take up the opportunity we are provided with in this bill, then we will all be culpable when, God forbid, a disaster does occur.

I want to address some of the contributions because they cannot be allowed to go unanswered. Firstly, Senator Gallacher says that this is not the way to go, but I note the senator's long interest and passionate advocacy in the transport industry. We have no dispute about that, but what I take issue with is the government's approach that says this is not the way to go. It raises a whole range of other issues and it pre-empts CASA on team management as well. When did CASA first raise the issue of team management? There was a discussion paper released on 25 August 2004. I reckon it is coming up to eight years; I think that is more than enough time. The fact is that the parliament has an obligation to act where there is a loophole. The parliament has an obligation to fix a problem that needs to be fixed. This is a problem that needs to be fixed.


It is fair to say that the government has fundamentally misunderstood the intent and the scope of this bill, as has Senator Edwards. The amendments were moved as a result of the committee process—and the committee process was a valuable one—to say that this was simply too broad. That is why I have introduced those amendments: to narrow the scope of the bill, to sort out the loophole that it is intended to fix. That loophole is: if you are on an Australian registered aircraft, a VH designated aircraft, on a domestic route that carries domestic passengers, then that cabin crew should be subject to the Fair Work Act; they should be subject to Australian terms and conditions. Anything less than that would be exploitation of those crews that are based overseas; anything less than that is actually taking away Australian jobs in circumstances where there appears to be an abuse of the special visas that are issued, because they would not be able to get a 457 visa in those circumstances. The amendments are the key to this and the amendments arose as a result of a committee process. That is something that this place does best: in a Senate committee we can rigorously assess legislation and subject it to scrutiny. I readily acknowledge that the legislation needed to be amended to narrow its scope and to remedy the mischief, if you like, of what is occurring right now. 


Enough is enough. CASA has been talking about this for years. CASA does have a lot of work to do. I am not being critical of CASA, but I think it is unfair for CASA to throw its hands up and say that this is unnecessary in its amended form. I am not sure that that is what it is saying, but in any event the parliament has a role to sort this out. 


Senator Joyce says that this bill will compromise the capacity of an airline to deal in the market it operates in and that it burdens airlines with more regulations and conditions. The key to this is the market in which these airlines operate. If it is a domestic flight—if it is carrying domestic passengers—it ought to be paying Australian wages and conditions or be subject to those rules, including fatigue management rules. The fact is if you have a flight with Etihad or United Airlines between Sydney and Melbourne, they cannot carry domestic passengers. They cannot, because rules of cabotage apply. They cannot do that, but Australian registered carriers can. That is a loophole that allows cabin crew to be paid much less than their Australian counterparts. What is worse, they are not subject to the same rules for fatigue management, and that is a real concern. As Senator Madigan pointed out so well, there is a real issue here with fundamental matters of safety. Senator Gallacher made the point that, if there is an emergency, you have to get people off an aircraft within 90 seconds. When you have cabin crew that have come forward to say, 'We are not safe to operate on an aircraft because we are so fatigued, because we are simply so exhausted, because we are simply so sleep deprived,' how on earth is that reasonable?


I thank Senator Edwards for his contribution, but he says that this is about an Australian company opening up its markets overseas. I think that criticism would be valid if we were talking about the bill in its original form, but the amendments sort that out once and for all. They unambiguously set out that the intent of this bill is to deal with domestic legs of flights where you are carrying domestic passengers and the way that they can be tagged as international flights. It is being abused, it is a loophole, people are being exploited and, what is more, it is taking away Australian jobs.


Senator Edwards mentioned that Qantas is a strong, iconic brand. I have no issue with Senator Edwards saying that. But why is it that so many of this company's 30,000 employees are fundamentally unhappy with the direction of the airline? Why is it that so many of the terrific men and women that work in Qantas on the ground and in the air, do the maintenance, fly the planes and crew the cabins are so fundamentally in despair over the direction that this airline is taking? Why is it that when something like 150 catering jobs were lost in Adelaide, those employees found out about it through the media? I think that shows disdain for the workforce, which must be noted.


These are matters that must be dealt with. Senator Edwards referred to the issue of the Qantas grounding; I will refer to that in speaking on the next bill. I think Senator Ludlam will also be making a contribution on the next bill. I thank the Australian Greens for their support of this bill and I thank Senator Madigan from the Democratic Labor Party for his support.


I wanted to reflect on the mischief here and on what the safety issues are. Government agencies in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom have recently responded with increasing vigour to what has been described as a 'call to arms' to address the largesse of concerns that indicate that they collectively may have been complacent rather than chronically uneasy about underlying threats to and weaknesses in the modern aviation industry. This loophole is one of these weaknesses. Yet here in Australia the government response to the June 2011 report of the Senate Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into pilot training and airline safety was one of almost disdain for the issues unearthed, and we barely scraped the surface of those issues in that inquiry.


When you consider that those who have been at the forefront of raising these concerns are cabin crew and flight crew, I think that more than anyone they have a vested interest in the safety of their passengers. I want to back the concerns of pilots and cabin crew when it comes to issues of genuine safety concerns. For that matter, how well did Qantas, as a significant shareholder in Tour East Thailand, communicate its corporate ethos in regard to staff relationships, safety and fatigue management and just culture—that is, the culture of being able to complain about safety issues without fear of recrimination—to its crew? I can tell you, they did not. Those crew based in Thailand are by and large terrified of repercussions if they speak out on safety issues. They are terrified of taking sick leave even if they are unwell or injured. They are terrified of speaking out about fatigue issues. Qantas says, 'It is not our company,' but they have a 37 per cent shareholding in it.


I also want to reflect on what will happen if we do not act on this. If we do not act on this we will continue to unnecessarily put the lives of passengers at risk with fatigued crew. We will continue to have a situation where there are two classes of crew on a Jetstar aircraft—or indeed any other aircraft of an Australian airline—that is flying domestic routes tagged as an international flight. If an Australian Labor Party government can sort out the issue of our coastal trade, our shipping, to ensure that there are fair wages and conditions paid on a domestic shipping route where you are carrying domestic cargo, why on earth can't this be fixed? This should really be a straightforward matter.


While fatigue in pilots is the most obvious risk to flight safety, there are other personnel who may be required to make decisions or act in some way to preserve, or certainly not endanger, the lives and wellbeing of the travelling public and those who may, for however brief a moment, be under the flight path of an aircraft. It seems that the government and its aviation portfolio agencies think that these things are not important. Perhaps the opposition still thinks that the bill is an unnecessary interference in the conduct of business. Fortunately, the Fair Work Ombudsman does not share that view and has chosen to prosecute Jetstar over its entirely messy exploitation of cadet pilots under sham arrangements via New Zealand contracts of employment. Of course, the Fair Work Ombudsman has yet to report on its other active investigation into foreign cabin crew employment practices, but let us wait and see what that inquiry reveals.


Finally, I want to thank a person that I have relied on for good advice in relation to this, someone who I believe has great integrity—that is, Captain Dick MacKerras, who used to be chief checking captain for Cobham Airlines. He has also been giving advice to AIPA, the Australian and International Pilots Association. He is Adelaide based. As a former CASA employee dealing with these issues, he knows his regulations. I am very grateful for his technical expertise and wise advice in relation to these matters. Captain MacKerras is, like so many others in the airline industry, passionate about safety, passionate about getting it right. And right now we are making a mess of things when it comes to cabin crew, fatigue issues and so-called tagged flights being completely exploited in the context of saving a few bucks. That saving of a few bucks potentially compromises safety, but fundamentally it is wrong in the way that it exploits those workers who are based overseas and who work under lesser conditions on what are essentially domestic flights. That needs to stop. That is what this bill is about. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:53):  I move:


That the following words be added to the end of the motion—


""and in respect of the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012, the bill be referred immediately to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 19 June 2012.""


The opposition are seeking to amend the motion moved for the adoption of the Selection of Bills Committee report, because we put forward the quite sensible proposition to the Selection of Bills Committee that this piece of legislation be referred to the Economics Committee for inquiry. We did that because this legislation has been rushed and the government has put in place a guillotine to deal with this legislation. The government seeks to deny this chamber its rights and prerogatives to properly examine this legislation. The government is doing this for a number of reasons, the first of which is that this legislation, if brought forward, if rushed through and if passed over the next few days, would enable the current government to manufacture a budget surplus. The government is attempting to re-badge the education tax rebate as an education schoolkids bonus and to no longer require that receipts be provided to demonstrate that the funds were spent on education. The government needs to do this to bring forward expenditure from next financial year to this financial year, so that it has the capacity to manufacture a surplus. It is a phoney surplus, a bogus surplus, but it is the first reason the government is seeking to have this legislation passed with undue haste. 


The other reason the government is seeking to have this legislation passed with such haste is to provide yet a further cover for the effects of the carbon tax. This is to be a sugar hit for households to help numb the pain of the carbon tax. If the government were being honest and upfront, it would change the title of this legislation to the carbon tax sugar hit bonus for households—at least we would have some truth in the title of the legislation.


The third reason the government has sought to rush this legislation and to deny the Senate Economics Committee the opportunity to examine it is that when Labor is presented with two competing priorities—one being political expediency and self-interest and the other being parliamentary scrutiny and accountability—the government will always defaults towards self-interest and partisan interest. That always wins out over the rights and responsibilities of this chamber to provide appropriate scrutiny. 


We have three reasons why the government is seeking to do this: one, it wants to help manufacture a fraud of a surplus; two, it wants to provide a sugar hit for households to distract from and ameliorate the effects of the carbon tax; and three, the government yet again is seeking to deny this chamber the capacity to perform its functions properly and to provide appropriate scrutiny.


The opposition refuse to be complicit in helping the government achieve any of those three objectives. It is my prediction that there may be another party in this chamber who will join with the government to vote against the amendment I have moved. That causes me great distress, because the Greens used to be paragons of parliamentary virtue back in the early days of Senator Bob Brown. We had hoped for better things from Senator Milne but she, sadly, is continuing in the footsteps of Senator Brown. We fully expect the Greens will combine with the government to vote against this legislation. They should not, but if they do they should be ashamed.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This bill delivers on the Government's Budget announcement of a new payment for families to help with the costs of children in school.  


It is part of this Labor Government's commitment to helping Australian families make ends meet. 


And it shows our determination to continue supporting low and middle-income families as we return the Budget to surplus. 


Our economic fundamentals are strong, unemployment is low and we are in the middle of a mining boom, but we recognise that it's not everybody's boom. 


We understand that many working Australians are struggling to balance the family budget. For many families, the extra costs of sending children to school, and giving them a great education, can add to this pressure. 


That's why, from 1 January next year, the Government will deliver a new payment to about 1.3 million Australian families with kids in school. 


This payment – the Schoolkids Bonus – will be paid to the families of about 2.2 million children in primary and secondary schools across the country. 


The Schoolkids Bonus will be delivered as an upfront payment to families in two instalments each year – before Term 1 and Term 3 – to help them cover the costs of their child's education. 


Expenses like school uniforms and school shoes, text books, camps and excursions, as well as extracurricular activities such as music lessons. 


Eligible families will receive a total of $410 a year for each child in primary school, and $820 a year for each child in secondary school. 


The Schoolkids Bonus will replace the Education Tax Refund in 2013, and this bill also removes the Education Tax Refund for 2011-12 from taxation legislation. 


For many families with children in school, the Education Tax Refund has made a big difference. However, we know that many families are not experiencing its full benefits. 


This is especially the case for working families on low incomes – it's simply too tough to pay the school expenses first and then wait months, or even a year, to get 50 per cent back. 


For busy families, it can also be hard keeping track of receipts, and then filling out all the paperwork at tax time. 


Last year, more than 80 per cent of families did not claim the full amount they are entitled to. About 20 per cent did not claim a refund at all. 


In total, about one million Australian families are missing out on the full benefit of the Education Tax Refund. 


This Labor Government wants that to change. 


And this is the right time to turn this assistance into an upfront payment, with the 1 July 2012 increase to the tax-free threshold meaning that more than a million people will no longer need to do a tax return. 


The new Schoolkids Bonus will make sure that all eligible families get their full entitlement – not just those who can afford to spend the money upfront and claim later. 


The Schoolkids Bonus means more support for families with kids in school. 


It means not having to wait months to get something back. 


It means not having to collect a pile of receipts, or fill out that extra paperwork at tax time. 


Paid in full and upfront, the Schoolkids Bonus means working families getting the support they need, when they need it. 


It's money in your pocket – and new support from the Gillard Government. 


It's support that's there before the costs start rolling in. 


It's extra support for more than one million Australian families – who have missed out in the past – and can now get every cent they deserve.


The Schoolkids Bonus will be available from 2013 to families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A, plus young people in school receiving income support payments such as youth allowance, ABSTUDY, disability support pension and veterans' educational allowances, on the eligibility test date.


Families will only need to notify Centrelink when their child first starts school so that the payments can begin. 


After that, the bonus is automatically paid in January and July every year if they remain on the relevant linked payment, such as Family Tax Benefit Part A. 


Parents will also need to let Centrelink know when their kids go to high school so they can move onto the higher payment.


The Government is delivering this new support because we know it can be tough to make ends meet, particularly when you're trying to get your kids through school. 


Uniforms, school shoes, text books and excursions aren't cheap, and the costs can quickly add up. When the Schoolkids Bonus begins in January next year, it will help families relieve some of the pressure on the household budget. 


But we also know that many families are feeling the pinch right now – and need a bit of extra support right now. 


So as we transition to the Schoolkids Bonus, we want to do what we can right now to make sure we are looking out for low and middle-income families who are finding it tough to keep up. 


This bill creates a one-off transitional payment – called the ETR Payment – which will pay out, in full, the Education Tax Refund to all eligible families for 2011-12. 


This means families will receive their full Education Tax Refund entitlement for the 2011-12 tax year ahead of tax time – so parents won't have to worry about keeping receipts or making claims when they do their tax this year.


The one-off ETR payment will be $409 for a child in primary school and $818 for a secondary school child – the same maximum amounts that would have been available for the 2011-12 tax year. A family with one primary student and one secondary student will get more than $700 extra on average this year.


All 1.3 million families will get the maximum amount they are entitled to for the first time – and all will get their payments earlier. 


They won't have to collect their receipts, and they won't have to fill out that extra paperwork at tax time. 


This lump-sum payment will be paid to all families entitled to Family Tax Benefit Part A on May 8th this year for a school aged child, as well as to young people in secondary education who are receiving certain student income support payments on May 8th. 


A similar ETR payment will be provided through amendments to Veterans' Affairs legislation for recipients on May 8th of payments under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme.


The bill will also create an administrative scheme for the ETR payment, which will assist people who may not be able to access an appropriate ETR payment under the family assistance law or veterans' legislation – for example, a parent who was automatically paid the primary school rate for a child who is actually in secondary school. 


In a tough Budget environment, this Government is making the hard decisions as we return to surplus. 


But we are a Labor Government, driven by Labor values. 


Labor will always stand up for Australia's low and middle-income families. 


Families who do their very best with what they've got. 


Who don't ask for much and who deserve a bit of extra support. 


It's our job to make sure that those families who need a bit of extra help are getting it – and that's what the Gillard Government's Schoolkids Bonus will do. 


Labor will always work to ensure that Australian families, particularly those putting their kids through school, have the support they need to make ends meet.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-05-10,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (12:33):  I rise to contribute to this debate, albeit, as we have heard, a very, very short debate because, in true Labor government style, condoned by the government's alliance partner the Greens, the Senate has to consider this important budget bill by 1.50 pm today, the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012—or, as my good friend Senator Macdonald just said, 'Why don't they call it what it is: a bill that is going to be bribing Australian parents?' 


The Australian people are not fools. Whilst those on the other side may treat them as though they are mugs and cannot see exactly what this bill is designed to do, Australians know that this bill is nothing more and nothing less than something that you would expect from a desperate government—




Senator Sterle:
  Would you same the same if you had kids at school?




Senator CASH:
  a government that in Western Australia is so on the nose that they are likely to have no seats after the next election. The Australian people know that the only reason we are debating this bill today is that on 1 July the greatest political lie ever to be perpetrated on the Australian people is going to commence. And that is the lie that commenced with this, the day before the 2010 election: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' the greatest political lie ever to be perpetrated on the Australian people. This bill confirms what the Australian people know. 



Senator Sterle interjecting—



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator CASH:
  We are debating this bill today for one reason and one reason only. Because of Labor's toxic carbon tax, the costs of living that have already risen time and time again under the last four years of this Labor government are going to continue to rise—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Order! I ask those senators in the chamber who are not involved in this debate to leave now. Senator Cash has the call.




Senator CASH:
  The costs of living that are already on the rise and have continued to rise under this Labor government, because of the carbon tax, are going to continue to rise. 




Senator Sterle:
  Will you say the same in Brand? I will be very interested, Michaelia.




Senator CASH:
  What is worse for the Australian people is this: this policy is just another policy in a long line of Labor failures, which in reality the Australian public are paying for.




Senator Kroger:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would like to draw your attention to the behaviour of senators on the other side of the chamber who have continued to interject and now have, disgracefully, walked out of the chamber in shame when someone gets up to note their behaviour. It would be appreciated if you could draw their attention to the decorum of this place.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Order! Senator Kroger, there have been interjections from both sides of the chamber and, as we know, interjections are disorderly. Senator Cash has the call.




Senator CASH:
  Labor has learnt nothing from the last four years of continual Labor government failures. Who can forget the $900 cash splash which, in many instances, was proven to be poured straight down the slot of a pokie machine? Who can remember the spectacular failure of the pink batts scheme? Who can remember the spectacular failure of the cash for clunkers scheme? The set-top boxes scheme? The list of Labor failures goes on and on and on. And what do we now have? Another cheap political trick by the Labor Party masquerading as the so-called schoolkids bonus.


The Labor Party have clearly underestimated the capacity of the Australian people to see right through their policy intent. The Australian people know that, despite the Australian Labor Party treating them as if they have no capacity to see through Labor's rhetoric, the bill we are debating today has nothing to do with education. It has nothing to do with the future generation of Australians and their educational needs and everything to do with those on the other side throwing as fast as they can—in fact, by 1.50 pm today—a wad of cash at the mums and dads of Australia who may qualify for this bonus. Labor know that the countdown is on and in but a few weeks those mums and dads are going to be hit with the greatest political lie of all time—the carbon tax.


It is incredible that, after four years of being in government, the Labor Party continues to believe that you can address the rising cost of living simply by giving the Australian people a cash handout. Anybody who has studied basic economics 101 will know that cost-of-living pressures only ever go down when costs of government go down. Based on Labor's record in that regard, it is going to be a very long time before we see the cost of the current government go down.


When considering the bill today we need to put it into context. Why has the government had to rush this particular budget measure through the other place and rush through the Senate in under two hours? Labor can rewrite history but it cannot rewrite the facts. The facts for the Australian people are this: the Gillard-Rudd-Swan Labor governments have delivered the four biggest deficits on record. That is right—the four biggest deficits in Australia's history. Contrast that with the former Howard government. In its last four budgets it delivered the four largest surpluses the Australian people had ever seen, including in its final year a record surplus of $19.7 billion. That was a surplus that was actually delivered, unlike those on the other side who currently claim to have delivered a surplus. They know full well that merely by saying on budget night that you anticipate a certain thing will happen does not mean that over the ensuing financial year it actually will.


The cold hard reality for the mums and dads of Australia is that the Labor Party continues to borrow an extra $100 million each and every day. The cold hard reality for the mums and dads of Australia is that the average Commonwealth budget balance was an $8.1 billion surplus over the Howard government years and under Labor it has managed a record average of a $41.7 billion deficit. The contrast could not be any clearer.


When it comes to budget deficits, this is a government that knows absolutely no bounds. Just look at what they told the Australian people in the lead-up to budget night. The budget deficit for 2011-12 was constantly revised upwards. The government told the people of Australia around 12 months ago that they were heading for a $12 billion deficit. They then realised that with their excessive spending they would need to revise that figure up, and revise it up they did. They revised it up to $23 billion. Again, it still was not enough. With their excessive spending, they had to re-revise the budget deficit up to $37 billion. Was that revision big enough to compensate for their waste and mismanagement? The answer is no.


We know the answer is no because on budget night just passed, the Treasurer, Mr Swan, advised the Australian people that the budget deficit had now exceeded $44 billion. As if that was not bad enough, the Australian people should be extremely alarmed that hidden in these budget bills was the government's announcement that it would seek to increase Australia's debt ceiling to a record $300 billion. Three hundred billion dollars is four times what the ceiling was in 2008. What does that mean? It means the Labor Party yet again is saying to the people of Australia, 'We have abused taxpayers' funds. We are well and truly over the limit on our credit card and yet again we have to sneak into the parliament—not make an announcement to the Australian people—an increase in the debt ceiling of Australia.' Does this government care? Of course it does not. That is why we are debating the bill that we have before us at the moment. What does it do? The government announces a quick political fix and it announces yet another cash splash. This policy measure is, without a doubt, one of the most blatant attempts by a fiscally incompetent government to cook this year's budget books in order to allow Labor to protect their artificial surplus for the next financial year. And why do we say that? Because the refund is going to be paid out before the end of this financial year, which is the sole reason that we commenced the debate at 12.30 today and we are being guillotined at 1.50 today, because Labor have manipulated the books to such an extent that they need to push a whole lot of cash through today to ensure that it is not reflected in next year's figures, to maintain their artificial surplus.


Labor's announcement that they are dumping the education tax rebate to instead give out handfuls of taxpayers' money is a desperate bid to improve their dying electoral chances. Like so many Australians, the coalition does not, and will not, support this improperly named 'schoolkids bonus' for very good reasons. The first is this: the money that is being handed over, that is being thrown at Australians, has absolutely nothing to do with education. Despite the Labor Party's denials of this—and deny it they have—we know this is true because, in the legislation we are currently debating, there is absolutely no requirement at all for the rebadged education tax rebate to actually be spent on a child's education. Under the education tax rebate, you had a rebate which had to be spent—you had to prove you spent the money on a child's education—and what do the Labor Party do? They abolish that and they say, 'If we call it a 'schoolkids bonus', hopefully the Australian public are silly enough to actually believe that in some way it relates to the schoolkids' education. Well, I have news for those on the other side: the Australian people are not mugs and they are not fooled by your rhetoric.


Instead of having a targeted payment, whereby all that parents needed to do was submit receipts that showed that they had expended funds on their children's education, and they would then get that money back, what we have is the Labor Party saying, 'We'll just give you the money; seriously, just take the money'—




Senator Nash:
  Take the money and run!




Senator CASH:
  Take the money and run, Senator Nash; that is exactly right. 'And we will have no conditions whatsoever, because we do not believe in making people accountable'—let alone themselves—'for what the money is actually spent on.' So parents can spend the money on whatever they like.


I spoke with a young mother yesterday. She was a single mother and, like so many Australians, she is under a lot of pressure and is battling with the rising cost-of-living pressure. She will qualify for this cash-splash payment. She said to me, 'Do you know what I'm going to do with it, Michaelia? It may well pay my next grocery bill, or maybe I will put it towards my electricity bill—because that keeps rising.' But she admitted she would not be using the money for her child's education. Whilst many parents will do the right thing and will put it towards their child's education, there are so many—like the mother I spoke to yesterday—who are drowning under the rising cost-of-living pressure who will have no real choice but, when given some money by the Labor Party, spend it on something else—and who can actually blame them? You cannot blame them, when they look you in the face and are honest enough with you to say, 'I won't spend it on education, because I'm about to have my electricity turned off because I can't pay my electricity bill.'


On that point, we have learnt today that, in my home state of Western Australia, electricity prices are likely to rise by almost 15 per cent, solely as a result of the federal Labor government's carbon tax and the fact that it is going to have a bigger impact and a bigger effect on bills than was initially expected. It has been confirmed by the WA Treasurer that power prices in WA will need to increase by 9.5 per cent to cover the added cost of producing electricity, solely because of the federal government's carbon tax. If Labor were truly serious about reducing the burdens facing Australian families, the best thing they could do is what the former Premier of New South Wales has told them they should do—that is, former Labor Premier Kristina Keneally. She has at least been honest enough to say, 'I supported the carbon tax because I needed to try and win an election. I now realise that that was wrong', and she is on the record as saying, 'The smartest thing that the current Prime Minister could do is to scrap the carbon tax.'


This new policy that they are introducing today, and the one that we are debating—we have one hour left now; one hour to debate a budget measure—has abandoned any pretence of being about offsetting education costs. It is nothing more and nothing less than a sugar hit for families to create a diversion from increased bills and costs that will happen just because a family goes about undertaking the day-to-day activities that they would normally undertake. Because of those on the other side, this is now going to be a far more expensive exercise.


The coalition understands, without a doubt, that parents in Australia need help with their education costs. We are upfront about that. In fact, we are so upfront about that that the policy we took to the last election was to increase the education tax rebate. Our plan was to increase it so that families would receive $1,000 for each secondary school aged child and $500 for each primary school aged child. Let's contrast that with the cash splash that the Labor government are giving out. One thousand dollars and $500 is what they would have got under the coalition; what are they getting under Labor? Under Labor they will only get $820 for secondary school aged children and $410 for primary school aged children. The Australian public are actually going to be $270 worse off per year under the Labor government. The coalition's policy was more money, it was appropriately targeted and it was directed straight at those families that most needed the financial assistance. But, as Graham Richardson has said time and time again: 'Whatever it takes.' The Labor Party will do whatever it takes to remain on that side of the chamber. The SchoolKids Bonus is the perfect example of Graham Richardson's statement in action. The legislation we are currently debating is about nothing more and nothing less than throwing money at people to compensate for the fact that they are about to be hit by the world's biggest carbon tax. This is about nothing more and nothing less than compensating the Australian people for the fact that over the last four years, under successive Labor governments, the cost of living has risen and risen, and the Australian people know that under Labor there is only one way that the cost of living goes, and that is up.


The coalition will oppose this bad policy. It is bad policy because it is not making a targeted payment. It makes a general cash handout that can be used in any way totally unrelated to education expenses. It is bad policy because it is bringing forward expenditure from next year's financial accounts into this year's in order to give the Treasurer and Labor a so-called surplus. Australia under Labor is now a nation that is saddled with increasing debt. That is the Labor Party's great record: a nation that is saddled with increasing debt.


Bills like the one we are hurriedly debating today prove that Labor's budget is not a nation building budget. It is not a budget to be proud of. It is a nation wrecking budget, a horror budget, and they should at least be up-front with the Australian people about what this cash splash actually is.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-05-10,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:54):  I rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. The issue here for the Greens is that we put very strongly to the government that we not proceed with the tax cut for big business in Australia because we are a very wealthy country, but we are also an unequal country, and it was time that we started to look at ways in which we could reduce the gap between the rich and the poor in Australia, which is widening. I am very pleased that the government did not proceed with the tax cut for big business. That essentially created the space in this year's budget to provide some, if you like, wealth redistribution.


The Australian Greens' perspective is that we would have preferred to have seen money made available for permanent system-wide improvements. When I say that, I, and the Greens, would have preferred to have seen $5 billion allocated to the implementation of the Gonski review into education. Of that, $3 billion would have gone into public education and we would have seen a huge investment across the country that would have complemented the previous investment in education from Building the Education Revolution funding. I am very aware that that funding led to badly needed new facilities across the country. I have visited many of those in my own state of Tasmania and I have to say that in the case of Tasmania, which is the place I am most familiar with in this regard, the money has been spent in a way that has made dramatic improvements in the amenity of school life for students across the state. That was an infrastructure cost, an improvement in facilities.


If we now implemented a real cash injection into education delivery in Australia we would have the long-term directional reform we need. However, the government has chosen not to do that. Instead it has looked at this particular bonus, which was already there in the budget as a tax rebate to provide support to families for the cost of educating their children. The problem with an income tax rebate is that people who are already on income support are not lodging tax returns and so do not benefit from this available support. When I sought some more information on this it became quite clear that, of the 1.3 million families across Australia who were entitled to access this, one million had either not accessed it or not accessed it in full. Those who had accessed it, a small number in relative terms, tended to be at the top end of the eligible income range, because they are the ones who are more likely to have tax accountants and are more likely to have a better organised way of managing their tax business and their tax receipts. So they are the ones who are able to benefit most from this, when in reality the people who need it most are at the bottom end of the taxable income scale or, indeed, the level of income support—or part-time and so on—they are working on.


I certainly support the view that if we are going to make a payment such as this it be targeted in a way that helps the people who need it most. I am satisfied that the previous way this was being offered, through the tax refund, was a failed policy for the reason I have just mentioned, namely, the people who need it most were the people who were not accessing it, for various reasons.


Another reason people did not access it is that, for many people, buying a new school uniform is not something they would necessarily do. Often they would buy school uniforms from other people, with the result being that they may not get a receipt. Equally, I am aware that the same thing happens, to a degree, with schoolbooks. I am also aware that children of low-income earners and people on income support have not been accessing school trips and school excursions. Unfortunately they require a copayment from the parents and often they cannot afford that. 


If the principle that we are coming from as a parliament, and I hope it is the principle we are coming from, is equitable access to quality education, then equitable access has to be enabled. As I indicated before, the Greens believe the $5 billion would have been better directed to the implementation of the Gonski review to complement the Building the Education Revolution investment in infrastructure. The government has chosen not to do that. But this measure does enable a shift in focus, and I am confident that this money now going into the pockets of eligible Australian families will go to supporting their children in school. 


Everyone in this parliament remembers the Howard government years, and everybody remembers the introduction of the baby bonus. I just heard Senator Cash speaking at length on how terrible it is that this money is not targeted. The baby bonus was also just a cash payment, and it is well-known across Australia that it became nicknamed the plasma bonus, because in many cases people spent the money upfront on some piece of capital equipment that they chose to purchase at that time. That is why there have been significant changes in the way that benefit has been paid over the years. It is gross hypocrisy for the opposition to argue about this, because if two people ever characterised the notion of buying votes with cash splashes it was the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, and the former Prime Minister, John Howard. They made an art form of it. They bought election after election with cash splashes, so let us not hear any more hypocrisy from the coalition on this. As the Prime Minister said in the House yesterday, a person gets a baby bonus for a baby and then the baby grows up and goes to school and they require money to enable equitable access to education. The leader of the coalition says, when asked why the baby bonus is different from the education bonus, 'It just is'. There is no principle and no policy difference, and it is ridiculous for the coalition to try to maintain the position it is currently taking.


In the midst of the mining boom we can afford to prioritise education for our children. Public funding of schools as a percentage of GDP shows that Australia is lagging the OECD average of 3.5 per cent, sitting at three per cent, while the best funded nations include Norway with 5 per cent, Iceland with 4.9 per cent and Denmark with 4.2 per cent—which is another reason why the Greens would have preferred this money to go towards a major injection into the Australian education system. The Greens will continue to advocate for an immediate investment in our public education sector.


We also want to talk about this benefit in the broader context of wealth redistribution in Australia and reducing the gap between the rich and the poor. We are concerned that the government has gone ahead with this schoolkids bonus bill. There is the added benefit through family tax benefit A but, unfortunately, there is nothing that is in any way equivalent for people on Newstart. We know that the most vulnerable people in Australia right now are those who are looking for work and are on income support. Frankly, I have to say the most vulnerable Australians getting Newstart needed another $50 a week at least. We are asking people to live on $244 a week. My colleague Senator Siewert did that for a week and, in some very passionate and excellent speeches, has said she does not know how people do it, given the cost of accommodation particularly as well as food and transport. I think $210 a year, which is what the government has made available—it will be indexed—is an insult to people who are struggling to survive. A 50c increase per day is not enough—it is barely enough for one cup of coffee a week. When we look at the most vulnerable and we add onto them the 100,000 single mums who are also going to have part of their benefit taken away in this budget, I would like to have seen an overall assessment of all of these different payments, working out how with the quantum of money across the levels of support we could have better supported those at the bottom end. As for the single mums, I make this point very strongly: if you are saying that you take the benefit away because you want people to seek work, the issue for me in rural and regional Australia—and every senator who is familiar with rural and regional Australia will know this—is that first of all you cannot assume that the jobs are out there in the first place; second, you cannot assume that there is any public transport or capacity to access transport to get to the jobs even if they do exist; and, thirdly, you cannot assume that there is going to be access to quality childcare. So you are penalising people who do not have alternatives, who do not even have the ability to go and get a job, let alone get to that job—and, even if they could get to it, they do not have access to quality child care. 


The Treasurer made a point of saying that this was a budget of the fair go, that this was a budget which was attempting to redistribute wealth in order to benefit the most vulnerable people in our society. Yet the most vulnerable in Australia, single mothers on Newstart in this case, have not been supported in an appropriate way. Cutting back on foreign aid also says that you are building a surplus on the back of the poorest people in the world. So we are building a surplus on the back of the poorest in the world and we are not distributing fairly—we are not distributing to the most vulnerable and the most needy in the Australian context. 


The Greens are supporting the schoolkids bonus because it is a way of making sure that payments are better targeted, going to those at the lower end of the income scale and to income support recipients—giving them support in educating their children. But we would have preferred a systemic change, with investment in the implementation of the Gonski review—$3 billion into public education across the country—and income support increased for the most vulnerable. That is how we would have dealt with this issue. 


On the issue of Newstart, my colleague Senator Siewert told the Senate yesterday that she has met single mothers and older workers who have been retrenched, young men and women, people living with a partial disability or with mental illness, and migrants struggling with language issues. All of these people come into the category of most vulnerable and have some of the greatest barriers to overcome to get into the workforce. But not one of them said to her that Newstart is what they want for their lives or their family. What they want is to be able to improve their own lives and those of their families and communities by participating in the workforce to a greater extent. 


The Greens are supporting the schoolkids bonus. We do think it is better than a tax rebate, but in the broader context we would have liked to have seen system-wide and permanent change to the funding of public education. If you had that, a lot of the charges that schools are increasingly having to impose on parents could actually be covered out of the schools' own funding. It has been quite a while since I was teaching, but I have many friends who are still in the teaching service and they all say that, over the years, there has been a massive cost shift to parents because the public education system simply cannot offer the same level of opportunity it used to—the public schools just do not have the money to do it. 


Fundamental system-wide change is what is required to achieve permanent improvement in the public education system—whereas the schoolkids bonus, in my view, is a stopgap measure. I recognise that it is ongoing and I recognise that it will be helpful in some cases, but I do not think that it is the kind of move which will inspire the nation to think that there has been a genuine investment in better educational opportunity and in universal access to high quality education. That could have occurred if the quantum the Greens saved the government could have been looked at differently—to make sure it was even better targeted to support the most vulnerable.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2012-05-10,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (13:11):  I rise today to speak in support of the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. Parents of Australian children, like parents everywhere, want nothing more than to give their children the best start in life they can. They understand that for a child's potential to be realised, both for the benefit of the child and for the benefit of our nation, this potential must be nurtured. Access to a good education is a right that all Australian children deserve and provision of a good education is the best way to help them realise that potential. 


The government understands that educating children can be expensive. The cost of uniforms, computers, stationery, music lessons, sporting uniforms, art supplies, software and numerous other items adds up to a significant portion of a family's budget. The Gillard Labor government understands this. We understand that at times parents must make difficult decisions to ensure their children's educational needs are met. The Gillard Labor Government's new schoolkids bonus is a recognition that educating our children is expensive. The new schoolkids bonus is a way that the Labor government can support parents in their most important task: building a better future for our children.


The schoolkids bonus is replacing the education tax refund from 1 January 2013. Under the education tax refund, parents were entitled to claim a refund by submitting education receipts. Unfortunately, many parents were not claiming either part or all of the refund they were entitled to. Parents now will not have to pay out of their own pocket and then wait months to get the money back. The Labor government has made this an upfront cash payment because we realise that parents are busy and that collecting receipts and tucking them away in envelopes until the end of the financial year is not at the forefront of their mind when they are busy buying new school uniforms, new stationery or new sports uniforms.


The new schoolkids bonus makes it easier for the parents of 1.3 million families across the nation to get the support they deserve from the government. In Tasmania, my home state, 34,800 families are expected to receive $410 for each child in primary school and $820 a year for each child in high school. Payments will be made for a total of 61,150 children just in Tasmania. In Franklin, the federal electorate where my electorate office is located, a total of 6,850 families with 12,050 children will receive funding totalling over $7 million. The schoolkids bonus will be available to families receiving family tax benefit part A, plus young people in school receiving youth allowance and recipients of some other income support and veterans payments. The eligibility requirements are the same as those for the education tax refund. As a transition to the schoolkids bonus, this bill creates a new payment called the ETR payment to replace the education tax refund that would otherwise have been available to eligible families for 2011-12.


The ETR payment will be paid to all families entitled to family tax benefit part A on 8 May 2012 for a school-aged child, and to young people in secondary education who are receiving certain student income support payments on 8 May 2012. The ETR payment will pay out the full amount of what would have been available through the taxation system for 2011-12—that is, $409 for each child in primary school and $818 for each child in secondary school. The ETR payment will be paid earlier than otherwise would have been the case under the education tax refund, and without the need to lodge receipts for a tax return. A mirror ETR payment will be provided through amendments to veterans affairs legislation for recipients on 8 May 2012 of payments under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme. The bill will also create an administrative scheme for an ETR payment which will assist people who may not be able to access an appropriate ETR payment under family assistance law or veterans legislation. All ETR payments and the schoolkids bonus will be non-taxable and will not count as income for social security or veterans entitlements income test purposes.


I am terribly disappointed that the Liberal Party have opposed this measure. I am deeply disappointed that the Liberal Party do not appear to care for the future education of Australian children. I am also deeply disappointed that the Liberal Party do not care about supporting Australian families. I call again on every Tasmanian Liberal senator to go to the schools in their communities and explain to the parents of students at Snug Primary School, Reece High School, St Aloysius Catholic College and every other school across Tasmania why the Liberal Party refuse to support their family in educating their children. And what excuse does the Liberal Party offer for refusing parents the schoolkids bonus? All that the Liberal Party offer is that they do not trust parents to spend the schoolkids bonus on their children's education. How insulting is that? How insulting is it to every caring, hardworking parent across our country that the Liberal Party believe that, instead of spending money on their children's education, parents will simply waste the money? How insulting is it to every caring, hardworking parent across our country that the Liberal Party do not trust parents to act in the best interests of their own children?


I find it disgusting that Senator Cash came into this place not long ago and implied that parents receiving this bonus will just pour it into poker machines—that the shadow parliamentary secretary for the status of women thinks so little of the mothers of Australia, whom she purports to represent, believes that. I do not think she actually believes it; I think she is just toeing the party line to be nice to Mr Abbott. I also find it quite hypocritical that Senators Fifield and Bernardi make public statements that young families are doing it tough but refuse to pass the one practical measure to help them out. I am angry that the Liberal Party think so little of Australian parents and Australian children. That stinks, it is rotten and it is mean. It is just plain nasty. Australian parents deserve better than those opposite.


I am, however, proud to say that the Gillard Labor government passed this bill through the House of Representatives last night, despite repeated, bizarre attempts by the Liberals to block the vote. Tony Abbott's extreme and unfortunately increasingly predictable blocking tactics took 'no' to a whole new level. The 19 Liberal Party members of the House of Representatives who spoke in opposition to the schoolkids bonus should hang their heads in shame and take a moment to think of the families in their electorates. Mr Abbott has shown all Australians just how determined he is to stop families getting the money they need.


I am proud to say that every single one of my Tasmanian Labor colleagues in the House of Representatives—Geoff Lyons in Bass, Sid Sidebottom in Braddon, Dick Adams in Lyons and Julie Collins in Franklin—voted in support of the schoolkids bonus. Each Tasmanian Labor member stood up for the families in their electorates. I am also proud that soon my Labor colleagues in the Senate will do the same and vote in favour of the schoolkids bonus. I highly recommend and commend this bill to the Senate.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2012-05-10,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:19):  I rise to make a contribution on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012. Colleagues, just when you think the government cannot possibly come up with yet another shambolic policy, here it is. After the litany of shambolic policies that we have seen from this government, we thought maybe one day they might get to the end of that; maybe one day they might actually give us something that they have thought through and that is substantive. Sadly, colleagues, no—not a chance. This country should be so lucky! This schoolkids bonus is yet another example of this government simply not thinking things through. 


This should not in fact be called a schoolkids bonus; it should be called a parents bonus. This is money that is going straight to parents with absolutely no requirement whatsoever that the money be used for their children's education. Supposedly, this is all about ensuring that money goes to children to support their education and other needs. Yet the government says to parents: 'Don't worry; we'll just give you a bit of a cash handout and you don't have any responsibility to prove to the Australian taxpayer that you're going to use this for your children's education'—none whatsoever. How you can possibly call it a schoolkids bonus when there is nothing to tie the bonus to schoolkids? I must say I think we should show these so-called schoolkids the respect of at least calling it a schoolchildren's bonus.


This government has absolutely no idea. This is nothing more than a cash splash. This is nothing more than a sugar hit for families. And it creates a diversion from the carbon tax hit to the cost of living. That cash splash is going out to parents at the very same time as the government is asking the nation to stump up for a $300 billion limit on the country's credit card. On one hand we have the irresponsibility of putting money out, throwing out a cash splash, with no requirement for responsibility from parents as to how they are going to spend it, and on the other hand asking this parliament to increase the limit for borrowings from $250 billion to $300 billion. This Gillard-Greens-Independent-shambolic-crazy government is absolutely appalling. They have no idea how to construct a budget that will take the country forward to a sustainable future. 


The people in this nation get it; they understand it. Senator Cash was absolutely right when she said earlier that the Australian people are not fools. They know that this is money to buy votes, that this is money to distract people from the cost-of-living hit which will come from the carbon tax—there is absolutely no two ways about that. With the litany of policy failures, this is just another. Look at the Home Installation Program, where $2½ billion was mismanaged with at least $500 million spent fixing the mistakes; computers in schools is a $1.4 billion blow-out and way behind schedule; Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch had nearly $30 million spent setting them up and then they were dumped; Labor's multibillion dollar NBN rollout—as my good colleague Senator Joyce said last night, the next budget nightmare—has continued without a proper business case; and my personal favourite, a small but a goodie: the government sold the parliamentary billiard tables for $5,000 and then spent $102,000 determining whether or not they got value for money. This demonstrates the calibre of this government. 


It is no wonder people come up to me in the street and say time and time again that they are embarrassed by this nation's Labor government. There is absolutely no confidence out in the community, none whatsoever, and things are in a downward spiral courtesy of this cobbled together, Labor-Independent-Greens government which people are mightily sick of. When they see things like the schoolkids bonus, they know money is not being targeted properly, that there is no responsibility being required from parents as to how they are going to spend this money. There is not one single thing linking that payment, the cash bonus going to parents, to providing educational needs of the students. How can it possibly be called a schoolkids bonus? As I said earlier, it is a parents bonus; it is not schoolkids bonus.


Earlier Senator Bilyk used a litany of phrases about how terrible it was that we thought parents were going to spend this money on things other than educational needs. It is not that we think badly of parents; it is that the cost of living being exacerbated by the carbon tax will mean parents will have no choice but to use this money to address cost-of-living increases. They are not going to have any choice. 


This government should scrap the carbon tax. If this government had one shred, one iota of sense and sensibility, it would get rid of the carbon tax, which is not going to change the climate one little bit yet will put a huge impost on families across this nation when it comes to the cost of living. If the government did that, it could retain the education tax refund, which would be targeted to families for education purposes. We heard comments earlier from Senator Milne trying to compare it to the baby bonus. The baby bonus was a targeted payment to achieve a policy objective. This is nothing more than a cash splash, like the $900 cheques which went to prisoners and people living overseas. Indeed, I remember a story of a fellow who had worked in property in north-west New South Wales, who called his boss when the $900 cheques went out and said, 'Hey, mate, can you thank the Prime Minister for me. I've got my $900 cheque.' He was sitting in a pub in London. That is the sort of policy ineptitude—'expertise'—that we see from this Labor government. The schoolkids bonus is yet another example of it.


With this dodgy budget, cooking the books, the way the government are running the nation's finances, if it were not so desperate it really would be laughable. Everyone can see it. Labor think they are hiding in the corner saying, 'No-one can see that we have moved all this money into this financial year and pushed a whole lot out to 2013-14. Gee, doesn't the surplus look fantastic in 2012-13!' People can actually see. They know and understand that the government have cooked the books to get the 'surplus' they want for this year, and it is simply appalling. The schoolkids bonus is no way to provide for educational needs for school children. It is absolutely no way to do it. It is yet another example of this government's complete ineptitude, and the Australian people know it. They are out in the streets decrying the fact that this Labor-Greens-Independent government simply are unable to run the country properly. They are completely inept, and it is no wonder people are saying it is time for the government to go.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2012-05-10,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:28):   What we just heard in that contribution from the opposition on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Schoolkids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012 was again simply a list of reasons why they cannot support Australian families. No matter how they try to dress it up, no matter what sorts of mealy-mouthed words come out, the reality is that that contribution was, firstly, talking about cobbling together a government. Mr Abbott was trying to do the same thing, but the reality is Australians do not want Mr Abbott as Prime Minister. They could not do that, so now they criticise the government. They talked about the NBN, again an initiative widely supported by the Australian community. Across the states and territories, particularly in Tasmania, it is a fantastic infrastructure initiative providing jobs and boosting the economy. 


They also talked about our economic expertise. Of course, they would, because we have a strong economy. We acted quickly and directly to tackle the global financial crisis and they do not like it. And we returned the budget to surplus and they do not like it. 


No matter how they dress it up and no matter what they say, they do not want to support the schoolkids bonus, because they want to oppose everything. By saying that parents will not spend the money on their children's education, no matter how they word it, they simply mean that they are refusing to trust families. They are blocking this relief for family budgets, for extra money to be spent on children's education, because they do not trust families and they have no other word but 'no'. We know they have been called the 'noalition' and I am sure they are very proud of it. 


What we are doing in delivering on the government's announcement to replace the education tax refund with the new schoolkids bonus is ensuring the government's commitment to help low-income families make ends meet. The new schoolkids bonus is a $2.1 billion investment over five years, which will provide assistance for about 1.3 million Australian families and for 2.2 million kids in school. The new payments will see eligible Australian families receive $410 a year for each child in primary school and $820 a year for each child in secondary school. In my home state of Tasmania, around 35,000 families stand to benefit from the schoolkids bonus, sharing in over $36 million. The bonus will help parents meet the costs of having children in school by providing a payment to assist with school uniforms, textbooks, excursions and stationery. 


Because we are making the schoolkids bonus scheme automatic and upfront, parents will not have to keep receipts for months and months until tax time. It also means that parents will receive the full amount every time, so families will not miss out if they happen to lose their receipts. Parents will not have to wait for months to be reimbursed if they have to pay the expenses out of their own pocket. The schoolkids bonus will be paid upfront in two instalments in January and June each year, so families will have the money in their pockets when children's school expenses start to flow. The bonus will be available each year to families receiving family tax benefit A, to young people in school receiving a youth allowance and to families receiving some other income support or veterans payments. 


As I mentioned earlier, the government is implementing the schoolkids bonus to replace the education tax refund. We introduced the education tax refund back in 2008 to help families with the cost of having children in school. However, many families did not claim the full amount they were entitled to under the education tax refund and some did not claim anything at all. Families lost their receipts or forgot to keep them, and many parents were not able to afford to pay for the school items first and then wait months to be reimbursed. So, we are now introducing the schoolkids bonus scheme, which has simplified the process and will provide upfront financial support to parents when they need it most. As part of our transition to the new schoolkids bonus on 1 January 2013, the government will pay out the education tax refund in full next month to all eligible families. We are doing this in the knowledge that many families would have school expenses that they need help with right now to make ends meet. This means that families with schoolkids will get payments straightaway, without having to collect receipts and wait until tax time to fill out the paperwork to be reimbursed. The lump sum education tax refund payment will mean eligible families will receive $409 for each child in primary school and $818 for each secondary school child. These are the maximum amounts that would have been available through the education tax refund in 2011-12. 


Whilst we on this side of the chamber are implementing measures to support families to help make ends meet, what do we get from those opposite? We have already witnessed here today the negativity; we have already witnessed here today the opposition, and we have already witnessed here today the opposition's view that parents cannot be trusted. That is exactly what we would expect—mindless negativity with the view to oppose, oppose and oppose. Mr Abbott and his Liberal colleagues have revealed their true colours. They have tried to block the passage of this vital piece of support for Australian families. Why Mr Abbott and his Liberal colleagues would want to deny extra payment and assistance going to families to help them with cost-of-living expenses is a question Mr Abbott needs to answer for parents. It is clear that the Liberal Party led by Mr Abbott do not support Australian families. Instead, they want to rip hundreds of dollars from the pockets of Australian families who are putting their children through school. 


We know that families on low and middle incomes are feeling the pinch and that is why we are providing them with the extra support to make ends meets. We are still waiting for the Liberal Party to drop the negativity. We are waiting on them to drop their mantle of opposing for opposition's sake and to help put some money into the pockets of Australian families to use for educational expenses. They failed last night, but today they have an opportunity to say to Australian parents, 'We understand that this money will help with your children's school expenses and we do trust you to use that money on your children's education.' Today, parents—and I know there are around 35,000 Tasmanian families who will benefit from this bonus—are looking for the Liberal Party in the Senate to say: 'Yes, we want to help you as well. We'll join with the government and pass the schoolkids bonus.' With those few words, I ask that the Liberal Party join with the government in ensuring that parents and their children receive this bonus to assist them with their children's educational costs.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-05-10,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:37):  I will make a very brief contribution on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (SchoolKids Bonus Budget Measures) Bill 2012, because on such an important piece of legislation it is important that the record is made clear. I will be supporting the second reading of this bill but not the third reading. I do so for this reason: as a general principle I think it is important to support parents in the area of schoolkids' education expenses. I am a supporter of government assistance where it is needed. One of the functions of government is to provide financial assistance to help those in need meet basic living expenses. So in that respect the principle is not a bad one. Increasing the level of assistance to families for schoolkids' expenses is a laudable principle. 


I object to the bill in its current form and I cannot support the third reading of the bill because of the way it is being handled, because this is just a blank cheque, in a sense. A voucher system would have been much more preferable—the system that was in place previously—because it would limit the possibility of some parents, a small minority of parents, rorting the system. In some cases that does happen and we ought to acknowledge that. But there is also the general principle of ensuring that, if this is about schoolchildren and their educational expenses, this money ought to be spent directly for the kids' educational expenses, not by means where there is no accountability. That is why I think this bill in its current form is flawed. The government ought to have stuck with the voucher system; if it had, I would have supported this bill. 


In summary, I do support the principle that there should be additional assistance to families, but if it is targeted specifically to educational expenses for schoolchildren then it ought to be via a voucher system rather than a system which does not have any reasonable measure of transparency or accountability.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-05-10,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:39):  There was an ad once that said, 'If a stranger comes up and gives you flowers, it is Impulse.' It was an ad for perfume. Sometimes when a stranger comes up and gives you flowers it is impulse; sometimes it is just plain creepy. This is the ultimate: the stranger coming up to give you flowers is Julia Gillard. Where did this bouquet come from? What inspired this bouquet? Why has she now decided to throw this garland before the Australian people? Pray tell. It is apparently about schoolkids. If she had actually thought about it, maybe it should have been about 'schoolchildren'. We are trying to get the proper dictum here and I think 'schoolchildren' would be a good approach to take. 


Let us talk about where the schoolkids bonus—more like a 'country on the skids bogus'—is going to come from. The whole thing about this is that it is borrowed money. It is not our money, it is somebody else's money. It is more money that we are going to be borrowing from the Chinese, more money that we are going to be borrowing from people in the Middle East, more money that we have to pay back. It is no bonus to the schoolchildren when we find out that not only will they be paying it back but, with $300 billion on our overdraft, their children and their children's children will be paying it back. The insane approach that this nation is taking now is beyond comprehension. Where do these ideas come from? Where do they emanate from? More to the point, where is the money coming from? They just do not seem to care anymore. We have got the schoolkids bonus—the country on the skids bogus—yet we have only managed to put $1 billion into the NDIS over the next four years. Where are the priorities of this government? 


Knock me down with a feather here, but you are not just trying to bribe your way into an election, are you? You have not decided that you might be able to get a bit more largesse out to every person with a child rather than actually help people with disabilities? Is that the approach? You are going to get called on it—people are all over you like a rash on this one. It is just so pathetic. We have could have built a dam and created wealth, we could have fixed up railways, but no. Why not have another payment to every person who owns geraniums or who has owned geraniums or who could possibly own geraniums at some point in time in the future? This is to help schoolchildren—what, in July? I thought, 'If they are not at school by July, you have got another problem on your hands—it is called truancy.' This is just so manic; it is just so typically Labor. 


We are, as we speak, $228.8 billion in gross debt. The finance minister of this nation could not even nominate their peak debt position. We are dealing with the most incompetent economics team that has ever run the country. In the midst of this, at a time where you would expect some sort of frugal inspiration to come over the government—noting that it is not their money, that it is all borrowed money that has to be repaid—and that they would be using their expenditure first and foremost following priorities. Obviously the schoolkids bogus sits above the NDIS, because you cut your money back on the NDIS. We have got to get our priorities right here. We have got to somehow think that people are so naive that you can actually buy their vote, because that is all you are trying to do. People are thinking that this government is a little bit creepy. It has become a little bit strange. We have seen fantastic figures in the budget—an 11 per cent increase in revenue streams. They must not have televisions over in the ministerial wing. There is a little bit of a problem going on in Europe—Europe being the biggest consumer of products from China and China being the biggest market for our commodities. This does not seem to worry them. Just borrow more money! And what is the outcome they are looking for? What do they put on the table as the outcome they want to achieve from this? What is it? Who would know? All we get are these stumbling speeches about the fact that people no longer have to keep receipts. How do you think the rest of the economy works? That is what happens—you keep receipts. You keep receipts, you get to the end of the financial year and you add up your receipts. Why don't you have another policy, since you are so worried about people keeping receipts, of getting rid of group certificates as well? Let's get rid of all forms of record keeping, because that is apparently the motivation that sits behind this.


Who thought this up? Was it Minister Wong who thought this up? Is this one of her grand visions? Was it that pre-eminent bard of economic literacy, the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, who thought this up? Where is the committee that sits behind this idea? Where was the committee hearing that came up with this idea? Find me even one adjournment speech by one member of the Labor Party that even suggested this. Where did it come from? Where did this little pearl come from? Did it come from some lobby group? Has any peak industry group come in and asked for this? Have I missed something? Was it telepathy that brought this thought into creation in the Treasury? Is there one person who, before the date this was announced, stuck up their hand and said this was what they wanted? Where did this $1 billion of frivolity come from?


It is all borrowed money. It is more money for the Australian people to repay and there is no benefit to the child who has to grow up knowing about this debt. From what we saw in the paper today, they will be paying $5,000 for social security services a year out of their tax. How much do you intend for them to pay just to repay your debt? Where does this debt finish? You have $300 billion on your credit card. Even if you could possibly believe in their so-called surplus—a $1½ billion surplus—how many years will we be waiting around to pay off the credit card? A couple of hundred years. That means that, if we had racked up this debt when Cook arrived, we would just have paid it off lately. This is so mad and it is so dangerous.


So we have come to this position now where we really have to call on the people in this chamber to be adult and start asking the serious questions, because you know what this is. It is merely a bribe. It is a completely and hopelessly unadulterated bribe. It is quite creepy the way things have disintegrated in the Labor Party. It has become so pathetic. It is quite obvious to all and sundry that there is no logic that sits behind this. There was no committee hearing. There was no peak industry body. Nobody has ever asked for this. It is just something that has been concocted on the back of an envelope, very much like the NBN—the next budget nightmare.


If you want to have just a skerrick of fiscal responsibility, a skerrick of integrity, you cannot allow these sorts of things to happen. You have to remember that the opportunity cost of the money wasted here is the hip replacement in the future. It is the dentist in the future. It is the health expenses in the future. It is the money that could be spent on people with a disability in the future. It is our defence budget in the future. These are the things that are being compromised because of this type of creepy lunacy that has come into existence with these random payments that have started floating in here.


The Australian people will take your money—of course they will. It is like the person at the hotel who shouts the bar over and over again. Of course you take the beer, but you do not respect them. You just think they are a straight-up fool. But this is what is happening with our nation. Senator Mitch Fifield here will be very interested in why this money was not in the NODES. They found the money for the creepy bonus, but they cannot find the money for the NDIS. We have reduced the money for the NDIS because we have to put it into the creepy bonus.


In closing, it is so obvious that what we are doing is bribing Australia with borrowed money. The Australian people will not respect you. The Australian people will hold you in contempt for what you have decided to do. The Australian people will hold you in contempt because the legacy of your government will impoverish the future of the cost of our future health care, our future defence and the future needs and requirements of this nation—because of your random, crazy government.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:02):  As I explained yesterday, both gross debt and net debt as a proportion of GDP peak in 2011-12. Obviously Treasury make certain assumptions about the size of the CGS as well as what the relevant interest rate will be in terms of estimating going forward. I would make this point when we talk about budget costings from those on the other side—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  You are very precious about this whenever anybody mentions the fact that you have no credibility when it comes to the budget, that your economic team keeps delivering mistake after mistake after mistake. 



Senator Cormann interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Senator Cormann clearly keeps betting. You always have to take a point of order because you do not want anybody to know. It is very, very precious, isn't it!




Senator Cormann:
  Mr President, on a point of order: I cannot see how the minister's abuse can in any way be directly relevant to the question. My question was why the government has to pay more interest on its debt in 2015-16 than in 2012-13 when they are telling us they will have surpluses over this period. I want to know very specifically, from the minister, whether the government expect government borrowings to go up or whether they expect interest rates to go up or whether they expect both to go up. That is the specific question, and none of the minister's answer so far were directly relevant to the question.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I believe the minister has been addressing the question. The minister has a minute and 15 seconds remaining.




Senator WONG:
  Thank you, Mr President. It is the case, if Senator Cormann considers the budget papers—and I assume he has—that there is an increase in 2015-16 in the net interest payment line. This is due to the maturing of a Treasury index bond line in that year. In that year all of the capitalised indexation of the principal is accounted for as interest and this adds to the net interest in that year over and above what normal interest on those bonds would be. This is explained in the budget papers at page 714.


We have laid out our path to surplus. We have demonstrated how we will grow the surplus over time every year of the forward estimates.

  Thank you, Mr President. Those opposite should tell the Australian people how many schools and hospitals they will close to fill their $70 billion black hole. They are now locked into a pledge for a surplus of one per cent of GDP this year. A $15 billion surplus is what they said. You would have to pay no Medicare next year.

Quite clearly the regard with which former Treasurer Costello holds the current economic team on that side of the chamber is demonstrated by his desire to return, his desire to ride again, his desire to get back into this place, because he knows those on the other side are incapable of putting a budget bottom line together.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research (Senator Evans) to questions without notice asked by Senators Payne and Fifield today relating to the 2012-13 Budget.


It is genuinely with a heavy heart that I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Evans. I think colleagues in the chamber will know that I have, as far as possible, in the disabilities portfolio, sought to bring a non-partisan approach, for the simple reason that people with disabilities are not interested in petty point-scoring; they just want the system fixed.


The Productivity Commission did some very good work in analysing what would be required to meet the unmet needs for Australians with disability, and the concept of the National Disability Insurance Scheme is what they came forth with. It is something that has been embraced by all political parties in this place. The Prime Minister has, over not just recent weeks but many months—indeed, particularly during the leadership ructions on the other side—spoken a great deal about the importance of and need for a National Disability Insurance Scheme. Those who listened the Prime Minister's words could have been forgiven for taking the impression that the Prime Minister had in fact fully committed to a national disability insurance scheme. In this portfolio I have endeavoured to give the government the benefit of the doubt.


The reason for my question to Senator Evans was to inquire as to why the timetable announced by the government, and the funding profile announced by the government in the budget, differed from that of the Productivity Commission. I thought that was a reasonable question to ask. I did not see it as a partisan question or a political one. It is a question that is being asked in the sector and in the community, and there was no answer forthcoming.


A few weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition and I held a joint press conference where we said that we expected there to be money in the budget for a national disability insurance scheme and, if there was, we would support it. We went further, though, and said that a national disability insurance scheme should be above partisan politics. The Leader of the Opposition and I proposed a mechanism to ensure that a national disability insurance scheme was beyond politics. Senator Evans made reference to our only policy being a committee. He was misrepresenting our commitment. We have proposed a bipartisan committee of the parliament to be co-chaired by the disabilities frontbenchers of both the government and the opposition. That committee would have the purpose of oversighting the implementation of a national disability insurance scheme, for the reason that, when you look at the Productivity Commission's time frame, the implementation of an NDIS will span many parliaments and several elections and, no doubt, maybe a change of government or two. We thought it important to propose a mechanism that could ensure that all parties were locked in to supporting the delivery of an NDIS and, more than that, that there was a forum where questions about the implementation of an NDIS could be posed in a way that they would not be seen to be partisan or political and where legitimate questions that parliamentarians should ask could be asked in a forum where they would be seen for what they were: questions designed to help improve the implementation of an NDIS.


It is a matter of great regret that the Prime Minister has not accepted the offer of a joint parliamentary committee. It is an idea that has been very well received in the sector and that many families who have someone with a disability and many organisations that provide support in the disability sector would like to see. It is a matter of great regret that the government has not taken up the proposal of a non-partisan parliamentary committee to oversight the implementation and delivery of an NDIS.


I regret that Minister Evans did not provide an answer as to the government's thinking about the implementation and rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. But we will continue to ask those questions, not in a spirit of partisanship, but because these are legitimate questions that people in the sector want asked and are entitled to have answers to.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (15:10):  I rise to take note of the answer of Senator Evans in response to questions from Senator Fifield. I guess that when this week started I was, as one can well imagine, interested to know whether the Liberal team in the Senate would be focusing on the budget, on the Speaker of the House of Representatives or perhaps focusing on the member for Dobell. Yes, there were plenty of political challenges for us to contemplate. But I have not been disappointed, because the Liberal Party have come into this place utterly focused on their mission, which was to have a fight amongst themselves over who could be the Opposition Whip. Once again the Liberal Party have completely missed the debates and opportunities of the week and have remained completely tied up in their own irrelevant and infantile fighting.


What we once referred to as 'Minchin's militia' appear to have now become 'Mitch's militia'.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Firstly, can you address remarks concerning Senator Fifield by using his name. Senator Fifield, I was going to ask Senator Feeney to come back to the matter before the chamber, but, as you are standing, do you have an additional point of order?




Senator FIFIELD:
  I was going to raise relevance on a point of order.




Senator FEENEY:
  This is the taking note debate, Mitch. Have a seat and argue it.




Senator Fifield:
  Traditionally there has been latitude given in taking note debates, but Senator Feeney is not straying even remotely close to discussing the government's position on an NDIS or on housing and homelessness. I ask you to draw him back to the answers Senator Evans provided.




Senator Wong:
  On the point of order, a habit is occurring on the opposition benches where every time a senator in the course of a debate might be critical of the opposition they jump up and take a point on relevance. It is taking sookiness to a new level. They like to dish it out but they cannot take it.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Feeney, you were given a bit of latitude to stray into the debate. You did not go anywhere near the matter and I remind the chamber that the question was very specific. Sometimes the questions are wide ranging; taking note of answers of all ministers on the day. Senator Fifield rose 'To take note of the answers given by Senator Evans to the question he asked'. We can have some latitude, Senator Feeney, but not that much latitude—and Senator Payne.




Senator FEENEY:
  I will bring myself to the question before us: the Liberal Party's commitment to the NDIS. It was only a very short time ago that the shadow Treasurer, the thinking man's Clive Palmer, was giving a speech in London. To impress his Conservative friends, safely, so he believed, beyond the realm of political scrutiny, he gave a hairy-chested speech about ending the culture of entitlement. To be fair to Senator Fifield, he has not come into this place talking about ending the culture of entitlement. He has instead come here and talked about setting up a committee. His are the tactics of delay and dissimulation. At least he has not had the viciousness of Hockey.


This boils down to the fact the Labor Party and the Labor government have managed a budget that has not only come back into surplus but, amongst its many reforms and achievements, has delivered action on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This of course is a mighty achievement. It is a mighty achievement and it is understood to be such by all of those in the sector. Of course, confronted with this mighty achievement, the opposition have constructed not a response but a fig leaf, a stratagem—and their stratagem is to have a committee, chairs, co-chairs and presidents and vice-presidents and convenors and co-convenors, and this grand group, spanning Mitch's timeline of hundreds of years—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order!




Senator FEENEY:
  We have Senator Fifield's 100-year plan for action on disability insurance, spanning many parliaments and many changes of government, covering the years and the aeons. His is a program which leaves Fabian gradualism looking like a revolutionary movement. No doubt the Liberal Party has sent Senator Fifield into this place to defend his fig leaf, because in the Liberal Party's ERC there are challenges which are beyond human imagination. They have not only to meet the very real contest of a Labor budget in surplus but also they are increasingly under pressure to explain how their $70 billion black hole might be brought under some kind of rein. When they contemplate the challenge of their $70 billion black hole, I can just imagine the sympathy Senator Fifield will receive from his colleagues when he suggests that the coalition needs to match the Labor government's action through the National Disability Insurance Scheme. My heart goes out to him—his task is nigh on impossible. Not only is their ERC populated by economically illiterate members of this place and elsewhere; there is poor old Senator Sinodinos trying to bring order to this madness, and Senator Fifield himself must now front up to the parliament with his own inspirational multiparty committee and generational change over the span of centuries. 


This government is very proud of the fact that it has come up with a plan that is real, a plan that is embraced by the sector and a plan that means real reform—and it is a plan that is funded. It is a plan that does not involve a committee; it involves changing people's lives. It is not a plan that involves bipartisan co-convenors; it is a plan that actually means people have real transformation in their challenges, their carers, their lives—




Senator Fifield:
  I'll be circulating your speech, don't worry about that—




Senator Payne:
  Are you talking to us about bipartisan co-convenors?

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (15:17):  I also rise to speak on the motion that the Senate take note of answers given to questions asked today by Senator Fifield and me. I am not quite sure where Planet Feeney is located, but it does not surprise me at all that Senator Feeney is unable to understand bipartisan co-convenors—after all, that would not quite work with the Victorian factional system of the ALP.




Senator Feeney:
  How is yours going?




Senator PAYNE:
  Mine is actually doing quite well, thanks. Minister Evans made the observation in his response to my question that everyone assumes that if there is not a new measure in a budget you are doing something wrong. I want to correct that misapprehension by Senator Evans. It is not just the budget that has persuaded us that this government is doing something wrong. Try for example, as I said in my question, the fact that 2011 was the second straight year in which dwelling commencements fell in this country in four consecutive quarters. Even those opposite should be able to work out that that means eight consecutive quarters. We have a housing shortage currently at approximately 186,800, but that is set to go beyond 300,000 by 2014, and a government that apparently thinks the best way to deal with housing affordability is to rely on the Reserve Bank. So it is unsurprising that it is not just the budget that persuades us that there is something wrong but, more importantly, the government's approach on all of these issues.


This budget has done nothing to boost housing supply or housing affordability; it has done nothing to further reduce the risk or incidence of homelessness. You only have to read the minister's press release from budget night to persuade yourself of that. We have building activity down, we have rents that are rising faster than inflation and we have from this government no vision for the housing sector. If you throw into that mix the carbon tax, which is going to increase the cost of building an average home by at least $5,200 even after compensation, according to the Housing Industry Association's figures, it is no wonder that we and the sector and most of the participants in the sector are seriously concerned about the approach that this government is taking. 


I will leave housing there for the moment because I do want to make some reference to the answer from the minister on the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the performance by Senator Feeney on that issue. This is one of the few policy proposals put forward by a pretty desperate government that has had bipartisan support, and I congratulate my colleague Senator Fifield for the work that he has done across the sector, across Australia, to engage with stakeholders and to work constructively on this issue and have some capacity to understand how important it is. Clearly, from the paltry offering of Senator Feeney, they over there do not understand this issue. Senator Feeney's dismissal of the idea that the matter is important enough for this parliament to have a jointly overseeing parliamentary committee, his wave of the hand and his suggestion that this was somehow a fanciful idea, is indicative of his contempt for the issue we have been discussing this afternoon following Minister Evans's answer on the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


It is what the government promised but has not delivered that should embarrass this government. I am not sure that I can understand the logic of them saying they have delivered 25 per cent of what the Productivity Commission recommended and brought it forward a year, so somehow that means they have done a good thing. The Productivity Commission's report on the National Disability Insurance Scheme was one of the most thorough and comprehensive approaches to this particularly important issue for Australians that could possibly have been taken. The government, by showing contempt for that report and that initiative, is selling itself and Australia's people with disabilities short. They have let down Australians with a disability, they have let down their families and they have let down their carers.


This will not address anywhere near the number of people the Productivity Commission proposed it should, which was 400,000 Australians. The government's announced scheme will only extend to 20,000 Australians. One hopes that there will be an explanation from the government—an adequate explanation as opposed to the inadequate one we were offered this afternoon—as to why they have taken this approach. We hope that they will do the sector the courtesy it deserves by offering that explanation not just to the parliament but to them. Based on the budget figures, as Senator Fifield said, there is no way that full implementation of the scheme by 2018 will happen. (Time expired)

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:22):  I am a little disappointed but I am not surprised. Normally Senator Payne makes a reasonable contribution to this chamber, but to come in here and try to lecture this government about homelessness and housing and the cost of living is a bit rich. We cannot let those opposite get away with that without mentioning that they had 12 years in government and did nothing.


Homelessness was put on the agenda by the Labor government. If you are really concerned about the cost of living and the cost of housing, why did you, only this morning, vote against a measure which was going to support families in educating their kids? By voting against the schoolkids bonus not only yesterday in that other place but here in this chamber today, you again demonstrated your inconsistency and your lack of appreciation of how difficult it is for families out there to educate their kids and of how well received this bonus is going to be in the community. It is becoming part of everyday debate in this place—those from the other side coming in to lecture us about what we have not done. But they fail to acknowledge that for 12 years they were in government. 


They lecture us about the disability sector. But throughout all the time I spent on the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, throughout all the committee inquiries we had while those on the other side were in government—inquiries in which they participated—they were not prepared to make the tough decisions. We have made those decisions. We have embarked on a scheme which is going to address the needs of those in our community who have disabilities and the needs of their families. But we are not even sure, when push comes to shove, that Joe Hockey and those opposite are actually going to support this scheme. 


We have already, in this budget, allocated $1 billion over the next four years to introduce this scheme. We are not going to rush in without consulting—we are going to make sure that the reform is going to address the areas of critical need. People with disabilities, their carers and their families have waited a long time, but at least we have taken the action. We have actually put it in our budget. 


In talking about the budget, it is interesting to note the misinformation about what is or is not in the budget which is constantly circulated. I will just touch on one example because I think it is important to correct the record. Yesterday, the media were running with a story put out by those on the opposite side that we had failed to allocate money in the budget for the Freight Equalisation Scheme—totally untrue.




Senator Fifield:
  What has the Freight Equalisation Scheme got to do with the answers Senator Evans gave on the Disability Insurance Scheme and housing?




Senator POLLEY:
  It is important because we are talking about the budget, Senator Fifield. The budget is not just about the NDIS and it is not just about housing. It is interesting because you do not want to mention the credit that has been given to the budget from organisations like the Tasma­nian Farmers and Graziers Association. Their chief executive, Jan Davis, said:


Additional funds for biosecurity and natural resource management activities were particularly welcome.


I know the Deputy President, coming from Tasmania, would appreciate that we do not always get the support of the TFGA. But, once again, that is not something that has been mentioned in this debate about the budget. 


Another thing that Senator Parry, who now resides in Launceston, will appreciate is the money which has been allocated from this budget to the Launceston City Council to develop their strategy in all-encompassing transport and infrastructure planning for the future—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, I will draw your attention to the question before the chamber at the moment.




Senator POLLEY:
  I think, Mr Deputy President, that when we are talking about the budget, there are a broad range of related issues—and, from listening to other contributions this afternoon, I think I am being consistent with other speakers in traversing some of those issues.


But I am very happy to get back to the NDIS because it is, after all, something which is close to my heart, as it is for many in the Tasmanian community. As I said earlier, it is essential that we get the scheme right for people with disabilities, their families and their carers. The full scheme should be rolled out based on a properly tested design. The lessons we learn as we deliver this first stage will inform our conversations with the states and territories on the national rollout of a national disability insurance scheme. 


We are actually putting the money in. We are proud, as a Labor government, that we have actioned this very crucial and important piece of reform. I am hoping that those opposite will stop playing politics with this, get behind the scheme and support it. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:28):  Never has Senator Polley uttered a truer word than when she said that the Gillard government has put homelessness on the agenda. You can be assured that this budget, which taxes and taxes Australians and which sends Australian jobs overseas, means that people with mortgages will have their mortgages foreclosed upon—creating homelessness. Homelessness is something the Labor Party knows about because they create it. When this budget sends Australian jobs overseas, closes down coalmines, closes down the jobs of many Australians—and even the government in its shonky budget is forecasting an increase in unemployment—you can be assured that Australians will get to know about homelessness. 


I now only have 55 seconds to speak in this debate. It is typical of the Labor Party—everything is guillotined. We had the fiasco this morning of the parliament spending hundreds of millions of dollars after only a couple of hours debate and no real consultation whatsoever. On this important subject of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, we are left with only a couple of minutes of debate because the Labor Party has again curtailed and guillotined proper debate in this chamber.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:31):  At the request of Senator Fifield, I move:


That the Senate notes the 2012-13 Federal Budget does nothing to strengthen the Australian economy in the face of storm clouds on the global horizon, as it:


   (a)   fails to cut spending;


   (b)   increases taxes;


   (c)   lifts the debt ceiling to $300 billion; and


   (d)   imposes the world's largest carbon tax.


Before I move into the debate, may I associate myself with the remarks by senators around the chamber wishing Senator Sherry well for his future. I am sure that, given his expertise in the areas of superannuation and retirement planning, he would have planned well for what lies ahead. May I also congratulate him for the enormous contribution that he has made to the public policy areas of financial services and superannuation in particular.


Every single year, as the Treasurer, Mr Swan, has been about to deliver a budget, he has made commentary in the media about what a budget it would be. There is one word that he has used to describe it—that word was word 'tough'. 'It will be a tough budget' he said of the 2008-09 budget, for 2009-10 and again for 2010-11—and he has said it now for 2012-13. Of course none of them, not a single Labor budget delivered by the current Treasurer, Mr Swan, has been a tough budget. They have all been typical Labor budgets, that is true—with excessive spending, massive new taxes and increased levels of debt and deficit. This is a government that inherited a very strong economic and fiscal position. This is a government that inherited a strong budget position: a budget with no government net debt, with a $22 billion surplus, with $60 billion in reserves in the Future Fund. And it is, of course, a government that, rather than having to pay interest to service the debt, was receiving interest payments. Not only was there no government net debt, the coalition had put successive surpluses into the Future Fund in order to make provision for the unfunded superannuation liability of the Public Service.


This budget really has been very disappointing, because we face significant economic storm clouds on the global horizon. The events in Europe this past weekend, which are likely to continue to develop in the weeks ahead, do raise a significant concern. Clearly, the global economy is in a pretty precarious situation right now and, because of the actions of the Labor government over the past 4½ years, Australia is in a weaker position to face those challenges than it should be. This government spends way too much money, way too quickly. Yes, we are in a stronger position compared with other parts of the world—of course, because we started out in a much stronger position. This government says, 'Look, our government net debt is expected to peak at 9.6 per cent of GDP, which is much less than in most other parts of the world.' That is true, but we started with zero per cent of government net debt! And when you start from zero per cent going into a crisis you are not going to be at the same level as those countries that started with 60, 70 or 80 per cent of government net debt as a percentage of their GDPs.


In this budget we have more wasteful spending, more new taxes, more debt—there has been a significant cooking of the books—and, yet again, the government wants to lift the debt ceiling. We just have to remember: this is now the third time the government has asked to lift the debt ceiling. Not so long ago the debt ceiling was $75 billion. The government said, 'Well, because of the global financial crisis we have to increase it to $200 billion.' Then in last year's budget the government said that it wanted to increase it to $250 billion. Now we are being asked to lift the debt ceiling yet again, to $300 billion. You have to wonder why a government that is promising surplus after surplus over the current forward estimates would want the parliament to give it another blank cheque, to increase the amount of money that this government can put on the nation's credit card to $300 billion. In talking to this motion I also want to deal with a particular myth that the Treasurer, Mr Swan, has been perpetuating in recent times. This myth is that somehow the reason we have this massive deficit again this financial year, this $44.4 billion deficit this financial year, is that revenue has collapsed. Whenever the budget position deteriorates, rather than looking at what happened with excessive spending and rather than looking at how we can cut spending, show more restraint and live within our means, this government collectively throws its hands up in the air and says, 'Oh, revenue has collapsed.' That is not entirely true. I point you to the 2009-10 budget and what the government's expectations were then as to what would happen in 2011-12, because 2011-12 was at that time part of the budget forward estimates cycle. They thought the deficit this financial year would be $44.5 billion. Guess what! We were told in the budget on Tuesday that the deficit this financial year will be $44.4 billion. So, back in May 2009 the Treasurer was pretty close to the mark as to where we would end up.


The problem is that in the lead-up to the last election he wanted to create the illusion that somehow we were back on track on the path towards a surplus. He wanted people to believe that things were going to be better than he thought, back in May 2009, they would be. Of course, just before the election we were told in the updated economic and fiscal outlook and in the pre-election economic fiscal outlook that the deficit in 2011-12 would be $10.4 billion. So, instead of what we were told in May 2009, namely, that the deficit this financial year would be $44.5 billion, in order to make it look like significant progress had been made the Treasurer told the Australian people, 'Look at this; we are doing well. The deficit is not going to be $44.5 billion after all; it is going to be $10.4 billion, and in 2012-13 we are going to have a surplus.'


The important fact I want to point you to is the revenue and expense forecast given in the budget the Treasurer delivered in May 2009. In May 2009, Mr Swan, the Treasurer, told us that he expected revenue in 2011-12—this financial year—to be $310.2 billion. Guess how much the revenue actually is in 2011? I invite anyone to help the chamber out. I will tell you what it actually is—it is $330 billion. Revenue in this financial year is $20 billion higher than the Treasurer, Mr Swan, told the Australian people, back in May 2009, it would be. So, rather than have a deterioration in the revenue outlook, he has actually had a $20 billion windfall compared with what he thought just three years ago. He has actually had a significant improvement in the budget bottom line in terms of revenue estimates.


Revenue has gone up by $20 billion, but what happened to the expenses side? And remember, it was back in May 2009 that the Treasurer told us, 'Yes, the deficit in 2011-12'—this financial year—'would be $44.5 billion.' Guess what? Expenses then were expected to be $351.9 billion. So what has happened to the expenses side? You guessed it. The expenses also went up by $20 billion. The expenses went from $351.9 billion to about $371.3 billion. That is an increase in expenses of $20 billion in that period. If the government had truly shown restraint, if the government had stuck to the spending that it expected for 2011-12, back in the 2009-10 budget, we would actually be $20 billion better off this financial year. But of course the government did not do that. More money was coming in because of all of Labor's new and increased ad hoc tax grabs. You remember them all: the mining tax, the carbon tax, the flood tax—actually they have not collected the mining tax and the carbon tax yet, but there have been 20 or 21 new or increased Labor Party taxes, starting with the alcopops tax, the condensate tax, the increase in the luxury car tax and a whole heap of other new taxes and revenue measures. But instead of using that money to balance the books to ensure they would get closer to a surplus more quickly, what did this Labor government do? They just spent it all.


This government has not only spent all of the additional revenue they did not expect back in 2009—the $20 billion of revenue they did not expect us to have this financial year when they put the budget together in 2009—but now, with the mining tax and the carbon tax, when they announced these additional multibillion dollar tax grabs, they actually spent more than those taxes were expected to raise. When the government announced the MRRT, the cost of the measures and the promises that were attached to the mining tax were billions and billions of dollars greater than the government's expected revenue from that same tax, which is of course why in this budget the government has had to scrap many of the promises that were previously attached to the mining tax. They have scrapped the cut in the company tax rate, they have scrapped the early cut in the tax rate for small companies, they have scrapped the standard deduction for individuals' work related expenses and they have scrapped the 50 per cent discount on interest income. You name it.


We always said that the mining tax was a fiscal train wreck in the making. We pointed to the fact that only the Labor Party can come up with a multibillion dollar new tax that actually leaves the budget worse off. Only the Labor Party can do that. The Treasurer has ended up with a massive black hole in what he has delivered. That black hole is the $174 billion worth of accumulated deficits over his first four budgets. That is the true black hole—the actual black hole—that is here on the table. The Labor Party likes talking about this fictitious non-existent $70 billion that the coalition supposedly has. There is no such black hole on the coalition side. But the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance, Senator Wong, would, I am sure, have read Vladimir Lenin's advice that 'a lie told often enough becomes the truth'. That is a direct quote from Vladimir Lenin. The Labor Party think that, if they keep repeating this absolute lie about a $70 billion black hole, somehow it will become the truth. Well, it is not the truth. The only truth is the truth that is there for all of us to see in the budget papers, and that is $174 billion worth of accumulated deficits. The truth that is there for all of us to see in the budget papers is that government net debt was zero dollars and it is now heading towards $145 billion. That is what it is heading for now. The real black hole is that $145 billion on which this government now have to pay interest. Of course the interest that this government have to pay on the debt that they have accumulated since they became the government totals nearly $30 billion over the forward estimates—nearly $30 billion in interest payments to service the debt that this government have accumulated since they came to power. How many good things could we do with $30 billion if we did not have to spend it on servicing the debt that this bad Labor government have accumulated over the 4½ years they have been in government? 


The Treasurer wants us to believe that everything is going to be different next year. We had a deficit in 2008-09, we had a deficit in 2009-10, we had a deficit in 2010-11 and we have a deficit in 2011-12. The deficit this financial year is $34 billion worse than we were told just before the election, yet somehow the government wants us to believe that next year, miraculously, nothing is going to happen to this $1.5 billion surplus. How are they achieving this surplus? They assume that revenue is going to increase dramatically—revenue is going to go through the roof; we are going to have the largest increase in government revenue in the last 25 years. We are going to have an increase in government revenue of 11.8 per cent. According to Treasurer Swan, government revenue is going to go up by $39 billion. Instead of collecting $330 billion, as we are this year, somehow next year we are going to collect $369 billion. It is unbelievable—an 11.8 per cent increase in government revenue. Of course that is against a background of GDP growth, according to the government, of 3¼ per cent and a reduction in our terms of trade, according to the government, of 5.75 per cent.


The last time there was growth in revenue of more than 11 per cent was back in 1987-88. We will recall that the situation back in 1987-88 was that we had GDP growth of 5.6 per cent and we had an improvement in the terms of trade of about 8.7 per cent. That was the background against which we had a growth in revenue of more than 11 per cent. It is quite difficult to achieve a growth in revenue of 11 per cent. The Treasurer knows two things. He knows, firstly, that it is highly unlikely that he will ever have to be accountable for the delivery of the final budget outcome. After September 2013, given the current political trends, even he would accept that there is only a slim chance that he will have to defend the performance of the government against budget, so he is reasonably safe in putting wildly optimistic revenue assumptions into the budget. Secondly, even if the Treasurer is still the Treasurer in September 2013, do you know what he will do? He will bring out the trick that he comes out with every single time and say, 'Shock, horror—revenue has collapsed, revenue has fallen away; we thought that revenue would increase by 11.8 per cent'—even though that was based on completely unrealistic expectations—'and we thought that we were going to have a $39 billion increase in revenue from 2011-12 to 2012-13, but it did not happen. It is somebody else's fault: nothing to do with our massive increases in spending, nothing to do with our wasteful spending, nothing to do with the fact that we treat taxpayers' money with absolute contempt, nothing to do with the fact that we cannot wait to shuffle $500 million out the door before 30 June, in the next six weeks, by bringing spending forward from 2012-13 into this financial year.'


By the way, I make this point to the Treasurer: shifting expenditure from the next financial year into this financial year is not a spending cut next financial year—it is cooking the books. It is trying to create the illusion of a surplus in 2012-13 where there is none. If people in corporate Australia used the accounting standards that this Treasurer and this government live by, they would be locked up. People in corporate Australia would not be allowed to fiddle the accounts the way this Treasurer has been fiddling them in recent weeks.


In the middle of all this we have the carbon tax. 'Carbon tax' is a term that the Treasurer dare not speak. In his whole 11-page speech bringing down the budget he never really engaged with the issue that supposedly is this big achievement and this big policy challenge that this government has confronted, and that is the government's approach to climate change. I was interested to read in the Financial Review today that former Labor leader Mark Latham was similarly surprised that a government that is supposedly so proud of its achievement of imposing a carbon tax on the Australian people did not have more to say in the budget speech on why it is doing what it is doing with the carbon tax—a carbon tax which will push up the cost of everything, which will make us less competitive internationally, which will make it even more expensive to do business in Australia, which will shift jobs and emissions overseas and which of course will do nothing for the environment although it will impose sacrifices on everyday Australians by pushing up their cost of electricity and their cost of living.


The reason the Treasurer did not say more about it is that increasingly people inside the Labor Party are embarrassed about what the government is doing; increasingly people inside the Labor Party understand that what they are doing is inappropriate, that they are going to hurt Australians through increased cost-of-living pressures without doing anything beneficial for the environment in return. Ministers in the Labor cabinet are briefing the media that they think they should scrap the carbon tax, we have had Kristina Keneally saying that we should scrap the carbon tax and we have backbenchers coming out and saying that too. When we are the government and we rescind the carbon tax, I am convinced that the Labor Party will sit side by side with us to make sure we get rid of this toxic tax.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,MOTIONS,17,1,speech
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2012-05-10,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:52):  I was really interested to hear Senator Cormann quote Lenin. What did he quote from Lenin? 'A lie told often enough becomes truth.' I thought he was talking about Tony Abbott, because the lies from the coalition about climate change, government debt and the global financial crisis are repeated time and time again in an attempt to try and make them truth. But they have failed.


If you want to quote Lenin, let me quote someone who did not achieve quite the international standing of Lenin—Robert Menzies. In a broadcast on 24 July 1942, when he was talking about his Liberal creed, Menzies said:


Nothing could be worse for democracy than to adopt the practice of permitting knowledge to be overthrown by ignorance.


Yet time and time again we see ignorance overthrowing knowledge on the opposite side. There are many in the coalition who understand the science of climate change, who understand the physics of climate change, but allow ignorance to overthrow both the science and the physics for short-term political advantage.


Menzies went on to say:


Fear can never be a proper or useful ingredient in those mutual relations of respect and good-will which ought to exist between the elector and the elected.


We have just heard a breakdown in that goodwill from Senator Cormann. The appeal to fear in his speech is typical of the coalition. They run fear campaigns on the budget, on climate change and on the global financial crisis—they are just totally consumed with fear campaigns. They should listen to what their spiritual leader Robert Menzies said about fear never being a proper or useful ingredient in mutual relations.



Senator Humphries interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  As soon as you mention Robert Menzies and you start to identify what is supposedly the creed of the coalition, coalition senators get all antsy and uptight because they know exactly what Menzies was saying and they know that the Menzies creed is being destroyed, day in and day out, by the coalition under Tony Abbott. They know that there is no Liberal creed anymore. It is no wonder the coalition get all upset about being quoted the words of their spiritual leader—they are so far away from Robert Menzies, they are so far away from their spiritual leader, that they cannot sit quietly and listen to his words. They know they have rejected the creed and philosophy of Robert Menzies.


In that July 1942 broadcast, Menzies went on to say:


And so, as we think about it we shall find more and more how disfiguring a thing fear is in our own political and social life.


We have just witnessed from Senator Cormann a supposed analysis of the Labor government's budget, an analysis based on fear. What else did Robert Menzies say back in 1942? He said:


A political party must never be a party which chronically says ""No.""


This is the man who established the philosophy of the Liberal Party and he says you should never chronically say no. What is Tony Abbott about now if not chronically saying no to every issue? Menzies continued:


If it never loses sight of its own ideas, it will be positive and creative.


Where are the positive aspects of the coalition? They are nowhere to be seen. Where is the creativity of the coalition? It is nowhere to be seen. The coalition is about fear and negativity. That is the creed of the coalition in this parliament—fear and negativity.


Robert Menzies went on to say:


In brief, Australian Liberalism must present itself as the party of action, and the party of the future. We are not the ANTI party, but the PRO party.


I cannot see what the Liberal party or the coalition stand for. I know what they are against. They are against pricing carbon—when they were for it under John Howard. They are against spending government money to keep people in jobs. They are the anti party, the party that Robert Menzies said they should not be. They should not be the party of fear, he said, but they have become the party which promulgates fear, day in and day out and in every speech. Senator Cormann's speech was typical of the fear campaigns being mounted by the coalition.


Listen to your spiritual leader. He was not that great but at least he had the right idea on some of these issues. You should not promulgate fear, you should not promulgate negativity—you should actually have ideas of your own. But you have lost that capacity under the leadership of Tony Abbott. And what is this motion, which I oppose, saying? It says there are 'storm clouds on the global horizon'. At last, the coalition have actually lifted up their eyes from their own bootlaces, looked around the world and decided there are problems in the global economy! They have actually done it. I was shocked when I read the resolution, because since 2008 they have been denying that there is a global financial crisis. I remember senators on the other side describing it as the 'North American crisis'—




Senator Back:
  North Atlantic.




Senator CAMERON:
  Go back and check Senator Bushby's statements on the record. So there was no global financial crisis according to them. When you look at their analysis—and I use the word loosely; I use the word 'loosely' about anything Senator Cormann says—you cannot find any talk of the global financial crisis. They say, 'We went from a surplus to deficit,' as if nothing had happened in the global economy, as if banks were not collapsing all around the world, as if governments were not propping up banks around the world, as if multimillions of workers were not losing their jobs around the world, as if industry had continued to invest as they had been investing prior to 2008, as if investment in the global economy had not dried up. In 2008 the Lehman Brothers and the global financial crisis were not in the lexicon of the coalition. They try and wipe it out, as if it had never happened.


That is why I was so surprised to see some recognition from the coalition that there was something happening globally and that there was a problem that governments around the world had to deal with. By the way, welcome to the real world; you have actually got there! There are problems out there, problems that governments all around the world have been trying to deal with and issues that you have been trying to pretend are not there.


Senator Fifield's motion says there are these 'storm clouds on the global horizon'. Well, big storm clouds have been around for a long time, and they are not on the horizon; they have been here since 2008. The Labor government have been dealing with them in a way that every other government around the world wishes they could have dealt with them—with speed, efficiency and effectiveness, and in a timely, targeted and temporary manner. That is what we did during the global financial crisis. We also underpinned 210,000 jobs in this economy. And what did the coalition say at the time? They said, 'We should just wait and see.' And who were they echoing? They were echoing former US President Herbert Hoover, who basically said 'do nothing' on the advice of the Hayekian economists of the time. 'Do nothing. The market will fix this if you just let the market take the time to resolve this. Government should stay out of it and everything will be okay.' Everybody knows that was a nonsense. Everybody knows there had to be Keynesian stimulus to bring economies back to some kind of normality. Everybody knows that that was what had to happen. Yet the coalition were arguing that we should just 'wait and see' what happened. If we had waited to see what happened, 210,000 jobs would have been lost; communities, workers and families around this country would have been devastated; government debt would have been far greater than it is now; and this economy would have been struggling to recover. Instead, we are the envy of the world. We are an economy with a AAA rating, something the Howard government could never get across all of the rating agencies. We are a government that put in place, as I said, in a timely, targeted and temporary manner, initiatives to keep this country running.


Those opposite then go on to say, 'How dare you lift the debt ceiling to $300 billion?' I am always amused when Senator Joyce gets up to talk about debt, because he was the shadow finance minister who probably lasted the shortest period of any shadow finance minister in history. I am glad Senator Sinodinos nods and agrees with me.




Senator Sinodinos:
  No, I don't.




Senator CAMERON:
  I thought I had better have a look at what Senator Joyce was saying, because I am not an economist. I know Senator Joyce says he is an accountant—I would not trust him with the limited accounts I have!—while I am only a humble fitter and machinist. So I went back and had a look at this debt issue. The best advice I could get was from the Budget Policy Division of the Australian Treasury—not a bad place to go, Senator Sinodinos; what do you reckon? That is where you should go to get some advice. I know you were there during your time. I know John Howard went there. I do not think Peter Costello went there very often, because he was not very successful. They had an internal paper for discussion within the Treasury, and it says:


Understanding debt and its historical trends is important, as the level of debt provides one measure of the strength of public finances. Levels of public sector borrowing fluctuate in line with the economic cycle and the budget position. This paper briefly describes the various measures of debt and trends in government borrowing.


That is from the experts. This is the experts in Treasury talking about government debt. And what do we hear from Senator Joyce, the shortest lived shadow finance spokesman in the history of the coalition? He keeps talking about gross debt. So what do the experts say about gross debt? They say:


Gross debt represents a portion of the total liability a government owes to creditors.


It tells you what the main component is and says:


While the gross debt measure provides information on government finances, it is only a partial indicator.


You would agree, Senator Sinodinos, those are the facts—it is only a partial indicator. You could not argue against that. It goes on:


Gross debt does not incorporate amounts that are owed to government by other parties. Also governments, like an individual or businesses, hold assets which can be sold to meet their financial obligations. To capture the asset side of the equation, net debt needs to be considered.


It goes on:


Net debt is the most commonly quoted and well-known measure of a government’s financial strength.


I never heard even Peter Costello, with all his failings, foibles and weakness, talk about gross debt. I never heard John Howard talk about gross debt. I heard them talk about net debt and net debt is what all economists look at; it is what governments around the world look at; it is what the IMF looks at; it is what the OECD looks at. And the Treasury officials say:


Compared with gross debt, net debt is a better measure of a government’s overall indebtedness as it also captures the amount of debt owed to the government.


So when you see Senator Joyce stand up, you have to understand that he is an accountant—my view would be he is not a very good one. He is not an economist. You should rely on the experts. Then in the Treasury paper A history of public debt in Australia, by Katrina Di Marco, Mitchell Pirie and Wilson Au-Yeung—they are the ones who know what they are talking about, not Senator Joyce—they say:


The case of Japan most clearly illustrates how only considering gross debt can result in a skewed interpretation of government finances. 


Skewed interpretations is what the coalition want the public to look at—not honesty but a skewed interpretation. They say that, if you looked at that, the gross debt measure for Japan is 173 per cent. They go on to say:


Canada, which has a comparable amount of gross debt to France, Germany and the US, has a significantly lower level of net debt—


So you cannot look at gross debt and Senator Joyce needs to understand this. We get told we should run the government like a business. We had better not run it like Fortescue Metals, like Twiggy Forrest, with a total debt of $5.997 billion and a total equity of $3.141 billion. What is the debt to equity ratio for Twiggy? It is 190 per cent. I know Senator Cormann is very close to Twiggy. I know Senator Cormann would do anything the mining industry tells him to do, but when he comes in here and lectures us about debt he should understand that the people he is arguing for have debt to equity ratios of 190-plus per cent. So do not lecture us about this.


Senator Sinodinos was a key government adviser. What did we end with after the period of the Howard government? We had a failure of investment in this country, with less than two-thirds of profits reinvested. We had a failure of innovation, with among the lowest R&D innovation in the world. We had productivity declining, at the bottom of the OECD. We had a failure of development. We had elaborately transformed manufactures diving. We had a failure of balance. The balance was all about putting in Work Choices to try to crash workers down to increase productivity through lower wages; it does not work, Senator Sinodinos, and you were up there. And we had a failure of sustainability. Even though you were advising, and former Prime Minister John Howard was advised to do something about climate change, it never happened. The best we got was a $10 billion investment in the Murray and that was done without even going to cabinet—the ministers did not know anything about it. So do not lecture us about credibility. You have none.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,MOTIONS,17,1,speech
"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-05-10,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (17:12):  What do you say about a contribution like that except that it was relentless negativity? You accuse the opposition of negativity but we get relentless negativity from the government. Senator Cameron, my advice to you is to stick to fitting and turning. Senator Bob Carr, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on Lateline talked about the 'nattering nabobs of negativity'. I think it was you he had in mind, Senator Cameron. I will come back to your contribution in a little while.


May I commend Senator Cormann on his remarks on this motion, because at the end of the budget week we have a chance to reflect on what we have seen and heard this whole week. I believe this budget will be remembered for being one with no coherent economic strategy, which fails to deliver economic growth or sustainable budget surpluses or to tackle debt in a sustainable way. This is a budget in which the Prime Minister is on her knees seeking forgiveness from the Australian people over the carbon tax. We see this through the relentless procession of the further handouts in this budget—the sugar-hit payments like the new schoolkids' bonus and the further increase in family tax benefit part A and other benefits for households. No-one argues that households do not deserve benefits, but to keep her faith with the Australian people over compensation and to try to improve the compensation, she has had to break a series of other promises and reverse positions on a whole history of matters.


Labor has dumped its promised company tax cut. Remember how much the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, made of the importance of company tax cuts to improve our competitiveness in the region? They talked about the fact that our company tax rate was out of kilter with those of the region. Ken Henry produced a whole report in which he argued about the need to reduce company tax rates by five percentage points in order to make us more comparable and competitive in the region. Ken Henry knows, business knows and observers know that today we do not benchmark or compare ourselves against the US, the UK or Europe; today for us the competition is in the emerging economies and in Asia. So we have to benchmark our tax against them and take measures to improve our competitiveness and productivity. Here we have a situation where the Prime Minister under pressure, fearing the reception to the carbon tax on 1 July, was forced to make further changes to compensation and that is why she translated these company tax cuts into further measures focused on households. 


In the process of trying to bring in a surplus budget the government has broken its promise on foreign aid spending. There has been much argy bargy about that in this place. The reality is that the government has deferred its commitment on foreign aid and in the process saved $3 billion or $4 billion dollars over the forward estimates. You could justify that on budgetary grounds, but you do not need to keep denying that you have done it—just accept that you have done it. We have seen both the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this house appearing to obfuscate and not accept that reality. If there is one thing that this government will be remembered for, it is that capacity not to admit that something has been reversed—accept it, take it on the chin and move on. Instead they seek to rationalise, justify and obfuscate.


In her promise of seeking to achieve a surplus budget, the Prime Minister broke her commitment, her solemn promise, to increase the funding for our defence forces by three per cent in real terms per annum. Instead there has been a cut of a further $5.5 billion to defence, a total of $8 billion of cuts to defence over the last two budgets. Labor has cut defence spending as a proportion of GDP to historically low levels. It is almost three years since we had the defence white paper. I was involved as deputy chairman of the consultative committee that went out to consult the community about what we do about defence. It is good that the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence has joined us. I was part of that committee and a report was put together—a report which promoted the need for adequate defence spending and with a particular flow-on to defence industry. In one fell swoop, or a couple of fell swoops if you include the last budget, the government has reneged on those commitments. It has left the Defence Force with very low morale, fearing that they have a minister who will not prosecute their case in cabinet and making them feel like they are taking a disproportionate share of the burden of meeting the government's surplus target. 


This does not conclude the number of flip-flops the government has undertaken in the process of trying to achieve a surplus budget. There was big talk over the last few months about the commendable agreement between the government and the opposition that we should move towards a National Disability Insurance Scheme, but in the budget, what did we get? Instead of the $3 billion or $4 billion that the Productivity Commission had indicated was appropriate for the start up of the NDIS, we got $1 billion committed over the forward estimates. It may be that the Prime Minister has some great plan that, if she wins the next election, she will come back to this issue and give us a great big infusion over the balance of the forward estimates. But, as we stand today, the commitment of this Labor government is $1 billion over the forward estimates to get this process started. Again, it is a major constituency where the Prime Minister made a big hit last week, I think it was, when she went to a big congress and announced with great fanfare, 'Don't worry, in the budget we will look after you.' Those expectations were dashed with this $1 billion over the forward estimates. Let us not forget that when the NDIS is up and running, the total additional cost on a per annum basis will be something like $6 billion to $7 billion to $8 billion per annum. That is a very big commitment that we have embarked on in this area. Again, I say she has dashed those expectations.


The Gonski review into schools education is to receive $5 million, even though Gonski put a price tag of something like around $5 billion for what needs to be done in this area. The government could have come clean and said, 'Look, we just can't afford this,' but to put in $5 million and say there will be an ongoing process of consultation and to engage in what I might describe as a kabuki dance with the states about who will provide what in this area is a great shame, because expectations have been raised and again they have been dashed. That is not all.


Every time the coalition puts out a good policy, the government steals it. There is no better example of another flip-flop or back flip than Labor allowing business to claim carry back losses of up to $1 million per annual for two years. The government criticised this very measure when it was announced by the coalition in April 2009. It was announced by that venerable stalwart of the opposition Malcolm Turnbull when he was the Leader of the Opposition. He announced that small businesses wanted to be able to carry-back tax losses, to help see them through the downturn as well, as to bring them forward. He talked about how it was a critical part of the economy. 'In these difficult times,' he said, 'small firms must be given the appropriate support to equip them to lead the economic recovery.' The govern­ment poo-pooed it; they argued against it; they said it would be too expensive and too ineffective. And yet here, down the track, is yet another damascene conversion to coalition policy and it is in the budget.


One of the underlying themes that I am trying to bring out here is that in seeking to make amends for its broken promise on the carbon tax by increasing the amount of compensation going to households, the government has had to break a whole series of other commitments and promises. In political terms, what that does is reinforce in the minds of the community the very reservation they have about the government. They cannot trust the government. They cannot trust the government to keep its word: the government chops and changes; it switches. There is no better illustration of this than the fact that to get to a surplus in 2012-13, the government has indulged in reprofiling, as it is called, of various expenditures. The loading of the back-to-school payment into the back of the 2011-12 year and the bring forward of Common­wealth grants to local government into 2011-12 have assisted the government to save more than the $1.5 billion that is the surplus in 2012-13. Again, the public are entitled to be cynical if these are the sorts of tricks that are used in order to create the artifice of a $1.5 billion surplus in 2012-13.


More importantly, when we look back on the record of this government, since coming to government Labor has deviated from its previous budgets over the last four years by $74.7 billion. Over the last two years the government has deviated from its budgets by $28.7 billion. On budget night 2010, Wayne Swan told Australia that the deficit for the financial year 2010-11 would be $40 billion. Instead, it delivered a deficit of $47.7 billion, a $6.9 billion difference. Last year on budget night, Wayne Swan told the Australian people the deficit for the financial year 2011-12 would be $22.6 billion. This week he told the Australian people that the deficit is expected to be $44.4 billion—a $21.8 billion difference. The public are entitled to ask, 'Why should we therefore trust the proposition that you will do this year what you have not done in the last at least three out of four budget years?' And they are entitled to have that view. That view is also cemented by looking at the budget assumptions.


There is no doubt that the budget is underpinned by some rosy economic forecasts, some rosy forecasts about growth, because the budget assumes that we resume trend growth, 3¼ per cent, in the next fiscal year. At a time when the Reserve Bank has become increasingly pessimistic about the path of the Australian economy, we have had a 50 basis point reduction in interest rates because the Reserve Bank has recognised that it overestimated growth over the last few months, and all indicators—of business and consumer confidence, the retail sector, the construction sector, the housing sector—have been that the economy in the non-mining parts has actually been growing very slowly or in some cases going backwards. There is no doubt the mining sector is growing strongly. There is no doubt mining investment is going gangbusters. And there is no doubt that that 20 per cent of the economy is contributing the bulk of the growth to the economy.


The RBA, the Reserve Bank of Australia, have seen through that. They have looked at the softness in the non-mining part of the economy and they have recognised the need to take interest rate action. That is why they gave us 50 basis points on the first Tuesday in May. They are looking at the budget and they will be looking at the accounting tricks. They will not be signing off on this budget, in my view. They will be looking for the continued softness in the economy. They will look with a jaundiced eye at these rosy economic forecasts. They will look with a jaundiced eye at the optimism that the budget displays about the international economic picture, as we established in question time over the last couple of days.


There is no doubt that the situation in Europe is deteriorating. It is deteriorating as we speak. It is deteriorating in Greece, where there seems little hope of having a stable government. It is deteriorating in France, where the new president is going for growth as opposed to austerity. Already we are seeing Spain teetering on the edge of financial implosion. Bond yields in Spain have exceeded six per cent. That is an indication that investors are starting to flee Spain; they are starting to get worried. It is one thing for Greece, two per cent of the Eurozone, to have problems. But there will be a bigger issue if Spain gets to a situation where the Spanish government is unable to fully bail out the Spanish banks. That will have implications all across Europe. Those are the downside risks that we are dealing with at the moment.


This is in the context where, apart from those rosy growth assumptions, we have rosy assumptions about how much the mining tax will raise and how much the carbon tax will raise, and if there is slippage in any of these then ultimately the government has admitted it will take further fiscal action. It will actually have a discretionary tightening of fiscal policy. What that means is that, if the budget deteriorates because the economy grows more slowly than they thought, they will actually take discrete policy decisions to tighten policy again, which means either further spending cuts or tax increases.


In his contribution to the debate today, Senator Cameron omitted to mention some of his own writings in this regard. He quoted Menzies and he quoted others, but he did not quote some of his own writings. In an article in the Daily Telegraph on 7 May we had laid out the Cameron manifesto. Forget about Menzies and the forgotten people; it is Cameron and the forgotten measures. These are the measures that I think he would have had in the budget. He called for an expansion of the minerals resource rent tax beyond coal and iron ore to other minerals. He called for a financial transactions tax to get at all those smarties in the financial sector, to put a bit of sand in the wheels of commerce. He argued about greater taxation of trusts. All those farmers and others out there, all those small businesses that have trusts, Senator Cameron wants to come after you. He wanted to earmark taxes to pay for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, to pay for the Gonski review and to pay for reforms to aged care. If we earmark these taxes, what sort of money are we talking about? In the case of the National Disability Insurance Scheme we are talking about raising an extra $8 billion per annum. In the case of Gonski, we are talking about an extra $5 billion. In the case of reforms to aged care, again, we are talking about $3 billion or $4 billion over time. This is the Cameron manifesto.


The reason I raise it is that, while Senator Cameron may be a humble member of Her Majesty's government, the fact of the matter is that, in the near future, if the budget starts to slip, if we start to see the surplus unravelling—




Senator Mason:
  Oh, that could never happen, could it?




Senator SINODINOS:
  I have to say, Senator Mason, based on previous experience, this is a distinct possibility. Then we have Senator Cameron's ideas on how he would pay for all this. There has been much made of the issue of debt—net debt versus gross debt and all the rest of it. It was fantastic that Senator Cameron found his way to the Treasury in order to speak to someone or at least get someone to give him a piece of paper that would explain all this. But the reason this is an issue is that people in the community are told that the government is going to achieve a surplus of $1 billion in the next financial year and simultaneously they are told, 'Oh, but the government is also going to have a bill in the parliament to raise the debt ceiling to $300 billion.' Then people ask, 'Hang on, if they are running a surplus, why do they need to borrow?'


There are many explanations as why that is the case. Part of the explanation, of course, is that the government is not only borrowing for itself, to fund its own activities and operations; it is also borrowing on behalf of public sector non-financial corporations such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the National Broadband Network. The theory there is that the government borrows on its credit rating, it passes on the money and then these parties will invest the money, and because they will make a commercial rate of return we do not need to worry. We will have an increased liability on that side of the balance sheet; we will also have an increased asset on the other side. This overlooks the fact that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the NBN have both been costed as being unlikely to make a commercial rate of return.


Senator Conroy's own study, which he finally relented and agreed to have done on this, indicated that at best the NBN could generate a six per cent rate of return—and this is as a monopoly. A six per cent rate of return is the 10-year bond rate or something to that effect, not a commercial rate of return, not the rate of return you need when you are risking money in that sort of industry. So when people out there hear that the government is raising the debt ceiling they become confused. They think: what is the message here? It further increases the cynicism that people in the community have about the government and what the government is about.


In the time I have left I want to dwell on one matter, and that is the matter of means testing rebates and various benefits. There is a justification for means testing certain benefits, but if we take this too far the danger we run is that we increase the poverty traps. We increase the effective marginal tax rates in various ways up the income scale. That is an important issue, because it can deter people from working, saving and investing. In particular, it can have an impact on the secondary income earners in families, which tend to be the women in the families, the partners. So it is fantastic when people talk about the budget implications of means testing, but let's also think about the participation implications of excessive means testing. This is a theme I will come back to because there is no doubt that in some of the measures the government has taken it has created a situation where, contrary to the rhetoric of the Treasurer, who prides himself on being someone who spent part of his working life seeking to reduce effective marginal tax rates, he is now actually making it worse.


In conclusion, may I say that this budget will not be remembered for too long. There are too many other events occurring in this place which will overtake the budget. Even the best budget has a limited shelf life; this one will have an even shorter shelf life. People will see this budget through the prism of what they believe about this government, and ultimately what they believe is they cannot take what the government says at face value. They have had too many promises broken, too many expectations dashed, and the government's budget confirms all of those impressions.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-05-10,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (17:32):  I was relieved to see Senator Fifield's name attached to this motion in the Notice Paper today. I must confide to the Senate that I was becoming worried about Senator Fifield's wellbeing. As the Senate will be aware, Senator Fifield has been engaged in some very dangerous activities in the past week or so. He has been busy organising a coup within his own party, trying to depose his colleague Senator Kroger as a Senate whip and doing so against the wishes of his leader. We learnt that Senator Abetz was also a party to this little plot and that it was only quashed when Mr Abbott intervened and said that Senator Kroger was to be left alone.


Yesterday it was also revealed in whose interest Senator Fifield has been engaging in his rather inept plotting and scheming. Senator Fifield, it seems, is the agent of the man who made his career: his former employer, Mr Peter Costello. Yesterday we learnt that the former Treasurer is trying to come back to Canberra so that he can depose Mr Abbott and seize the Liberal leadership, a position for which he has in his own mind always been destined. Senator Fifield, it seems, is his point man in the Senate.


This motion begins by asserting that the budget 'does nothing to strengthen the Australian economy in the face of storm clouds on the global horizon'. Leaving aside the question of what a global horizon might be, this astonishing statement reveals just why the opposition might well want to bring Mr Costello back to Canberra. I could say a lot of things about Mr Costello's performance as Treasurer, but I am fairly certain he would never have said such a ridiculous thing as we can find in the motion we are considering right now.


Has the opposition noticed that the central feature of this budget, which is to cut or defer spending and increase revenue so as to put the budget back into surplus, is a motivation to strengthen the economy of the nation? Has the opposition not noticed that the debt crisis in Europe is all about the markets punishing countries which do not exercise the fiscal discipline necessary to keep their budgets in surplus? Has the opposition not noticed that the Australian economy is amongst the strongest economies in the developed world? Has the opposition not noticed that we will be the first economy in the developed world to move back to surplus? Has the opposition not noticed our low unemployment, our low interest rates, our strong trade position, indeed our healthy demographics? Has the opposition not noticed today's employment figures, in which unemployment has fallen yet again to 4.9 per cent?


Let me quote the independent economic commentary website Economy Watch:


Spurred by robust business and consumer confidence, Australia’s economy is expected to grow even quicker in the next five years. 2011 to 2015 should see Australia’s GDP … grow by 4.81 to 5.09 percent annually … Likewise, Australia’s GDP … per capita is expected to experience healthy growth.


I am not surprised at all that there are Liberal senators who want to bring Mr Costello back to Canberra, because the performance of their frontbench on the economy since they have been in opposition has been little short of laughable. First we had their appalling response to the global financial crisis in 2008. The shadow Treasurer then was Ms Julie Bishop. What was her response to the GFC? 'Wait and see,' she said. Wait and see! What a masterful piece of inspirational leadership that was. Fortunately for Australia, this government did not wait and see. Our Treasurer, Wayne Swan, acting on the advice of Treasury and the great majority of economists, responded rapidly and responded effectively with our stimulus packages, which saved this country from the kind of recession that afflicted most of the rest of the developed world and which, I am sad to say, is still afflicting much of Europe. While I am on my feet addressing this subject, let me pay tribute to Senator Nick Sherry, who was a member of the ministerial team that planned and executed Australia's highly successful response to the GFC—the most effective and successful response in the world. Senator Sherry gave us his valedictory speech earlier today, and he had every right to look back with pride on his long career in the Senate and in the ministry. He shares the credit for the success and strength of our economy today, which is in such glaring contrast to the state of many other developed economies around the world. I thank Senator Sherry for his service to the Labor Party, the government and the Senate and, like everyone else, I wish him well for the future.


Ms Bishop's brilliant performance as shadow Treasurer led to her being replaced by Mr Joe Hockey—the thinking man's Clive Palmer, the man who did such a great job in 2007 of persuading Australians that they should embrace the Work Choices legislation. Building on that success, Mr Hockey's comedy routine as shadow Treasurer has been ably assisted by his straight-man sidekick, Mr Andrew Robb, as shadow finance minister. These two have bumbled and blundered for the past three years, passing the buck between them, contradicting and undermining each other, putting out figures and retracting them—and then denying that they ever said it.


On Tuesday's Lateline, in response to the budget, we saw a breathless Mr Hockey insist that if he were in government he would cut much deeper. No wonder senators opposite want to bring Mr Costello back to Canberra. Perhaps they should get the band back together and bring John Howard back as well. Then they could give Australia what it really wants: the son of Work Choices! And if anyone thinks that is an idle threat they should read Mr Howard's speech to the postbudget breakfast in Brisbane, in which he said:


At some point this country has to revisit the area of industrial relations reform.


We all know what industrial relations reform means to Mr Howard and indeed what it means to those opposite. It means the return of Work Choices. And if we should forget that, we have Mr Howard's proxy, Senator Sinodinos, here to remind us.


What is the first item on the opposition's indictment of our budget? That it fails to cut spending. This is curious, because ever since Tuesday night the opposition and its friends have been castigating us precisely because the budget did cut spending. The budget in fact cut spending by $33 billion. Let me quote a source that senators opposite might respect: the Wall Street Journal:


Mr. Swan unveiled the biggest package of budget cuts in 30 years hoping to turn a deficit of $A44.4 billion in the 2011-12 fiscal year ending June 30, into a surplus of A$1.5 billion in fiscal 2012-13.


That is what the Wall Street Journalsaid—'the biggest package of budget cuts in 30 years'. Of course, when one contemplates the time span of 30 years, that means that this government has already achieved bigger savings measures than anything the Howard government ever managed.


So we have indeed cut spending in this budget. But, according to the opposition, this is a terrible budget, precisely because it has made some cuts or deferrals in the areas of defence, foreign aid and so forth. Yesterday John Howard described the cuts as 'shameful'. These cuts are real and, certainly in the defence area, they will cause the deferral of some desirable projects. So to suggest that this budget does not cut spending is just ridiculous. This is a government that makes tough decisions on spending when those tough decisions are necessary.


This line of attack by the opposition of course raises the obvious question: if the opposition thinks that a $33 billion cut in spending is not enough, what figure would they nominate? How about $70 billion? That is a nice round figure. As it happens, it is the one that both Mr Hockey and Mr Robb have put forward at various times—and then denied at various times, and then put forward again at various times. And although they have been trying to run away from that number, it is plain that the opposition's ERC—if one could dignify it with such a term—does not know whether it is cutting or spending, leaving or arriving. If the cuts we have made are not enough for the opposition, what would they cut? Education? Pensions? We saw the shadow Treasurer speaking in London about the wickedness of a culture of entitlement. So pensions no doubt sit somewhere on their list. But what else? Medicare? Defence? I notice that the opposition has been remarkably silent on the questions of defence in this place. These are the big-ticket items in the budget, and it simply is not possible to make deep cuts in government spending without cutting into these areas.


My advice to those opposite, particularly Senator Sinodinos, is to stop wasting your time costing Senator Cameron's manifesto and turn your minds to costing your own policies. But this opposition always tries to have it both ways on spending. This is an opposition that could run into itself coming through the door. They criticise the government when we make cuts to spending, but they promise the Earth to the various interest groups that support and fund their parties. They conceal their own plans—plans that must involve massive cuts to spending if they are to repeal the mining tax and lose the revenues it will produce and yet not put the budget back into deficit. I think it is time the opposition came clean about where they are and by how much they would cut spending. I hope Mr Abbott will do this in his budget reply speech tonight. But, as I recall his lamentable performance in his budget reply speech of last year, I must confess that I am not confident about that.


Today the opposition cries crocodile tears about foreign aid, but foreign aid is always the coalition's first target of choice for spending cuts. It is an easy target for the right-wing populism that coalition parties like to engage in when no-one is watching. I am sure the Senate remembers Senator Joyce's incoherent rambling speech in February of 2010, when he called into question our foreign aid budget in its entirety, especially our funding to the World Bank for poverty alleviation. Peter Reith—who remains influential in the Liberal Party, helpfully commenting on its fortunes from time to time—said recently that foreign aid is a waste of money. The website of Liberal MP Jamie Briggs recently ran an article calling for the scrapping of Australia's foreign aid to Pacific Island countries to help them cope with climate change. So this is the commitment of those opposite to foreign aid, and their support for its financing will last mere days.


The motion before us also refers to the world's biggest carbon tax. If the opposition thinks that we on this side are going to make any apologies for putting a price on carbon and carbon emissions, taking the first step on the long road to decarbonising the Australian economy, they are mistaken. This government has many achievements to be proud of, but I think history will record that the final passage of the carbon price legislation was one of our finest hours. We would of course have reached that milestone in 2009 had the coalition parties honoured the agreement Mr Turnbull reached with the government and passed the CPRS legislation. Instead, they allowed Mr Abbott, they allowed Minchin's militia and they allowed his fellow climate change denialists to seize control of their party. They reneged on their solemn agreement with the government and they chose the path of cynicism and obstructionism, something for which future generations of Australians will undoubtedly condemn them. 


Eventually we succeeded in passing the carbon price legislation, along with its associated compensation packages. From 1 July this year, Australia will start to see the benefits of that package flowing to them. We have never denied that putting a price on carbon will impose some costs on some sectors of the Australian economy, an economy which we all understand is heavily dependent on fossil fuels and indeed coal exports. But we strongly believe that, in the longer run, it is in Australia's interests economically, socially and environmentally to take a leadership position in the slow and difficult struggle to save the world from the effects of human induced climate change.


In conclusion, I completely reject the terms of this motion. Those opposite have no grounds to criticise this government's record of fiscal responsibility. Yes, we went into deficit in 2008 and in subsequent years as part of our response to the GFC, a global financial crisis that those opposite still deny ever happened. The government did the right and responsible thing. Contrary to the primitive Thatcherite views of those opposite, there are times when deficit financing is necessary and responsible to stimulate an economy in danger of sliding into recession. We make no apologies for that and indeed the performance of the Australian economy is lasting testament to the effectiveness of the government's actions. But now it is time to bring the budget back into surplus and that is what we have done. That has certainly involved some pain, including in my own portfolio areas. But as a great Social Democratic Prime Minister of France, Pierre Mendes France, said:


To govern is to choose.


All parties have to choose what path to follow. We have chosen the path of discipline and responsibility by bringing down a budget that delivers a surplus while protecting those who rely on Labor to safeguard their welfare and their lives. Those opposite have chosen the path of irresponsibility, obstructionism, hypocrisy and even deceit. I am confident that the Australian people will recognise which side of the Senate has acted in the national interest.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-05-10,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:47):  I was actually enjoying Senator Feeney's speech. It was quite well written. It had good wordcraft in it. It had proper pitch. All around, it was almost Shakespearean. It is a shame he is leaving the chamber because I was hoping he would go for longer. The trouble is it was a load of rubbish. That is the problem—it was a complete load of rubbish. It was going so well that I was waiting for the punchline and then it came to the part where they are decarbonising the planet. That is the part that always throws you. Once they talk about decarbonising the planet, you know, 'They're back; it's the Labor Party.' This is the height of lunacy. There is one group in Australia who will benefit from the carbon tax—they will absolutely reap the rewards from the carbon tax—and that group is the coalition. We are going to use it as a mechanism to kick those opposite out. It is so obvious—it is as obvious as the nose on your face. The Australian people hate it and those opposite know they hate it. I do not know why they pursue it. They should have some gumption and stand up about it. Even if they believe in a lot of the tripe, they should have the gumption to stand up in their party room and say: 'This tax is going to destroy our party. If we go forward with it, it is going to destroy us. Unfortunately, policy is never bigger than a party and the policy has to go.' But they have not done that. They are carting themselves to oblivion.


Let us deal with the budget issues. The NBN is going out of the back door. It is absurd. The NBN is now just racking up major cost overruns. It does not have the customer base it was supposed to have. In accountancy there is a thing called impairment that you have to place on assets when you realise they are not making money, that what you paid is not what you would get if you had to sell it. Believe you me, after you spend all your money on the NBN, if you go to sell it you are not going to get your $50 billion back. You are going to have to book an impairment and that loss is going to be massive for the Australian people. It is a crazy idea. You have to look at where your overdraft is right now. You have applied for an extension of your overdraft to $300 billion. You do not have the capacity to go on frolics—it is not there. If you do, it is completely and utterly criminal because you are lumbering your mistakes onto other generations to come after you. 


Another one is this schoolkiddie's bonus, or whatever you call it. Why? It is $1.3 billion, but it is $1.3 billion that we do not have. It is another $1.3 billion that we have to borrow. It is not our money. It is the good people of China's money and the good people of the Middle East's money; it is not our money. We are going to borrow $1.3 billion just to basically throw it and hope it lands in the appropriate spot. There is no logic behind it, no committee behind it, no peak industry body behind it. There is nothing behind it but a desire of the Treasurer—though probably it was a desire of the Prime Minister—to try to buy favour. That never works. It is the last refuge of a scoundrel, even after patriotism. It just never works. You cannot buy love. Even Mr Thomson could probably tell you that. It is a case where you will get an outcome, but you will not get the affection of the Australian people. Of course they will take the money. People will always take your money, but it does not mean they are going to respect you for it. The question everyone is asking of course is: why didn't you put it into the National Disability Insurance Scheme? That is something that is supported. It is a logical outcome. It is probably a far more appropriate place than to just throw it out the door.


The next one is defence. You are throwing out the insurance policy. Looking through the figures with defence, the cut to it against GDP takes us to levels that we have experienced in Australia before. From what we can see, prima facie, it is starting to look like levels we had around 1938. I am not suggesting for one moment that there is something, but it is just foolish. It is foolish for you to let that crucial portfolio go to such a low level. It is reprehensible that you have taken your eye off the ball, because with all this fiasco with Mr Slipper and Mr Thomson happening in the foreground, with Mr Rudd being absolutely carpeted by his colleagues and with the undignified way in which the Prime Minister of Australia carpeted the former Prime Minister, we in the opposition did not need to be an opposition—you do it to yourselves, every day. It is just absurd. It started to reflect that the dignity of office was lost. We knew as soon as the polling started to come out that the Australian people would switch off you, and they have.


While that absurdity was happening in the foreground, the absurdity in the background was our finances and the issue that I have always been concerned about, which is debt. It is not a case of just the level of debt but the trajectory of debt and the year-in, year-out, week-in, week-out, structural deficit that was becoming clearly apparent in your cash flows. It continues to this day. You cannot pull wool over people's eyes, borrow week after week $1½ billion, $2 billion, $3 billion and say, 'This is not a problem.' Of course it is a problem; it is a major problem.


I remember one week when you borrowed $3 billion. I was trying to think about that with housing. It is 6,000 houses at $500,000 a pop. You have about two-and-a-bit people in a house and that is a count of 13,000 or 14,000 people who you just purchased for the week. This is not logical and you cannot go on. Of course, it is not going to go on. Every promise you make on a financial footing, you break. It is all right giving people bad news—as an accountant, I can tell you that—but you must hit your target. You have to hit your target and when you are out, not slightly out but miles out, that sense of confidence in what you are saying goes.


Two years ago you told us that this year we would have a $13 billion deficit. Okay, that is a bad outcome. Then, a year later, you said, 'No, no, we've got it wrong. It's going to be a $22 billion deficit'—just slightly less—and then the year after that you go, 'No, we got it wrong again'. It was a $44 billion deficit. So there is a trend. Each year you are about 100 per cent wrong. Then you say, 'Even though we have got it so drastically wrong, you now must believe us.' Senator Feeney said, 'We have delivered a surplus'. You have not delivered a surplus. That is also another untruth. You have made a promise of a surplus—a promise that will not be able to be ascertained until 30 June 2013, for which the final figures will come in around about September. Between now and then we have to believe your promise.


Let us work on that. What other promises has this government made that we can therefore say makes it believable?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  The carbon tax.




Senator JOYCE:
  You can start with the carbon tax, that is the obvious one. It is a key policy. Or you could start with their deficits, their debt—it does not matter where you go. You could start with the latest one of a pecuniary interest for Mr Thomson. We are trying to find out who knew what in the Labor Party and who paid the bills. You cannot believe anything they say any more. It is one of those absurd things where we have to go through the ritual of asking the questions and then realising that there is nothing they say that you can trust.


The honour of office has been desecrated, destroyed and we are just going through a ritual until we get to the election. The election is coming. We went through this ritual in Queensland as well, but at least in Queensland, I would have to say, Ms Bligh had respect. There were people who thought that there was something slightly honourable about the way she was working.


Going back to exactly where we are: our gross deposition on market value was $265.84 billion by 30 June this year. It is just fantastic. I do not deny that you did not start with a gross deposition but it was about $58 billion. It has just taken off. Then we have to rely on the trust that you can somehow bring the show back under control. But notice that our gross deposition keeps heading north, even with your own figures. You are telling us about surpluses. The reason you do that is that you are banging things on the capital account but you are not booking your impairment value. So in every way we go around your books they are just a load of absolute tripe.


What do Australians see at present? How do they get a sense of confidence? We walk into the restaurant called the Australian Labor Party. We are greeted at the door by the maitre d', the Speaker of the House, Peter Slipper, and he sits you down at the table. Out the back you have the cook, the Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Not one thing she says is on the menu ever turns up, not one. There is not one thing you can believe. It does not matter what you buy; it will not turn up. And whatever you buy is going to cost vastly more than is on the menu. Have a look at the accountant, Mr Swan. This restaurant has had the four biggest losses in our nation's history. It now has the biggest debt in our nation's history. The entertainment? I do not know who you put down for the entertainment. I suppose Craig Thomson. The member for Dobell is the entertainment.


You can see it is not something that we placed on you. You guys—the Labor Party—placed it on yourselves. You did it to yourselves. The one thing that never lies is debt. Debt never lies. It does not matter how you cut it or dice it, you just have to pay it back. When you are up to $300 billion in debt—no doubt that is where you will get to—then you will come back with some other spurious excuse, just like the three previous times, about why you have to extend it. There will be some weeping and gnashing of teeth about how something went wrong and how we have to borrow more money. There was the ridiculous effort of the finance minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, who could not even nominate the nation's peak debt position. It was excruciating to sit here during question time, having asked the question, and have a palaver of percentages of GDP and net debt. We asked a simple question and we cannot get it.


We know that the competency to manage the economy is just not there and that every day the task gets harder. Every day the calibre of the people who are supposed to be managing it comes more under question. We did not put the country in this position; you did. Now you are desperately calling out, saying, 'Tonight, Tony Abbott must tell us how to fix our shop.' It is your shop and you made the mess. It is not a mess we made. The first thing we have to do to fix this mess is to get rid of them. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:59):  I present the fifth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and also the Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 5 of 2012. 


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


The Alert Digest and the report are presented regularly to this chamber. I will say a couple of words about the work of the committee. I am a newly appointed chair of this committee. I used to be on the committee, many years ago, when I first came into this parliament. I thought then—and this thought has been reinforced since I have returned to the committee—what a fabulous job this committee does. It goes through all of the legislation that is presented to parliament and, in an almost universally non-partisan way, determines what parts of that legislation might unduly trespass on personal rights and liberties or might inappropriately delegate legislative power or insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny.


I urge senators to pay attention to these reports and the digests as they come in because they highlight, they do not make judgements on whether these are good or bad—that is a matter for policy debate in the chamber—but they do alert people to infringements on what we would broadly term human rights. So much comes through in legislation that does attract the attention of the committee. Very often when the committee draws attention to provisions the government or the people submitting the bills either amend them to take into account the committee's concern or alternatively explain why these particular provisions are there. It is a tremendously useful tool for senators and those interested in getting good legislation through this parliament. I commend the report and the digest to the Senate for its consideration.


Question agreed to.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:03):  As chair of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, I also present the final report of the committee's inquiry into its future direction and role, together with documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


The committee itself requested this inquiry in the light of its 30th anniversary in November 2011. After 30 years of operation, the committee considered that it was appropriate to review its terms of reference and to reflect on its work. Through the inquiry, the committee sought to identify whether change is needed to modify or supplement its existing terms of reference. In doing this, the committee explored its practices and processes, its supporting framework and its place in the parliamentary committee system. 


The scrutiny of bills committee especially appreciated the support for its work that was expressed by a number of the submitters to that inquiry. The committee, with the assistance of the views of submitters and on its own analysis, has identified a number of areas in which change is suggested to strengthen the existing framework. In this vein, I might mention that I had a chance corridor meeting with the CEO of one of the submitters, the Rule of Law Institute, who advised that the institute had done its own assessment on the work of this committee and that assessment would be released in due course with statistics that would make very interesting reading. Suffice to say, however, the Rule of Law Institute was very supportive of the work of the committee and praised its work over 30 years in highlighting some of the issues that are raised on what many would say is inappropriately drafted legislation.


The committee's inquiry into its future direction and role makes some important recommendations to ensure that the terms of reference in standing order 24 remain relevant and useful. I would characterise the suggestions as complementary to the committee's current work and progression without departing significantly from existing practices. The more significant recommendations that came out of the inquiry, which are contained in the report that I am tabling now, include provisions that:


… in appropriate circumstances, the committee should notify the Senate of a failure to respond to a request by it for information;—


That is a request back to the government for information on some of the drafting of the bills, and—


similar to the legislative and general purpose standing committees, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee should be given permanent inquiry powers.


The committee also recommends that:


standing order 24 be amended to specifically refer to the scrutiny of bills which excessive rely on delegated legislation for their operation ….


Also, there was a recommendation that the draft legislation that is part of the scheme of uniform legislation should be referred to relevant Senate committees, including the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, for consideration before the legislation is finalised. This is in the case where draft legislation is exposed.


The committee recommended that thought should be given—and this is very important—to both this committee, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and the Regulation and Ordinances Committee looking at regulations as well as legislation. Whilst this is not specifically mentioned in the committee's recommendations before the chamber, it is interesting to note that regulations under the Henry VIII arrange­ment, which is often referred to, do permit regulations—that is, subsidiary regulation—to override the legislation passed by this parliament and thereby actually giving it power to make regulations. It is okay to allow the regulations to be made—some would say it is not okay, but it is a practice that for very good reasons has evolved—but those regulations are then not subjected to the same scrutiny as the enabling legislation is. That seems to be a bit of a flaw in the whole process. I think something the committee and, indeed, the Senate should look at in the future is whether regulations should actually be subjected to those same processes by both the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee.


The committee also recognises that the expertise in legislative scrutiny is likely to be useful to other participants in the legislative process. The committee, therefore, considered ways in which to raise awareness of the principles it considers and its expectations of how they will be addressed. The ideas the committee intends to progress include: firstly, creating a checklist of key scrutiny issues to assist the department and to identify possible scrutiny issues; secondly, publishing short guides and a consolidated document of principles to support the use of the checklist; and, thirdly, enhancing its website and other electronic resources.


In conclusion, on behalf of the committee I acknowledge and thank all of those many people who have assisted the inquiry by making submissions and providing additional information. I also pay tribute to Senator Mitch Fifield, who was the chairman of this committee before I took it over. He chaired most of the work into the report that is currently before the Senate. I particularly thank the secretariat—the secretary of the committee, Toni Dawes, and all of her team—for the considerable help they have given. They are the professional advisers to the committee who assist generally with the work and with this inquiry as well. I commend to the Senate this committee's report into its future direction and role.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:59):  I present the fifth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and also the Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 5 of 2012. 


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


The Alert Digest and the report are presented regularly to this chamber. I will say a couple of words about the work of the committee. I am a newly appointed chair of this committee. I used to be on the committee, many years ago, when I first came into this parliament. I thought then—and this thought has been reinforced since I have returned to the committee—what a fabulous job this committee does. It goes through all of the legislation that is presented to parliament and, in an almost universally non-partisan way, determines what parts of that legislation might unduly trespass on personal rights and liberties or might inappropriately delegate legislative power or insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny.


I urge senators to pay attention to these reports and the digests as they come in because they highlight, they do not make judgements on whether these are good or bad—that is a matter for policy debate in the chamber—but they do alert people to infringements on what we would broadly term human rights. So much comes through in legislation that does attract the attention of the committee. Very often when the committee draws attention to provisions the government or the people submitting the bills either amend them to take into account the committee's concern or alternatively explain why these particular provisions are there. It is a tremendously useful tool for senators and those interested in getting good legislation through this parliament. I commend the report and the digest to the Senate for its consideration.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (20:42):  Tonight it is with much pleasure that I rise to speak on the important topic of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and I was delighted to see the budget this week make such substantial progress on this important issue. I was very pleased a couple of weeks ago to join the Prime Minister and the Minister for Families, the Hon. Jenny Macklin, in my duty electorate of Cowan in WA. We held a very important forum at Jellybeans Childcare Centre in Warwick and discussed our government's plan to fast-track the implementation of the NDIS. It was a terrific forum, meeting the kids, families and staff of Jellybeans and talking about this important issue. Jellybeans is a terrific childcare centre with a specialty service for children with autism. I was particularly pleased that the Prime Minister and Minister Macklin took such a deep interest in the concern about disability services in our local community of Warwick.


I would also like to note that at the end of April a super rally in support of the NDIS was held in Perth, the NDIS Make it Real rally. Similar rallies were held right across the country but the Perth rally was particularly successful. People shared their stories, wrote blogs, donned red shirts and generally lobbied for an NDIS, and they should all be proud of the contribution they have made to making sure the NDIS becomes a reality in this nation.


I would also like to congratulate the very successful campaign organisers from the Every Australian Counts campaign. Their work on the rallies and the whole range of other activities I think has really helped build the momentum for an NDIS, and all these people should be incredibly proud. There have been over 100,000 supporters around Australia for this campaign and they all deserve our applause because, as we all know, governments cannot make big decisions like this without a mandate, and that mandate comes from the important community journey that we have been on, learning about the important issues that confront people with disability in this nation and their need to support and sustain their lifestyle.


As we know, about four million people in Australia—that is, about 18.5 per cent—are reported as having a disability. In my home state of Western Australia, about 17.4 per cent of the population are recorded as such. When you add this number to the people who are involved in the lives of people with disability—families, carers, friends, lovers, support workers and many more—it becomes clear that a significant proportion of the population know or are concerned about people with disability. It has been a long concern of mine that many of those people are not getting the services that they need. Why is this so? It is simply because our system currently in Australia, as fragmented as it is and as underresourced as it is, has not been able to handle the level and range of services that people need. It is why the Productivity Commission, at the request of the government, undertook their detailed study into these issues. A huge amount of work went into the commission's inquiry. People told their stories. People told the commission how broken the current system was but also how it could be made better. It was a really important process. 


The report of the Productivity Commission was accepted and responded to by our government. Our government responded quickly because people with disability and their families and carers told the inquiry and told our government that they just could not take this broken-down system any more. I have met with many families in circumstances where indeed they have simply had enough because they are not coping anymore. They could not take the years of waiting for services, which were sometimes never provided. Indeed, many families would cope much better if there was certainty that services would be provided at a certain point in time. But when you are faced with a situation of caring for a loved one day after day, when it undermines your capacity to earn an income elsewhere and meet other goals in life, the household dynamics can often be quite stressful. To live without the certainty of knowing that your family and the person you love and care about will be able to get the care and support they need at some point in time really does get too much for people. I can see that people have been tired of trying to do it all on their own. People have been right to want choice in the types of services and choice in how they access those services—basic things. So the government responded quickly to the Productivity Commission's report and in the development of the NDIS. 


One of the highlights—very much so—of this year's budget is the funding of the first stage of this great reform. As we know, the Gillard government will deliver $1 billion over four years to the rolling-out of the first stage of the NDIS. This represents bringing our plans forward by a year to get the NDIS under way. I think that is a terrific thing. Even if it means we are just getting it going in certain regions of Australia, we will be able to learn a lot from what happens in those places. As we accelerate and build it into a universal scheme, the fact that we have had that head start in bringing it forward a year is a very important thing. It means that, by mid-next year, care and support for around 10,000 people with significant and permanent disabilities will be provided for by the scheme. 


It is going to happen in four locations around Australia. I sincerely hope that one of those locations will be Western Australia, and I will certainly be advocating for that. But we know beyond doubt that the scheme is going to be expanded to include even more people. I am really pleased with this announcement because we all know that the NDIS can do for disability what another great Labor reform, Medicare, has done for health care in our nation. Medicare has given people access to the services they need most, the ones that really add to their quality of life. 


The NDIS has an important and defining feature—that is, that it will be based on people's individual needs. It means that people in this rollout will no longer have to make do with services that do not meet their particular needs, which were designed for a model of how things should run and not designed currently for a person's individual needs. Individual needs in some instances will relate to their disability and the kind of disability they have, and in other instances it will be about accommodating their lifestyle preferences and their other personal needs. So from July next year there will be individually funded packages, and I think that is a really terrific thing.


We will also have funding for local area coordinators who will provide an individualised approach to delivering these services to people in the launch locations. The model builds on what has been quite a successful way of delivering services to people in Western Australia. There is much more detail about the rollout of the NDIS, but tonight I really want to congratulate my government. I am very proud of them. I am very proud of the Gillard government for getting on with the job of designing and delivering this much-needed reform. I particularly want to pay tribute to the thousands of people with disability, their family members, friends, partners and people who care for and support them. They took the time to say what they needed and took action to advocate for this reform. It is because of their work and their commitment that we are about to see the implementation of this most important reform.
