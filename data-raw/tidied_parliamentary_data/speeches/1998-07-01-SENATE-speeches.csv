"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—I move:
That government business notice of motion no. 1 standing in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Tambling) for today, relating to the consideration of the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1998, be postponed till a later hour.
—Were we told about that?
—I cannot tell you that, but I assumed you were.
—When was my office told about it?
—I am happy to get further instructions. I assumed that it was discussed between the parties.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—In the absence of Senator Schacht, who presumably will be with us shortly, there are a series of government amendments which have been circulated and essentially deal with the opposition's original proposals to split the bill. The government's 
 amendments effectively result in addressing a number of opposition concerns.
I see that Senator Schacht is now in the chamber. I am just indicating that you have some amendments which were designed in your terms to split the bill. The concern was to ensure that the matters were able to be properly dealt with by the parliament. We have some amendments which we believe address all of those issues and with which we believe the opposition agrees. I therefore propose that the package of amendments B98AU323.WB be dealt with first.
—Let's call it `WB' from now on.
—I understand they are in the process of being circulated. I thought they had been.
—We have WB, but nothing else.
—We had better make sure you have the rest in the near future.
—We have the government amendments.
—Have they been circulated to all senators?
—Yes, they have. The amendments of 26 June have been circulated.
—On that basis, I propose we deal with that package of amendments first.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I want to get this straight. The package of amendments being circulated is the one listed, which I have here, that is, B98AU323.WB. Is that what other senators have? It is the government's amendments—which they drafted in consultation with the opposition—on a whole range of areas.
—At the table we have only B98AU321.WB from the government and we have 1065 from the Greens.
—That is not the same one.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—The information I am now getting is that these are in the process 
 of being circulated. The document to which Senator Schacht refers is the one that covers all of those matters and is the one which I propose be taken first.
—We do not have it.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—Another sheet which has come through on behalf of the government and deals with the original equalisation plan is called B98AU321.WB, but that is not the one which Senator Alston was talking about. This is a separate amendment dealing with what we will call regional television arrangements, and has just come into my hand. Those amendments have also been agreed to between the government and the opposition.
—How nice!
—That sheet was circulated on 26 June. It has been on the desk for some time.
—I agree with Senator Alston. If this is a difficulty for other senators—
—Just marginally; we don't know what we are talking about.
—That is what I am trying to come to, Senator Margetts. I agree with Senator Alston that the most appropriate way to deal with the committee stage is the amendments on B98AU323.WB. They deal with standards issues for datacasting, et cetera, and is now being circulated. I think it appropriate that we deal with that sheet first, but if other senators have not yet seen it, that will be a bit tricky. If Senator Alston and I want to explain that sheet while we are speaking, other speakers can read the amendments and then hear our explanation of why the government and the opposition have reached agreement. These amendments are in accordance with the publicly announced amendments which the opposition was seeking over a week ago to Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998 this legislation.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—Madam Chair, for the benefit of the minor parties, particularly the Greens, might I indicate that all the 
 amendments should have been circulated by now but, as I understand it, there has been a technical hold-up. Therefore, the only one that you should have is the one relating to the regional equalisation plan, and we are in a position to proceed with that immediately.
The other amendments should be with senators in a matter of minutes. They deal with the broader issues we have just been discussing. I certainly apologise for the fact that these have not been in their possession before now.
I think it is fair to say, however, that we have been responding to requests from interested parties, and we have been having discussions about the state of play and the issues that are outstanding so, to that extent, if senators have been in touch with my office, they would be aware of where these amendments are going and what is proposed to be done. But I certainly acknowledge that, at the end of the day, it is the government's responsibility to have circulated all proposed amendments in sufficient time. As I understand it, we are in a position now to deal with the regional equalisation plan because that amendment was circulated some time ago.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-01,"—For a second I thought someone was trying to talk us into debating amendments which we did not have in front of us, which I thought would be thoroughly stupid. I would like to say that I will keep this in mind next time someone such as Senator Campbell abuses me for giving him only a day to see Greens' amendments.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-01,"—I want to endorse that. For the proper functioning of this place, all parties should be acquainted with amendments beforehand. There is a special situation here. This legislation has been coming on not for weeks but for months, and the government and opposition, if making conjoint amendments, should have flagged them to all parties. This is a case where the minor parties have become the major parties because they are actually watching the deal as it unfolds between the two major parties.
We reiterate that this is no small matter. This is about digital television broadcasting 
 and, ultimately, the whole range of digital communications which will affect the way in which every citizen in Australia is informed and interacts with the rest of the community. In fact, it will affect the way they will get their knowledge and express themselves on just about everything in the years ahead.
There is big money, many billions of dollars, involved in this. There is big potential for things to go wrong as well as for things to go right. There is the inevitable conclusion, because both the major party blocs here are in favour of it, that for years to come the current media moguls, the people who have given us the most constricted choice of media outlets of any country in the world, arguably, will transfer that constricted choice across to digital broadcasting. The position here is that until the years 2006 or 2008 they will have it, and goodness knows how long after that, without any other players being allowed into the field.
In the United States, for example, from the outset public broadcasters were assured of the opportunity to have a slice of the digital airwaves so that the public could have wider choice. In Australia, and in this Senate where we are representing Australians, we are cementing the limited choice that people will have, and we are cementing the power of the very few men who will control not just what we read and hear in so far as current affairs are concerned but in the entertainment field as well.
It is not a healthy thing in a functioning democracy that the fourth estate should be given such limited control. This was a sterling opportunity to break open the restricted choice that there is in Australia, to go beyond Mr Packer, Mr Murdoch, Mr Stokes and a couple of other people, but the big parties are choosing not to take that on. Part of the reason for that is that they are in thrall of those very same people. You know you cannot win office in this country if you do not have at least two of the three gentlemen that I have just mentioned on side. Fortunately, with the other parties in this place, we are not caught by that imperative.
Although we do not have the numbers, and although it will not change the outcome of the 
 debate today, we can at least speak up for the ideal that there should be greater choice and that we should not be here dealing with a series of amendments which have been cobbled together overnight following an arrangement which has been struck between Labor and Liberal. No doubt Labor will say, `Well, we have made improvements here; we have saved the day.' But, if you take your eye off the minor differences between the two big parties and concentrate on the interests of the Australian electorate, you will find that Australian citizens and Australian voters have been let down because of the power of the media moguls to dictate, through the big parties, the outcomes in the parliament. That is an unhealthy thing, not just for choice of access to information generally for the Australian public but for democracy as well.
—Before I call Senator Lundy, can I just say that we now have three sets of government amendments before us. I intend to identify them by the last three digits of the numbers that appear at the top right of the sheet. Therefore, 321 is the regional equalisation plan; 322 is modifications to the National Transmission Network Sale Bill, and 323 is the one that relates to schedule 1, datacasting.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I, too, would like to put forward some comments with respect to digital content in the broader context. Obviously, with the high level of technological determinism relating to this Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998 , the question of content and future content providers is a highly pertinent one. I trust the minister is familiar with a recent report from the OECD working party on the information economy entitled Content as a new growth industry . I would like to draw the minister's attention to a couple of the critical 
 clauses in that report. They go to the heart of several concerns expressed in the ability of many different sources to provide digital content in a range of formats in the new digital TV environment and other ways in which digital content is delivered to people's homes. As I said, this particular report looks at content as a new growth industry and states:
.	 provides an initial analysis of the size, structure and dynamics of music and audiovisual content production and delivery and the changes occurring in the digitisation of these processes.
The report goes on to say that it:
.	 identifies the ways in which network-based content production and delivery acts as a basis for new economic growth and job creation;
.	 identifies the changing structures of final consumption and revenue generation which are developing in network-based services.
These three points are obviously highly pertinent to this current piece of legislation. I would also like to make references to other critical points raised in the report. One of them goes to the predictions of what the report refers to as close and informed observers of the Internet in both the research and corporate communities. They estimate in fact that full real time voice and video capabilities on the Internet will probably be available within three years.
How this impacts upon the introduction of HDTV, I think, is something that must be considered in this forum, particularly because, with the structure of the current bill, the seven megahertz groups of spectrum that are going to be allocated will actually provide a means through which some suppliers of digital content can deliver their message. For this reason, Labor has sought to extract the definition of datacasting from this bill to allow for future, more comprehensive consideration.
Given that datacasting currently embraces, as far as I can see, the way in which digital content is delivered via the Internet, it raises questions about to what degree we need to consider other means of delivering datacasting services over our existing infrastructure outside of that which is available through the spectrum on offer. To this end I have a number of questions which I would like to put 
 to the minister. In the deferral of consideration of the definition of datacasting and in the interests of the potential of, I suppose, scope, openness and opportunity for other digital content providers, have you considered embracing in some context the provision of digital content through other infrastructures such as the telecommunications infrastructure for the purposes of the provision of digital content?
I would like to refer to a letter I have received from the Australian Consumers Association, which I think sums up my point. They are concerned that the definitions of datacasting that currently exist within the legislation should encompass what is being supplied through a range of delivery mechanisms other than spectrum. Minister, firstly, is it your intention with respect to the consideration of datacasting to look at the provision of digital content via alternative products such as Web TV and existing Internet infrastructure and Internet content providers and embrace that within the guidelines and scope of the legislation? Secondly, if that is the case, what provisions and mechanisms do you intend to at least consider in terms of ensuring the openness and access to the means by which other content suppliers can use the infrastructure through which to deliver digital content?
Minister, I leave you with those questions, and I look forward to your response. I would like to go on and make a couple of other points that were raised in this particular OECD report. The report itself identifies, by way of providing examples, the revenues attached to the various forms of content delivery in OECD countries. Of course—and I mentioned this in my speech on the second reading—the advertising revenues from TV based media are far in advance of any other form. Hence the delivery of digital content, be it in a datacast format or in a broadcast format, is obviously something that is worthy of consideration, particularly in the context of the potential growth of the content production industry.
The report also refers to the growth of this particular industry and highlights the fact that the largest amount of growth overseas has 
 occurred with small to medium enterprises. There the networks have been opened up in many respects to the content provided not by the larger corporations but by the small to medium enterprises. This has fuelled the jobs growth with respect to content provision in many of the other countries, and indeed mechanisms for ensuring their participation in the content delivery sector seem to have been lost in consideration of this bill to date. It draws my attention to the proposal to make the respective adjustments legislatively as a result of the outcome of the Blue Sky case and to what you will do as a government to protect and advance the content production sector here in Australia.
The other point raised in this report which I think is relevant—again, which I have mentioned previously—relates to the various corporate alignments that are occurring, particularly with respect to telephone and cable companies in providing datacasting, television and video services to homes. The report cites examples in the US, where there has been a dramatic shift in some of the partnering arrangements between the providers of cable based content and telecommunications, and I cite the recent takeover by AT&T of TCI, a US cable company. The corporate plan—or what has been reported as the corporate plan—behind this particular merger, again is something that I think we need to anticipate, particularly in light of ninemsn's relationship with Telstra, in that the purpose for that is to provide a video-on-demand style service in conjunction with a telephony service to people's homes.
The relevance of this point comes back to the technological determinism within the HDTV bill. What we are saying in this bill is that high definition television is something desirable for Australian consumers and, let us face it, it will be an enhanced product. It will also require significant expenditure in terms of infrastructure, being the new TV set, and the means by which perhaps you access datacasting services if the parliament takes decisions of that order. But what this bill does not deal with is the technological progression that is occurring with non-spectrum based delivery of digital content—and in effect, by 
 locking up the digital spectrum and providing for a means by which datacasters access it under quite strident circumstances—it leaves open the opportunity for a whole range of digital content to be delivered, such as video on demand.
There was an article in yesterday's paper of a new development by Cisco to provide a video-on-demand service through their TV IP product, so we already have an example where this style of service can be delivered through the telecommunications infrastructure. I think that these technological developments cannot be ignored when considering what we have before us. They construct very strong arguments for the logic behind separating out the definition of datacasting from this bill to allow a far more comprehensive consideration of it in the context of the technical definitions and for us as parliamentarians to gain a better understanding of the technology, the corporate environment of the technical progression, and the trends elsewhere that we can learn from and then make our assessments. We do not want to find ourselves, as a parliament, legislating for a specific technology in the face of trends which show the delivery of digital content is moving in a completely different direction elsewhere.
Technology is difficult to deal with in any parliament and through any legislative process. I think one of the main concerns about this is the period of time that this bill seeks to cover in its determinations for the transition from analog to digital. Again, the commonsense behind reducing the exclusivity period goes some way to addressing those concerns about the length of time with which we are determining what will occur in the provision of digital content through spectrum.
Finally, I would like to make a couple of general comments about content production and the opportunities that exist here. Because the minister also has the portfolios of arts and information economy, I believe he understands only too well the potential that the production of digital content has for Australian industry. In the context of intellectual property laws and our outstanding innovative software development, our outstanding arts, our creative population and the global reputa 
 tion we already have established in the area of content lend themselves to ensuring that, in the construct of this piece of legislation and subsequent consideration of datacasting definitions and legislation, we need to be mindful of providing the most open and the most accessible ways through which developers and independent developers of content can deliver their product—in the first instance to an Australian market but in a second instance to a global market.
It is for this reason that narrowing those opportunities by providing a monopolistic structure in which digital content can be provided would be so bad for Australian content providers and so bad for what is seen as the last opportunity for Australia to position itself in terms of information technology and its status as the largest growth industry in the world. With respect to jobs, this minister has a responsibility to ensure that the content providers—whatever their allegiances, whatever their product—have the opportunity to access digital spectrum or a digital pipe in whatever format that may emerge or be installed.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-01,"—I want to speak briefly about the deal that has been done here between the government and the ALP. I believe the entire framework needs to be examined. Like most people, I believe that speaking up on these kinds of issues about the major networks in Australia is political suicide, but here you go.
The entire framework does need to be examined. The ALP's and the government's approach of reviewing certain sections and then allowing proclamations is predicated on an assumption that the framework of the bill is okay. It assumes that the handing over of the spectrum to the free-to-airs and giving them insulation from competition is the right way to go and there are just little bits and pieces that need tidying up.
This really is not acceptable. The package should be reviewed as a whole. The Greens disagree with this assumption. It is not just little bit and pieces that require thorough investigation; it is the entire bill. Consequently, splitting the bill served no legitimate purpose, but the effect of the changes does 
 not really lead to any real assessment of the transfer to digital conversion. There are a number of reasons why the Greens believe the optimal option would be to delay this bill, pending a more comprehensive consultation and investigative process.
The government has taken the estimated costs of conversion from analog to digital terrestrial television broadcasting from FACTS without any independent assessment. FACTS do not express detail about how these figures are derived. The government has just taken these estimated costs for granted and based the linchpin of policy on this assessment. Based on these figures, the government has accepted the argument that, without free spectrum and without a ban on compensation, digital conversion could send the free-to-air operators to the wall. This argument should not be blindly accepted without independent assessment. We should not be proceeding with this so-called framework without the primary costs being assessed.	Indeed, the ALP in their minority statement in the committee report on these bills stated:
The commercial broadcasters have claimed that in order to meet the proposed start up date for digital television of 1 January 2001, it is essential that they be in a position to formulate their structural and purchasing plans as a matter of urgency. Whilst not making any judgement as to the validity of this claim, the Opposition is willing to support legislation that provides the minimum essential threshold elements for the introduction of digital television.
Now, wouldn't you think that the ALP—the party of the workers—and the government would think to consider the validity of the claim before drafting a legislative framework or coming to a position on a bill that is squarely based on such a claim? It is preposterous that both the government and the opposition are happy to support a scheme that is actually based on an argument of questionable validity. Indeed, it is interesting to compare with the United States experience where broadcasters initially estimated S10 million per station but the cost is now seen as around $1 million.
What are the options? The bill effectively promotes high definition television—HDTV—over all other possible commercial uses of DTTB. The bill mandates that free-to-air 
 broadcasters will not be permitted to multi channel or provide subscription television services. The bill provides that free-to-airs can use spare spectrum for datacasting services at a fee.
The potential of digital terrestrial television broadcasting is immense. The Greens think that the opportunities of enhanced programming, datacasting services, advance information services and direct terrestrial television access to material provided by the Internet are all positive and important things for Australia. But the government has positively promoted high digital TV above all of these other possibilities. They have positively failed to consult consumers on their preference. If this were really a consumer focus initiative, some of the following opportunities for consumers would have been considered: pay TV for people who do not have access to or cannot traditionally afford it; lots of Internet news, education and shopping services linked in with popular programming; or more companies involved in delivering mainstream digital TV services, including newspapers, phone companies, Internet companies and new broadcasters.
But the government has not been committed to discussing consumer needs in a genuine fashion. Rather, the deal was struck in the absence of thorough consultation. It is noteworthy that when spectrum was allocated in the United States the perceived need for an emphasis on high digital TV evaporated.
Perhaps what we are looking at is revenue raising and competition. The spectrum is a scarce public resource that has an incredible value. We have not even explored all the possibilities of this technology as yet. This is such an ironic piece of legislation in so far as we have a government pulling money left, right and centre out of essential services such as welfare, labour market programs, education and legal aid; yet they are prepared to give up millions in potential revenue gained by charging for use of the high digital TV spectrum so that the quality of a TV set is increased. It does seem to be an odd priority, and it does seem odd that Labor are largely going along with this.	This government forces mobile phone operators to bid hundreds and 
 millions of dollars in an auction for mobile spectrums. This money goes into the public kitty, and could be spent on socially worthwhile programs.
Despite the prima facie advantages of competitive tendering, the government has not critically or thoroughly investigated the possibility of a competitive tendering process; yet they are willing to throw it out of the window as an option. This is worth considerably more than the debate over Australian National Lines and yet we have had a whole lot less debate from Labor on that issue as well.
The bill also fails to address the possible opportunities that exist for Australian manufacturing and software development industries, and the contribution this can make to Australian employment and export earnings. Moreover, the government's position is incredibly hypocritical. Whatever happened to the usual fail-safe concept of competition policy such as has occurred with Telstra?  What is going to happen when the ACCC and the National Competition Council get on to this one?
The government's commitment to consultation and public process is highly questionable. There has been insignificant time and opportunity for consultation. Senator Alston announced the coalition's digital policy on 24 March 1998. The bills were only introduced into the House of Representatives on 8 April 1998. They were then referred to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee to report on 22 June 1998. This was an incredibly short time frame to deal with such a large and important issue.
Knowledge is power. The government know this and, obviously, the opposition know this as well. Access to knowledge means access to the ability of people to find out what is going on in this country and to form opinions. The committee only had time to hold three public inquiries, all of which were held in Canberra. The Greens believe that, for substantive consultation to occur, the committee should seek a wider coverage of Australia and have more time to conduct its inquiry.
The government has made substantial amendments to the legislation which high 
 lights the fact that a wide range of different concerns have not been recognised, let alone incorporated, into the legislation. The emphasis on regulations in this bill indicates the grossly inadequate time to properly consider the various factors in this legislation. This is not good parliamentary process. What we see now is deferred proclamation. We end up with an `all or nothing' approach, and that is not good process either.
I think it is part of the whole process by which the government sees the Senate as an obstruction. So the government avoids real debate and process, and we end up with the kind of wasteful, unaccountable nonsense that we are being asked to deal with today. There are so many unknowns in this legislative framework, because the government has not had time to really sort out the issues and be prescriptive. Instead, it has opted to leave it to regulations that can only be disallowed or accepted—there is no room for amendments or suggestions.
Telecommunications cannot be considered a luxury in this day and age; telecommunications are a clear necessity. This legislation is not something that we should be pushing through in a rush and locking in a framework that benefits only certain players. We are constantly hearing about the woes of the bush. We know that there is movement away from rural and regional centres—this includes young people and people looking for work, as well as essential services such as banks and transport. The advent of digital technology gives us an opportunity to attempt to address some of these issues. It gives us the opportunity to provide real options for people in the bush in terms of education and other information services for employment purposes. But neither the government nor the opposition have the commitment to assessing the options available to Australia. This bill should not be going through in its current form.
 The Greens will not be facilitating the deal between the government and the opposition—they can have that to themselves; they can have that on their own conscience and on their own records. The Greens will not be supporting this compromise that leaves the most contentious and crucial tenets locked in 
 until later. The so-called bare bones approach bestows great advantage on commercial TV networks. The commercial TV stations want their closed deal sewn up before the election and before there is time for a proper review of the deal.
As I said during the second reading debate, the commercial TV stations are concerned that, if a thorough investigation takes place, their deal will be in jeopardy. But closed shop arrangements are not the way to go in this kind of technology in this age. An investigation may reveal that Australians can enjoy all the fruits of digital television through another method of introduction. Why are we hurrying now?
 This so-called bare bones approach also bestows great advantage on the government and the opposition. The two major parties want to deliver their part of the closed shop deal to the TV stations in time for the election. It would be a fortuitous thing if the major TV moguls were feeling generous towards both parties in the lead-up to the election as opposed to those other very uncomfortable, nasty people in the Senate who want to review legislation carefully. It would be a shame if the same free-to-air television stations—that can be exceptionally critical or exceptionally supportive of a political party, depending on the directions from the top—were given such a big advantage right now. It is a very expensive `you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours' kind of deal. The effect of this legislation is that the digital television spectrum worth billions of dollars is being handed over for nothing.
 The ALP's amendments are inconsistent. The claim is that they want to get the bare bones of the bill through, but the result of the amendments will allow a bizarre set of things to remain. These bare bones elements look more like a set of election sweeteners for the communications industry. The deal is going to be pretty helpful for a positive spin in prospective election coverage. There is something in there for regional broadcasters—to show that commitment to the bush. There is a rollback of the closed shop to 2006—to show the Consumers Association that they have not been forgotten. Everyone has been 
 remembered by Santa this Christmas in July. So the ALP are really the all round good guys.
—Of course we are.
—Yes, right. They have this nice deal with the government. How convenient when an election is looming. A cynic might say there is a lot to gain from the position that the ALP has taken. Election proximity makes it good politics to have a set of amendments that show some level of commitment to everyone. How nice—except that the future will blame you both. However, by that stage the election results will be over, and you will be safe, one way or the other, or you will be out. In the meantime, you are prepared to pay whatever it costs from the community's pocket to get that result.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I just wanted to raise a housekeeping matter. Since I last spoke, and while Senator Margetts and Senator Lundy were speaking, more sheets of amendments have been circulated. Mr Temporary Chairman, I think we should acknowledge them and make sure that we have a title on them so that we can then sort them into the order in which they are being moved.
The ones that have been circulated since we last discussed circulation are, first of all, the Democrat amendment, which is sheet 1062 in the name of Senator Bourne. That basically deals with amendments vis-a-vis the ABC, SBS and so on. Then there is one in the name of the opposition—sheet 1071—which has two amendments on it. One deals with the industry development policy and the other relates to the exclusivity ban. It seeks to reduce that ban for new commercial television licences from 2008 to 2006 and that there will not be a review of that decision until that time.
I understand that they are the complete range of amendments that have been circulated. Perhaps we could get some agreement from the government on the order in which they want to put these amendments. Senator Alston has already indicated that sheet 323, which we call datacasting and standards, be the first group of amendments we deal with. I ask that he then indicate the order of amend 
 ments on the other sheets after that to help senators prepare themselves for discussions.
—Senator Schacht, the amendments that you have talked about are the ones that have been circulated. There are also government amendments that have been circulated as well.
—Which one's that? We have already identified those.
—There are four lots of amendments. We have had half an hour talking about the wonders of modern technology but it still seems as though we are going to have to sort out exactly in what order we are going to deal with these because we have no running sheet.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, I have asked for a running sheet, but I think I can indicate the order orally. I suggest that a logical sequence would be to deal with sheet 323 first on datacasting and standards. We should secondly deal with the exclusivity period, which is opposition amendment 1071(2). We should then deal with regional equalisation, which is 321—the government's amendment. We will then deal with solus markets, which is 579; national transmission network regulations, 322; the opposition's industry plan amendment, 1071(1) and, finally, the Australian content and ABC/SBS amendment from the Democrats, which is 1062.
—We are just checking. There seems to be one amendment that we do not have—that is 579.
—That is solus markets. I have one ending 580.WB. Solus markets is 580, isn't it, on the sheet circulated?
—Yes.
—It should be 580, not 579. Is that right?
—Yes.
—If everybody is happy with that, we will proceed that way and get ourselves organised. Are you happy with that, Senator Bourne?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-01,"—Yes. I want to make a few general remarks. I will keep them reasonably short. I must say that I have been very concerned about the passage of this legislation, not because I do not think it is inevitable that we will go to digital—I do—but because it is probably sensible to know under what conditions, and that has been the problem. We have not known exactly what conditions we could be going to with digital. So much in this legislation is left to review and to delegated legislation.
In fact, I had intended to move an amendment to the original package that the ALP was going to move to ensure that the start-up date of digital could not commence until the very complicated aspects of digital high definition broadcast, enhanced broadcast, multi-channelling, datacasting and all of that was dealt with by legislation and enshrined in legislation, not just in regulation. As a last resort, as I am sure everybody knows because they have seen it on the Notice Paper, I was going to move a motion to send off to a Senate committee everything that had not been resolved in the whole process of digital.
The outcome that we have come to today does not fill me with as much dread as it does Senator Margetts. What it does—I hope this is the case; I have looked at it very carefully and I cannot see that it is anything else—is, in effect, give us something like an 18-month exposure draft on this legislation. I am very pleased with the outcome that both houses of parliament will have to vote on the proclamation date. In the end that gives us 18 months to discuss all of this, to discuss everything that is in this legislation, particularly section 4 about standards. It gives us the time, and it gives the whole community in Australia the time, to work out what is going on in the changeover to digital. That is something that was not in the original legislation. That was the thing I feared most about it.
I do still fear the impact of having regulations for standards, which are incredibly important. I believe they should be in legislation, but we do have the safety net of not voting for proclamation until the regulations are right. What will happen now is that, in 18 
 months, when this comes back before the parliament, both houses will be able to see exactly what is in those regulations. If what is in those regulations is not a reasonable outcome according to both houses, then one house will not pass those regulations until there is a reasonable outcome. I know there will be considerable pressure. There is considerable pressure now, but I think we are all big enough and nasty enough to be able to withstand that sort of pressure until we get it right. I hope that is the case.
I have already talked in my speech on the second reading debate about what our basis of understanding on digital is, so I will not go through that again. I am still worried about the fast-tracking, but I am much happier about the changes to the proclamation date. I congratulate the minister for that. I understand it was his office or the department that came up with that. I think that is excellent.
I ask the minister when he believes the reviews will start. I am sure he will answer that some time during the course of the committee debate. I am concerned, as I am sure we all are—I know the government is—that the parliament can reach agreement which will provide the least possible disruption to the viewing public. I am pleased to see that the government has said that they have the same objective.
The debate will be very interesting over the next 18 months. It will be very interesting once the reviews begin, as long as they are open and people are able to have input. I would like to ask the minister whether he believes there will be public input; I hope so. I think we have to take a lot of notice, too, of the monetary cost to the public of having to buy new equipment. We all know what the estimations are of the cost of the new sets and the black boxes. I do not know about anybody listening, but I do not have $1,500 at the moment that I could use on a black box to change my TV over, but I am going to need it sooner or later. I suppose the minister has the same crystal ball I have, but I would be interested in his views on the costs of changing to digitisation.
As I said, I believe this is an exposure draft. I think it will work like that. I hope that 
 having faith in the two major parties is not misplaced in that they are not going to do something horrible in 18 months. I believe they will not. I believe we now will have so much public debate—obviously there is debate going on now—on what people want, what is in section 4 in relation to standards, what are reasonable standards, including standards on captioning and a lot of other things. I hope that in 18 months—in fact, I confidently expect, which is perhaps going a little too far—we will have something that will work.
The minister mentioned NTN regulations on 322 coming before my amendments on the national broadcasters and Australian content. I do have a couple of amendments at the end of my amendment sheet on NTN regulations. I take it I should move those at the same time the minister moves his. Would that be correct?
—That is for the committee to decide, Senator Bourne. I do not have any objections to that. You will decide as a committee. They are the amendments at the end of sheet 1062?
—Yes.
—I think we will look at that as we come to it, Senator Bourne. By then we might have the running sheet in order.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I want to make some general remarks about the content of these  amendments in response to Senator Margetts in particular. She said that the government and the opposition have reached a deal over this bill. I want to make it very clear that the government has agreed to the amendments that we had announced publicly two or three weeks ago and gave form to a couple of weeks ago.
As far as we are concerned, we are very pleased that the government have accepted the thrust of all of our amendments and that the government have assisted. After our discussions, they supported, in principle, our amendments that we had announced over the last couple of weeks, subject to how they were 
 drafted—and that is a drafting matter, not a matter of substance about the intent of them. We have accepted their cooperation, and I want to put on record here that the cooperation from Senator Alston, his staff and departmental officers was most useful.
But I want to make it clear to Senator Margetts that we did not get into an auction with the government about what our amendments were. We announced our amendments because we thought they were the best in the circumstances. They were debated seriously and at some length in the shadow ministry, in the Labor Party caucus committee on communications, and in the full caucus. They were not arrived at lightly. They were not arrived at as a deal; they were arrived at because we believed this would be the best way we could go forward with the government's bill.
I do agree with Senator Margetts that the process of this bill could have been much better handled. When the government had reached its decision, from its cabinet and party room processes, on what the content of the bill was, the bill should have been put out as an exposure draft bill for at least two or three months for all the interested players in the community, not just the media moguls, to have a look at the intent, structure and implications of the bill. We all accept that there are long-term implications for communications and broadcasting in Australia. There are also implications, as Senator Kate Lundy has said in her remarks today, for information technology and whether this is the way that we can deliver over a period of time the so-called information superhighway to all Australians.
We believe the government should have put out an exposure draft for two or three months. When that was completed, the bill should have then gone to a Senate committee for another month or so, within reason, for there to be debate within the committee and debate between the various interested parties, whether they be media representatives, community organisations, consumer organisations or anybody else who has a view. The committee would then have had an opportunity to hear and debate those views.
We complained at the very beginning that the 3½-week timetable the government gave the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee was far too short to get decent submissions in in time and to give people a chance to have those submissions heard at a public hearing. I have to say to Senator Kay Patterson, as well as to opposition members and others, that, given the constraints the government put on us, we did the best we could, but it was not the best process overall.
As a result of that process, the opposition made it clear that we fundamentally agreed with the introduction of digital television and digital communications in Australia. There is no argument about that. We agree with that policy decision. We agreed from the outset that, to achieve the best way for this to occur in Australia, you could not ignore the fact that there are existing broadcasters—television stations, both commercial and national—that were in the marketplace with licence arrangements and that they themselves would drive the uptake of digital television in Australia.
But the opposition did not see the uptake of digital television, in particular high definition television, as an end in itself just for entertainment purposes. We believe that, once there is a significant uptake of HDTV in Australia in a digital format, we will improve the communications system and make Australia a better place for people to have access to the new broadband, on-line services called the `information superhighway'.
In terms of broad economic restructuring of Australia, this would be a major economic advantage, an international competitive advantage. We are about ensuring that all Australians get access to it, not just the rich, not just the favoured few in the cities or in the better suburbs of the cities. That is an issue that we will follow through—that is, in conjunction with our telecommunications policy there has to be the issue of access for everybody. But we accept that, to drive the uptake, you have to have the existing television broadcasters, both commercial and national, out there leading the way because they are the ones who have the best access to the market.
So, once we reached that decision—though we disagreed with the process of the timing, which was ridiculously short—we then looked at the other things in the package that the government put before us that we disagreed with. We announced our amendments, and the indication today before you is that the government has, in fact, accepted all of our amendments—not as a deal, but it has accepted the validity of our amendments.
We are delighted the government has accepted our amendments, but I say to Senator Margetts that it was not a deal where we cross-traded. We said, `These are our amendments. We believe they improve the content of the bill, as far as the bill can be improved within the philosophical approach, the policy approach, of introducing digital. These are our amendments.' I just want to emphasise that point. When we get to the actual issues of where we disagree, we will deal with those as they arise in the various amendments.
The first basic amendment that we have agreed to deal with—I know we are still making general remarks, but I will mention it now—is the amendment moved on behalf of the government, which is on sheet 323, which we have called `datacasting and standards'. Although this is moved in the government's name, this is the opposition's amendment—we put it to the government.
When we put our initial amendments, which we drafted, to the government, the government officers—and I thank them for this—suggested that the best way to achieve the intent of our amendments was to do it in the way described in these amendments. That is, on the issues of datacasting and standards, the government's review, which we believe is appropriate, will take place and will be completed a year earlier than proposed in the initial government bill. When that review is completed and recommendations are made about datacasting and standards, a report will be tabled in parliament. If the government wants to then proceed in either way—with those recommendations or not—it has to get a resolution of both houses of parliament. So that means, Senator Margetts, if you are still here, if the Greens are still here, in the next 18 months—
—You two are still voting the same way! It means nothing whatsoever—nothing.
—I have to say, Senator Margetts, that it may be true that the numbers may be against you on something you want to raise. But I imagine that when this review comes out there will be a significant public debate about its content and its recommendations. You and I, and everybody else on all sides, will be lobbied very hard from the various interest groups, whether they be media players, consumer associations, technical people, manufacturers or whatever. It will be an open, public debate.
In the end, all of us will have to make up our minds as to whether we vote in this chamber to allow the proclamation to take place. If we do not like the government's proposal, we will not vote for it and it will have to amend and negotiate a proclamation resolution that will get through the Senate, whoever the government of the day is—and I hope that, in 18 months time, I, on behalf of the Labor Party, will be the minister dealing with this issue in this chamber.
But I expect that unfortunately the Labor Party will not have a majority in the Senate. It will still be a mixture of minority parties and the opposition to reach a consensus on what that structure should be. But, Senator Margetts, the opposition has achieved a process where you are still in the game—where all senators are still in the game—to debate what those standards and what datacasting should be.
That is a very significant achievement compared with the original government bill, which was to leave all of this to the review and then the minister would table regulations which you could either disallow or accept. A disallowance motion is like having a gun at your head—you can disallow the regulation and the government puts the next set of regulations in, and it keeps going and saying, `If, in the end, you don't accept the regulations, nothing is going to happen at all.'
—This is a very big gun to our head. In the end it is `Take it or leave it.' 
—We did not want to have an all or nothing approach through disallowance of regulation. This way, Senator Margetts, you are in the game of negotiating. It may well be that—and I cannot guarantee you—the Democrats and the Labor Party may reach an agreement, or the Democrats and the government may reach an agreement, on what that resolution or proclamation should be. That is the way it is in the Senate. You have to live with it; I have to live with it.
But the point is that everybody is going to have an opportunity to debate it as a bill—that is, what should be the content—before it is agreed to carry the proclamation. That is a significant difference to the government's proposal. We put it up—not as a deal, but as a proposition—saying, `If you don't agree to that, we will vote to void that part of the bill completely.' That was our initial amendment. I am very proud of the fact that the opposition's position has been accepted by the government, but not as a deal. This is what we put and this is what has been accepted in the amendments on sheet 323. We are delighted with that process which we believe is a far better process than that in the original bill.
I want to describe very quickly for the record the various amendments that are on sheet 323. Amendment 1 is put forward in the government's name but they are basically the opposition's amendments. Amendment 1 removes incidental and directly linked services in relation to commercial television. This has the effect of allowing commercial television to broadcast an identical signal in digital as it does in analog.Amendment 2 changes the review date from 1 January 2001 to 1 January 2000. It brings forward the first review which now includes extra elements that the opposition have pushed forward to be completed by 1 January 2000. Amendment 3 removes the condition from the definition of datacasting services—that the service is not of a kind specified in regulations. This takes away capacity to use regulations in limiting the definition of datacasting.
Amendment 4 removes incidental and directly linked services from national television and removes the multi-channelling paragraph. This has the effect of only allow 
 ing the national broadcaster to broadcast an identical signal in digital as it does in analog.	Amendment 5 adds the proclamation date provision. This renders inoperable part 4, which deals with standards, until a date to be fixed by proclamation. The proclamation can only be made after a resolution passed by both houses of parliament and this can only be done after the minister has tabled all the reports required under the review by 2000.	 Amendment 6 changes the review heading date from 1 January 2001 to 1 January 2000. Amendment 7 removes paragraph (a) from the 2000 review. This paragraph provides for regulations relating to incidental and directly linked services and datacasting services.
Amendment 8 adds to the review the requirement to report on amendments for incidental and directly linked services on commercial and national television—that is, the ABC and SBS. This provides the capacity for the review to report on legislative amendments required for commercial and national television to provide digital broadcasting services that are incidentally and directly linked. It adds to the review the requirement to report on amendments for multi-channelling on national television. This will provide for reporting of legislative amendments which will be required to allow the ABC and SBS to engage in multi-channelling. Amendment 8 also adds to the review the requirement to report on amendments for datacasting services. This will provide for reporting of legislative amendments required to govern datacasting services. Amendment 8 also adds to the review the requirement to report on amendments for standards. This will provide for the reporting on the legislative amendments required in all the standards areas.
Amendments 9, 10, 11 and 12 insert the proclamation date requirement throughout relevant sections of the Radiocommunications Act. This provides for amendments to the Radiocommunications Act which are necessary to facilitate transmission licences for datacasting to remain inoperable until a date fixed by proclamation. (Extension of time granted)
Finally, amendment 13 inserts express prohibition on the Australian Communications 
 Authority to issue a transmitter licence for the purpose of datacasting. This ensures that licences for datacasting cannot be issued until after a date fixed by proclamation. I thank the Senate for giving me the opportunity to put on the record the explanation of amendments on sheet 323 which are, in effect, the opposition's amendments.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-01,"—Methinks Senator Schacht protesteth too loud. It is not necessary to cross-issue deal on something as juicy as telecommunications. Quite clearly, I think these are the kinds of issues between the major parties that we see the Australian community getting so angry about. The point is not whether the Greens have been cut out of this debate; it is whether the community has been cut out of the debate. If there is agreement at this stage between the two major parties, there are financial commitments being made by the major television operators and the networks.
Given that cross-agreement between the two major parties and the amount of money that is involved with the investment—all of those things—what is the likelihood that this deal will be blown up even if there were strong community concern during this review on the done deal? The answer is very little. It is, in fact, an all or nothing deal. Deferred proclamation does not really give us much leeway to change the way we have put the legislation together. The argument that has been given by Senator Schacht is that the best possible way is for us to deal with the review now and then to put the legislation together later. That is a nonsense. And it is really an abrogation of proper process.
For all that he protests, I believe that Senator Schacht has basically cut the community—not the Greens—out of this debate, giving the appearance that they will be able to talk later after the deal has all been signed. Terrific—absolutely terrific. The networks know that you guys are happy with the deal. The networks know that nothing short of a total revolution is going to change that. The reality is that all the rest is just embellishment from hereon in.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I do not want to delay the Senate unduly. I take this opportunity, in view of what Senator Margetts has again said, to emphasise, firstly, that there was no deal between us and the government. We told the government what our amendments were, and we are very pleased to say that they have accepted them. Secondly, I want to say to Senator Margetts that the Labor Party took the policy decision of favouring the introduction of digital television. We believe that it was an appropriate decision to make, despite the fact that we disagree with how this legislation was produced.
We also made it clear several weeks ago when this legislation emerged that we support the free to airs getting an allocation of seven megahertz each to move to HDTV. We support them having a simulcast period. We have a subsequent amendment reducing the period of exclusivity for any new commercial licences. It is yet to be debated. We also support the start-up date of 1 January 2001. We believe that it is a reasonable decision to take in broad policy terms.
Our amendments are aimed at removing all the detail about what the standards will be, what datacasting will be, what multi-channelling will be, and what enhancement of the signal will be until the government has an opportunity to complete its reviews. If the reviews are no good, everyone in the Senate, the House of Representatives and the community will have a chance to publicly debate that review.
Senator Margetts also suggested that we have been interested in talking only to media moguls. The opposition listened to and took on board the comments of anybody in the community who approached it with interest from any angle, including the Australian Consumers Association. I have indicated previously that, in evidence to the committee, Mara Bun said that if the commercial television networks do not use the spectrum for HDTV, they should lose it; that is, they should use it or lose it. Standards will be laid down in the review about the introduction of HDTV. There will be a process of setting targets for the introduction of the hours 
 involved. That is still to come. It will be a disallowable instrument in this area. Standards will be set regarding the number of hours each week, month and year for HDTV. There will be a public debate about it. If the television stations do not meet the requirements laid down as a disallowable instrument, they will lose the spectrum. It is in this legislation. If I have it wrong, I have missed something in the reading of the legislation.
The Australian Consumers Association made a very strong plea that these broadcasters should not be given access to the seven megahertz as an absolute gift forever to do with what they will. If they do not use it for HDTV, which is the intent of this bill and certainly the intent of the opposition, they will lose it. That is the result of the discussion with the Australian Consumers Association and the evidence they gave the Senate committee, which I attended. The Australian Consumers Association made a very compelling case in using the phrase `use it or lose it', and we support it.
Regional television turned up and made a number of representations. Whether they were in the aggregated markets or in the so-called solus markets, both had different issues, which we will deal with shortly. As a result of what they put to us, the opposition has moved a number of amendments and we did not have any great dispute with the government once we had a discussion about those amendments. Again, there was a difference of opinion between what the solus market commercial television operators wanted and what the aggregated television broadcasters wanted. It was a bit different from what the metropolitan commercial broadcasters wanted via the dominant influence of FACTS.
The three different levels of television broadcasters all had a different view about the need for the introduction of digital television. I am proud that the opposition differentiated those needs and has moved amendments accordingly. They are before us now in this package of amendments. They are what we put on the table, not as a deal but as a reasonable outcome to help the different levels of television commercial broadcasters.
New datacasters from both the Internet association and individual companies such as Ozemail gave excellent evidence about the need to rapidly develop datacasting in Australia as a new form of information distribution. Their evidence was compelling. As a result of that evidence, we have proposed the amendments that are before us now on sheet 323. They state that we do not want the definition of datacasting left to a review that, at best, would make it a disallowable instrument. We want that review to define datacasting and to bring back a tabled report in the parliament. We will then vote for it as part of a motion. If we disagree with the review and the datacasters, free to airs and Consumer Association disagree, that will be part of the debate.
The datacasters made an excellent case for the development of datacasting, which involves separate licences. We also had to sort out what will be allowed to the free to airs to use for datacasting with their seven megahertz when they are not in HDTV. This was unclear in the evidence given both by FACTS about what they thought they could do and what the government said it believed its legislation would do in the definition. I sat for three days trying to find out what it stood for. There was no agreement about what the legislation at that stage stood for. Datacasters said that it meant one thing, the free to airs said that it meant another and the department said that it meant something in between. To me, that was a recipe for utter confusion and endless litigation before the ABA, the Federal Court or someone else.
By having this review and having it report back here, the parliament will decide the final definition of datacasting. It was clear that the datacasters want to do some things with datacasting that some of us might believe is broadcasting. Some of the things the broadcasters want to do with their datacasting channel could be seen as datacasting, where they would move into a whole new area. The government said that if the free to air commercial television stations want to go into datacasting, they will have to pay a licence fee similar to the one charged to those who have a special datacasting licence.
To the opposition, that seemed far too indefinite and might lead to forgoing increased revenue to the government. I am not sure about that, but that is another part of the review that will come back to us. Again, we will decide that issue. On the issues of multi-channelling and enhancement, I think that what FACTS described as enhancement means multi-channelling. I have to give Mr Branigan his due; he was quite open at the hearing. When he described enhancement, I said, `Mr Branigan, I think you're describing multi-channelling, which this bill is aimed at preventing you from doing.'
They gave the example of what they would see as enhancement. For example, a commercial television station in Melbourne at news time would have a signal going out all over the metropolitan market of Melbourne, including Geelong. They would want, by way of a separate signal, to put the same news service out but with a somewhat changed content to include specific items for the Geelong area. It would be on two different channels at the same time. The consumer, in the way it was described, would choose between two different channels.
I said that, to me, it was multi-channelling. Mr Branigan said, `No, it's not. It's enhancing the first signal.' I think that if a consumer is pressing a button to get two different signals at the same time, that is multi-channelling. We want the review to deal with that definition, otherwise there will be an enormous brawl over the issue of enhancement and it will be used as a loophole to get the commercial television stations into multi-channelling, which I know is the government's intent. The opposition's intent is not to allow multi-channelling. We want them to get into HDTV. So that is another area in which we think the review proposed on sheet 323 is very effective. It will give this parliament the final say on the decision as to what the definition of enhancing a digital signal is.
I believe that, in the circumstances, this is a very good outcome for the opposition parties, whoever they may be in the Senate any time in the next couple of years. It also means that the government cannot smash this stuff through on behalf of any particular 
 commercial television station. I think those are excellent outcomes in these amendments.
We have also included an amendment dealing with multi-channelling for the ABC. The opposition has already taken the view that we believe the ABC and SBS should be able to multi-channel so long as it is not in conflict with their charter obligations. We also believe that the ABC and SBS must do their bit to get the uptake of HDTV. They will be bound, as far as we are concerned, to get into HDTV programming for their viewers. But when they are not in HDTV, like the commercials, they should be able, we believe, to multi-channel to meet their charter obligations to provide minority interest programming and so on.
We do not believe it is automatically an excuse for them to get into commercial operations to sell off a multi-channel to another commercial operator. We believe that would be contrary to their charter. But if they can make a good case in this review that they should be able to have some flexibility, that will come back to the Senate and it will be debated at that time. That cannot go ahead either way unless a majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives agree.
I believe that is an excellent protection. Let the review get on with it; let the ABC and SBS argue their case. But we are not giving them carte blanche on it. We want the definitions of commerciality carefully constructed for them so that it is not contrary to their charter obligations. I think that is a good outcome, Senator Margetts. I believe that the structure, in the circumstances, contained on sheet 323—effectively, our amendment—is an excellent outcome.
I agree with you, Senator Margetts: we believe this legislation should not have been rushed through. I put on the record that the ABA discussion paper of July last year on the introduction of digital television said that this legislation did not have to be introduced until October this year, for a start-up date of 1 January 2000. The government has said that we have got to get it through now. I suspect—and I agree with you on this, Senator Margetts—they are under pressure from the commercial television stations. They want this 
 legislation pushed through as quickly as possible and the period of public discussion telescoped down.
I agree with you that that process would have been better, but when the government insists on this legislation being dealt with, we have dealt with it, we believe, on the basis that we believe in the principle of introduction, but we are refining it in such a way that there will be no way that the commercial television stations can walk away, quietly off on the side, with an additional commercial asset. I believe that the opposition has got these amendments accepted by the government in order to achieve the best possible outcome in all the circumstances.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-01,"—Madam Temporary Chairman, you will be pleased to know that I do not intend to continue stringing this out longer than necessary. What Senator Schacht has been doing has epitomised the problem here. He is diverting attention from the main game—that is, that they have accepted the framework, that they understand the community wanted that exposure draft, that the community wanted to debate the framework. Senator Schacht quoted the Australian Consumers Association, but let me remind Senator Schacht that the Australian Consumers Association clearly stated that competitive tendering had not been discussed in any real sense in the whole process.
We are setting up a framework. We will fill in the middle. We will put together the little bits; we may have some say in that. But the reality is that the government has got what it wants. The networks have got what they want. They have got a framework which they know is set in concrete. That is the problem with this process. Senator Schacht has admitted that it would be better if it were put as an exposure draft for three months and that in October we would look at it and deal with it in a proper process. This is not, and never has been, a proper process.
In that sense, whatever Senator Schacht says still does not hide the fact that this should not be put through now in this form. The framework should not be set in concrete. It is the framework which is in contention. 
 The basic justice and equity of the framework are in contention. The rest is largely a case of fiddling at the edges. I realise that there are important issues at the edges, but basically the Australian public, the community and equity in television communications have been the losers.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-01,"—I have one question of the minister concerning amendment No. 8. I had discussions with the ABC last night—I know that the opposition did and I assume the government did as well. They had three suggested changes to paragraph (dc) in amendment (8), which I accepted. I think the opposition did but I am not sure about the government. The ABC suggests that the words `the Commonwealth should be made' at the end of the first line of paragraph (dc) should be replaced with `the Commonwealth are required in order to allow a national broadcaster'. Also the words `the broadcast of the programs fulfils' in paragraph (dc)(ii) should be changed to `the broadcast of the programs is in accordance with the charter' and the word `responsibilities' should be taken out. Paragraph (dc)(ii) would then read `the broadcast of the programs is in accordance with the charter of the national broadcaster'. I am not sure whether the minister has looked at those possible changes to his amendment. Last night, when I spoke the ABC representatives, it seemed to me that they were reasonable changes.

I will deal with some of the matters raised both in terms of the preamble and specifically on the amendment sheet. Senator Lundy's concerns about digital content are obviously ones that exercise all our minds. I was pleased that she did not suggest that somehow this legislation might restrict the capacity of content providers to service their markets through a variety of technologies because clearly that is not what we have in mind. I think Labor has amply demonstrated the futility of technology-specific legislation which is limiting, the amp  phase-out being one classic example.
This legislation is aimed at enabling digital terrestrial television to occur but not in any shape or form to limit other forms of technology delivery. So whether it be satellite, MDS or cable, there is nothing in the  Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998  that will restrict the proliferation of digital content. Indeed, that will occur to the maximum extent possible, unless otherwise constrained by legislation, which we do not 
 have in mind. All this is doing is saying at the moment that the Broadcasting Services Act allows television only in analog form. We want to extend that to digital and we want to go further and recognise some of the new technology developments—multichannelling, datacasting, convergence—and all of their implications, which will then lead to a much broader use of terrestrial services to disseminate content.
I am aware to the OECD report. Someone in the industry kindly sent me a short summary of it recently. I think it offers us a great deal of confidence that there will be growth in all of the areas you mentioned. Certainly, the bill essentially proposes point-to-multipoint distribution, so video on demand being point to point would probably not be picked up by this legislation. Otherwise, it makes spectrum available which will encourage new entrants to come in and offer a whole range of services that might result from interactive digital television, web casting and the like and, to that extent, offer enormous new opportunities for digital providers.
I will not deal with Senator Margetts's more fanciful conspiracy theories, but I do want to deal with some of the more extraordinary and breathtaking ambit claims put forward by Senator Schacht. I understand why he desperately wants to claim ownership of these amendments.
—It is true.
—Let us just deal in facts and we will let others judge. This needs to be understood. Essentially, what the Labor Party had in mind was that the bare bones of the digital bill should be allowed through, which would simply allow the free to air broadcasters to migrate from analog to digital, so they were given guaranteed spectrum. They were guaranteed a simulcast period, they were given some period of exclusivity, which is an industry protection mechanism to some extent. Otherwise all of the new and exciting possibilities that result from enhancements, from convergence, multichannelling, datacasting and even closed captioning—which I would have thought Senator Stott-Despoja would have been pretty appalled about—were simply trashed. They were thrown out, put to one 
 side, maybe never to surface again. That had the very serious effect of throwing any baby out with the bathwater.
We acknowledge that there are ways in which the matters can be brought back to the parliament and in the scheme of things, if it is done by legislation rather than regulation, that will give the parliament more flexibility. That is probably a move that will not make any significant change to the approach that we intended to adopt. It was always our intention to have a whole range of these issues—not just the ones I have mentioned, but retransmission, under-served areas, spectrum—examined by way of review and for those reviews not only to result in reports but the reports to be the basis of legislation or regulation brought back to the parliament.
The Labor approach would have simply not ensured any of that. All that it would have done would be to have allowed a very ersatz version of digital television to go forward. We would have been an international laughing stock because the US, the UK and all those others who are rapidly wanting to embrace digital technology and digital television would have had datacasting and we would simply have been locked into this higher grade version of the analog network.
I think Labor eventually realised that was simply an untenable proposition. What we have now achieved through government amendments—not ones that Senator Schacht likes to pretend to reflect are opposition amendments—is rewritten back into your preferred form all of these things such as datacasting, HDTV, multi-channelling, enhancement, closed captioning—
—The same effect. You cannot do anything without the approval of parliament.
—All I am saying is that that is a separate issue.
—No. We were always out to make sure one way or the other that you have to come back to parliament.
—No. There was no requirement to come back to parliament under your model.
—But they would not have been able to do anything else. They would have forced you to do something else.
—That is exactly right. Thank you very much, Senator Schacht. Game, set and match.
—What you should do is put up the white flag. You have put up the white flag, Richard.
—Your approach would only have allowed the analog free to air to convert to second-class digital and that would have been that. There would have been no requirement to have gone beyond second-class digital television. That is just plain—
—You are sounding like General Custer at Little Big Horn as the arrows went through.
—Order, Senator Schacht!
—Madam Chair, the great virtue of any exchange of this sort is that the matter can be determined independently by looking at the evidence. All you have got to do is look at Senator Schacht's press release and Senator Schacht's proposed amendments and you will see that there was no guarantee at all that anything would ever come back into the parliament. All that you were guaranteed—
—It would not have been able to do anything else.
—Exactly right. If some heavy hitter came to you and said, `Listen, we have got what we want, thank you very much. We don't need datacasting, we don't need some of these other enhancements or, if we do, maybe they could be put off well into the future', there would have been no obligation on you to come back to the parliament. We have achieved a very significant step forward by writing back into the legislation all of those new and exciting technology developments that at least Senator Lundy appreciates are not only time critical but absolutely important in terms of ensuring consumer demand for these new services. So I am delighted that you are supporting our amend 
 ments and, as I say, the record will speak for itself.
I should just say in passing, use it or lose it—which you seem to think was discovered by you during the Senate committee when the ACA brought it forward—was our commitment from day one. We have never had any thought other than that. As far as the record is concerned, once again, I think it will become clear that you are a late arrival at the party.
Similarly, with datacasting and other definitions, the fact is the whole purpose of reviews was to determine what was meant, where the boundary lines ought to be drawn. You seem to think you can get up in a Senate committee and skewer a few hapless people who have not yet been able to draft a form of words that could be put before the parliament—in other words, who have got a few ideas on what they think it means. That is simply underlining our point.
The whole purpose of the review exercise was to decide what ought to be meant by datacasting, enhanced services, et cetera. You have your reviews, you let every man and his dog have a say on it, and then you bring back a distilled proposition which the parliament can support. That is precisely what we had in mind. Yet here you were slamming people for not having reached that refined stage. No-one expected them to. We did not. We simply wanted these principles to be adopted.
I am delighted that now, in every shape and form, you have accepted not only our framework but each and every building block supporting it. You have rabbited on, saying, `Oh, there's not enough time; we don't know which way to go; we are running around like headless chooks.' At the end of the day you have given a ringing endorsement, not only to the basic framework but also to every critical aspect of it. You have played at the margins; you have tweaked a few basic numerals—
—What did we do with the exclusivity band?
—As I am saying, you are tweaking that, but, in terms of all the underlying principles, the real building blocks for the digital revolution, you have given it a 
 huge tick, and we are very grateful. If I could move on, and I know Senator Schacht would like to spend all day on these sorts of things—
—I will, if you keep telling lies like this.
—I am happy for the record to speak for itself. As far as Senator Bourne is concerned, can I say that we agree that you can make the amendments to (dc), requiring, and also to (dc)(ii), in accordance with the charter. There are the two points. We are happy to amend the schedule to that extent, and I assume we can proceed on that basis. Perhaps Senator Bourne can formally move those on the run.
As I understand it, Senator Bourne's proposal is that at the end of the first line in paragraph (dc) the word `should' should be replaced with `are required'. Then, in (dc)(ii), instead of the words `fulfil the charter responsibilities', we should insert `in accordance with the charter'. I seek leave to amend my amendment.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I have two quite specific questions to the minister in relation to these amendments. The first goes to the definition of datacasting in the context of the referral of datacasting considerations to the review. Does it embrace the delivery of datacast services through all forms of delivery, including analog, cable, NDS satellite, enhanced telecommunications services such as ISDN, and indeed the telecommunications network? I guess what I am seeking, Minister, is whether or not you see your review embracing all means by which datacast services are delivered to people's homes.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—The short answer is no. This is only for the purpose of defining datacasting for the purposes of terrestrial television. To the extent that there is a need to redefine it or adopt the same definition for other technologies, that will be a matter for a later date. But at the present time it only arises in the context of digital terrestrial 
 television. We are drawing a broad distinction, if you like, between conventional television and the Internet. That is the most basic demarcation. We simply want to ensure that, in deciding what is permissible under the heading of datacasting, we do not impinge on broadcasting. So the definition is couched more in terms of the negative, but it is only ever in the context of terrestrial television. As I say, if it becomes relevant elsewhere, we can address it then.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—My second question goes to the issue then of providing datacasting services across this range of potential infrastructures, if you like, specifically with respect to other providers of content who seek to invest in providing content, indeed through the digital spectrum, but who are not party to the arrangements by which the clusters of seven megahertz are currently being allocated. Can you explain to the committee on what terms and under what conditions will the digital spectrum be available to datacasters who are currently outside the scope of the seven megahertz allocations, and under what terms would they get access to this prior to the review being conducted?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—The spectrum is being made available only for the purposes of terrestrial transmission. So whether it is the existing free to air networks or new entrants, we are defining, or identifying, for the first time a new concept in terms of datacasting, which needs to be defined in order to ensure that it does not encroach on broadcasting. But that does not in any way preclude those who might be wanting to transmit content by other means—satellite, wireless or any other means—from providing a whole suite of services.
The Internet is already out there. The Internet is being delivered by cable, by satellite. It may well be carrying precisely what we ultimately define as datacasting. At this point in time there is effectively no limit on that. The reason we are seeking to introduce this new concept in the terrestrial area is that we are looking at the extent to which 
 traditional broadcasters should also be allowed to become datacasters. If they are not broadcasters, they are not affected. So there are a lot of people out there probably datacasting their heads off, and no-one is worrying about it.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—Thank you, Minister, I think that clarifies my question: it does go to those outside the embrace of this legislation in that I am talking about content providers who are not currently broadcasters. From what I understand from what you have just said, if you are not currently embraced as a broadcaster by this legislation and the allocation of a seven megahertz cluster of spectrum, then in fact there is a commercial means by which those providers of content could currently access the digital spectrum for the purposes of datacasting. I am seeking a final clarification on that point.
—I am sorry; I did not quite appreciate the nub of the question. I did hear some of the surrounding material. Could you rephrase the question?
—Minister, what I am seeking a final clarification on is whether those providers of a datacasting service at the moment, who are currently outside the legislation in that they are not broadcasters and are not the recipients of any spectrum, currently have through commercial or other means access to purchase or lease, or get a hold of, a certain amount of digital spectrum through which to deliver their datacasting service.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—I am sorry; I did not appreciate that point. The answer is that to the extent that they wanted to acquire spectrum, they would do it through the Radio Communications Act price based allocation mechanisms, and we do not believe there will be a shortage of that.
—It will be auctioned?
—Yes. As we have said, there will be plenty of spectrum for new entrants in terms of datacasting.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—Again, I am just 
 trying to make sure I understand this completely, Minister. During the Senate inquiry we heard that there was to be a clump, if you like, of digital spectrum available for the purposes of non-broadcasters' distribution of digital content via the spectrum. Are you in a position to identify how much spectrum? From recollection, I think I remember the department talking about up to 20 megahertz. Could you clarify the quantities that will be available and give an assurance that there is no period of time in relation to the review or any other proposed legislative mechanism by which such content providers could access that proportion of spectrum if it indeed exists?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—There is no doubt that it exists. From memory, I thought that, in the Sydney area particularly, there was something like 30 to 40 megahertz available. The important thing to remember is that the great bulk of the—
—For broadcasting?
—No, available to new entrants for datacasting beyond the equivalent or adjacent blocks that the current free to airs would have access to for that period. The overwhelming bulk of the seven megahertz would be used for high definition television. If you are merely a datacaster you need only a very small proportion, so you could probably run a fully-fledged datacasting service with less than one megahertz. Therefore, we would expect that there would be a multiplicity of new entrants, and all the evidence has been that there is more than enough available. In fact, just recalling the 500-megahertz auction, there was very little interest in that. It went for about $1 million, and the general industry view was that there was no hurry because there was going to be a surplus of spectrum available for non-broadcast purposes.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—Going back to your response to my earlier question about the scope of the definition of datacasting in the impending review embracing other delivery mechanisms of digital content, you responded that the review would look only quite narrow 
 ly at the way digital content was transmitted through the digital terrestrial television. Minister, in light of the various alignments and the new technologies that open the door to the possibility of broadcasters delivering a datacasting service—not through digital terrestrial television but through a mechanism that incorporates other forms of delivery, be it the existing telecommunications infrastructure, the existing cable or pay TV infrastructure or, indeed, satellite infrastructure—I am asking you to consider that that also needs to be embraced in the review.
I have taken the time in my contributions to refer to these convergences of technologies that currently are occurring. I can identify a series of products and directions of corporations—like AT&T and their partnership with TCI, ninemsn and their relationship in developing the Web TV or Microsoft based product, and the one I spoke about this morning of Cisco's IP TV—which all incorporate the delivery of what potentially could be defined as broadcast services through alternative means, and therefore could provide the broadcasters embraced in your HDTV legislation with a means of delivering datacasting and digital content through other infrastructure.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—For example, Cisco's model is simply a proprietary alternative to Web TV, which is the Microsoft brand name. These are simply examples of the Internet being translated to a television sized screen. There will be, no doubt, further progress in terms of technological developments, and they will all be considered when convergence is part of the review process. So a lot of these things will come under the microscope in due course but, at the present time, if we take what we generally think is the starting point for the concept of datacasting, those players are already datacasting. It is just that it is not particularly relevant in terms of legislation. No-one is proposing to stop them from doing that. We generally think that it is good because it is expanding the boundaries.
The reason we are having a review in this area is that we want to distinguish between 
 broadcasters pursuing their traditional trade of broadcasting and moving across to another area which not only would be the subject of taxation, because the existing free to air players and the new entrants would have to pay equal revenue, but also to ensure that the boundary line did not enable the new entrants to be de facto broadcasters. That is why it is relevant only in the current context, but that does not in any way mean that we are constraining the use of other technologies for datacasting purposes. In practice, it is already happening. There is a proliferation of web sites, there are innumerable service providers—over 600 in this country—and they are all facilitating what you could loosely describe as datacasting by other means.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I certainly understand the point that you are making, Minister, but I suppose what I am putting to you is a suggestion that this review process provides a unique opportunity to address, quite specifically, the implications of the convergence of these technologies. I have one further question. I know I keep saying that, but your answers to my questions are provoking more queries.
—Convergence will be one of those matters that will be specifically reviewed, so you will have every opportunity to address all of those issues.
—Could you say that on the record, Minister?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—I think you will find that convergence is one of those matters referred to in the amendments.
—Try 59(b). This must be one of our amendments.
—The bill states that one of the reviews that must be conducted is:
whether any amendments of laws of the Commonwealth should be made in order to deal with convergence between broadcasting services and other services;
You can say that that is simply confined to the broadcasting sector, but in practice I 
 would have thought you would have to take account of all other technology development.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—That is part of the review up to the year 2000.
—There are lot of separate—
—Yes, I know. Is that one of those reviews that has to be laid on the table of the parliament—as part of the proclamation arrangements?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,—Clause (4) says that copies of a report are to be `laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the completion of the preparation of the report'.,SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—Minister, the report of the review on this issue of convergence will have to be laid on the table of the parliament before the year 2000—the reporting date is up to 2000 and before the proclamation takes place.
—It has to be tabled within 15 sitting days, so that may be well before the year 2000.
—So what this means is that if someone chooses in the Senate or in the community to put this issue of the convergence definition into this review as part of a package of discussion about the carriage of the resolution on proclamation they can raise that issue in the Senate and put part of it. And if the Senate or the House of Representatives decides to do it, so be it, even though that is not automatically directly going to be a consequence of it. But people can, when they get that report on convergence, say, `We are not happy with the review or not happy with the outcome and the recommendations. Minister, before we agree to vote on your proclamation, we want this amendment done on convergence.' That is how it works?

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—On the matter of the seven megahertz spectrum for those broad 
 casters who currently will receive an allocation under this bill: if they have the opportunity to provide a datacasting service and use a cross-relationship or cross-promotion with their broadcasting service, what provisions exist in the bill to ensure that those who have access to datacasting services through other means as well do not suffer a competitive disadvantage?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—There is nothing specific there that deals with it but, clearly, to the extent that it constituted possible anti-competitive conduct, then the ACCC would have an overriding view on it and would play a watchdog role. So it may well be that players would approach the ACCC to ensure that what they had in mind was not likely to contravene or provoke any inquiries.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—This final question goes to the issue of standards in terms of any infrastructure required such as set-top boxes for the presentation of digital content—perhaps in conjunction with the provision of that content either over the telecommunications structure or indeed post-review through the digital terrestrial TV signal. With the bringing together of that product, if you like, on television screens, a decision has to be made about the standard through which that signal is developed. If the delivery of digital datacasting content can be blended now, prior to this review, and presented on the TV screen—as we have explained, we know this technology is currently available through web TV and other mechanisms—how will the government have a say in what standards are developed for the presentation of that digital content prior to this review taking place in the interests of not establishing any particular exclusivity to one content provider, given the relationship between some of the multinational content providers and the actual standards that they utilise within their technology?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—I think we have made it plain that we expect inter-operability between set-top boxes—
—It will be plain if you do not.
—Exactly. And that means that it will not be acceptable for people to develop proprietary standards that are incompatible. As I understand it, there is not currently a debate about differing standards in relation to datacasting. There is now industry agreement that DVB should be the preferred digital standard, and therefore in due course that will presumably be put in legislation or it will be a matter of regulation to ensure that that occurs.
What normally happens with other industry standards is that, as differences emerge which have the potential to result in incompatibility, pressure arises for the government or a standards body to effectively arbitrate.
—Is that Standards Australia?
—I am just talking hypothetically, because at this point in time I am not aware of any issue or choice in terms of standards for datacasting. But if that issue arose and some of the concerns that you express became real ones, then clearly as part of the report back process and any subsequent legislation we would have to give consideration to whether we should be mandating any particular standard.
But particularly with the pace of change in this area, the last thing you want to do is to decide prematurely what standards you propose to adopt. You are much better off to see which way the industry is going and then, if necessary, you have to make a hard choice. De facto standards often emerge through letting it sort itself out in the marketplace. Whilst we would be reluctant to intervene, we would certainly reserve our right to do it as a last resort. If and when it becomes an issue, then no doubt the review and other processes of the parliament will address it.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—On the issue of standards, which is covered by these amendments off in the review area, I was informed by FACTS about two or three weeks ago in a press release they kindly sent to me—I think you probably were too—that the FACTS technical 
 committee had adopted the European system for digital television called DVB—I think that is the acronym. I have to say from what I have heard in the industry, including datacasters, people were pleasantly surprised that the FACTS committee chose the European system rather than the American system, because the datacasters believe that the DVB system is more sympathetic and more flexible for the use of datacasting.
Will that recommendation be dealt with by one of your review committees? What I want to find out is—although the FACTS committee has taken that decision—whether it does go to a review committee. I want to make sure that in public process terms it is not FACTS deciding the digital standard. I want to make sure that in the end—even if it is the correct decision—there is a process where the government will decide that standard on the basis of all the evidence. If someone has a more compelling argument for the American standard or something else, then that can be debated. The issue of picking the right standard—whatever standard or system you pick—does have a major advantage for the Europeans vis-a-vis the Americans, and vice versa. What is the process with that recommendation coming from the FACTS technical committee; how will that be dealt with in your review; when do you expect the review committee to make public its final decision; and will that be the body which announces the one that the government is willing to work with?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—If I can just refer to the FACTS press release. I might say in passing I do not know that it was a huge surprise. There were some suggestions that the networks might have been split between themselves.
—I am sorry—`The data people were pleasantly surprised' was the expression I used.
—If they had looked at international experience, they would have seen that countries with the PAL transmission systems generally went for DVB and the others, SECAM and NTSC, went for ATSC. 
 So in that sense it was reasonably predictable. The answer is that it was merely a recommendation—albeit a unanimous one—of the digital terrestrial television broadcasting selection panel. That panel consisted of not only the commercial networks but also the national broadcasters, ABC and SBS; regional broadcasters; the Department of Communications, Information Economy and the Arts; and the Australian Broadcasting Authority. According to their release, the decision has to be ratified.
—By whom?
—They say:
The recommendation will now be forwarded to the department for its formal ratification and to Standards Australia for formal documentation and public comment.
Then they say:
After ratification of the decision by the department, full development of the detailed standards will now be progressed through industry and Standards Australia committees. Draft standards are expected to be completed by the end of 1998.
It is my recollection—I may be wrong—that at the end of the day the minister formally proclaims it. So you go through all these processes. Presumably you take account of any competing views from other industry bodies, but it looks at this point in time as though it will be relatively uncontroversial. At the end of the day, it is our call.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—On that same point, when the flow-on effects into the actual standards are looked at by the industry bodies and through Standards Australia, can you make sure that the department of communications is represented on the subcommittee of Standards Australia that will be established to look at the issue of drawing up the standards for receivers, et cetera, based on DVB? When the flow-on effect goes down into Standards Australia, it will establish an industry committee to determine the standard for the receiver that has to be manufactured to receive the digital HDTV signal. Standards Australia will round up by some—
—We are on the Standards Australia committee.
—That is fine. I just want that assurance because in the past—as a former minister who had responsibility for some period of time for Standards Australia—there was considerable argument in industry circles about how people actually got on the committee.
—We have got it back on the rails since then.
—No, I got it back on the rails because I had a complete review of the whole issue of standards. I made some significant changes because the industry was complaining that, if you were in the loop, you got on the committee and you might actually make a decision that is useful for your commercial interests rather than for a broader national interest. But if the department is represented on that committee, I think that is a most useful development. I hope the department is proactive on that committee to ensure that the national interest on standards is considered here. That is fine, I am pleased to hear that.
The next issue I want to raise—someone might say that what I am about to raise is contrary to WTO and so on—is that the decision to adopt the DVB, the European system, was not an inconsequential economic decision vis-a-vis the advantage people who manufacture the European systems get in manufacturing, development and so on. Therefore, though we have Labor amendments dealing with industry development plans, before you sign off if you are still the minister, or whoever the minister is, I would want to say that this is a critical decision that some countries always use when they adopt a standard to leverage an industry outcome privately and quietly.
I do not want you to do anything that is contrary to WTO, but we are taking a decision that is going to give some economic advantage to those who are associated with the European system. If you are talking about subsequent industry development in Australia for manufacturing, for R&D development in digital and so on, the Europeans are going to claim this as a considerable victory. They will be waving the flag all over the world saying, `Australia has taken our system. They see it 
 as better than the American system.' Whatever the historical reasons, et cetera, they will be claiming that this is a considerable victory for their system. Therefore, we ought to say to those people, `Yes, and in the industry development plan that means, under the industry plan, that by picking your system, we want you to do the best to get an outcome for manufacturing and R&D development in Australia.'
In the past—this is not a criticism of the government; it is just a general comment—we have often adopted international standards and have not used it to leverage an industry outcome in Australia to our best advantage whereas other countries are quite blatant about saying, `We will adopt a standard that gives us the best internal industry development outcome for investment, et cetera.' I know that you will say, quite rightly, that some of these old arrangements and practices are now outlawed and contrary to WTO, but, as all of us know, smart international lawyers find a way around these things. I just hope, Minister, if you are still in the job, or whoever it may be on all sides of politics, that that is put into the equation. I want to get a response to that.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—The equipment manufacturers are certainly part of the consultative process. As we understand it, some of the major Japanese manufacturers like Panasonic have already indicated support for the DVB standard. I am not sure precisely what you have in mind in seeking to get some leverage from the fact that we have chosen to go down the European path. If, by that, you mean that we should impose higher standards on them or somehow get them to pay a penalty, then I will be interested to see what you have to say when you flesh this out in your press release. But, beyond that, all I can say is, yes, we will be WTO consistent. We will also be wanting to maximise the extent to which equipment is manufactured in this country. Panasonic, for example, do that already. It may well be that this decision will be very helpful in that regard. We hope it is.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—When the decision flows through to the minister of the day to tick it off—I agree with you that there does not seem to be much controversy in Australia at all because of choosing the European standard—does that mean we have to go to some international body to have that standard recognised as the standard we are using for some international broadcasting or industry arrangement? I know that that has happened in other areas. For example, I remember some time ago the spectrum use for satellite broadcasting had to go to an international arrangement where each country, under certain arrangements, had eligibility for a number of satellite slots, et cetera. Those would be agreed to at the international level and were a useful national asset to have, so to speak, on behalf of the community. Once you formally decide the standard, do we have to register that and go and seek agreement with some international body?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—I am not aware of any requirement in this area. Certainly, with the ITU for mobile roaming technologies, it is obviously desirable to have consistency so that the same block of spectrum is available for a particular use as widely through the international community as possible. But this press release from FACTS does not suggest that there is any need to go further than the bodies we have mentioned. I think you can safely assume that we are entitled to make our own decisions on this matter.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—On a final matter, taking Senator Lundy's concerns further, as far as the broadcasting side is concerned and not just the datacasting side, many people during the next decade may choose to put a converter on their present analog television set rather than purchase a new digital set in HDTV form or standard digital. Will the issue of the standard of that converter be one of the issues that the review will look at so there is a general standard for the converters? There will be a big demand for them I suspect. A 
 lot of people may find it cheaper to buy a converter rather than a complete new set.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—I would expect so. Once again, the general principle of interoperability applies classically to set-top boxes and therefore to conversion facilities.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—In relation to set-top boxes, you have expressed the general philosophical approach that we want open access to the interoperability of the set-top boxes. In the review, if it became clear that different broadcasters, whether they be in pay TV, free to air or whichever area, were moving to not have interoperability and open access in the boxes, would you be willing to say that, irrespective of the standard, there has to be open access to the set-top box so that someone does not use the technology to create a natural or near natural monopoly for themselves? That is the major concern we would have.
That again is a regulatory matter on which the ACCC in general regulation over competition policy might rule, but I suspect it is more an issue for the ACA. I would like to get on the record here that it is the government's view, as it is the opposition's view, that if it became apparent that someone was trying to use a technology advantage to create some sort of monopoly by closing off access to the set-top box the government would take action—not in defining what the technology would be but by saying that the box must have open access for new players to come and for others to use it.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—I think what you foreshadow would be an unnatural monopoly. We do not have any more sympathy for those than we do for natural monopolies.
—I take your point. Describe an unnatural monopoly.
—Between the free to air networks, the issue would not arise because the converter box would presumably enable you to access any of those services; in other 
 words, the full suite of commercial television. The issue would probably only arise in terms of access to individual datacasting services. Again, the principle of platforms providing open access is one that will be part and parcel of the reviews. Therefore, we will ultimately have the ability to determine the extent to which there is a need to mandate interoperability.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I hope this is not perceived as a frivolous question, but it goes to the heart of the legislation we are considering. Minister, do you have access to any figures of how big a television screen has to be to perceive a visual difference, in the first instance, between analog and digital TV and, in the second instance, between digital TV and high definition digital TV?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—I am really only talking off the top of my head, and I still think in inches. I think the standard television set is about a 23-inch set. At some of the trade shows, particularly in places like Las Vegas, they have had 51-, 61- and 72-inch sets. I think it is all a matter of gradation. On a standard television set you would still be able to recognise the advantages of digital transmission. The first point of distinction is the aspect ratio, which is currently four to three and it goes to nine to five or something.
—Nine to six?
—It would not be nine to six. That would make the ratio three to two. I have been advised that it is 16 to nine. So you would have a different aspect ratio for a start. Then, as I understand it, there is a ceiling, but if they are out there pushing 72-inch screens at the moment, then presumably it is on the basis that that gives you better aspect resolution than something smaller. I am not sure what the optimum is. What the minimum is before you start to notice a difference, again, I think the industry would probably say that even with the standard size you would notice a difference, but it just gets better the further you go.
Amendments agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—by leave—I move:
(2)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 5 to 7), omit the item, substitute:
1  Section 28
Repeal the section, substitute:
28  Limitation on allocation of commercial television broadcasting licences
The ABA must not, after 25 June 1998, allocate any new commercial television licences in any licence area before 31 December 2006.
(3)	 Schedule 1, item 12, page 53 (lines 22), after ""with"", insert ""up to"".
(4)	 Schedule 1, item 12, page 54 (lines 15 and 16), omit paragraph (a).
These opposition amendments are, I suppose, in one sense, about the most covered issue in the package of digital television, which is the exclusivity period for commercial television—an exclusivity period when no new commercial television licences can be issued. The government proposed that as of the date when they introduced this legislation, back in March I think it was, there be no new commercial television licences issued until 31 December 2008, which would mean that it would take effect from the beginning of 2009. There has been considerable comment from the various players in the media and elsewhere in Australia about the length of time. There has been considerable criticism. I think the Australian Financial Review  wrote an editorial demanding that the minister resign over proposing such a lengthy ban.
The opposition has taken the view that on all the package of issues in the digital bill that the government proposed the issue of the exclusivity period was not absolutely connected in any way to the development of a digital television plan in Australia. Reading the ABA report from July last year, there was no recommendation from the ABA about an exclusivity period for no new commercial licences. That was added to the government's package in private in the last six months when they were obviously in discussion with a commercial television station in Australia. It only came to light when the government announced its package.
Some people have confused the simulcast period with the exclusivity period. They are 
 absolutely separate. At times, the supporters of commercial television networks have not been very careful and have allowed the confusion to take place. Some people believe that the simulcast period is inorganically connected to the exclusivity period. It is not. They are two separate issues. The only justification the government puts forward, and the only justification for the exclusivity period, any time period, is that this would enable the certainty, in commercial terms, of the licences for the existing television operators in that they will be able to recoup the considerable expense they claim they are going to incur for equipment, et cetera.
There is debate about the claims of how much they are up for. We have commented in our minority report that there was differing evidence at the hearings from various people, and it all depended which side of the argument they were coming from. If you did not have a television licence, you basically debunked the amount the television companies were saying they needed to spend to introduce digital television in Australia. This is a matter of judgment about the evidence.
I suspect, not surprisingly, the free to air commercial television stations gilded the lily a fair bit and jacked the price up and those opposed to that view wound it back as far as they could possibly get it. No doubt there is an expenditure required in equipment—in the studio equipment, in the equipment for making new programs in the HDTV format and in the transmitters and translators across Australia. I think it is true that that will run into some hundreds of millions of dollars.
The opposition tried to make a judgment on that evidence and asked, `What is a reasonable period to recover the investment?' We also understood that it is not just a straight economic argument. We have always been strong proponents of local content rules. We want Australian television to have its maximum content produced in Australia, written by Australians, made by Australians, directed by Australians and acted by Australians showing an Australian character, showing ourselves. We want that reproduced on our television screens in the various forms of high quality drama and good enough to be export 
 ed to the rest of the world to show the character of Australia.
Since the content rules were introduced several decades ago, they have been through some changes and have been overwhelmingly successful. Australians do accept that it is good to see Australian programs. They are the highest rating dramas, the highest rating programs, whether they are on commercial or the ABC. The range of quality is from what some call the soaps and so on right through to the highest quality such as a present ABC drama called Wildside. Both commercial and national broadcasters have made the highest quality which has been exported to the world and has given great credit to Australia and brought great recognition to us just beyond the economic return in selling the rights.
It has shown that Australians are capable of being the world's best in production, which has led, of course, to our film industry as well. This is not an economic argument that you can ask someone down in Treasury to draw a line on. It is not just the straight return; it is the broader return that this shows us to be a highly civilised society dealing with major issues of quality, human relations, et cetera.
We accept that commercial television cannot pay for that quality of drama. If we had a completely free market, an open dog's breakfast, where there was an unlimited number of licences available, we would get an endless repetition of junk, whether it was produced in Australia or imported. We believe there is an argument on content alone in the national interest to restrict the number of licences so the revenue base is big enough and there is a range of quality production.
We accept that you are not dealing with, as our good friends in the Financial Review would write, a total free market. They say that, if Australians want to watch it, they will turn it on and the commercials will pay for it. Sooner or later, someone will find a way to keep cutting underneath the cost. I do not think that is an outcome we want.
Therefore, we accepted that, to give that justification for an economic return and some certainty, there should be an exclusivity period, but we did not believe it should be as 
 long as the government has proposed. Therefore, we have moved an amendment that it be reduced by two years to 2006. Also, in our amendment, we have made it very clear that there will be no review before 2006 to possibly extend the exclusivity period. We want people to understand that, if our amendment is adopted by the Senate, that is the exclusivity period. It ends in 2006, and that is it. There is no review written in to say that we will have a look at it in 2004 and 2005 to extend the period.
We accept that there is a review to extend the simulcast period in 2005—it may be extended on the basis of how many people have a digital television set. We want to make that clear to everybody so no-one is under any misapprehension. As far as the opposition is concerned, the exclusivity period ends two years earlier than the government's proposal. There is no review of it, no way to extend it.
People can argue here—I think Senator Margetts might have argued in her general remarks, if she was here—that this period is still far too long. Letters received only this morning from FACTS, not surprisingly, express horror at the idea that the exclusivity period in the opposition's amendment is being reduced by two years. They go on at some length about content, local content, et cetera. I think we have taken account of all of those arguments. Therefore, the exclusivity period, we believe, is about appropriate.
There are purists who say there should be no exclusivity period. I would call them the `Tom Burtons' of the Financial Review, which includes Michael Stutchbury of the Financial Review—the ultimate economic rationalists, as they would describe themselves, and free marketeers. I do not think they understand that we are not starting off with a clean blackboard here. We have existing analog operators who have been granted licences under provisions this parliament has made. If you just say, `On a certain date you will go off air and analog will end. Someone else will pick up the digital broadcasting thereafter,' I think you are asking the consumers of Australia to take an enormous leap. Suddenly they would find, without any warning, that their existing analog screens would 
 go blank and someone else would start broadcasting in digital. That is not something Australian consumers would accept. Although it may be a perfect free market outcome, it is not a practical outcome for ordinary Australian consumers.
We are not in any way ashamed to say that there should be an exclusivity period. And we are not ashamed to say that during the simulcast period, which is a different issue, they should have access to the seven megahertz to do both. When that runs out, they hand the analog megahertz back. We commend these amendments to the Senate. We believe that, of all the arguments that have raged around it, this is the best balance between the interests of stability and investment in the broadcasting industry. It ensures that someone is not given an unnecessarily long access to a rare community resource—that is, the spectrum.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-01,"—The Democrats will be agreeing with this. As Senator Schacht said, there will be some people who think it is a bit long. I think it is a bit long, but I understand the numbers as well as anybody. As I understand it, and as Senator Schacht has said, the commercials are saying that they need the exclusivity period because of the cost to them not only of converting to digital but also of producing the amount of Australian content needed to stay within the law. I accept that there are significant costs in both of those factors.
I would like to see improved Australian content, of course. It will be interesting to see how we go on my amendment later on Australian content. But, as far as the costs go, the ABC's digital plan has been checked by Arthur Andersen. They have agreed that it would cost about $180 million for the ABC to convert. That is because the ABC has metropolitan, regional and rural networks. I suspect the cost of $740 million, all up, between the commercial metropolitan networks is probably a bit high; in fact, it is very high. But it is the case, and we accept this, that it will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars for everybody to convert, so I think that some exclusivity period is reasonable. I 
 think that it is a bit long but I understand that, because the government is now agreeing to it, at least it is a bit shorter than before and I am happy to accept that.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—There is just one other aspect I wanted to mention about this exclusivity period and what our amendment does, which was not in the government's original proposition. I know Senator Quirke will speak on this matter as well because he and I have both been spoken to and lobbied by regional television operators in South Australia who appeared before the Senate committee.
Our amendment does one other thing that the government's original proposition did not do: we have extended the exclusivity period to take into account commercial operators in solus markets, as it is called—that is, markets where there is only one commercial operator. The initial government proposition was that, because they were the only operators in those areas, they should not have the advantage of exclusivity. If someone else wanted to go into those markets to start a second television commercial service, that was a bit of competition. The representatives of GTS4 and SES8 from my own state came along to speak about how they seemed to have been singled out, or had not been given the same advantage as every other television operator. There was some incredulity in the Senate hearing room when the government's response was, `This is because there is no competition in those markets and therefore they are not deserving of it.' A number of people pointed out that we had accepted that we were giving the major advantage of exclusivity to other operators.
The second thing is that those operators, not only in the regional solus markets but in Western Queensland and New South Wales where aggregation has not taken place, operate in commercial markets where the revenue base is very limited. The opposition believed that to say that these operators were not able to get the same protection even though they were the only operator was rather unjust, to say the least. Most of these solus market operators are very heavily connected to the local community. They do a lot of community 
 broadcasting and, as a result, they are some of the better examples of community involvement in television in Australia, which is something you do not see in metropolitan television. Our amendments will give them the same advantage on exclusivity as the aggregated regional markets and metropolitan operators. That is part of our amendment as well. There are other amendments still to come that deal with the solus market on other matters. We will deal with those later on.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-01,"—As Senator Schacht has indicated, there are two of these solus operators in South Australia. They have been around to see us. In fact, they have a very just case. For all the arguments that have been put forward for a period of exclusivity, the two solus operators in South Australia have a legitimate argument for the same claim. You have to start from first principles on this. It is quite clear that in the metropolitan markets we cannot expect hundreds of millions of dollars—as I understand it, it is well over a half a billion dollars—to be invested to bring about the digital revolution in television without some protections.
For all the purists and free marketeers, of which I have been generally described as one, this is a different arrangement. The fact is that we have something like 10 million households in this country and something like 18 million people living in Australia. We will not have the luxury of having an absolutely open market without considerable problems eventuating from it.
When you accept that there has to be a market limitation, that there are already analog licences out there and that we have to set the framework for the new digital television revolution, and when you accept the period, as we do, of exclusivity for the metropolitan markets, the same arguments come out in other jurisdictions where there is only one television player. As a consequence of the arguments the opposition has put forward and what I said in my speech during the second reading debate about this, in the Spencer Gulf region, in Mount Gambier south-east of South Australia and in the golden west around the goldfields in Western Australia—there may be 
 other solus markets that I am not aware of—we cannot expect the two South Australian operators to put in the necessary $31 million investment if they are not given the same period of exclusivity.
I want to talk a little about local content. This is one of many threats to local content in South Australia. Had we not protected the investment that these people are expected to make in digital television, we would have seen local programming and local news services and a number of other things in serious jeopardy. This is not the appropriate place to talk about this. Obviously when the Telstra bill comes before the House, Telstra has a few cases to answer. I am sure that the shadow minister will be flogging it on these issues. It is also not a very good story. I hope these amendments are accepted by the Senate because they will set the basic parameters to protect the investment and the local content in two of the solus markets in my state.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I draw to the attention of the minister an issue regarding the definition of `broadcast' contained within the Broadcasting Act. Given that this exclusivity period relates to those who are in possession of a television licence, the definition of broadcast is obviously inherent to that licence. I am seeking some indication from the minister that the definition of broadcast in the context of the review that will take place prior to the year 2000 will not be broadened in any way so as to further disadvantage those entering into the provision of datacasting services or, indeed, services relating to video on demand. It also includes all those services that currently could, depending on how you feel about it, be easily defined as point to point or point to many or very clear broadcast services.
Video on demand is probably one of the critical points, particularly if the supply side of that video is on continuous streaming and the definition of broadcast becomes increasingly blurred. My point is to ensure that the definition of broadcast in the context of television licence allocation and its relevance to this exclusivity period is not used as a mechanism by which to further preclude the 
 activities of other content service providers between that review and the year 2006.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-01,"—In the absence of the Manager of Government Business, I am obliged to put on the record my concerns. 
—Where is he?
—It does not matter where he is. He does not need to be here if I am here. I am saying what he would have wanted to say, which is that it was our understanding, after discussions, that the likely duration of this debate would be an hour or maybe two. Indeed, Senator Schacht's assessment was that, as far as he was concerned, it would take an hour but that he could not speak for the Australian Democrats and the Greens. I fully appreciate that. I have not taken full account of the number of competing would-be shadow ministers around the place on the other side.
The fact is that Senator Schacht alone has spoken for well over an hour. I think three contributions at least, maybe four, have been made, each taking a maximum of 15 minutes.
—You are provoking me, are you?
—I want you to understand that out of one side of your mouth you say that you want to have the bill pass through in the quickest possible time. You say that you are cooperative and do not want to string it out; you think it will be all over in an hour or so. After almost three hours, however, we are on the second amendment. A large part of the reason for that is that Senator Schacht has spoken for more than 50 per cent of the time. I am simply saying that Senator Schacht should choose his words a bit more carefully in the future. I will move to Senator Lundy's concern.
—I am glad I didn't because you get up and mislead on what I have been saying.
—In every instance I have responded to you. Senator Lundy mentioned broadcasting. There will not be a specific review of the concept of broadcasting. It will obviously be part and parcel of 
 any assessment of what is intended to be meant by datacasting. It is pretty well understood what broadcasting means at present. The issue of new licences to allow traditional broadcasting activities will be obviously ruled out as a result of these amendments.
We have considerable sympathy for the regionals. We understand the additional demands that will be placed on regionals that are converting. It is reflected in the fact that we have given them a three-year period in which to commence the start-up. We thought it made sense to conduct a review before we made final decisions on the arrangements that might be put in place.
In most instances, there was not a direct need to protect the regionals because they have what are probably classic natural monopolies. There have been inquiries conducted by the ABA which have determined that there is not a viable basis for competition. On that basis, we did not think there was any urgency about such statutory protection. We wanted to conduct a review to look at promoting the prospects of competition, particularly in places like Tasmania where, as it stands now, residents only get two services. That is what we had in mind, but we certainly do not downplay the importance of the regional areas.
In terms of the period of exclusivity, there might be arguments at the margin, but I am very pleased that at long last the opposition and others in this chamber have recognised that there are very considerable up-front costs that have to be borne by those that we are requiring to convert—
—We always recognise that.
—I am not sure you have. If you look at some of the campaigns that have been run by the Financial Review , for example—
—It is not part of the opposition.
—I agree with that. Sometimes there is a bit of convergence, but I would not accuse you of being the ultimate dry, so I do not suspect that you had any major input into that editorial, which has to 
 be one of the most over-the- top ideological propositions, demonstrated by the fact that not one person took it seriously. It was met with a universal yawn and sank without trace.
I make the point that, with all the sound and fury that has been out there on this issue, when you boil it down, there has been remarkably little disagreement. Most of that confected outrage has been driven more by concerns about a very narrow agenda, which has probably had more to do with winding back cross-media and foreign ownership than disputing the essential building blocks that are necessary for the digital revolution.
I am pleased that you have supported not only all of those basic principles but, essentially, the need for a sufficient payback period which recognises the very substantial up-front costs in terms of production, transmission, rebroadcasting, the fact that there will, if anything, be a splitting of the advertising revenue, the fact that there is a leakage away from free to air television to the Internet. There are a range of very significant measures which, in our judgment, make it inopportune to be contemplating new entrants when you have not been contemplating them for a period of many years.
As one very senior newspaper manager said to me, `It is no coincidence that we happen to have limited the number of players and at the same time have achieved the highest quality free to air television in the world.' He is in print; he is not in television. But he does not see it as any coincidence, and he is dead right, because there has been this trade-off with local content which, obviously, does cost more than if you had a free market in that area. That has been an acceptable situation probably for 40 years.
To suggest that somehow, at the very time that they are going to face a lot more up-front costs in having to address all these issues, you then allow new players to come in in the short term seems to me—
—You are not talking about Sex/Life  as being one of those high quality programs?
—No, I do not think many others in the community would be, 
 either. I know you are a staunch defender of it. I recognise your right to watch it religiously.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—Order! Senator Schacht, would you mind not conducting a conversation across the chamber.
—He is more into free love than free speech. I simply say that now is not the time to be contemplating new entrants when there are all of those very substantial up-front costs to be borne. At the end of the day that is recognised by the opposition as much as by the government. The only argument at the margin is about the length of the period. No-one can make fine judgments about precisely when you achieve payback, but it seems to us that if you look at the approach adopted in the UK and the US—I do not know whether the Financial Review  has ever done this—they certainly took the view that there would be a very significant payback period and they have gone very much down the path we are proposing to follow.
Amendments agreed to.
Amendment (by Senator Alston) proposed:
(1)	 Schedule 1, page 57 (after line 16), at the end of the Schedule, insert:
Part 11—Regional equalisation plan
64 Regional equalisation plan
	 (1)	 As soon as practicable after the commencement of this clause, the Minister must, by writing, formulate a plan (the regional equalisation plan)  which specifies the measures proposed to be taken by the Minister or the Commonwealth Government:
		 (a)	 to facilitate the provision of commercial television broadcasting services transmitted in digital mode in regional licence areas; and
		 (b)	 to facilitate the provision of datacasting services transmitted in digital mode in regional licence areas by the holders of commercial television broadcasting licences.
Objectives
	 (2)	 In formulating or varying the regional equalisation plan, the Minister must have regard to the following objectives: 

		 (a)	 the objective of maximising the diversity of choice in television services provided in regional licence areas;
		 (b)	 the objective of bringing to regional licence areas a similar range of entertainment and information services as are available in metropolitan licence areas;
		 (c)	 the objective of maintaining the financial viability of the commercial television broadcasting industry in regional licence areas;
		 (d)	 the objective of providing commercial television broadcasting services in regional licence areas that are relevant to, and responsive to, local needs in those areas;
		 (e)	 the objective of discouraging the concentration of media ownership in regional licence areas.
	 (3)	 Subclause (2) does not limit the matters to which the Minister may have regard.
Variation of plan
	 (4)	 The regional equalisation plan may be varied, but not revoked, in accordance with subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.

	 Repeal the subsections, substitute:

	 (2)	 As soon as practicable, the ABA must allocate an additional commercial television broadcasting licence to the existing licensee for the licence area.
6B Subsection 38A(12)
	 Repeal the subsection.
6D Section 73
	 Repeal the section, substitute:
73 Additional licence under section 38A not to result in breach of ownership limits
	 If an additional licence has been allocated under section 38A to the holder of an existing licence, the existing licence and additional licence are to be treated, for the purposes of this Part, as being only one licence.
6E Paragraph 75(1 )(e)

(2)	 Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 11), after item 7, insert:
7A Section 204 (table row relating to refusal to grant an additional period)
	 Repeal the row.
These amendments amend section 38A and section 73 of the Broadcasting Services Act to provide for, on application, the automatic allocation of an additional licence to an existing licensee in an under-served area. We are really ensuring that it is still possible for supplementary licences to be issued.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-01,"—This is an issue which the opposition raised by way of amendment as a result of the Senate committee hearings. It was clear that, in a solus market, if you wanted to provide the consumer with a wider choice of programs, if you issued an extra licence, they would both go broke. The best way to do it is to provide what is already happening in Griffith, where one licensee has two different signals. It means that, when the digital system operates, they will also be able to have a second digital signal to provide two signals. If these operators in solus markets want to apply to have a second signal, they can do so and therefore provide the local community with a broader range of content, without all of them going broke by demanding that a new commercial operator come in 
 in a very limited commercial revenue base. This is an amendment which we raised. We and the government have reached agreement on it. Accordingly, we support the amendments.

(2)	 For the purposes of dealing with the consequences of that non-enactment, the regulations may provide that this Schedule applies in relation to a national broadcaster subject to such modifications as are specified in the regulations.
(3)	 In this clause:
 modifications  includes additions, omissions and substitutions.
This amendment is simply a fail-safe provision to ensure, if the National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997  is not enacted, that there will be sufficient flexibility to manage the process.

Otherwise, it would be helpful if Senator Bourne could perhaps indicate what is intended by this. It says, `After ""operator"", insert ""of the site"".' I have no idea what that means. We can probably deal with that separately from the amendment that I am proposing. If we just follow through on the sheet to the industry plan and the Democrat amendments on ABC and SBS, then I think that will give us time.

(1)	 Page 2 (after line 5), after clause 3, insert:
4  Industry action agenda
(1)	 Not later than 6 months after the commencement of this Act, the Minister for Communications, Information, Economy and the Arts, in consultation with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, must cause to be prepared an industry action agenda to assist the development of the Australian broadcasting electronics industry.
(2)	 An agenda prepared under subsection (1) must be directed towards ensuring the achievement of the following policy objectives:
	 (a)	 the objective that the Australian broadcasting electronics industry be efficient, competitive and responsive to the needs of the Australian community;
	 (b)	 the objective of encouraging investment in innovation and value-adding activities in the broadcasting electronics industry;
	 (c)	 the objective of providing effective support for Australian exporters of broadcasting electronics technology in gaining access to markets; 

	 (d)	 the objective of encouraging technology transfers throughout the broadcasting electronics industry;
	 (e)	 the objective of establishing links between educational institutions and the broadcasting electronics industry to improve the skills base for the industry;
	 (f)	 the objective of promoting strategic commercial relationships between the Australian broadcasting electronics industry and international telecommunications industries.
(3)	 An agenda prepared under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument.
This amendment refers to the industry development plan. It is based on legislation in other areas of government activity and industry activity. I understand the government accepts it and I hope everyone else in the Senate accepts it. The fact that there was no industry development plan available was, I think, a major omission in the legislation when it first came forward. Remember that the expenditure that will take place in Australia as people buy HDTV sets will run into billions of dollars and we will be a major world market. We should ensure that, as much as possible, this equipment, particularly receivers and transmitting and studio equipment, is manufactured in Australia—not just assembled here—and ultimately we should look at ways of doing R&D in new digital forms so that we become a centre of excellence in digital development worldwide and thus create jobs and economic growth in Australia.

I see that it is only five minutes to lunch. There are a few sections of our amendments that I still wish to speak to the government about. If the Senate is happy with it, I might first go into the content, the Blue Sky amendment, which I think everybody has talked about. I would like to make a few points, and that will, I am sure, take us to lunchtime, and then I can speak to the government about my other amendments. I move:
(1)	 Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 11), after item 7, insert:
7A  Paragraph 160(d)
Repeal the paragraph.
Everybody will remember the High Court judgment on Blue Sky where the High Court noted that one interpretation of the act was that equal access might require 50 per cent of Australia's quota being given to New Zealand programs. Of course, if that happened, Australian audiences could see half of their favourite television programs disappear and be replaced by New Zealand programs. Even if that interpretation did not prevail, for every single New Zealand program that gets into the 
 Australian quota there is one fewer Australian program in there.
In addition, of course, New Zealand does already have a generous subsidy scheme available exclusively to its producers because subsidies are exempt from the CER. With their subsidies, New Zealand programs will have a distinct price advantage over Australian programs. In some categories, particularly children's drama, of which New Zealand is a significant producer and Australian networks are not noted for a willingness to pay high prices, one of the greatest fears is that Australian audiences might see all of their Australian children's drama disappear and be replaced by New Zealand programs. I certainly hope that will not happen, but the possibility is there.
In other words, the New Zealand government, which will not regulate to create its own domestic television market, has supported its subsidised producers in an action in our High Court that has allowed them equal access into our domestic market, and that is the flaw. So far, of course, this is just New Zealand. But I think we all know about the all-encompassing multilateral agreement on investment which is looming on the horizon and which our government still apparently intends to sign—and who knows whether we will have a reservation on cultural content? Of course we should have had a reservation on cultural content in the CER, but that did not happen.
The Australian content standard was written with a definite purpose in mind. That purpose was to ensure that Australians will be able to hear our own accents and see our own stories and our own heroes in our largest mass medium. The history of Australian television demonstrates that, before the standard was introduced, there were very few Australian dramas, comedies, children's dramas or documentaries on commercial television. The success of programs like Neighbours, Home and Away, Blue Heelers and Water Rats is built on that content standard.
Most countries in the world have local content quotas. They have them for the same reason we do: not to protect an industry but to preserve their own culture in the face of 
 the enormous pressure from the largest producer of film and television and multimedia in the whole world—the United States. US film and television is now that country's largest export industry. As an English language country, we are particularly vulnerable to that kind of cultural domination.
There is no doubt that television, and its extension in the future digital age, will be the medium through which most Australians experience much of Australian culture. Our successful programs play an important role in reflecting and even in shaping our culture and our society. They help to promote a sense of unity, social cohesion and nationhood. And they show our most recent arrivals that we are in fact a fair and tolerant society which resolves its problems through the processes of justice and democracy. That is in contrast to so many foreign programs where solutions to problems come from guns and violence.
When our television programs are seen in other countries, they show Australia to be a country which is modern, technologically advanced, safe, stable and democratic. That, of course, is of enormous benefit to trade and tourism.
But our successful programs are only able to be exported because our Australian content standard creates a stable and viable domestic market. Any country that does not have a stable or viable domestic market is unable to make and then market programs to the rest of the world. That is the way it is in television production.
The recent High Court decision was a warning. Our Australian content standards are vulnerable.	We know that the government's response to the High Court decision has been to wait and see if the Australian Broadcasting Authority can pull a rabbit out of its hat and find a way to reconcile what appears to us to be irreconcilable. We cannot combine our culture with the culture of another country and still maintain the uniqueness of our own. Solving this dilemma is not a job for the Broadcasting Authority; it is up to this parliament.
For the record, I will take a moment to outline the position of the New Zealand government on this issue as put to me by the 
 New Zealand High Commissioner. The New Zealand government would have liked the Democrats to reconsider our position on this amendment. Their preferred outcome would involve the disputing sides to the debate, the New Zealand and Australian production industries, waiting for the ABA and then debating their findings, getting together and deciding how best they can resolve the issue.
Naturally, the New Zealand government is concerned that the issue will be returned to the High Court if this amendment progresses, but we have received advice that the removal of section 160(d) should not result in a new challenge, and we certainly hope that is the case.
Interestingly, we understand that the New Zealand government has moved to exempt culture from the multilateral agreement on investment. I hope that this government will be considering doing that as well.
The carve-out of culture from GATT, and from treaties like the MAI, demonstrates the importance of culture and its inappropriateness in any trade treaty. But the Democrats are acting in accordance with the original intention to remove culture from the bilateral closer economic relations treaty that we have with New Zealand. We do not believe that culture is a commodity to be traded like primary or other products. We believe that that was an oversight on behalf of the treaty drafters in not exempting culture from the CER, and that is why we are moving this amendment today.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-07-01,"—The 38th federal parliament has been marked by a consistent campaign by the Australian Labor Party to misrepresent and misinform the Australian people about the nature and implications of coalition government policy. The Australian people have a right to expect a standard of accuracy from all of their elected representatives. They have a right to expect that all members of parliament will accurately report other people's positions, 
 the cost implications of government measures and government policy. It is fair game and it is cricket to criticise. It is not fair game and it is not cricket to misrepresent. The Australian people have a right to expect that public discussion of government policy will be free from scaremongering. This standard has not been met by the Australian Labor Party.
I just want to highlight—or perhaps I should call it `lowlight'—the Australian Labor Party's campaign of misinformation and scaremongering. To document every single example would take me far longer than I have today, and I am systematically doing that because it is unbelievable to see their misrepresentation of policy.
Labor's record on economic management when in government was abysmal. They left the incoming coalition with a whopping $10.3 billion debt for one year. On 2 June 1998 we witnessed the spectacle of Gareth Evans's declaration to the gathered media that Australia was experiencing the worst current account deficit ever. In fact, the record deficit was $7.8 billion in March 1995, when Labor was in power. But he forgot to mention that.
Labor has also trumpeted its conversion to fiscal responsibility. In an article in the Melbourne Age on 24 April 1998, the shadow Treasurer was quoted as saying:
As much as we want to reverse the savagery of the Howard-Costello Budget cuts over the last two years, the economic conditions we will confront—especially a likely blow-out in the current account deficit—means that we will have to exercise real budgetary restraint.
Yet, to date, Labor shadow ministers have made unfunded promises worth $6 billion. Every time they make a promise, click, over goes the cash register on the taxpayers' account. The Australian people deserve better than what they are being dished up by the Labor Party.
On 2 June 1998, the opposition leader was interviewed on radio and was asked if he had a credibility problem given the actions of Labor in 1993 when, the interviewer said, `you jacked up a whole raft of wholesale sales taxes'. We did not see great press releases out which said, `Here's the good news: we're going to jack up the wholesale sales taxes' on 
 the things that people do not realise they pay—the wholesale sales tax on pet food, glad wrap, alfoil, confectionery, drinks, cars, hammers and other commodities. No, we did not see them announcing that, but they jacked them up. In answer to this comment, Mr Beazley said:
Well we'll find out . . . and I would dispute your analysis . . . that's Liberal propaganda. . . 
It was propaganda that we said that it was a matter of fact that Labor had put up the wholesale sales tax—that is Liberal propaganda! Mr Beazley made the allegation that the coalition had made up the fact that the wholesale sales tax went from 10 per cent to 12 per cent on items that were taxed at 10 per cent, from 20 per cent to 22 per cent on items that were taxed at 20 per cent, and 30 per cent to 32 per cent on items that were taxed at 30 per cent. What did they score out of that? They reaped $10 billion extra in tax increases, but Mr Beazley said that it was Liberal propaganda.
That is absolutely unbelievable. It is an undeniable fact that the wholesale sales taxes were put up, and the then Labor government reaped $10 billion extra in taxes. They did not bother to tell the taxpayers; oh, no. There it is: wholesale sales tax was jacked up; a hidden tax that a lot of people do not realise they pay was jacked up. And Mr Beazley said that it was Liberal propaganda. What an unbelievable statement! They go on further in these sorts of statements where they just cast things aside. Don't worry about the truth; don't let the truth get in the way of a good Labor propaganda story.
An address that Mr Beazley gave to the Australian Education Union on 23 May was littered with misinformation on coalition funding to education. I will just give a couple of examples: He said:
The effect of this year's Budget is that total spending on all education will fall by 6% between 1996-97 and 2001-02. Spending on schools will fall by 1.3%, though enrolments are expected to be about seventy thousand higher in 2000 than in 1996.
The truth is that Australia's schools received $4.1 billion in the 1998-99 federal budget—an increase of over $153 million, or 3.8 per cent, 
 over the estimated 1997-98 outcome. The last three coalition budgets have provided additional funding for schools of almost $750 million—a 22 per cent increase over Labor's last budget. Don't worry about the truth; just get up and say whatever comes into your head that makes a good story. Truth or no truth—it does not matter. Whatever suits Labor's purposes, they get up and say that it is Liberal propaganda that wholesale sales taxes were put up. I think that is the best of the lot. Going on in his speech, Mr Beazley said:
Nominal funding for government schools this financial year will be $1,289 billion dollars. Discounted for price increases, this works out at $1,193 billion dollars—or nearly ninety million dollars below the level for the last financial year.
What is the truth? The truth is that Commonwealth sourced funding to the government sector in 1998 is expected to increase by $382 million on 1996—Labor's last budget. Funding has increased from $4.68 billion in 1997 to $4.86 billion in 1998. On a per capita basis, funding in the government sector is estimated to increase by some 13.4 per cent from Labor's last budget to the year 2000. In 1996, the per capita Commonwealth funding figure was $1,962 billion; it is now $2,130 billion. So per capita spending on each child in school has gone up. But, no, Mr Beazley made the bald statement that expenditure on education has gone down. The Australian public deserve better than this.
I will turn to the shadow minister for social security and the aged, Ms Macklin. I could do a whole two hours on Ms Macklin and the way she misrepresents the truth. I have already had a go at her about how she scared older people—she spent the whole of October and November scaring older people about our policy. On 13 May 1998, the shadow minister for social security and the aged, Jenny Macklin, issued a press release entitled `National network of 160 rehabilitation services under threat'. She stated:
Just when you thought that it couldn't get any worse for people with disabilities trying to get a job in the new employment services market, the government has introduced a Bill which threatens the quality and accessibility of employment services provided by the CRS. The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service Reform Bill contains provisions which will see the CRS and its network of 
 160 services across Australia partially privatised by 1999.
The truth: the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service will not be partially privatised by 1999. Ms Macklin was wrong when she says that the bill partially privatises the CRS. The bill does not contain any provisions to privatise the CRS in any way. The bill covers administrative measures necessary to establish the CRS as a new organisation dedicated to the delivery of first-class rehabilitation services to its clients.
I can tell you that it has not been doing that. Despite the best intentions of the staff of the CRS when it was under Labor, there was disorganisation, there was a lack of coordination and it did not fulfil its mission. Ms Macklin went on to say:
The effect of this will be felt hardest in the bush, where over 80 of the CRS outlets are based and where the CRS is the only provider of rehabilitation services around for miles.
The truth: there are no plans to withdraw CRS services from current areas. CRS will continue to provide quality services in regional and remote areas under its contractual arrangements with the department.
What else did she say? Ms Macklin said:
And we have to consider just how many of the 1,400 CRS workers the Government intends to sack as a result of this measure.
The truth: Ms Macklin is wrong when she suggests that many of the 1,400 CRS staff will be sacked as a result of these measures. CRS staff will be transferred to the new company under the Public Service Act with their existing entitlements, and they will have mobility rights providing them with the rights of return to the Public Service. Were there any apologies from Ms Macklin? Were there any retractions of the release? No. The Australian public deserves better than this.
What about Labor on child care? One of the more persistent myths peddled by the Australian Labor Party relates to child care. A typical example was found in a press release put out by Senator Neal on 17 May 1998. She said:
The child care sector is in crisis and parents are leaving in droves because they can't afford child care.  

The truth: recent ABS figures show that more women with dependent children are now working either full-time or part-time than three years ago—an increase of 36,000 since April 1995—and the labour force participation has remained stable at around 59 per cent. There were no retractions from Senator Neal. Do not worry about truth getting in the way of a good story. Just say that women are leaving the work force in droves. Do not worry about the ABS statistics; just make up a story that fits your argument whether it is the truth or not.
What about pharmaceuticals? I think one of the most despicable things I have seen was a pamphlet put out by Mr Michael Lee, the shadow minister for health. How can he claim to be the alternative health minister when he frightens older people in this way? The pamphlet was about the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme was increasing at a rate that was totally unsustainable—something like 15 per cent per annum. Drugs that ought to have been available to people with multiple sclerosis and to people with Parkinson's disease—and I think there was one other very expensive drug that was needed for people with advanced breast cancer—were not on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.
By bringing in some of these changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, Dr Wooldridge enabled those drugs to go on the PBS for those people who deserved them—for those people whose whole lives were ruined by their Parkinsonian tremor; for people with multiple sclerosis whose symptoms could be alleviated. Women with advanced breast cancer are able to get a drug. But, no, you do not bother telling the people about that. You do not bother telling them that those measures have benefited some people with profound disease and disability as a result of that disease. No, you did not tell them that.
You put out a nasty and misleading pamphlet which Labor MPs and candidates were encouraged distribute to their electorates. The claim was made:
Under Mr Howard's plan wealthy people will be able to afford the newest, safest and most effective drugs but battling Australians will be forced to 
 make do with the cheaper, less effective and less safe drugs.
Wrong, wrong, wrong; lie, lie, lie. That is what it was: an absolutely outrageous, disgraceful, scaremongering, lying campaign. What are the facts? The suggestion that the benchmark-priced drugs are less effective and less safe was made without one shred of evidence. Mr Lee has not had the good grace to come into the other House and apologise to all the older people he scared by saying that these drugs were less effective and less safe. He has continued to peddle this misinformation, and every single person who distributed one of those pamphlets deserves to be ashamed.
The government engaged independent medical experts to ensure that the medicines affected by the change had very similar clinical effects to others in the same group. The drugs are alike and work just as well as one another for the vast majority of people. A generous and broad exemption is available if people cannot change to a lower-priced drug for clinical reasons. The doctor can make that clinical decision, and those people will be exempt. The exemption is available if the doctor believes that prescribing an alternative drug would cause patient confusion. Was that in the pamphlet? No. So the Labor Party continues to peddle lie after lie, misrepresentation after misrepresentation, and they should be ashamed. The Australian public deserves better than that.
A letter was circulated by a candidate, purporting—pretending—that he is going to represent people in the House of Representatives and lying that we are going to abolish Medicare, lying about the nursing home policy and lying that we have closed down Medicare access in the electorate to the north of mine. I will not deign to name the electorate because I will not give him the credit of being recognised. Dr Wooldridge in the other place has rebutted those claims—those outrageous lies.
Labor has focused its campaign of fear and misinformation on the most vulnerable people in our community. The aged, the sick and struggling families have been the targets of Labor's misinformation campaign. Is it any 
 wonder there is widespread cynicism in our community? Is it any wonder that Australians do not trust politicians? Is it any wonder that One Nation gets votes when Labor continues to behave in the way it does? The Australian people have a right to expect better than misinformation and misrepresentation from their elected representatives.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1998-07-01,"—My question is to Senator Vanstone representing the Attorney-General. Can the minister confirm that there are at least four agencies within the Attorney-General's portfolio with vacant office space on leases ranging up to 2007? Is the minister aware that the Human Rights Commission has vacated 1,200 square metres in central Sydney but remains liable to pay $2.71 million until expiry of the lease in 2004; or that the Australian Government Solicitor remains liable to pay $5.65 million until 2002 in the Sydney CBD, $471,000 until 2002 in Darwin, $1.34 million until 2006 in Adelaide's CBD, and $1.52 million until 2007 in the Melbourne CBD; or that the Australian Protective Service remains liable to pay $481,000 until 1999 on a property in Kingston ACT; or that the Federal Court remains liable for vacated Industrial Relations Court premises in Sydney at a cost of $83,000?

 this gross waste of money on empty offices in this portfolio possibly be defended?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Attorney-General's Department: Vacant Office Space</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-07-01,"—I thank the senator for her question. She has obviously done a significant amount of research to prepare that question. She nods in appreciation. I hope she is nodding truthfully, and has not simply accepted work someone else has done on her behalf. If she has done that work, then good luck go to her. It would not be a surprise to you, Madam President, to know that I do not have a brief on the vacant space through the Attorney-General's Department, as I am confident a number of other ministers would not have, but I will seek some advice for the senator in regard to that matter and get back to her.
What I can say is that I am absolutely confident that the Attorney-General's Department, along with all other departments, are managing their property services—to the extent they have control over them—as best as is possible. Sometimes as a consequence of policy changes, sometimes as a consequence of a change in size of an organisation—going up or down and needing different accommodation—there can be vacant space in any organisation. The key requirement of course is to properly manage one's responsibilities and liabilities. The Commonwealth is no different from another lessee of space in that, when the space is no longer required, it cannot just walk away from a contract; it has to live up to its contractual obligations. That, of course, means managing one's property responsibilities as best one can. I am confident we are doing that. I am confident that this government would be doing it across the board far more efficiently and effectively than the previous government. As to the specifics, I will seek some information for the senator.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Attorney-General's Department: Vacant Office Space</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-07-01,"—I regret that the senator was obviously not listening to the answer or perhaps does not understand the contractual arrangement that one might enter into when one leases property. Perhaps the senator thinks that the Commonwealth can be a bad renter or client in that respect and just walk away and not pay up. Perhaps the senator thinks that where there is vacant space that can be just turned into cash overnight and that the Commonwealth responsibilities can somehow be removed with a magic wand. The plain facts are that where the Commonwealth has entered into a contract it is liable under that contract. And, as with any other business that moves from one premises to another for whatever appropriate reasons, there may then be a vacant space not taken up that has to be paid for until it can be sub-let or alternative Commonwealth uses made of that space. Senator, for you to simplistically assume that you can take the cost of vacant space, turn it into cash and spend it on something else is naive in the extreme.

"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-07-01,"—Yesterday in question time, Senator O'Brien asked me a question, on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in regard to pig industry assistance. I referred that question to the minister and I now have a response which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
I refer to yesterdays question from Senator O'Brien regarding a press release from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy entitled, ""Government Announces Pig Industry Assistance.""
The media statement said;
""The Government has decided to correct a surprising administrative anomaly it identified when looking at the safeguards issue.""
""The previous Labor Government inexplicably failed to include such a safeguard mechanism in legislation introduced into parliament at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1994.""
Senator O'Brien questioned whether, ""the Minister agrees that the claim that legislative amendments 
 were required was no more than a delaying tactic by the government.""
Senator O'Brien, the minister never claimed that LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS were required, he merely highlighted the fact that the previous Labor government failed to avail itself of implementing such a mechanism, when logic suggested it should have been included in 1994 with the associated legislation.
That is precisely the point, Senator O'Brien, the previous Labor Government INEXPLICABLY FAILED to nominate a body to conduct such safeguard investigations, or even to make any mention of safeguards action, at the time.
Indeed at the Senate Estimates Committee on Wednesday 10 June, Senator Cook was questioned on the issue of implementing safeguard mechanisms during the previous—Labor government, and I quote from the transcript.
Senator Hill—Who was it who missed this important opportunity to safeguard Australian industry?
Senator Cook—Well, the argument is whether an important opportunity did go past to safeguard the Australian industry.
Senator Hill—And are you arguing it did not.
Senator Cook—I do not know. I was not in charge of this part of the legislation at the time.
Senator Hill—Are you washing your hands of your government's failure.
Senator Cook—No, I am not. I am absolutely sure we focused on this at great length in cabinet. I am sure we devoted a whole day to debating it.
Senator Hill—Anyway, we can be assured that you will cooperate with the current government now.
Senator Cook—I am pretty sure you will find that we will cooperate with the current government on this initiative.
I would pose the question, was the Labor Government short sighted or did it choose to ignore the issue.
I would also pose the question to Senator O'Brien whether he has discussed with Senator Cook how he plans to cooperate with this government on this initiative.
The Government on discovering this INEXPLICABLE FAILURE to nominate a body to conduct such safeguard investigations, set about rectifying this problem as quickly as possible and I AM PLEASED TO SAY that WE HAVE FIXED the problem without the need for specific new legislation.
The fact of the matter is that the safeguards mechanism can be put in place via specific legislation or regulation, or through incorporation of the mechanism into existing domestic law. Given the 
 commitment of this Government to address the pig industries concerns we have put in place the general procedures as an urgent priority, in a manner fully consistent with our WTO obligations.
In regard to Senator O'Brien's fallacious accusation that the government has used delaying tactics, I am pleased to assure him that is not the case, as is evidenced by the speed with which these procedures have been put in place
Indeed, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has today welcomed the finalisation of the reference from the Treasurer to the Productivity Commission for an inquiry into imports of uncooked pork and the profitability and competitiveness of the pig farming, pigmeat and processed pigmeat industries.
""The inquiry will examine whether safeguards action is warranted against imports of—frozen pigmeat under the WTO safeguards arrangements.
The industry asked for this inquiry and the Government has met the industry's request by setting up the required procedures for safeguards inquires and now initiating an investigation into pigmeat imports.
""It is now up to the industry to make submissions to the Commission and to present it with the evidence that substantiate its claims that safeguards measures on imports could be justified under the WTO Agreement. This is now industry's responsibility"",
The Government has swiftly and decisively responded to the requests of the pig industry, and in the process it has yet again identified the previous Labor governments failure to exercise our legitimate rights under the WTO, in this case having a safeguard mechanism in place.
The accusation by Senator O'Brien that, ""the 140 day reporting date for the productivity commission report is a ploy to delay any government decision until after a possible election"" is noting more than blatant political opportunism.
Senator you are purporting to have a genuine interest in rural Australia when all that you are really doing is promoting yourself within your party for your own ends, with scant regard for the gravity of this issue.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Pork Industry</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer

—The notice of motion is self-explanatory and will clearly be dealt with tomorrow. I wanted to add a couple of points to it by way of statement.

It will be clear from reading the proposal that the maximum time has been allocated to government business, although there are allocations for question time and taking note.

I also indicate that committee reports could be tabled during the week. But we indicate now that the government would not be of a mind to grant leave for motions to take note.

There has been no discussion with the opposition on these matters. There has been no discussion with us about the prospect of our sitting late on every one of the nights next week, bar Wednesday. I think we are entitled to have an explanation as to what it is that the government is intending to debate, what the legislative program is that the government is proposing to put before the parliament which would justify the extension of hours that it is seeking.
I think we are also entitled to have an explanation as to what the government intends to do in regard to supplementation for staff and the other resources that are required to bring personnel to Canberra so that we can maintain orderly operations as required by our parliamentary responsibilities. I gather that the government, given that it has introduced this measure and given notice on this unilateral basis, intends to proceed whether we like the measures being proposed or not.

Motion, as amended, agreed to.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Brown has just come in here like a walking billboard with a `No dams' sign all over him. I ask you whether that is breaching any standing order. If it is, could you ask Senator Brown to remove it.
—On the point of order, today is the 15th anniversary of the High Court decision which saved the Franklin River. I was just celebrating—no harm meant. I am happy to take down the placard if it offends the honourable senator.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-01,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 1191.
I have moved this motion because this is an urgent matter. The people of West Papua, or Irian Jaya, as the Indonesians call it, have been dispossessed of their freedom since the Indonesian paratroops dropped in in 1962. At the behest of people condemning this action from right around the world, there was a sham act of self-determination whereby some 1,000 representatives from different groups in the West Papuan countryside were brought together and, under the watchful eye of the army, given the opportunity to vote for integration with Indonesia in 1967, but that was the end of it. Since then, the people of West Papua have had their freedom suppressed.
There has been extraordinary repression of their culture and their indigenous way of life. There has been a takeover of vast areas of the more productive parts of their lands—without the people having a say—by loggers and by thousands of transmigrants from Java and elsewhere to their west in Indonesia. To highlight the awesome difficulties that these people face, let me quote from the Guardian Weekly of just four weeks ago:
Amungme tribal leader Yosepha Alomang, a mother of 10, should be in Britain. But as she boarded the plane this month in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, to head for London and the Rio Tinto annual meeting, she was stopped by the military.
Had she come, Ms Alomang would have told the mining firm's corporate shareholders a harrowing tale of torture at the hands of the authorities. Four years ago she was imprisoned without charges, sexually abused and threatened with being shot. Held for a month in a filthy room, she was made to eat her own faeces. 

Ms Alomang is one of many outspoken critics of the huge Freeport copper mine, high in the mountains of Irian Jaya, which is part-owned by Rio Tinto. For years the mine has been the centre of well-documented human rights violations against indigenous groups.
And I might add that within recent months there has been the shooting of a number of West Papuans on their own lands, in the vicinity of this giant Freeport copper mine owned by an international cartel with its head office in the United States. It is time the suppression of the rights of West Papuans was matched by an opening up of their plight to world view and a renewal of the debate about their freedoms. That is what my motion urgently seeks to do.
I have watched in horror, since I was a youth in 1962, not only at the way these people have been suppressed, but also—and this the worst thing of the lot—their case for freedom and their fight for self-determination, their culture and their lands being taken off the pages of world discourse, not least by successive Australian governments. Australia, by and large, has refused to even recognise the plight of people fleeing from West Papua to Papua New Guinea. We have, therefore, refused them access to asylum in Australia simply because they are classed as Indonesians, which they are not; they are West Papuans. Our nearest neighbours, along with the East Timorese, are suffering similar repression, torture and, really, genocide in terms of the definition of that word by the United Nations. It is an horrific story.
We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the plight of these, our nearest neighbours. They are in a terrible position. They do not have international defenders. Their issue has been suppressed. Part of the reason that this motion should be declared formal so that it can be brought before the Senate and voted on before the Senate rises for what is ostensibly a long break leading to an election, is that at this critical time, with West Papuans demonstrating in Jakarta and elsewhere, we need to give them some support, some international backing and the force of humanitarian thinking that they have deserved for so long. Many of the students from West Papua have been recently protesting in Jakarta 
 against what they say is the loss of 400,000 lives in their home country since the paratroopers arrived in 1962.
It is a cause that has been out of the public eye for too long. It is a cause that deserves world attention and indeed, condemnation. But more importantly, this motion calls for the people of West Papua to at last be given a proper, democratic act of self-determination.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I did listen closely to Senator Brown's case for urgency and I must say that if he had developed his case in relation to the government's mismanagement of its own legislation program, I think it may well have been more telling. It is extremely difficult, at the moment, for the Senate to understand what the government's priorities are in relation to the government's own legislation program. We had the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Ian Campbell) on his feet in the chamber a short time ago, unable to explain to the Senate why the government is proposing to have the Senate sit an extra week; unable to inform the Senate what legislation was likely to be dealt with in these five extra sitting days that the government is proposing that the Senate sit. It is those sorts of issues, along with the substantive ones, Senator Brown, that the opposition would give consideration to in this motion of urgency.
On balance, I think the opposition's view would be that we cannot support the urgency motion that Senator Brown has moved. I want to say, for the record, on the substantive issue that the approach of the opposition to the issue of Irian Jaya is, of course, set out in a resolution that was adopted by the Labor Party at its national conference in January of this year.
For the benefit of the Senate, I will outline what that resolution says:
In the light of Australia's support for the United Nations International Decade for the World's Indigenous Peoples, Labor supports the right of the people of Irian Jaya to develop their own distinctive culture and institutions, and expresses its concern about government and commercial activities such as unrestrained logging, mining, transmi 
 gration and expropriation of lands that impact negatively on local communities.
Labor notes reports of social unrest, environmental damage and human rights abuses associated with the activities of the Freeport mine, and urges the Australian government to ensure that Australian companies conducting operations in Irian Jaya fully respect the rights and traditions of local communities and develop and observe appropriate codes of conduct.
This resolution goes on to urge the Australian government, particularly through the government's aid program, to provide more support to local communities and non-government organisations to enable them to better protect their interests and rights.
I also inform the Senate that the resolution passed by the Labor Party's national conference concludes by calling on the Indonesian government to respond to concerns regarding conditions in Irian Jaya by allowing unhindered access by independent media and humanitarian and human rights organisations. The Labor Party went on to urge the Australian government to send a parliamentary mission to Irian Jaya to observe the situation and needs of the Irian Jayan people, including with regard to the adequate provision of drought relief, and to consult with local communities on how Australia can better assist their development.
These are important issues. Senator Brown says to the Senate that these are very significant issues. We agree that they are. The Senate now has to decide whether this motion of urgency to suspend the standing orders of the Senate ought to be supported. On balance, given that we are faced with a government totally incapable of managing the Senate's legislation program and completely divided in relation to its approach on the important national issues of the day—preferences for the One Nation Party, the privatisation of Telstra and the imposition of a GST—we have to see what the government has to say for itself. It is for that reason that we oppose the motion of urgency. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>WEST PAPUA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-01,"—The Australian Democrats are and always have been concerned about West Papua along with East Timor and, particularly, Aceh in Indonesia. This is probably an 
 important topic to discuss with some reasonable urgency. I do not think it would take the Senate very long—we have heard quite a bit already about the substantial topic—to vote on the motion if we believed it to be urgent. I am not averse to voting for this urgency motion, because I think it would be dealt with very quickly.
The self-determination of any peoples anywhere is dear to the Democrats' hearts. As we all remember, West Papua had a vote. It was one of the very first that was ever carried out by the UN. Even the UN will now tell you that it was not the West Papuans' finest hour. Obviously, if we want a true vote for self-determination in West Papua we have to do it properly and we have to do it again. The Australian Electoral Commission is an expert at doing these things. It is invited all around the world to carry out votes in countries which are not used to having democratic votes. We could certainly request the Australian Electoral Commission to assist in such a vote. I am sure that it would do it and do it very expertly.
We believe that we should be looking at the current situation in West Papua. It is still a situation which needs review. There are still observations of torture and problems with disappearances. There are still problems not only around the mining areas but in several other areas. Aceh is another area that needs looking at. I am pleased to say that the Senate remains focused on East Timor. We support the urgency motion because I do not think it would take very long, if we did agree that it was urgent, to get a vote on the substantive motion.",SENATE,<title>WEST PAPUA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-07-01,"—The government opposes the motion to make this a matter of urgency, and not for the silly and spurious reason that Senator Faulkner raised in his diatribe. We are well used to Senator Faulkner standing up and generally lashing out vigorously on every opponent he sees. As a former manager of government business, he was quite notorious for the mismanagement of government business in the Senate. To be quite frank, for him to be standing up and giving lectures to others is quite absurd.
—You were such a good manager that you got sacked.
—I got promoted, actually.
—You got sacked, I thought.
—This former failed minister for the environment continues to butt in. His record does not bear close examination. Senator Faulkner is the only minister for the environment to lose the green vote. Mind you, he had a pretty good opponent, if I remember correctly. It was a real achievement on Senator Faulkner's part to lose the green vote at the last election.
I will not get diverted. We oppose this being made a matter of urgency. There is a very heavy program before the Senate.
—What is it?
—Senator Carr is the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate. No wonder John Cain mentioned Senator Carr's performance in his book. That comment causes no surprise. There are many vehicles available to Senator Brown if he wishes to debate a motion of this type. He can use what is available to him in the Senate procedures. The fact is that he has not bothered to use them. Therefore, we will not be supporting the suspension to make this a matter of urgency.",SENATE,<title>WEST PAPUA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-01,"—This matter is urgent not only because of human rights issues but also because this is the right time in history to deal with it. The transition in government means that Australia can play the right role in relation to Indonesia and support self-determination for those areas taken over in the 1970s. No less a radical spokesperson for human rights than Robert Menzies made very strong and clear statements about West Papua. These concerned whether Indonesia had the right to take the action it did and the role of the colonising powers in relation to West Papua. We have had similar statements from spokespeople regarding other actions by Indonesia in the 1970s, including war veterans. However, in relation to Irian Jaya, it is right that the Senate deals with this issue. It is right that we have the opportunity to debate 
 it or take it to a vote. I support the motion for the suspension of standing orders.",SENATE,<title>WEST PAPUA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-07-01,"—First, let me respond to Senator Kemp's remarks. He implied that management of this place was easy. He was only given the job for a few months. You should reflect back, Madam Acting Deputy President. When the Howard ministry was first formed, even though he was a shadow minister, he did not make the ministry. He missed out, if you like, on the November draft and was picked up in the March draft after a few ministerial resignations. So his own Prime Minister (Mr Howard) did not rate him too highly. He made him a parliamentary secretary and Manager of Government Business. The only way to get rid of him as Manager of Government Business, as he was so incompetent, was to promote him into the ministry. He took Senator Short's spot, so he no longer managed government business. This was one of the few moves by the Prime Minister that we welcomed. Little did we realise that Senator Campbell also would not be up to the mark.
I think we have a problem as a chamber with constantly carrying resolutions on foreign affairs that are eventually transmitted to countries, day in, day out on a very selective basis. Yes, we care about self-determination in East Timor, and apparently in West Papua. What about the Polisario in the Western Sahara or the Albanians in Kosovo and so on?
—Move the motions then.
—I am told, `Move the motions.' In the general disposition of powers and influence, the running of foreign affairs is usually left to the executive. The Senate can express a view. We have at least said, in one element of consistency that Senator Brown will not agree with, that we do not believe these resolutions should go forward without debate, because not all aspects of them would necessarily be agreed to, but some aspects might be. Therefore, the only point we now have to consider is whether this matter is urgent.
Senator Kemp said that there are other more urgent matters, that the government's legislative program is more urgent. I wonder how Senator Brown reacts to that. Senator Brown, 
 do you know what this urgent government program is? Have you been sent a letter saying, `We want X amount of bills passed'? Have you been told what is coming on next week? I tell you what: if you have been told, you are well in advance of the rest of us. All we saw was the discourtesy of bringing in a notice of motion today, saying that we would sit all of next week. I do not mind sitting all of next week, but what sort of preparation time can we have? Absolutely none. We do not know what is coming up next week. We have got no idea. Maybe we will give your motion priority next week, Senator. The issue of self-determination for what you term West Papua has been around for 36 years.
—When was it last debated here?
—I have no idea when it was last debated here. Again, I do not know that a chamber composed like ours should be sending off some new foreign affairs resolution every day. You want this issue progressed. You want this matter investigated. I do not know about my colleagues, but I will try to influence them. When you put forward terms of reference for an inquiry by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade or the Senate committee, if this is an important issue, I will do my best to convince my colleagues to have these matters examined in depth and reported to the Senate. That will be far more effective than a one-off motion which slides through and which is then sent to the ambassador of their government. They scratch their heads, saying, `Who is the Australian Senate? Is it the government or is it not the government?' As such, their knowledge of the Australian political system may not be what we desire, but it all comes back to the fact that Senator Brown has not made out a case for urgency.
One must say that he put up a much better performance than the rather pathetic performance put up by Senator Kemp. He could not indicate to us, after we finish dealing with the digital television legislation, what this chamber is going to do tomorrow, on Friday and for five days next week. You have not got a clue; if you have, you are being deceptive. You are not telling anyone, so that they can 
 prepare, what sort of legislation will confront us next week. You would not have a clue.
Where is the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Ian Campbell)? Why isn't he here to explain why this matter is not urgent and what more urgent matters he has got? He is not here. We have not heard the argument but, on balance, as our leader, Senator Faulkner, said, the case for urgency has not been made out.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-07-01,"—There is something very wrong in the state of affairs in Mr Oldfield's One Nation party. Increasingly, it appears that the Prime Minister has entrapped himself between Senator Lightfoot and a double dissolution race.
The spectre of racism has risen its head in this nation due to both the negligence and recklessness of the Liberal and—I must include, because he asked me to—the National parties. For the record, we should be absolutely precise about how racism found a vehicle for political expression in this country through—
—On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: under no circumstances did I ever ask Senator Woodley to say that the National Party was racist or the coalition was racist. That is just a blatant untruth. Would you withdraw that, Senator Woodley, please?
—Senator Boswell, there is no point of order.
—I withdraw whatever offends Senator Boswell. For the record, we should be absolutely precise about how racism found a vehicle for political expression in this country through Mr David Oldfield's machiavellian and Svengali-like pursuits.
On 10 September 1996, when the member for Oxley made her first speech, the Prime Minister remained silent and, we now know, politically impotent on the issue. Gone was his decisiveness on guns in response to the Port Arthur tragedy. What is so remarkable 
 about this, and we should never forget it, is that Mr David Oldfield's racist One Nation Party is, and always will be, a child born out of the Liberal Party of Australia.
The government will no doubt be quick to say that if the Wik 10-point plan had been passed by the Democrats then all of this could have been averted. What the Prime Minister is really saying is that if only the Democrats had been prepared to rip rights off Aboriginal people, then David Oldfield's One Nation would not have happened; if only the Democrats were prepared to wipe out the property rights of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, then David Oldfield's One Nation would not have happened; and if only the Democrats were prepared to treat Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders as third-class citizens then David Oldfield's One Nation Party would not have happened. Well, Madam Acting Deputy President, the Australian Democrats are simply not prepared to use the indigenous people of this nation as a human shield against the attack on the coalition by the One Nation Party.
So how did One Nation happen? That is the question. It happened because, in 1996, the Liberal Party of Australia, through a sloppy preselection process, endorsed Pauline Hanson as a candidate. It happened because, despite the dis-endorsement of Ms Hanson before the election, she still appeared on the ballot forms as a Liberal Party candidate. It happened because, 10 months after the member for Oxley had made her blatantly false and racist first speech, the Prime Minister finally and belatedly—and reluctantly—began to refute those inaccuracies. It happened because the member for Warringah, Mr Tony Abbott, did not have sufficient control or supervision over Mr David Oldfield when he worked for him. It happened because, during the Queensland state election, the Liberal and National parties made a clear and conscious choice to direct preferences to Mr David Oldfield's One Nation Party ahead of Labor. If they had not done so, One Nation would have won only one, at most two, but certainly not the 11 seats that they did win.
Let me here and now also disavow any coalition senator who may be still entertaining 
 the fantasy that to speak out against Mr David Oldfield's One Nation Party is to provide Mr Oldfield and the member for Oxley with further publicity. That simply will no longer wash with the Australian community. Clearly, the racist genie—or is that the racist Pauline—is well and truly out of the bottle, and it is now incumbent upon people who crave democracy and justice to defend what I regard as honest Australian values to the teeth. To do less under the present circumstances is to give your consent to the policies of David Oldfield's One Nation.
It is massively dishonest of the Prime Minister to claim that the Senate has held its legislative program to ransom. The Senate has passed and improved well over 350 bills, and only three have been rejected—and then only on the basis of their injustice and lack of fairness. Let me put on the record once and for all that the Prime Minister cannot threaten the Democrats with a double dissolution election, for we will not back down on Wik, we will not compromise our stand on racial equality in this country, we will not treat indigenous Australians as third-class citizens, and we will not be intimidated by shady and shadowy figures of organisations such as David Oldfield's One Nation.
As we all know now, the next election will really be about control of the Senate and will, because of David Oldfield's One Nation and the Liberal Party, be a race election. For the last 21 years, the Democrats have brought consistency of policy and integrity to everything we do. We have guaranteed supply to both Labor and coalition governments. Despite that, we hear that some coalition members would prefer to deal with One Nation instead of the Democrats.
At the launch at lunchtime today of the immigration and population policy, and what is euphemistically called the social cohesion policy, of David Oldfield's One Nation, the member for Oxley and Mrs Robyn Spencer, David Oldfield's Senate candidate for Victoria, made a number of offensive and inaccurate statements. They said that ethnic leaders are part of the problems we face in this country; they said that children born of refugees should be denied citizenship; they 
 said that Australia should not become Asianised; they said that 70 per cent of Australia's present immigrants are from Asia; they said that the real figures for immigration are in fact double what the government alleges.
No facts were offered to support these figures. Their other policies are quite plainly and simply racist. But not only that, despite their claims, they are manifestly unchristian. It is a consistent theme of the Old and New Testaments, as I have consistently pointed out in this place, that we should care for refugees and migrants. Consistently over and over again is that statement made.
Last year when the Democrats refused to enact legislation that denied migrants access to social security for two years, the major parties voted together to defeat our moves. This is racial discrimination. The so-called larger parties of this parliament chose less than a year ago to give succour to a policy that David Oldfield's One Nation Party embraces.
Let me plainly put on the record that the strength of the Australian nation in the view of the Australian Democrats has been our success at enshrining multiculturalism within this country. We repudiate the White Australia policy that David Oldfield would seek to revive in this land. We can never be complacent again about this rising tide.
People need to know that, despite the dishonesty of the coalition's rhetoric on Wik, the High Court found in favour of pastoralists. Let us note from today's press that Mr Donald McDonald, the National President of the National Party knows this full well. He understands that there is no problem for pastoralists; why else would he pay out $4 million for a Queensland cattle property subject to native title claims?
You cannot help thinking that the issue of Wik would have been settled by now if the coalition had stayed out of the debate altogether, and you cannot help wondering who is running the country: Senator Lightfoot, Richard Court, Shane Stone or whom? The speculation over leadership from within the Liberal Party is all over the corridors of Parliament House. It is like the dying days of 
 Bob Hawke's prime ministership. The Australian Democrats ask the Prime Minister to come clean and once and for all truly distinguish himself from the party that his inaction has created—David Oldfield's One Nation Party.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>One Nation Party</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-07-01,"—The federal coalition in the Senate is on the public record as opposing the divisive and impractical policies of One Nation and their leader from the very earliest times. Senator O'Chee and I have stood in this place and in other public forums that were available to us and explained time and time again how One Nation is bad for Australia, and particularly bad for regional Australians. I have gone to great lengths to point out that One Nation is fatally flawed because of its connections with the far right groups.
The unwholesome stain of the far right cannot be washed out by denying that it exists. The facts are on the table that two state presidents of One Nation have connections with the League of Rights. The Victorian president has addressed two League of Rights functions and the Queensland president has been published in the League's literature. One Nation is not run by ordinary Australians who say what we all really think. One Nation is run by extraordinary Australians who say what the far right and David Oldfield want us to think.
One Nation has come a long way since the first sparks from the One Nation leader's maiden speech. It has become a bushfire threatening to consume the very person it was built around—the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It is important to note that the flames of the One Nation fire have been fanned not only by the cynical manipulators and the far right but by the actions taken in this very chamber.
The proposer of this MPI, in particular, has done much to aggravate the situation. The hours of abuse and slander heaped on the bush by the smaller Senate parties during the marathon Wik debates have brought the bush to boiling point. They seethed under the ill-informed comments of people like Senator Woodley, who profess to be friends of the 
 farmers. By blocking the native title legislation, by incorrectly branding pastoralists as wealthy and guilty of racism and bad treatment of Aboriginals and by seeking to restrict farming activities, these minor party senators have caused untold grief and anger in the bush.
This MPI is a cynical attempt on their behalf to escape the rightful blame for pushing the bush into a corner. Just as it was the Senate Nationals who stood up for the bush families through the native title debates, it is the Senate Nationals now who have been on the front foot exposing the fallacies of One Nation. This has not been an easy task. It is hard times, people look for easy answers and there aren't any.
So far, One Nation has burnt up one conservative government and installed Labor in power in Queensland. The first cab off the rank in congratulating Peter Beattie was the sex industry, which is pushing for changes to the prostitution laws. Is this what the people of rural Queensland voted for when they voted for One Nation? I don't think so. Did they vote to install the very leftist Dean Wells as education minister? I don't think so. Who will look after the bush now in Queensland—Henry Palaszczuk, a school teacher and the suburban Labor member for Inala? Definitely not.
One Nation is a political movement offering everything and delivering nothing. It has been waylaid by strange forces and power hungry men from Sydney in slick suits. It trades off state presidencies and Senate spots for access to extremist networks.
I wish to conclude my comments by once again referring to the hypocrisy of the Democrats in bringing on this MPI. They seem to have forgotten their role in electing the member for Oxley. In doing so, the Democrats helped give birth to the One Nation phenomenon. As Laurie Oakes wrote in the Bulletin in September last year:
The Australian Democrats, despite their holier-than-thou attitude, were pivotal in her election in the first place. Even after the offensive comments about Aboriginal people that caused Howard to insist on Hanson's expulsion from the Liberal Party during last year's election campaign, the Democrats did not direct preferences against her. They stuck 
 to their double-sided how-to-vote card preferences to Labor on one side, to Hanson on the other and helped her get over the line. Cheryl Kernot and her colleagues should be embarrassed and ashamed.
In light of his comments here today, Senator Woodley owes the Senate an apology and an explanation as to why he went along with the decision to give preferences to Hanson. Perhaps if he had stood up for his principles then, we would not be debating this MPI today.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>One Nation Party</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-01,"—As far as the Labor Party is concerned, we say that One Nation is a blot on the Australian political landscape. It feeds on paranoia; it functions on paranoia; it runs hard on policies about the evils of immigration—evils that are non-existent; and it promotes destructive, racist perceptions about Australia's indigenous people. While One Nation gains succour from people who feel left behind by the changes in our society, the One Nation party does not have a clue about how to address these issues—and, of course, it does not want to.
One Nation's party structure is totalitarian, with tight control of information and with regular purges of personnel. David Oldfield's and Pauline Hanson's One Nation is a very unpleasant outfit, and yet One Nation's existence owes everything to the Liberal Party. One Nation has flourished, as no other embryonic political party in this nation has ever flourished, and it is all thanks to one man—John Howard, the Prime Minister.
Contrary to what the Prime Minister and Mr Andrew Robb said at the time of Ms Hanson's disendorsement from the Liberal Party during the 1996 election campaign, we now know that her disendorsement was a unilateral decision of the former director of the Queensland state division of the Liberal Party, Mr Jim Barron, and former Queensland Liberal Party president, Mr Bob Tucker. The Prime Minister's office tried to rewrite history by claiming that John Howard intervened, but this weak and snivelling caricature of a Prime Minister did not intervene. He did nothing of the sort.
—I rise on point of order. It is not an appropriate way for either party to refer to the Prime Minister. I ask that you ask the senator to withdraw it.
—I believe those remarks are out of order, Senator Faulkner. Would you care to withdraw them?
—If they are out of order, I will withdraw them, Madam Acting Deputy President. The Prime Minister let Pauline Hanson escape from the political starting barriers, and he let her go from strength to strength. Mr Howard's ideological soul mate, the member for Warringah in the House of Representatives, Mr Tony Abbott, gave Mr Oldfield his springboard into politics. He gave him his springboard into political infamy by employing him as an adviser and also, as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, by giving him a mobile phone. But once legitimised in parliament, Ms Hanson made her infamous first speech which is now recognised on nearly every ultra right-wing web site around the world.
That was a speech that sent shock waves around Australia's body politic, because here was a former candidate for the Liberal Party of Australia now legitimised as a member of the House of Representatives, uttering the rhetoric of, until now, marginalised white supremacist groups. The Prime Minister's silence on this matter was deafening. He would not even utter her name, let alone criticise her. In fact, he glorified in her right to express these points of view.
What about the speech that he made to the Liberal Party faithful in Queensland on 22 September 1996? He said:
The election of the new government has done something to make that kind of neo-McCarthyist, zealous prejudiced reaction against something that you don't agree with, make that a little less acceptable.
That is what the Prime Minister said. After Ms Hanson's maiden speech, he also said to the Queensland Liberals that the pall of censorship from the Keating years had been lifted.
That was Mr Howard, the Prime Minister. That was Mr Howard's clarion call to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party.
Of course, it is true that others were extremely concerned about this. On the Sunday program on 21 October 1996, when Laurie Oakes asked the National Secretary of the Labor Party, Garry Gray, and the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Andrew Robb, where they would place One Nation preferences. Mr Gray, on behalf of the Labor Party, was absolutely explicit. He said that One Nation would be placed last on Labor how-to-votes. Labor has kept that principled position to this day and will continue to keep that principled position. We were under no misapprehension at any stage about where Pauline Hanson was coming from. We were under no misapprehension about how you had to minimise the impact of Pauline Hanson, and we have never deviated.
What did Andrew Robb think? He is a senior Liberal, and he has strong connections in the business community. When Laurie Oakes asked him the same question, `Would you put Labor ahead of Pauline Hanson?', Mr Robb said, `Indeed; indeed.' The Prime Minister turned out to be either one of the very poorest judges of political reality or a silent admirer of Ms Hanson's view. Mr Howard hoped from the start to get some political rub from Ms Hanson's unpalatable brand of wedge politics. That is the truth.
After Mr Robb resigned as national director of the Liberal Party, John Howard promptly sat on the incoming federal director of the Libs, Mr Lynton Crosby. In October 1997 on the same television program the Liberal tune had changed, of course. Laurie Oakes asked Mr Crosby to affirm the pledge of Mr Robb. Mr Crosby said:
Laurie, I can't do that, because the decision in relation to preferences is a decision for each of the state divisions.
And this continues to be John Howard's mantra to this very day, even as late as question time in the House of Representatives yesterday.
So from 1996 onwards you had a situation where senior Liberal figures like Mr Malcolm Fraser, Mr Fred Chaney, Mr Tony Staley,  Mr 
 Michael Kroger, Mr Jeff Kennett—and many others privately—implored the Prime Minister of Australia to show a skerrick of leadership. They told Mr Howard in no uncertain terms to denounce and expose the One Nation Party and its racist agenda, and put One Nation last. But as early as October 1996 Mr Fraser stated:
I believe One Nation is extraordinarily dangerous for the future of Australia. I believe the debate is more serious than at any time since I began in politics.
That is Mr Malcolm Fraser, former Liberal Prime Minister of Australia. It was only in 1998, this year, two years after Labor made its clear and explicit declaration on preferences, that one by one, grudgingly, senior Victorian Liberals started coming out of the closet on preferences. Let us be fair about this and acknowledge that they were led by the Victorian division of the Liberal Party whose hatred of Mr Howard runs so deep. It was Mr Costello—the man who is now out there organising numbers as fast as he can against Mr Howard for leadership of the Liberal Party—who said on Meet the Press  on 10 May 1998 that he would put One Nation last on his how to vote in his seat of Higgins in Victoria.
But do not forget, Mr Acting Deputy President—you would know—that the same Mr Costello, who now undermines John Howard at every opportunity, was parroting the Howard-Crosby line on preferences being a choice for state divisions of the Liberal Party at a doorstop on 28 July last year. That was well after Ms Hanson's very damaging first speech in this parliament. That was well after that speech was affecting the social fabric of our nation, affecting race relations in our country, clouding the views of our nearest trading partners, and of course damaging Australia's international reputation.
Even during this year's groundswell in his own cabinet over putting One Nation preferences last, Mr John Howard did not criticise it. He did not at any stage try to exert his own diminished authority in the Liberal Party and in the government. He continued what can only be described as a  disgusting political flirtation with Pauline Hanson. Ms 
 Hanson—and I recall this—even declared just prior to the Queensland election:
John Howard has been in a lot of ways a gentleman and I respect him for not attacking me personally.
That was uttered at a One Nation Queensland launch on 21 May 1998. She had not felt a breath of criticism from John Howard, not a breath of criticism from Australia's Prime Minister, from the time of that infamous first speech she made in the parliament to her notorious speech on indigenous Australians on 2 June this year.
I would like to remind the Senate that a week after that notorious speech that Ms Hanson made in relation to indigenous Australians John Howard's cabinet decided not to proceed with the planned $10 million anti-racism advertising campaign. Let us acknowledge something about Mr Howard, let us give him credit for something. He has real skill in the application of wedge politics. I acknowledge that. That is what he is known for. Just before the Queensland election, Mr Howard was being  outwedged by One Nation. The Liberal Party's pre-election polling was coming in in Queensland and it was revealing a disaster for the Liberal Party and a disaster for the coalition in the Queensland state election.
 Mr Howard finally decided, after Ms Hanson's speech about indigenous people in this parliament on 2 June, to peep up on 3 June and state that Ms Hanson's speech was `racist and deranged'. They are the first critical comments from John Howard about Ms Hanson. But he did not say it out of principle or because he believed it. He said it because of political opportunism; he said it because of the change in the political situation in this country; he said it because he had been told about the internal polling of the Queensland Liberal Party. But, incredibly, the Liberal Party and the National Party still preferenced to One Nation in the 13 June Queensland election.
Who could ever forget how Senator O'Chee puffed himself up before the election, toured the countryside, and said,  `It doesn't matter who the National Party send preferences to. It doesn't matter if we send our preferences to the One Nation Party, because they will 
 never be distributed'? Did the same Senator Bill O'Chee come into the parliament and apologise for that outrageous misleading of the Australian people and outrageous misleading of Queenslanders? No, of course he did not. There were no apologies from those who said that these preferences would not be distributed.
But the Labor Party stuck by its guns. The Labor Party stuck by its principles. We elected a significant number of National Party or conservative members of parliament instead of One Nation members of parliament. Of course, we know what the outcome of that election was. We know that the preferences of the conservative parties were responsible—in many cases—for electing a record number of One Nation candidates.
 The truth is that the Liberals and the Nationals facilitated the election of 11 One Nation MLAs in Queensland, and their own action contributed to the elimination of the Liberal Party as an official party in the Queensland parliament. Mr Howard's strategy ended up in tatters after the Queensland election, because the Liberal Party does not even have party status in Queensland. One Nation does; but the Liberal Party does not. Congratulations, Mr Howard, on that great achievement. As Michael Kroger was moved to say on the Lateline program on 30 June:
All I can do is tell you what the view has been in Victoria from day one, that Pauline Hanson should have always been put last. It's a funny thing to say, but you would prefer a Labor Government with all its faults in principle terms to a One Nation Government.
But I remind the Senate it still took an entire week after the 13 June Queensland massacre of the Liberal Party and a bit of prodding from senior Liberals—not to mention a lot of undermining from Mr Costello—for John Howard to grudgingly, belatedly, finally declare, in all his importance as Prime Minister on the Meet the Press  program, that he would put One Nation last on his own how-to-vote card in his seat of Bennelong in Sydney. He did not declare that One Nation would be last on all Liberal Party how-to-vote cards; he did not have the guts to say that. He did not declare that One Nation would be last on coalition how-to-vote cards. No, he did not 
 have the guts or the leadership capacity to do that. He would only talk about his own seat.
And now, after the 13 June massacre of the Liberal Party in Queensland, hypocrisy is rampant among those opposite. They are now realising not only that they will not get any political rub from the One Nation phenomena but also that they stand to lose their seats. As soon as that realisation occurred, quickly Mr Howard and the coalition have changed their tune. We did not hear a word of criticism beforehand, but now it is a different story.
Mr Costello says, `The unsavoury elements that have always existed are back in the political game through One Nation.' Why didn't the coalition, who knew that that was happening, say something before the Queensland election?  Why didn't they put One Nation last in the Queensland election?  Why didn't they do something about One Nation before it had a chance to flourish as a political force?  But, of course, that is not the way they work. It is certainly not the way Mr Howard works. We know the great principle that Mr Howard operates on: hear no evil about One Nation, see no evil about One Nation and wait to collect the preferences of One Nation. That has been the principle that he has adopted.
The coalition has been outwedged by Pauline Hanson. Only now has Mr Costello started to rigorously criticise Ms Hanson, although he is criticising Mr Howard behind closed doors. They have started to criticise Mr Oldfield, Mr Ettridge's tax haven, the monopoly money and the connection with the League of Rights—out it all comes now. What a bunch of hypocrites!  Why didn't they do it when they should have? At last they apply rigour when it comes to analysing the ultra right which the Liberal Party have conveniently planted in our midst. It has been nourished by the Liberals and by Howard's inaction, and it has been legitimised through party status in Queensland.
As I said, One Nation grows on paranoia. John Howard gave Pauline Hanson the nod when he declared that people had been stifled in their ability to speak on issues such as immigration and `the aboriginal industry'. Don't ever forget that Mr Howard said, `The 
 pall of censorship of the Keating years has been lifted.' I have to say that Mr Howard will go down in history as the Prime Minister that allowed the disparate racist forces in our society to become organised and institutionalised, when his government should have been continuing the long battle of other governments in their endeavours to fight the pernicious evil of racism.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-07-01,"—We have heard the usual hysterical diatribe from Senator Faulkner, full of misrepresentations and distortions. Senator Faulkner operates on the principle that if you throw enough mud some will stick. Fortunately, we have heard it so often that no-one believes it any more. I do welcome, however, the opportunity to reaffirm the position of the coalition and of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on some of these important issues before the chamber.
The coalition's view is that all individuals have a fundamental human right to be respected, whatever their race. It is a tolerance upon which civilised societies are built. Yet in all communities we recognise that there is a racist element. Sometimes it is based on pure prejudice, but more often it is based on fear and ignorance. We who respect a civil society have a responsibility to combat prejudice. We should never shirk from that responsibility. We should endeavour to avoid acts which legitimise that prejudice or might be interpreted as doing so.
Fortunately, in my observation, racial prejudice in our community is not widespread. I believe we live in an overwhelmingly tolerant society. In many ways we are a unique society. We are multi-racial. We are multi-cultural. Apart from the indigenous Australians, we all came here within a few generations and from all corners of the world. We came in waves—most as economic refugees looking for better economic opportunities, some as political refugees to escape oppression, and some to escape the sort of intolerance One Nation preaches.
In more recent years more have come from Asia, and there is nothing surprising in that. Like some of the first Australian immigrants came from Asia, some of the most recent 
 immigrants have come from Asia. They all legitimately help build Australia. The more recent immigrants are legitimately helping making contemporary Australia.
Ms Hanson spoke of the Asianisation of Australia, but what does she mean? Asian Australians share the values of all Australians—freedom, democracy, work, family, home ownership and so on. What is unique about Australia is that we have been able to embrace a unity of values whilst embracing diversity. It is an Australia that I am proud of. I do not know whether the leaders of the One Nation Party, Ms Hanson and Mr Oldfield, are racist, but they certainly communicate in a way which reinforces racial prejudice, and for that they should be condemned. It is an unhealthy contribution to Australian political life.
Apart from those who are racially prejudiced, there are, as I said, those who lash out in racial terms not because of inherent prejudice but because of fear and ignorance. These individuals are exploited as such by Ms Hanson and Mr Oldfield—particularly, I would suggest, the latter. The best response in my view is to seriously address their fears and endeavour to help these people who have such fears to overcome their ignorance.
There is no doubt that we do live in times of dramatic change. The traditional stability provided by work, family, community and church is now no longer so certain. Once we held one or two jobs in a lifetime; now this is rare. To many this is threatening. The need to be flexible and adaptable, to recognise the need for a lifetime of further education and training, to accept the likelihood of quite dramatic employment changes during a working life is stressful. It is not unique to Australia; it is a worldwide phenomenon.
Demographic changes are dramatic and result from a more dynamic economy. Areas of competitive advantage are changing rapidly. They are much more based on information and knowledge based industry than natural resources. Natural resource based industry is becoming less labour intensive. No doubt all of this contributes to the high level of family breakdown that we have seen in the last decade or so, but so do changed aspirations 
 and attitudes. With a more mobile society, a sense of community and the security of that sense also suffer. Even the churches do not seem to be able to provide the sense of security that they once did, perhaps because they are going through their own process of difficult change.
This environment of rapid change is made to order for those wanting to exploit fear and prejudice. The real answer lies in policies and programs to ease the stresses, in providing an economic framework which maximises job opportunity, in providing infrastructure which enhances competitive advantage, in providing quality education and training, and in cushioning the consequences for those most affected by change beyond their control. We have only been in office for a little over two years, but many of our programs have in fact been directed towards those specific challenges.
You only have to look at our successful efforts to bring down interest rates, to ease the pressure for home owners and to help small businesses become more profitable. You only have to look at the very massive investment we have made in rural and regional Australia, because this process of change is more dramatic in those areas than what is occurring in the cities. We have made big investments in roads. Infrastructure is so important. We have spent $4.8 billion there and $250 million on regional telecommunications, and one can go on.
You only have to look at the money we are putting into cushioning the change of social stress that is occurring. There is our support for the family through the family tax initiative. There is our support for pensioners through maintaining their level of support at 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. It is not the time to contribute the full range of the government's efforts but to make the point that it is in addressing these stresses that we believe we can best address this problem that we are witnessing in our society.
It also requires honesty. It is unfair to build false expectations. It is cruel to tell people that they can return to the 1950s, as I heard one One Nation leader proposing only last night. To claim that it is possible to isolate ourselves from the world, to believe that we 
 can in some way hide from this process of global change and be better off, is to live an illusion. In fact, the result would be a disaster. Starved of markets, starved of capital, starved of the stimulation of external ideas, we would shrink both economically and socially.
In fact, we are better off than most to adapt to the process of change and build an even more prosperous and fair society, but it will not be achieved by exploiting the fears of those who are doing it tough. Always in times of dramatic change there has been a tendency to lash out at minorities—those who are racially, culturally or spiritually different. What is sad is that there has always been those—One Nation's leaders are the latest—who exploit those who are vulnerable.
I am proud of the record of racial tolerance of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party. It is a racial tolerance that we exhibited in getting rid of the White Australia policy and in throwing Pauline Hanson out of the Liberal Party. It is the coalition who proudly sponsored the Indo-Chinese refugees to Australia after the conflicts in that region. This is a racial tolerance on my side of politics which has not and will not change. I regret that rather than address the basis of the insecurity that provides the opportunity for One Nation to exploit racial fears, Senator Woodley has rather sought to use race to make a cheap political point. It does him and the Australian Democrats no credit.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>One Nation Party</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-01,"—Quite the contrary, Senator Woodley and the Democrats have every right to represent a large section of feeling in the Australian community that things have changed dramatically for the worse in our society in the last two years not only in terms of the public discourse, but also in terms of the feeling of security that many people had before and the feeling that we did have one nation but it is now being torn to shreds. That threat and that lack of security is going to be a very difficult thing to overcome.
At the same time as the member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson, was giving her inaugural speech in the House of Representatives, I, as the first Australian Green in this parliament, was giving a contrary speech in the Senate. In 
 that speech I spoke about the need for compassion between we human beings and also a new regard for this planet of ours. It was ignored by the media. But the media did take up the racist epithets which were being brought to the surface in the other place by Ms Hanson.
Let me say at the outset, we human beings who want a civil society do so with great forbearance, because inherent in all of us is a certain wish to be secure from people we see as different. The civilising motive is to keep a cap on that. The need to put energy into that is a permanent thing. What Ms Hanson and One Nation are doing is removing that cap or at least releasing some of the energy that goes into civilising society, making us less civil—less civil towards people within our own ranks who we might think are different and less civil towards people in the rest of the world who we know are different very often in appearance, language, culture and the way they celebrate life.
In doing this, we fail to recognise that the very variety of cultures and human beings on this planet is the spice of life for all of us, just as the very variety of nature on this planet itself and its diversity, which is now under such awesome threat from the environmental degradation of our age, is. It is this great variety that we can celebrate in life itself.
From that moment in October 1996, the responsibility for the failure to keep the cap on can be sheeted home very strongly to the Prime Minister and the government of the day. Twice at that time in this place I called for the Prime Minister to name Ms Hanson and condemn her bigotry. At first I could not get support. Later on it was blocked because it was seen as a stunt. Well, it was not. I could see what was going to happen. I could see the sort of divided society and change coming down the line that we have now to endure.
But, as I am standing here in the Senate this evening, an act of great intolerance, an act which I believe is racist, an act which I believe panders to the lowest common denominator in terms of regard for the first Australians, is occurring in that we are immi 
 nently going to hear the Prime Minister of this country say that the parliament is coming back to deal with an agreement with Senator Harradine on Wik. Let me say two things about that. The aim of this is to take away the rights of indigenous people in this country. Already the parliament has taken away their rights to negotiate on almost all forms of land use—sure, recognise their ownership and prior occupation of the land, but then say that they have no right to have a say in what happens to that land. It is disempowerment by parliament.
The one last piece that was left intact in this place, because the Labor Party supported it and Senator Harradine supported it, was the right to have a say on mining. It was whittled down to a fraction, five per cent maybe, of the land use changes that are going to occur on indigenous land in the coming century. What this agreement that Senator Harradine is striking with the government does is take away even that right. It leaves the indigenous people of this nation disempowered. That is racism, and it is coming from the government of this country.
Taking away people's rights is an act of racism when it applies to one particular part of the community, as it does here. That is why the Prime Minister does not want the Greens in here. He would prefer One Nation. That is going to be an albatross around Senator Harradine's neck, because when it comes to this issue we do not need One Nation in here. Senator Harradine is doing that job of giving away the indigenous people's rights through his own act of perfidy while this debate is taking place.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-07-01,"—Despite my differences with the Democrats, I have always respected their right to come into this chamber and put before this parliament any issues and matters for debate. If this issue that they have brought forward was so important as to actually take up the time of the Senate when we are sitting an extra week to deal with issues, I would have thought it would have been appropriate for Senator Woodley to at least have the good grace to stay here for the debate, or at least 
 stay here for the person who spoke after him, or have at least one Democrat here. But they propose a matter for debate that is so important that we need to take up the time of the Senate, and they disappear out of the chamber.
I rise to say that I am disappointed to give yet another free kick to One Nation through this matter of public importance. I can only surmise that it is a self-serving, cynical, opportunistic act on the part of the Democrats to try to do something about the fact that they are vanishing off the political landscape. That is the only reason I can think of why Senator Woodley would choose to do this. I regret it, and I have told him personally that I regret the fact that he decided to do this. I thought better of them, but that is what they chose to do. I can assure him that it will not do anything to enhance his party or enhance his party's profile, but it will have the reverse effect of giving One Nation another day in the limelight, another lot of time in this parliament.
The MPI makes this gross assumption that a vote for One Nation in the Queensland state election correlates to a rise in racism. Any tyro of social studies, or the study of society, would know that `correlation' does not necessarily mean `causation', but Senator Woodley puts those two things together—that is, correlation equals causation. Despite the triumvirate that heads One Nation—the triumvirate of Pauline Hanson, David Oldfield and David Ettridge, which heads it by owning it and dictating—and despite its views, which have been debated here, and Senator Boswell has eloquently today and last week suggested the links and the murky people who hide behind One Nation, those people who voted for One Nation—and some in Victoria have said to me, `I think I'll vote for One Nation'—are not necessarily racist. But they are people who are concerned, as Senator Hill said today, about the change that is going on around them. They are angry. They are frightened. They do not know where to turn.
Reports indicate that, in casting votes for One Nation, the people of Queensland were sending a message to all parties—Labor, Democrats and Liberal alike—about their 
 concerns. They indicated that they are irritated by aggressive and self-serving behaviour in parliament, by abusive behaviour from their parliamentary representatives. I think one of the problems is that they see us in question time, they do not often see what happens in the committee hearings when we can actually cooperate.
Despite the fact that I might yell at Senator Cook or Senator Ray across the chamber, often in those committees, especially in the scrutiny of legislation committees, work is done that protects the rights of individuals, but people do not see that. It is most probably one of our faults that we have not told people about some of the things that go on in here, but they see us as parliamentary representatives in the cut and thrust especially of question time and they do not like it. They believe that the parliamentary debate does not reflect their concerns. They are irritated by the very sort of sanctimonious statement we have before us today that we are debating as a matter of urgency. Again, I say that Senator Woodley does not feel this is sufficiently urgent to actually be here in the chamber.
This disillusionment is not the result, as Senator Brown would have us believe, of two years. It has been brewing for over a decade. I have to just remind people, and you do not need to be reminded, that, for much of that time, Australia was governed by a Labor federal government.
—We kept the genie in the bottle; you let it out.
—There we are. Senator Cook said it in his interjection: `We kept the genie in the bottle; you let it out.' The genie was there, Senator Cook. The genie was there building up, building up and building up, until one rub and it burst out. You cannot put the genie back in the bottle. What we have to do is ask, `How do we respond to that?'
Senator Hill outlined the changes taking place in our society, the changes that people are concerned about. The Democrats have a case to answer about the rise of One Nation as well, but I must take this opportunity to say that the press cannot be the Pontius Pilates and wipe their hands of it. One Nation 
 is partly a press creation, and the press also needs to take a cold hard look at itself, as we all do, in the role that it has played in the creation of One Nation. If any of us had asked to have our advisers sitting beside us on the program on Channel 7 on Sunday morning, we would have been laughed out of court.
Senator Knowles interjecting—
—We would have been laughed out of the country, Senator Knowles says, and yet the press allowed that. For not one of us in this chamber—backbencher or frontbencher—would they have tolerated that fact. All of us have a responsibility.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I present the 9th report of 1998 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 9 1998  dated 1 July 1998.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I suppose the future of this parliament has not yet been decided. But we should take into account one particular eventuality. I would like to say a few words about the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I notice the most recent member—
—It is a very good organisation; they have done a good job.
—It is. Senator Brownhill has been on it and Senator Quirke, who sits on my left, is its most recent member. I think they will agree, and you certainly will agree, Senator Brownhill, that it carries out—
—I don't know whether to agree or not; because I am not a member.
—I voted against its formation.
—It is a most outstanding body. Senator Ray, I will take up your point because you have given me a topic that I ought to dilate upon. Senator Ray said he voted against this committee, which was set up at the suggestion of some very great senators from both sides of the chamber.
—Name them.
—Senator Missen.
—Senator Evans.
—Yes, Senators Missen and Evans, Senator Chaney and Senator Tate. The idea was that it would put into the parliament a flow of thought which I think is very essential to the process. This is the sort of thing the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, has advocated for years, because it is quintessentially a parliamentary institution and a parliamentary instrument. I think it has been a famous one. Perhaps it has not been as potent as it should have been but I think it has done good and effective work over the years.
Another reason I want to raise this matter is that yesterday, in this building, there was a meeting of the Judicial Conference of Australia which is a conference that looks at matters of importance to the judges of this country. That committee discussed, with members of parliament and with the Attorney-General, matters to do with the three arms of government—that is, the judiciary, the parliament and the executive itself. Much good came out of that. I would like to note the meeting of that body yesterday in this chamber. I hope that many more of those meetings take place in this building. Perhaps we could go somewhere more akin to what they represent; perhaps we could go to the court. I would hope, Mr Acting Deputy President that you would come. I hope that my leader, Senator Faulkner, who is a man with a huge appetite for justice and a huge appetite for the rule of law would come along as well.
I want to set out for the record the five tests that the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills measures legislation against. The committee has corrected a lot of legislation over the years and has made Australia a much 
 freer place to live in than it otherwise would be. I use that word `much' advisedly, because if we did not have a body such as this in the parliament there would be what I would call a `creep' in legislation, which allowed officials and policing authorities to search people when they should not be doing so, to take property or documents from people when they should not be doing so and confining personal liberty when they should not be inclined to do so. Unless this body did it, this role would have to be left to the courts.
We in this chamber often criticise the courts. If you have listened, over the years, to the things that have been said about the courts and, in particular, the High Court, you would understand what I mean. There has been great criticism that the High Court, it is said—and I do not accept this—has come in and intruded on areas that this parliament ought to pay attention to. There is truth in the proposition that this parliament ought to more often intervene in legislation to make sure that those liberties that every citizen is entitled to should be preserved. I do not think there is much truth in the proposition that the courts interfere when they should not. I think the courts should interfere more, at times.
Parliament certainly should do more than it has. I will express on this broadcast day the five tests that this body applies to legislation. It looks at each piece of legislation and decides whether or not, by express words or otherwise, that legislation trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties. It sees whether that legislation makes rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers. It sees whether it makes rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions, whether it inappropriately delegates legislative power or whether it insufficiently subjects the legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny. It has applied those tests over the years and applied them well.
Given the uncertainty of the future of this parliament, I pay tribute to fellow members of that committee. They are Senator Crane, the Deputy President; Senator Ferris; Senator Sandy Macdonald; Senator Murray; and last, but by no means least, Senator Quirke. I also 
 pay tribute to Professor Davis, who advises us on whether the particular legislation intrudes upon those five tests that I read out. Professor Davis gives us advice. As Senator Quirke says, we then decide whether the advice of Professor Davis is correct.
I also pay tribute to James Warmenhoven, our secretary, who is the latest in a long line of quite outstanding  secretaries in this area. I also pay tribute to Margaret Lindeman and Sue Blunden. They form the secretariat and they get ready the legislation so that it can be examined by the professor and then sent across here with advice. I also thank the whips, including those who are now present, for the way that they have helped over the term of this parliament.
I have taken this opportunity to speak on this report because I think it is a report that should be spoken to more often. Depending on the course of this parliament, it may be appropriate from time to time to simply point out to the Senate the sorts of things that it ought to be looking at. That includes not just party political matters. All of us should be able to talk about our values and the common values that we live by as Australians, which come at the end of a long tradition where rights and liberties are of such essential importance.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I am going to be brief. I congratulate Senator Cooney on the job he is doing on the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. He reflected on an interjection by me that I voted against this committee when it was set up in 1981 and 1982. That was on the voices. No-one joined me, which is just as well, because then I would have had to actually call a division. My concern at that time was not that bills should be scrutinised but that the job would be delegated to staff and consultants and that senators would merely rubber stamp the recommendations that came through.
What became clearly obvious from the work on both sides of the chamber on this committee as it evolved in the 1980s is that the committee took its task very seriously. It looked at legislation. I found it most valuable as a minister when we had legislation up 
 before the chamber. Quite often, matters brought up by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills had not been thought of by the minister in scrutinising the legislation. It was quite a useful tool for a minister to have some other body away from departmental advice evaluating the legislation and pointing out weaknesses in it. So I have to say—this is very difficult for me—that back in 1981 and 1982 I was probably in error in voting against it.
—Is that the only mistake you have made in the intervening 15 years?
—Supporting Senator Faulkner on one occasion, as he will recall, was the second mistake. The committee has done good work over the years. Its reports are succinct.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I present the 9th report of 1998 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 9 1998  dated 1 July 1998.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I suppose the future of this parliament has not yet been decided. But we should take into account one particular eventuality. I would like to say a few words about the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I notice the most recent member—
—It is a very good organisation; they have done a good job.
—It is. Senator Brownhill has been on it and Senator Quirke, who sits on my left, is its most recent member. I think they will agree, and you certainly will agree, Senator Brownhill, that it carries out—
—I don't know whether to agree or not; because I am not a member.
—I voted against its formation.
—It is a most outstanding body. Senator Ray, I will take up your point because you have given me a topic that I ought to dilate upon. Senator Ray said he voted against this committee, which was set up at the suggestion of some very great senators from both sides of the chamber.
—Name them.
—Senator Missen.
—Senator Evans.
—Yes, Senators Missen and Evans, Senator Chaney and Senator Tate. The idea was that it would put into the parliament a flow of thought which I think is very essential to the process. This is the sort of thing the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, has advocated for years, because it is quintessentially a parliamentary institution and a parliamentary instrument. I think it has been a famous one. Perhaps it has not been as potent as it should have been but I think it has done good and effective work over the years.
Another reason I want to raise this matter is that yesterday, in this building, there was a meeting of the Judicial Conference of Australia which is a conference that looks at matters of importance to the judges of this country. That committee discussed, with members of parliament and with the Attorney-General, matters to do with the three arms of government—that is, the judiciary, the parliament and the executive itself. Much good came out of that. I would like to note the meeting of that body yesterday in this chamber. I hope that many more of those meetings take place in this building. Perhaps we could go somewhere more akin to what they represent; perhaps we could go to the court. I would hope, Mr Acting Deputy President that you would come. I hope that my leader, Senator Faulkner, who is a man with a huge appetite for justice and a huge appetite for the rule of law would come along as well.
I want to set out for the record the five tests that the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills measures legislation against. The committee has corrected a lot of legislation over the years and has made Australia a much 
 freer place to live in than it otherwise would be. I use that word `much' advisedly, because if we did not have a body such as this in the parliament there would be what I would call a `creep' in legislation, which allowed officials and policing authorities to search people when they should not be doing so, to take property or documents from people when they should not be doing so and confining personal liberty when they should not be inclined to do so. Unless this body did it, this role would have to be left to the courts.
We in this chamber often criticise the courts. If you have listened, over the years, to the things that have been said about the courts and, in particular, the High Court, you would understand what I mean. There has been great criticism that the High Court, it is said—and I do not accept this—has come in and intruded on areas that this parliament ought to pay attention to. There is truth in the proposition that this parliament ought to more often intervene in legislation to make sure that those liberties that every citizen is entitled to should be preserved. I do not think there is much truth in the proposition that the courts interfere when they should not. I think the courts should interfere more, at times.
Parliament certainly should do more than it has. I will express on this broadcast day the five tests that this body applies to legislation. It looks at each piece of legislation and decides whether or not, by express words or otherwise, that legislation trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties. It sees whether that legislation makes rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers. It sees whether it makes rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions, whether it inappropriately delegates legislative power or whether it insufficiently subjects the legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny. It has applied those tests over the years and applied them well.
Given the uncertainty of the future of this parliament, I pay tribute to fellow members of that committee. They are Senator Crane, the Deputy President; Senator Ferris; Senator Sandy Macdonald; Senator Murray; and last, but by no means least, Senator Quirke. I also 
 pay tribute to Professor Davis, who advises us on whether the particular legislation intrudes upon those five tests that I read out. Professor Davis gives us advice. As Senator Quirke says, we then decide whether the advice of Professor Davis is correct.
I also pay tribute to James Warmenhoven, our secretary, who is the latest in a long line of quite outstanding  secretaries in this area. I also pay tribute to Margaret Lindeman and Sue Blunden. They form the secretariat and they get ready the legislation so that it can be examined by the professor and then sent across here with advice. I also thank the whips, including those who are now present, for the way that they have helped over the term of this parliament.
I have taken this opportunity to speak on this report because I think it is a report that should be spoken to more often. Depending on the course of this parliament, it may be appropriate from time to time to simply point out to the Senate the sorts of things that it ought to be looking at. That includes not just party political matters. All of us should be able to talk about our values and the common values that we live by as Australians, which come at the end of a long tradition where rights and liberties are of such essential importance.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I am going to be brief. I congratulate Senator Cooney on the job he is doing on the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. He reflected on an interjection by me that I voted against this committee when it was set up in 1981 and 1982. That was on the voices. No-one joined me, which is just as well, because then I would have had to actually call a division. My concern at that time was not that bills should be scrutinised but that the job would be delegated to staff and consultants and that senators would merely rubber stamp the recommendations that came through.
What became clearly obvious from the work on both sides of the chamber on this committee as it evolved in the 1980s is that the committee took its task very seriously. It looked at legislation. I found it most valuable as a minister when we had legislation up 
 before the chamber. Quite often, matters brought up by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills had not been thought of by the minister in scrutinising the legislation. It was quite a useful tool for a minister to have some other body away from departmental advice evaluating the legislation and pointing out weaknesses in it. So I have to say—this is very difficult for me—that back in 1981 and 1982 I was probably in error in voting against it.
—Is that the only mistake you have made in the intervening 15 years?
—Supporting Senator Faulkner on one occasion, as he will recall, was the second mistake. The committee has done good work over the years. Its reports are succinct. The senators who serve on it take their task seriously and put forward suggestions that the executive can value and use as independent advice. I congratulate the members of the committee on the work that they are doing. However, I am not quite enthusiastic enough yet to join them on the committee.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-07-01,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is a report, a weighty tome, that provides a considerable amount of information, most of which I am afraid to have to report is of little value in the immediate debate. This is an historic document. This is a document that purports to inform the parliament of the state of schooling in Australia in 1996. This is a report being presented today into the events that occurred two years ago. It would have been better, I would have thought, if, after several years of complaint, the department was able to move things along a little more quickly so that we had information that was actually current.
On the first measure, one has to say that the document has failed to meet the normal requirements of accountability in so far as it provides us with little information that is current about what is occurring in the Australian education system and in Australian schools in particular. What is provided is an improved format in terms of the national overview of what occurred in our schools in 1996. However, the longstanding complaints about the nature of the data collection and the manner in which the material is presented, in my assessment, remain. There are obvious 
 problems with the way in which this national report has failed to produce significantly valuable information on the policy changes that have occurred in this country in the period from 1996 to the present, and on what occurred in 1996. There are significant lapses in the material contained in the report.
In 1996 there was a change of government in this country, but you do not have any understanding of that from reading this report. You have no understanding, for instance, of the policy changes that occurred within that year, of the way in which significant cuts in expenditure were forced upon the education system by the change in government, and, as a result, of Dr Kemp assuming responsibility for the schools portfolio. You have no understanding of the way in which the changes were recorded in terms of the broad banding of literacy programs, changes which cost Victoria, from my recollection, about $8 million.
You have no understanding of the implication of the abolition of the new schools policy and the introduction of the EBA. You have no understanding of the removal of funding for various programs and the introduction of VET in schools. You have no understanding of the abolition of the students at risk program or the national professional development program for teachers. You have no understanding of some simple propositions such as the effect of the raising of private fees and charges by schools on parents, which, in the case of Victoria, amounted to, according to the Auditor-General of that state, some $187 per student in 1996.
You have no understanding that, according to the Auditor-General, amounts totalling $97 million were raised as a result of the extraction of funds from parents, some 16.9 per cent of the school operating revenue. You have no understanding of the fact that, as was recently revealed in Victoria, during this period there was $275 million worth of backlog of arrangements for the maintenance of school programs and capital works projects within the state of Victoria which would take five years to address.
What we get is bland, flag waving by state governments, flag waving which does not 
 address fundamental questions in terms of the need for reform in the education system, even in 1996. You have no understanding of the realities of the changes that occurred within that period. It is a failure by this government in yet again presenting a report which is hopelessly out of date and does not measure up to the basic requirements of accountability in terms of providing adequate, detailed and accurate information as to what is occurring in our school system. Once again, we have to acknowledge that the government has failed. Once again, we have to acknowledge that this is an inadequate method of presenting information to the parliament, even on the basis of material two years out of date.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>National Report on Schooling in Australia 1996</title>,Documents,25,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-07-01,"—We are considering the National Report on Schooling in Australia 1996 . It was a matter that was considered by the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee about two years ago. We did have some criticisms of the way in which the report was formatted at that time. It is useful to note, going through the report, that there have been some improvements in the reporting style. This document is a much more informative document than it has been in the past. But, as usual, Senator Carr has used this as an opportunity to try to slag the government on various aspects of population in schooling. It is interesting of Senator Carr to note that this is actually the calendar year 1996 report.
—Which minister is named in the front of it? Which minister?
—We brought down our first budget in August 1996. We are talking about calender year 1996. By the time those programs were implemented and started to have some operation after August 1996, it was about November 1996. So this report you have been criticising, Senator Carr, is really the outwash of your government, because the funding that is involved was out of the 1995 budget into 1996.
Senator Carr often goes on and talks about lack of funding in schooling. As a matter of fact, a recent Senate inquiry looked at matters such as private and commercial funding in public schools. Through anecdotal evidence, 
 not any scientific evidence, people from the Labor Party on the committee tried to make out that schools were short of funds. The lie was put to that in a publication in the Sydney Morning Herald on 16 April this year. The source of this document is the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs from 30 November 1997. It outlines how much money is in the high schools of New South Wales.
I seek to incorporate this document in Hansard. I did talk to Senator Chris Evans, who agreed to it. Because Senator Carr was on his feet when I took the document over to show him, I did talk to the senator who was the acting whip at the time. I do not think he had any great problem with it. As I pointed out, the source of the schools and figures is the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, 30 November 1997. I seek to incorporate that document in Hansard.
—I did ask Senator Tierney if we could see the full list. What he showed me was an incomplete list. I also ask whether it is possible for Hansard  to incorporate the list as the senator showed me. Other than with those considerations, I do not think there would be any objections.
—I agree. As Senator McKiernan very astutely pointed out when I showed the document to him, the top line has a little problem with the photocopying, but we will get a complete copy.
—With those reservations, is leave granted?
—Subject to the logistical requirements of it being included. It may not be possible, as I understand it, for it to be incorporated.
—Senator Tierney, we will return to the granting of leave at the end of your contribution.
—The list shows some interesting things about funding in New South Wales schools. It is a list of the high schools of New South Wales and the amount of funding each of these schools has in the bank at a particular time. If we go through some of 
 the 250 schools that are listed in the report from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, 30 November 1997, we would discover, for example, that Bossley Park High School, not exactly your North Shore area of Sydney, has reserves of over $1 million; Goulburn High School has reserves of $620,000; Blacktown High, in western Sydney, has reserves of $250,000; Liverpool High has reserves of $340,000; Tempe High School, which is near the centre of Sydney and has some of the poorer suburbs nearby, has reserves of $283,000; Wollongong High School, in the steel belt, has reserves of $219,000; and Young High School has reserves of $432,000. That does not sound to me like schools are starved of funding. If they can put away reserves of that amount—a reserve level has actually been criticised by the finance director of the New South Wales Department of Education—I would have thought the schools are in pretty good shape financially.
Over the years governments have funded our school system quite well. Under all shades of government, state and federal, there has been a very high commitment to the funding and schooling in this country. This has been carried on by this government, particularly in a number of programs that have been added under Dr Kemp's administration, such as the incredible importance he puts on literacy and numeracy as basic skills in this country and the huge emphasis he has put on vocational education and training and creating pathways through to employment. It is through these sorts of programs that we have set in place an education system in Australia which is one of the leaders in the world. As we move into this new era of the information age, Australian schools, particularly under the leadership of this federal government, are very well placed.
—Is leave granted to incorporate the document?
—We still have not seen the complete document. I understood that Senator Tierney said that if it could not be incorporated he would be happy to table it.
—I would be happy to table the document if it is not technically possible to incorporate.
—Is leave granted to table the document?
Leave granted.

"Synon, Sen Karen",LP,1998-07-01,"—On this day in 1851, Victoria became a separate colony from New South Wales. This important act marked the beginning of the sovereign state of Victoria. The state is aptly named after a monarch who reigned over one of the most stable and progressive periods of history—Queen Victoria. It was a time of progress in science, a time of rich progress in discovery, and a time of immense social and cultural enlightenment. These and many more elements of the new modern world were influencing our new colony during Queen Victoria's peaceful and prosperous era.
Victoria, the modern state, has all the hallmarks of this most wonderful time in world history. We in Victoria now enjoy one of Australia's, and indeed one of the world's, most vibrant, sophisticated, multicultural and commercially dynamic societies. Today our sovereign state also has a proud record of achievement to its name. Victoria has provided Australia's Prime Ministers for most of the post-war era, the most notable of these being our nation's most successful statesman and father of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies.
The year 1851 also marked the initial economic surge in Victoria with the beginning of the gold rush and the beginning of an era of great vision in which many of our major institutions were established—civic institutions that have built up the fabric of our modern state and helped to shape Australia. 
 Victoria now boasts a number of sparkling urban centres, not the least of which being the city that was only recently nominated as the world's most livable city, our wonderful state capital of Melbourne.
However, Victoria Day 1998 gives me a special personal reason for pride in my state today. This morning, Victoria's Governor, Sir James Gobbo, named somebody I greatly admire and respect as Victorian of the Year 1998—Andrew Kay of the Here for Life Foundation. Andrew works with the appalling tragedy of youth suicide, a tragedy that affects too many families. As I think of all the good things that our modern, vibrant state offers and the great fortune and prosperity that is the birthright of all who are citizens of Victoria today, I am almost mindful of those who do not share a sense of confidence and security. Sadly, many of those who are affected by depression and grief are young. Sadly, too many of our young people take their own lives.
Andrew Kay, while an apprentice electrician living with his family in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, built Victoria's first skateboard ramp at the back of his local church while he himself was little more than a teenager. Andrew was a young man with a sense of gratitude for all that he had received from life, a man who knew the love and trust of a close family. He was a happy, outgoing young person determined to make a meaningful contribution to society.
While he was still a teenager, Andrew was, I know, profoundly influenced by the suicide of a close friend, and this set the path of Andrew's Christian journey and, indeed, his career. Andrew chose to work with young people to prevent this awful waste of life that he had experienced so close to home.
A few years ago, Andrew founded the Here for Life foundation. Here for Life is an organisation dedicated to the awareness and prevention of the tragic phenomenon of youth suicide. Here for Life, with the help of some philanthropic and corporate sponsorships, has set about stemming the tide of the tragic loss of young lives. Knowing Andrew as I do, and watching the way he leads a team of dedicated volunteers, I am aware that he sees this 
 award as a recognition of the importance of this social problem.
Andrew feels rewarded when suicide is prevented, and I know that he is encouraged when he sees the real fruits of his efforts. He sees this in the trust that has been built up among families who have lost young sons and daughters to suicide over the years, those same families who are prepared to share the horror, the pain, of these deaths in an effort to prevent others from choosing death over life. Andrew now revels in the fact that so many more young people are learning how to support their peers in time of depression and grief. He is helping to ensure that education and counselling about emotional illness are now a part of school cultures, where awareness is growing and, slowly, death is being prevented.
I know that Andrew also feels very encouraged when money is raised to continue the precious, but often depressing, research and to support the work to prevent suicide. Most of all, Andrew sees the results of his efforts when young people gather together with a positive and a confident energy that augurs well for their future. They did this, for example, at the Victorian Youth Forum at the Melbourne Town Hall that Here for Life organised a few weeks ago.
At this marvellous forum, 4,000 young people came together to celebrate youth. They came to own their own futures. They came to speak for themselves. They came to take a life affirming message back to their peers and to learn that they can make a difference. They said, `We care, and we are here to help build our society.' Our federal minister, David Kemp, was there to hear these young people speak up, to listen to the voice of youth.
It is in results like these that I know Andrew Kay finds his true rewards. Just as Victoria has grown in independence and strength from 1 July 1851, I hope that many more young people in Victoria and Australia continue to learn the positive message that motivates Andrew and the Here for Life team.
In closing, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Victoria Day Council, led by Dr Anthony Cree of Ballarat University. In doing so, I wish to congratulate them on their 
 efforts and applaud their hard work. Today, Victoria Day, I salute Andrew Kay, the founder and director of the Here for Life foundation and a worthy Victorian of the year 1998.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Victoria</title>,Adjournment,26,1,speech
