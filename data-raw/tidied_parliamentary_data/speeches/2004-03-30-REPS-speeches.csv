"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2004-03-30,—My question is to Minister for Ageing. Does the minister rule out the extension of accommodation bonds for high-level aged care residents? Can the minister confirm reports that the government is proposing to increase the accommodation charge for aged care residents to as high as $30 a day?,REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2004-03-30,"—I thank the member for Perth for his question. This is typical of the very shallow and irresponsible approach that Labor have taken in relation to aged care, because all they are doing is responding to media speculation. Labor clearly have no ideas of their own. They are clearly still paralysed in terms of policy making in aged care. Ten years on from the damning Professor Gregory report—an indictment on Labor—they still do not have any ideas in aged care. Even now they do not know if they are coming or going. Apparently today in a press release the member for Perth said, `Mark Latham recently made it clear that Labor will not be supporting the extension of bonds to high-level care.' That is apparently news to other Labor members. It has been reported that Senator Michael Forshaw gave a keynote address on behalf of the ALP in Cairns recently and he said he would not rule bonds in or out. So what is it? What is Labor's policy on aged care?
This gives me an opportunity to remind members of the House that, under the Howard government, there have been record levels of aged care funding, from $3 billion in 1996 to $6 billion today. There have been a record number of places allocated in aged care—some 55,600 new aged care places. As I have said on a number of occasions, we received the Hogan recommendations just on a month ago. The recommendations are being considered by government in the context of the 2004 budget.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2004-03-30,"—My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement in the House yesterday on the delays with the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill. The Prime Minister said:
... the people who have, in the name of playing politics, delayed this belong in other parties than the Liberal and National parties.
Isn't it true that Labor supported this bill and it was delayed, in fact, as a result of disagreement within the Liberal and National parties? Now that this disagreement has been resolved in favour of the National Party, does the Treasurer agree with this decision, or is it just another backflip forced upon him by the Prime Minister and the National Party?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Fuel: Ethanol</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question

During question time you allowed a question to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services from the member for Maranoa with respect to the position of our troops in Iraq, which clearly has very little to do with his portfolios.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2004-03-30,"—The government's recent acceptance of the master plan proposed by Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd shows that when Macquarie Airports bought Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport they were buying a very special after-care service as well. They were not just buying a very good value for money asset; they seem also to have bought a guarantee of ever-increasing profits. The Howard government will smooth the way. It will make sure that no consideration for the residents of Sydney will get in the way of the exponential profits that Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd expects. Recently we saw the Minister for Small Business and Tourism double the duty-free allowance, handing the airport a fine increase in its profit stream. The trouble was of course that he forgot to ask the states, who have to approve the increase.
Much worse are the expansion plans which the Minister for Transport and Regional Services recently rubber-stamped. It must seem bizarre to people who do not live in Sydney that we spend so much time talking about the airport. But consider this: at the moment the number of people in Sydney affected by serious aircraft noise is the same as the number of people who live in Darwin. In 20 years time, serious aircraft noise will affect the same number of people as the total population of Tasmania. That will mean that almost half a million people will stop talking when a plane passes overhead; they will not be able to hear the TV or sleep at night.
This expansion means a tripling of passenger movements. It means that movements will increase from 26.4 million in 2000-01 to 68.3 million in 2023-24. The government like to say that bigger aircraft will solve this problem, but in reality Sydney Airports Corporation's own figures show that aircraft movements will also double. As well as a tripling of passenger numbers and a doubling of aircraft movements, there will be a tripling of aircraft noise. Currently aircraft noise substantially affects about 125,800 residents who live within the 25 ANEF—Australian noise exposure forecast—zones. There are 4,300 people living in 1,600 homes that need to be insulated against aircraft noise. Even if there were no residential growth in the inner suburbs of Sydney, the number of people affected by this plan would triple in the next 20 years to 389,000 people living in 17,000 insulated homes. There is no chance that the number of people living in these suburbs will not increase. Urban consolidation is happening more in these suburbs than anywhere else in New South Wales. Anyone driving from Kingsford Smith airport into the city will have seen the building going on in Green Square. Another 28,000 people will be moving into that suburb over the next 10 years. It is easy to see how the number of people substantially affected by aircraft noise could top 500,000 under this plan.
The New South Wales state government's submission on the draft master plan says:
Some suburbs now relatively unaffected will be (almost) entirely under the noise paths—Summer Hill, Ashfield, Annandale and Rosebery ... some residents will be exposed to 284 flights a day, every day—on some days as high as 451 movements.
I believe that 51 suburbs which are not currently affected by airport noise will become affected under this master plan. All of this comes at a time when families, schools, hospitals and nursing homes are still struggling to get the insulation they need to lead normal lives. In answer to a question on notice from the shadow minister for transport, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services said that, while he had collected over $35 million in 2002-03 from the government's noise levy on Kingsford Smith airport, he had spent only $8.5 million on insulation. He collected $35 million and spent $8.5 million. In fact, the figures are likely to fall in coming years, to $6.5 million next year and almost nothing in the next three years. The minister should explain why he continues to collect the noise insulation levy when he is not spending the money on homes, schools, nursing homes and hospitals which are badly noise affected but which fall just metres outside the eligibility zone.
The master plan means abandoning noise sharing. Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd say they will not abandon the 80 movements an hour cap but, even if they meet the cap every hour of the day, that means using the parallel runways a lot more. Using the parallel runways means that we cannot have noise sharing as it is at the moment. The use of the parallel runways will be extended to up to 14 hours a day or even conceivably the 17 hours a day that the airport operates. Multiply 17 hours a day by 80 movements an hour and conceivably there will be 1,360 movements a day. That means the abandoning of noise sharing. It also means that even if there is a very short delay, due to bad weather or a bomb threat at Sydney airport, the backlog could last all day. It means that the cap and the curfew would have to be breached just to get through the flights that were scheduled for that day.
The master plan also proposes the building of 240,000 square metres of commercial and retail space. It is obvious that this will have a definite negative impact on local residents and businesses. Sydney Airports Corporation says of course that it has no responsibility to provide adequate transport, let alone to consider the effects on nearby residents and businesses. Bulky goods handling will put more trucks on the road. Retail precincts in these airports are designed to attract people who are not flying. That means that they will be sucking business out of all the neighbouring shopping centres. Eastgardens and other nearby shopping centres are likely to see a dramatic decline in their business. It also means increased traffic on the roads around the airport, including very heavy traffic, because there will be more trucks handling the bulky goods that SACL is proposing to run through the airport precinct.
Road congestion is going to increase. The master plan outlines the trebling of on-site car parking to over 14,000 places. That is very profitable for the airport owners. We all know how much it costs to park at Sydney airport. There is absolutely no consideration for traffic on local roads and traffic congestion. Kingsford Smith airport already has twice as many car parks as the biggest shopping centre in the Southern Hemisphere. If commercial and entertainment plans go ahead—they are talking about a leisure precinct as well—the number of people driving to the airport will increase dramatically. The master plan will bring an extra 20,000 cars on the roads per hour in peak hour every morning. The air pollution and noise that go with that road transport are obviously going to affect the residents around the airport. We should instead be encouraging people to use public transport.
What is really interesting about this proposal and what makes it such a great business proposition for the owners of the airport is that the profits are taxpayer subsidised. The New South Wales government is expecting to spend about $2.7 billion on road infrastructure around the airport to support the airport expansion if it goes ahead. Once again, the airport owners are seeking to privatise the profit and make the taxpayers of New South Wales pick up the tab. The state government has no right to levy taxes on the airport; it is subject only to Commonwealth law and Commonwealth taxes. So New South Wales gets no land tax, no parking levy and no section 94 developer levies. It would not be so bad if this restriction related only to the aviation aspects of the airport business, but it does not; it obviously relates also to the commercial aspects—the retail precincts, the parking and so on. It means that the taxpayers of New South Wales receive no contribution from the airport to spend on public transport, servicing the airport or the local roads that need upgrading. The profits go straight into the pockets of the airport shareholders.
The government keeps saying that it is possible to run more aircraft through Kingsford Smith airport. That is true. It is technically possible to run more aircraft through Kingsford Smith airport. We can expand aircraft and passenger movements, but do we want to? How much noise, how much pollution, how much traffic and how much road congestion is too much? People living in the inner city and the inner suburbs accept that there is a trade-off for the convenience of living close to the city, but everyone reaches their limit. There will come a day when this curfew and cap are unsustainable. By that time, all of the sites near Sydney will have been built out and there will be no alternative but to abandon the cap and curfew. Unless the government plans now for a second airport, buys the land and sets aside the site, we will reach saturation at Kingsford Smith airport and we will have nowhere to go but to get rid of the cap and the curfew.
The other thing to remember about the cap on aircraft movements is that 80 movements an hour is a hell of a lot of aircraft noise—it is a hell of a lot of planes overhead. Even if the cap were reached but not breached every hour, the increased burden would be intolerable. At the moment, there are quiet times of day, and I can tell you that the residents look forward to them and breathe a sigh of relief. But the proposal in the master plan is to fill out these quiet times of day and not waste a single minute, so those 80 aircraft movements an hour will be there every hour, 17 hours a day. Certainly, that is in the best interests of Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd, but it is not in the best interests of Sydney residents. The proposal has been opposed by local councils, by the New South Wales government and, perhaps most significantly, by the Sydney Airport Community Forum, the minister's own hand-picked consultative group. It has criticised the master plan and it supports the building of a second Sydney airport.
Of course, Labor has an alternative—that is, to build a second airport. We must build a second airport for Sydney. The costs of not building a second airport are obvious. There is not only the cost of noise and pollution for Sydney residents but also the economic cost estimated to be $2.3 billion by 2016. That is the loss of 17,000 full-time jobs. We have to retain the cap and the curfew at Kingsford Smith airport and also the noise-sharing arrangements that we have in the long-term operating plan. If you have those 80 movements every hour, that is going to put a lot of pressure on noise sharing. Noise sharing will be abandoned. We need to make sure that all those who need noise insulation get it. And we should give particular attention to schools, nursing homes and hospitals, not just domestic homes. At the moment, we have the absurd situation that two families living on opposite sides of the street might be treated differently for the purposes of noise amelioration.
Unfortunately, the delays associated with the building of Badgerys Creek airport mean this solution has slipped from our grasp. It would have been the best solution, but it is no longer available to us. When we planned to build at Badgerys Creek, the economic benefits which would have flowed to the area were substantial. It is estimated that Badgerys Creek airport would have created about 33,000 ongoing jobs and another 8,400 during the construction phase. Public transport links and roads would have been upgraded.
The government was not interested in creating these extra jobs. It is not interested in the noise and pollution effects of the exponential growth of Kingsford Smith airport, so it has put the problem off for another day. Someone else will deal with it down the track. Labor, in contrast, will build a second airport. We will look at sites in the southern highlands, south of the Nepean River, and we will ensure that the chosen site has minimal impact on the local environment and local populations. We will also make sure it is part of an integrated transport plan.
Incidentally, the Greens—and I notice the member for Cunningham is here—do not want Kingsford Smith airport expanded but they do not want a second airport either. I will not even waste time talking about how stupid that is.
—Parachutes!
—The member for Grayndler suggests parachutes. Perhaps it is in their plan. We have to accept that, when Mascot Aerodrome officially opened in 1920, it was surrounded by a very different population density, and it represented a very different noise burden. It has reached its limit now. It is only nine kilometres from the central business district of Sydney. It is closer than any comparable airport anywhere in the world. Within five kilometres of Kingsford Smith airport, we have over 140,000 people; within five kilometres of Badgerys Creek, there are 5,000 people; and within five kilometres of Wilton, we have 1,000. Unless we build a second Sydney airport, life will become unbearable. Not today, not tomorrow but, as sure as night follows day, in 10 or 20 years time the residents of our greatest city will be cursing the myopia of today's leaders.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-03-30,"—It is my pleasure to speak today on the member for Sydney's motion on Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I have actually agreed with the member for Sydney on some of her motions, particularly her human rights motions, but this is where we disagree. I found it particularly interesting that when the member for Sydney had a staffer looking around for information today—and there were lots of figures coming out; she was doing her own version of `Rain Woman'—the staffer rang the office of the member for Boothby, in South Australia, asking for information about the airport. When he pointed out that it was a South Australian seat, she was very disappointed and said, `Well, can't you help me anyway?' If this is the best the member for Sydney's office can do, no wonder people are confused about the airport.
The member for Sydney, of all people, should be thinking about her constituents. I know that she is worried about the Greens—and it is very good to see the member for Cunningham in the House tonight—because the Greens are breathing down her neck. She undoubtedly is very concerned following the election of Clover Moore in the New South Wales council elections on the weekend. She knows that Labor are in big trouble in inner Sydney and she is doing her best to keep them at bay. The Greens have got every right to ask: where is the Labor Party's credibility? 
There is probably a greater concentration of tourism workers living in the member for Sydney's electorate than in the whole of Sydney, and it is those tourism people who benefit from the closeness of Kingsford Smith more than anybody else. Every year, five million international visitors come into this country and 25 million people use the airport, and Australia benefits by some $16 billion in foreign exchange earnings into Australia from tourism. The airport is the greatest asset that we have to bring international visitors into the city. Of course, the domestic tourism industry is worth an additional $40 billion for this country. The member for Sydney is ignoring her constituents and the many tourism workers in her electorate for the straight political gain. 
What is this all about? The fact is that the Labor Party said at their conference that they are going to build a second airport. They did not say where it would be, because they are worried about the protests. They say, `It might be Wilton. It might be Badgerys Creek'—never mind whether it would work at Wilton, because fuel from planes flying over the Sydney catchment area would contaminate the water in the catchment area; never mind the impact it would have on the people who live in the seat of Gilmore on the South Coast or the people who live in Wollongong. The Labor Party probably say, `We've lost the seat of Cunningham. Why don't we just put it in there and give it a burst there?'
As one of the great masterpieces in Labor's overall planning for the Sydney airport, the New South Wales Minister for Roads, Mr Carl Scully, came down to the F6—which would have connected Kingsford Smith into the south and would have therefore connected the airport at Wilton—in a great flourish before the last election, when he was actually the Minister for Transport, and announced that he was going to cancel the road. Labor are giving it away in terms of connections in that area. It is blown in terms of connections. You obviously do not speak to your Labor mates in Sussex Street, but it is probably time you did after last weekend's results. 
There is a whole lot of naivety in the proposal. The member for Sydney said, `We would have built at Badgerys Creek. It would have created all these jobs out there. It would have been great.' But who remembers what happened at the last election? Every time Labor had a chance, they were out belting the government over Badgerys Creek. They did it in Lindsay, they did it in Macquarie and they did it in Macarthur, saying that the government was going to build an airport at Badgerys Creek. They used every opportunity. They organised protest rallies. When the alternative was Holsworthy, Labor were there with protest rallies against the minister and the government. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who is at the table, who is the fantastic member for Hughes, knows all about the  tactics they used when Holsworthy was proposed. Did we see them going down into the seat of Hughes saying, `What a great idea having a second airport here'? They were leading the charge—not as well as the member for Hughes—in protesting against the government every step of the way. Of course, there is all this hypocrisy now: `We should have built it at Badgerys Creek. It would have been fantastic.' Let us get some realism into the debate. They do not want to identify what the actual site is—
—Why don't you tell the truth, Bruce?
 (Mr Barresi)—Order! The member for Melbourne!
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. They do not want to identify the site, because they are worried about the backlash. They want to talk about it in generic terms: `We might have it here. We might have it there,' but they have not actually decided. They do not want to do the work on it. 
Labor are not looking at the greatest employing industry in the country, which is tourism. Some 600,000 people in this country are employed in the tourism industry, and over 60 per cent of tourists into Australia come via the Sydney airport. One of the great pluses for Sydney is the closeness of its airport. We have a guarantee that the cap and the curfew will be maintained, and we have the clear forecast that no additional airport will be required for at least 20 years, so why should additional government funding be put in to build another airport? 
We remember what happened in Montreal. In the same way that Labor are talking about a second airport, they decided in Montreal to build their second airport before it was needed. They built the airport at Mirabel, which is a long way out of Montreal, and the problem was that nobody wanted to use it so it became a white elephant—so much so that they eventually closed it during winter. People would change their flights just so they could use the airport closer to the city. And so it will be with this one. If there is not the need, if there is additional capacity that is available to go into Sydney, they will find the way to do it. Of course the international airlines would not want to go out into either Wilton or Badgerys Creek if there is not the requirement to do it at this stage.
The cap of 80 movements an hour being maintained and the curfew being maintained were things that the Labor government initiated when they were in office. Now the member for Sydney is saying that this is far too much, that it is too high. But it was the Labor government that put it in place; it was the Labor members who moved the amendments in terms of the cap—and there is no consideration in any way that it is going to be changed or that the curfew is going to be changed at all. 
The member for Sydney talks about people in her area that are affected. I say to the member for Sydney that 55 per cent of all flights—take-offs and landings—come across my electorate. If this were a real issue in my electorate, I would know about it. You have heard the member for Sydney say how terrible this noise is that comes through her area, but 55 per cent of flights go over my electorate. In fact, from the polling that I did, I found that one per cent of people in my electorate thought aircraft noise was a problem. I do not know who the member for Sydney talks to, but she should do her own polling and find out the reality of what people think. Only one per cent of people were concerned about the impact of aircraft noise. What is the reason for that? There are so many people in my electorate who work for the airlines. If you go down to the dry cleaners, you will see that the place is full of Qantas and Virgin Blue uniforms. People who work at the airport include the maintenance workers, those who drive the tractors and those who run the coffee shops and the restaurants. The airport is a great provider of employment right in the centre of Sydney. People in my electorate are supportive of the airport because they know it creates jobs, and it provides a very close and central link into the city.
The member for Sydney talks about the number of flights and how many people will be affected, without taking into consideration the way in which the size of aircraft is going to change. In less than two years, Qantas will have their new 380 aircraft, which will be about one and a half times the size of the current 747 and will take somewhere between 500 and 600 people on a flight. That is the trend: airlines are going from the 767 to the 330 aircraft—larger aircraft with less frequent flights across Sydney.
The traffic levels that we are talking about are quite different from what they were, for example, at the time of the Olympics. It will still take some time until we reach the number of international visitors that came to Australia at the time of the Olympics and during the year in which the Olympics was held. That is for a number of factors. Since that time, we have had September 11, which of course has meant caution for people who travel internationally. Then we had October 12 with the Bali bombing. Then with SARS we had the real impact of people being concerned about their health when travelling. All this has meant a downturn in tourism. We are starting to see a slow return to the tourist numbers that we had before, but it is a slow process. We do not know what other factors in the future will affect the numbers and, in many ways, in terms of the airport plan the forecast is optimistic. The noise sharing arrangement under LTOP means that each part of Sydney gets a share of the noise. I believe it works effectively in Sydney and it is a useful way of sorting out where the aircraft should be.
The member for Sydney also talks about the role of SACF in terms of bringing together their motions. It is an opportunity for members of this House and members of council to come together and express their views and concerns. I am not sure how many times the member for Sydney has actually attended SACF meetings and presented her views there. I doubt whether it has been very many times. I have certainly not seen her at those meetings. But there is a real opportunity to talk about noise sharing there. It is all right to grandstand in this House and express your concern but, if you were really concerned about noise in your electorate, you would be attending every meeting of SACF.
—I am not a member.
—The member for Cook will refer to members by their seats.
—I am sure that the member for Sydney would be able to attend—
—I will break the doors down.
—We look forward to you attending. In terms of the Sydney airport master plan, there has been extensive consultation—there have been 87 submissions. I do not know whether the member for Sydney has actually placed her submission before the House—I would guess not.
—They left me off the list.
—Again, the Labor Party attitude is: we will not worry about SACF; we will not worry about a submission; we will just come in and mouth off in the House. There was a 90-day public comment period. The fact is that the official forecast is that no new airport is required in terms of both the airport and the projections for future numbers.
—That is not what the Department of Transport and Regional Services were saying a few years ago.
—It is interesting that the member for Melbourne would make these statements. He is certainly able to outline to the House his actual policy on the area. Which site are you planning to burden Sydney with? Is it the people of Wollongong who are going to suffer? Is it the people in other areas who are going to suffer?
—No, it is the people of Kurnell near you.
—We have the airport right alongside us and, as I have said, the people in my electorate accept the airport where it is. It is a great job provider. The people of Sydney appreciate it because of its closeness to the CBD. It is well served in terms of an effective rail link. It is well served in terms of the eastern distributor, which means that people can travel into the city in less than 10 minutes—and very often they can achieve that in peak time.
To take an alternative route would mean that we would have the same problems as Montreal has with the white elephant of Mirabel airport, which everybody can see is a great example. The sensible approach is to continue with Kingsford Smith. There is no need to build a new airport for the next 20 years. The rest of it is a pure stuntman approach by the ALP. They said that they were going to have it at Badgerys Creek, then it was Wilton, but the facts simply do not support them. The people who know the facts know that we only need one airport, Kingsford Smith—certainly in the short term—and the claims of the ALP are without substance. This is a futile attempt by them to try and get back in the race, particularly by the member for Sydney being concerned about the movements—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2004-03-30,"—I strongly endorse the contribution to this debate of the member for Sydney and condemn the speech of the member for Cook. With great respect, member for Cook, I raise your comments about the credibility of the member for Sydney. I ask through the chair—
 (Mr Barresi)—The member for Lowe will address his comments through the chair.
—Well, I am, Mr Deputy Speaker. What about the member for Cook declaring his employment history with the tourism industry, including with Sydney airport, and his support for the promotion and expansion of Sydney airport over a long time? As for his comments about the long-term operating plan operating fairly, the fact remains that we were promised 17 per cent air traffic movements to the north and at the moment, as I speak in this House tonight, we are getting 33 per cent—double what we were promised.
I want to bring another scandalous chapter in the shameful handling of Sydney airport by the Howard government to the attention of the House tonight. On 20 January a letter was written by the general manager of corporate affairs and human resources at Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd, Mr Chris Falvey, to the Chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, Senator Marise Payne, advising that Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd had submitted the final draft master plan to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The general manager's letter noted that SACF's submission was one of the most comprehensive submissions received. Despite this observation, not one member of SACF—of which I am one and the member for Cook is one—received notice of this letter until it was distributed through the SACF secretariat on 26 March 2004. That is last week, four days after the minister's 22 March 2004 media statement No. A39/2004 announcing the approval of the master plan.
What is at issue is that revelations are now emerging that there are substantial differences between the preliminary draft master plan and the final draft master plan for Sydney airport. No member of the public had any warning of the final draft master plan or its contents. Moreover, the SACF, the peak community consultation body established by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, had no knowledge of the contents of the final draft master plan before 26 March 2004.
What does the final draft master plan say? I will tell you: at this time, we still do not know. Neither the minister nor the proponents of the master plan, Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd, are under any legal obligation to notify the public of the final draft master plan. However, it is true that Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd did have knowledge of the request of the chair of SACF, representing the community and the public interest in Sydney airport's future, to be given prior warning of the tabling of the final draft master plan. The bottom line is that the final draft master plan was tabled and a decision was made by the minister to accept the plan, without the community having any knowledge of the contents of the final draft master plan. That means that no-one had the opportunity to scrutinise the final draft master plan or to make any final submissions prior to the minister approving the plan.
All this flies in the face of my repeated calls to the minister to heed the recommendations of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report on the inquiry into the development of the Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan published in June 2000. The eight recommendations in that report clearly envisaged amendments to the Airports Act 1996 and, in particular, the very provisions which at this time have so denied the public interest. Here we are on 30 March 2004, and still the recommendations are not implemented. The public interest has again been slaughtered by an appalling lack of statutory safeguards and the government's naked contempt for due process, natural justice and any other minimal standard of decency. This House needs to be reminded that the Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd and that the Prime Minister's mate Mr Max Moore-Wilton is both the Chairman of the Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd and the Chief Executive Officer of Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd.
It is not possible at this time to know what the contents of the final draft master plan are in order to determine the basis and reasons upon which the master plan was approved. Going on the only publicly available information, the preliminary draft master plan, Sydney residents to the north of Sydney airport can expect—as the member for Sydney so appropriately put it—nearly a doubling of aircraft movements from 240,000 to 412,000 by 2023. With this will come a mammoth increase in aircraft noise for people in my electorate of Lowe and in the inner west of Sydney. Moreover, the repeated failure by Airservices Australia to meet the long-term operating plan aircraft movement targets, particularly to the north—which seems to be strange to the member for Cook—means that residents of Sydney are being bludgeoned into copping parallel runway mode operations. This is now clearly the real agenda of Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd and its master Mr Max Moore-Wilton's Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd and their principal shareholder, Macquarie Bank—so determined to maximise profits for its directors and shareholders at the expense of my constituents and the constituents of the members for Sydney, Grayndler, Watson and Barton. It is a shocking, blatant example of nepotism. The facts demonstrate that there is treachery being visited upon the people of Sydney and the public interest. The demonstrated contempt of Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd, Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd and Airservices Australia for the public is now undeniable. The minister must hold a further Senate inquiry.
—The member for Grayndler is correct. The minister must further make a decision under his statutory powers within section 78(2) of the Airports Act 1996 and direct by written notice to the Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd, as the airport lessee company, that he immediately be given a draft master plan that is expressed to replace the original master plan. This will give the public its right to remedy this treachery visited by the Howard government on the people that we represent.
As the minister is aware, under the provisions of section 78 of the Airports Act 1996, the airport lessee company has 180 days in which to table the replacement draft master plan. I think I speak for all the people of Sydney who are now totally fed up with the bullying of these big-end-of-town corporations—Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings, Sydney Airports Corporation Limited, Macquarie Bank, their Liberal Party mates and the likes of Max the Axe. These people have rammed the decision through with contempt for the people that I, the member for Grayndler and the member for Sydney represent. It is time to bring these people to account. They should be flogged.
Finally, I put on notice that today I have requested, under the Freedom of Information Act, the full file from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to determine the extent to which the airport lessee complied throughout this master plan debacle. I remind the member for Cook of the gross dishonesty of the Howard government. In January 1996—and Mr Paul Zammit, my predecessor as the member for Lowe, behaved honourably when he knew that the Prime Minister was going to dud him—the Liberal Party put out this very shameful leaflet which says, `This is not Liberal policy; you can't trust Labor.' I will explain what this document is all about. Mary Easson, who before Paul Zammit held the seat of Lowe, said precisely what would happen in Lowe with regard to the expansion of aircraft noise under the Howard government. Three months after being elected to office, the Prime Minister in the Howard report—his own report to his own electorate of Bennelong—said: 
John Howard guarantees second International Airport for Sydney. 
The Prime Minister said to his electorate:
Sydney is to be guaranteed a second international airport regardless of the outcome of the environmental impact statement of Badgerys Creek. This decision reflects the Howard government's determination to solve the Sydney aircraft noise problems as quickly as possible and responds to environmental and industry concerns about the viability of Badgerys Creek. 
What a lot of humbug and cant by the Prime Minister. This just reflects the lies and deception of the Howard government in looking after the interests of its mates at Macquarie Bank. If you do not believe me: when Mary Easson put her leaflet out in 1996 to expose the truth of the matter about where, under the Howard government, the planes were going to go, here is the government's own draft master plan which shows planes going all over Sydney but predominantly over the electorates of the members for Grayndler and Sydney and my electorate of Lowe. Why? Because they are Labor seats and the government could not give a damn about the people that we represent. Why? Because they are Labor held seats.
The government is only interested in looking after the big end of town—and that includes the Macquarie Bank, which paid an absurd amount of money: $5.6 billion. As I have said many times—and it was also alluded to by the member for Sydney—Sydney airport is operating very well as a car park and a shopping centre. It is not doing the job that it was supposed to do. It is only looking after the interests of the shareholders and the directors who get fat salaries and share options at the environmental expense of the people that the member for Grayndler, the member for Sydney and I represent. I will keep talking about this right up to the next election because I was elected on this, and I will remind my electorate of the dishonesty of the government—(Time expired)

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2004-03-30,"—It is not at all surprising that this particular motion has been moved this week after last weekend's debacle, for the Labor Party, of the lord mayoral elections in Sydney. The manipulation of the City of Sydney to try and give the lord mayoralty to the failed former member for Dobell came very much unstruck. Indeed, Clover Moore, the state member for part of the area that now comprises the City of Sydney, really put the wind up the Labor Party members of that area of Sydney. They can see that Labor does not serve them well and so it was necessary for the member for Sydney to move this motion to try and show that they are doing something. It is truly a cynical exercise and should be seen for what it is.
In her speech the member for Sydney talked about the development that was going on in areas that are adjoining the airport. They are part and parcel of the state government's medium-density housing policies whereby it wants more people to live in the inner city and inner suburban areas so that it does not have to have the expense of creating new infrastructure in developing new areas on the outskirts of Sydney. The people who are developing these areas in and around the airport know precisely what they are doing. They are building accommodation which is close to an airport, which has pluses and minuses for some. For the people who work in the industries which are associated with the airport or at the airport itself, it is very convenient; it is very convenient to the city. On the downside, the noise involved in being near an airport is factored into the purchase price of those properties, and so the market operates and those people who want to live there take that into consideration when they buy into this new development. So, very simply, that argument about the development of the area has to be seen for what it is: it is deliberate state government policy to see those urban areas grow, and the people who then choose to live there are those who factor in their proximity to the airport.
One thing that does not change about Sydney airport is the fact that one half of it is surrounded by water. This makes it quite unique. It means that there are many flight paths that can come in over the water where in other parts of the world they have no such luxury; they are all forced to fly over land and, indeed, mainly inhabited land. The idea has been raised that we should again go through the farce of Badgerys Creek—and it was a farce that Labor perpetrated upon the people of Western Sydney. First of all they said, `We're going to build this great airport,' and everybody said, `Where's the infrastructure for getting to and from the city?'—`Don't worry about that; it will all happen.' Of course it did not. There was no planning for it and then the airport itself just did not occur and, in the meantime, houses started to encroach and come closer to those areas. They never believed that Badgerys Creek would be built—and of course it will not be. But in the meantime many people who wanted to conduct their existing businesses were bought up and forced off their land. There were many unhappy people that this was perpetrated upon, and the farce went on.
But in the end we said that it would not be built, it was not needed; and the Labor Party under Simon Crean finally said also that it would not be built—because they knew that the people of Western Sydney would simply not wear it. So once again we are seeing a proposition come up: we must have a second airport. So the member for Sydney says, `Well, we haven't decided where it is. We'll take a look at the Southern Highlands, we'll take a look around Wollongong, we'll take a look here, there and everywhere, but we're not actually going to make a decision because we don't want to upset too many people before the election.' On the other hand, the member for Lowe says, `Oh, no, we've decided on Wilton.' Wilton was one of the sites that were rejected before Badgerys Creek was picked, and there were a whole lot of reasons for that. Largely it was because it is part of the catchment area for Sydney's water supply. So we do not even see agreement in the party itself.
—Order! The member for Sydney has made her contribution.
—The member for Cook pointed out that perhaps the member for Sydney did not talk very often to the powers that be at Sussex Street—and I certainly believe that that would be the case, because she is in the wrong faction to have a chat there. But if we have a look at this so-called plan which says we need a second airport, the Olympics were the big enlightening period, when it was shown that not only could Sydney airport cope with the traffic that was generated from the Olympics but it could go on coping for a long time to come. The member for Cook pointed out the futility of trying to impose an unwanted airport—as happened in Canada—upon air carriers and upon the public, who simply do not want to be part of it.
The plan that has come forward—and it was subject to 87 submissions, which were taken into account in the draft plan—is in fact one that remains within the cap and within the curfew. It is a straightforward and honest plan that says this is what is anticipated will happen through to the years 2023-24. It also points out that aircraft are going to be bigger so they will be moving many more passengers, which is good for the economy of Australia. Sydney is the gateway to Australia—this is where people want to come—and the fact that the airport is close to the city is a big plus for attracting people here and bringing money into the city and, by way of jobs, into the areas that surround the airport as well. We can have more people coming in larger aircraft, because they will be technically superior aircraft and will be quieter. So there are many things that will improve in technology and handling which will again bring benefit to the city.
I repeat that this exercise that we are indulging in today with a lot of hyperbole is really simply an exercise in being seen to be doing something, to try and fend off the headway that opponents of the Labor Party are making in this part of Sydney. Be it by Greens or by Independents, the Labor Party in that part of Sydney is under siege and they know it. Accordingly, we have had this very contrived debate forced upon us. I thought the wording of the motion was interesting:
The urgent need for the Government to provide an alternative to the massive planned expansion of Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport.
An alternative. The fact of the matter is that the airport that exists there—with one half of the area being ocean, as I said, which allows much movement over unoccupied territory—is a great advantage for this city. When you look at the term `the urgent need', the fact is that we showed with the Olympics that Kingsford Smith can cope with a much greater capacity than was ever thought possible at the time when people were saying we had to have a second airport. That will occur when there is better handling, better usage and more efficiency. Many of the people in this chamber will remember that, when Badgerys Creek was still a possibility, there were all sorts of discussions by the airlines saying that they did not want to use it. They said it would be a disadvantage. They asked, `Who are you going to make use it?' and, `Are you going to force the regional airlines out of Sydney Kingsford Smith and force them to go out to Badgerys Creek, thereby disadvantaging regional people?' The same arguments will come again if a second site is ever contemplated—arguments about who will be the users or who will be forced to use a second airport which they do not want to use and which the capacity of Sydney airport has shown is not needed.
I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that today's debate has been nothing more than a contrivance. The fact is that Sydney airport does and can cope well. It does bring jobs. It does bring wealth to the city, and the people who choose to live around the airport do so knowing that they are living next to an airport and calculate that in both the price of their purchase and the convenience of purchasing in those areas.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1,speech
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-03-30,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the member for Sydney's call on the federal government to provide an alternative to the massive planned expansion of Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. Despite what the member for Cook would have us believe, Kingsford Smith is an environmental and planning disaster, and the proposed expansion of the airport, as recently announced, will undoubtedly exacerbate the problems. The Greens are opposed to the government's plans. Their solution is no solution. They have clearly put this in the too-hard basket and have abrogated their responsibilities to the people of New South Wales. The Greens have openly criticised the government for accepting Sydney Airport Corporation's airport master plan, which allows for the doubling of aircraft movements and the tripling of passenger numbers through Kingsford Smith.
However, the Greens also believe that the ALP's two-airport policy will not solve the problem either. The continued expansion of Kingsford Smith underlines the need for a replacement airport, not a second airport. That is right: a replacement, not a second airport, as the current site is dangerous, noisy, polluting and clearly inappropriate for Sydney's air traffic needs. The solution must start with a recognition that Kingsford Smith airport needs to be phased out if the millions of adversely affected Sydney residents are to be relieved of its many health and safety threats and issues.
The Greens also reject the ALP's plan to build a second airport on the southern highlands—with Wilton as their preferred site—for a variety of reasons. For a start, it is clear that the ALP's position on this issue has always been politically motivated, and in recent times driven by threats to marginal inner city seats. This is not a good climate in which to be making major policy decisions that are going to impact upon millions of lives. I know the member for Grayndler has been vocal on this issue and critical of the Greens' position, and only a week ago the member for Sydney sharply criticised the Greens on the Sydney airport issue, accusing us of having no airport policy. She said:
The Greens don't want the expansion on Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport—
which is true—
but they also don't want a second airport built for Sydney. What do they want? Should we ban plane travel altogether? Or fly into Melbourne and catch the train to Sydney? The Greens are fine at pointing out problems .... Where do they want the extra planes and the extra passengers to go?
The Greens' position is clear. We want Sydney airport phased out and replaced by a new airport outside of the Sydney basin. We want the site selected by a process that respects both the transport needs of New South Wales and the rights of affected residents. We want the Australian government to take carriage of this process. We want a replacement airport, not a second airport—an idea we reject. Building a second airport and leaving Sydney airport in place would only serve to massively increase aircraft noise and accident risks for all inner Sydney residents, including the member for Sydney's constituents.
Labor's second airport solution is no solution at all. Labor's second airport would inevitably handle only smaller aircraft and intrastate flights. It would thus increase the capacity of Sydney airport to take more of the big jets and, consequently, increase noise impacts on households that are already suffering. A second airport would not only make matters much worse for inner city residents but would relegate the residents of rural New South Wales who depend on air travel to an airport that has no connection to interstate and international flights. Labor's selection of Wilton as a site for their second airport typifies everything that has gone wrong in airport regulation over the past half century. Wilton has overriding environmental values—values the Leader of the Opposition himself has recognised. But, time and again, short-term political expediency has overcome evidence based planning, and this is why we are in such a mess with Kingsford Smith airport.
The Greens are committed to a process that decouples making decisions about appropriate sites for a replacement airport from the ability of private interests to influence politics. Only in this way will we get an airport location that delivers economic and social benefits without compromising the environment or the quality of life, health and safety of local communities. The appalling history of Kingsford Smith airport demonstrates the dangers of allowing politicians to make airport siting decisions. We have just seen the Howard government support the SAC airport master plan, which will not serve the best interests of the people of Sydney in particular. But both major parties are complicit. Labor's past record on the airport brings no comfort to Sydney residents. Having built the third runway, voted for the privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport and opposed a replacement airport, they share responsibility with the government for the appalling outcomes for Sydney's residents and the environment—appalling outcomes described in detail by the member for Sydney and the member for Lowe.
The operations of Kingsford Smith airport impose unacceptable noise, air pollution and accident threat burden on the population of inner Sydney. As demand for aircraft movements grows, the burden will intensify. Current so-called noise sharing flight paths will not solve the problem in the long run. The Greens believe that a replacement site should be found outside of the Sydney air drainage basin and that Kingsford Smith airport should be phased out. High-speed public transport links should be constructed to link the new airport to Sydney and suburbs. Money raised from the sale of the KSA site—except foreshore land and environmentally sensitive land—for residential, commercial and industrial development can fund the majority of the costs of relocating the airport. Because the greatest danger occurs when aircraft take off or land, it is desirable to locate airports as far away as practicable from densely populated areas and vulnerable installations such as chemical plants and oil refineries. This happens in major cities around the world, even in Australia, and Kingsford Smith is not appropriately sited at all. Moreover, when an aircraft experiences difficulties and needs to make an emergency landing, one of the first things done is to jettison excess fuel—as has happened over Sydney on occasion.
A proposed second airport at Wilton would spell an environmental disaster for the Illawarra and the Southern Highlands of New South Wales. Labor's proposal would compromise the quality of Sydney's water supply, with unburnt fuel and other pollutants dropped from planes flying over the catchment. Rather than promoting developments which threaten precious water supplies, communities expect government to move in the other direction. Labor's proposal would impose unacceptable noise on communities under the flight paths. KSA was originally constructed as a temporary airport which through the accretion of time became permanent. Its development has been marked by poor decision making, bad process, undue influence from private interests—as the member for Lowe has pointed out—and a lack of commitment to the community from either of the dominant political parties. The third runway was constructed to appease powerful friends of the ALP, without proper consideration of the impacts on local communities.
The Greens believe that the role of the political process is to establish and define the parameters for an expert site selection process which should then be conducted without political interference. The process must be responsive to the needs of individual communities that might be affected by airport siting decisions. The Greens believe that a replacement airport site should be found by an expert process that weighs the economic, environmental and social benefits and costs of candidate sites, free from undue commercial or political influence. We are committed to the development of a process that respects the wishes of all local communities.
The Labor Party, if it is elected to government, will face a massive community backlash if it chooses Wilton as the preferred site for Sydney's second airport. Wollondilly Shire, for example, has changed dramatically in the 18 years since Wilton emerged as the second choice behind Badgerys Creek as the preferred airport site back in 1985, and the ALP must accept this. Wilton is in the Sydney air drainage basin, and a major airport would worsen the poor air quality which already impacts on Illawarra residents, particularly residents in my electorate of Cunningham. Wilton is also close to major Sydney and Wollongong water catchments, which could well be adversely affected if a major airport were established in the vicinity. All Wollongong suburbs would be adversely affected by a major airport at Wilton or in the immediate vicinity. Aircraft would have to come in low over the city, and the escarpment would magnify the noise. And, remember, Wollongong is just two minutes landing time from the Wilton airport. An international airport at Wilton is a dumb idea, if ever there was one. The local council opposes it, the 38,000-odd residents of Wollondilly oppose it and the people of the Illawarra certainly will not accept having Sydney's airport noise problems dumped on them.
In summary, the Greens call on the opposition to reconsider their decision to build a second airport at Wilton, or to once again face the political consequences of ignoring the concerns of people living in the Illawarra. The people of Cunningham do not want a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week international airport at Wilton—and this is a likely scenario. But the Greens are honest about what we want. The fact that the ALP are not listening to us is not our fault. I therefore commend the member for Sydney's motion and call on the government to adopt our policy and put in place a process to identify a replacement airport site for Kingsford Smith airport.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2004-03-30,"—I am very pleased to speak in support of the motion moved today by the member for Sydney and seconded by the member for Lowe—colleagues who, along with me, have fought aircraft noise and its impact on our local communities. The Sydney airport master plan will see a doubling of the number of movements, from 225,000 a year to 412,000. It will see a tripling of the number of passengers, from 23 million to 68 million. It will have a devastating impact on our communities. I do not think that people outside those communities understand. The member for Mackellar said that half of the aircraft go over the ocean. That is absolute nonsense. Figure 16.1 of the master plan shows that, for the predicted daily jet aircraft movements in 2024, flight path G, which is the one to the south out over the bay, has 56 movements a day. That is 56 out of 1,131 every single day, of which 638 are directly over my residents. It is the most densely populated area, not just in Sydney or New South Wales but in Australia. This is an outrageous plan which puts the interests of profit holders above the interests of residents.
I wish to apologise to you, Mr Speaker, for my interjections last week in this House for which you were forced to take action in accordance with the standing orders. I was particularly angry at the frustration I felt because kids from Fort Street High School have their education disrupted every 50 seconds by aircraft noise over their heads and the government has refused to listen. It says that there is noise from, say, here to where your office is, Mr Speaker, but that where Fort Street High School is there is no noise. It is New South Wales's oldest high school. The buildings were built before the airport and, indeed, before planes were invented, yet those kids have their education disrupted. That is the real impact of aircraft noise.
I do not have long to speak, so I will also address the other alternative. We know what the Liberal plan is: more noise over more people more often. Eventually the cap and the curfew will be gone and the smaller planes will have to go to Bankstown or somewhere else to free up Sydney airport for the major jets. The alternative put forward by the Labor Party is to have a second Sydney airport environmental impact statement. We do not want the problems of aircraft noise visited on anyone. That is why we say that, upon coming into government, we will have an EIS into the Wilton site and into sites in the southern highlands.
The Greens supported Wilton in my area. Councillors, state activists and state MPs all supported Wilton as the alternative until the member for Cunningham won that by-election. Then—talk about political motivation!—all of a sudden they were against Wilton as a site for the airport. They talk about environmental considerations. Three per cent of Sydney's air pollution is caused by the airport—the main cause is cars and transport—yet they say that we cannot have Kingsford Smith airport and that it should be shut down. I do not support the position of shutting down Sydney airport. Sydney airport creates 40,000 jobs and it is important for the economy. My community does not expect to have no noise; they expect what occurs through living in the inner city. What they want, though, is some fair standard of living. That is why we do not support the complete shutting down of Sydney airport. How dishonest is it to say that you can shut down Sydney airport, but you are opposed to Badgerys Creek airport and Wilton airport. The Greens' position, quite frankly, is that planes will have to fly over Sydney and you will have to parachute out over the spot to which you want to go. It is an absurd position. It is dishonest and it will be condemned as such. I call upon people to support the Labor Party position, which actually provides a real solution to aircraft noise.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1,speech

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2004-03-30,"—The federal opposition recognises the need in the current international security environment to provide bipartisan support for the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003, based on the further amendments recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and those amendments as accepted by the government in response to the parliamentary joint committee's recommendations.
The truth is that we in Australia now face an international security environment which has changed fundamentally through the proliferation of terrorist activities. This has been the most far-reaching change in the security policy terrain since the Cold War. The complexity of the challenges facing our intelligence agencies today necessarily means that the environment in which ASIS undertakes its functions has changed fundamentally also. Recognising this changed environment, this bill seeks to enable ASIS to protect its staff members and agents and engage cooperatively with other agencies—be they the AFP, the ADF or others—in the war against terrorism.
These are grave and important operational considerations that need to be addressed in the current environment. While we recognise that we need to provide greater levels of security for our officers and agents deployed overseas, we are also conscious of the need to ensure that these new powers are not abused. It is for this reason that we successfully requested that the government refer the amendment bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to review the contents of the proposed legislation and suggest amendments where it identified them as necessary. That committee has now reported. The tabling of that report was done first in the Senate two weeks ago, and I understand that the tabling in the House of Representatives occurs today.
As many in this place are aware, ASIS's activities are the subject of intense scrutiny. We on this side of the parliament believe that this is a good thing. The current act, the Intelligence Services Act 2001, states: 
... ASIS must not plan for, or undertake, paramilitary activities or activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons.
This limitation arose from the Hope royal commission in 1983. That royal commission reviewed the security and intelligence agencies and investigated the controversy arising from an incident in November 1983 at the Sheraton hotel in Melbourne involving ASIS agents. The 1983 royal commission made a number of significant recommendations, most of which the government of the day adopted, and they remain in place today. It was recommended that ASIS's directive be amended to exclude ASIS from carrying out covert action or undertaking training for such action. Secondly, it was recommended that the use by ASIS of weapons be terminated and that ASIS's stock of weapons and explosives be disposed of.
Of course, it was generally accepted before the events of 11 September 2001 that these limitations were appropriate in the context of the security policy environment in which ASIS operated at the time. Since that time, however, we accept that the rise of international terrorism in the post-September 11 period has changed the operating environment for ASIS employees abroad. We accept that this changed international environment could not have been foreseen when the act was originally drafted. ASIS today is operating in a range of environments where the security situation is deteriorating and where its work involves intelligence collection on terrorism targets in the region.
ASIS's work on terrorism targets brings additional threats to the safety of ASIS employees. It is a reality that, in this changed international environment, ASIS employees now face much greater levels of personal and physical danger than they have before. To give some quantitative weight to this, the Singapore based Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies argues that up to nine additional organisations similar to Jemaah Islamiah—the organisation responsible for the Bali bombings—are currently operating within South-East Asia with different memberships, differing militant objectives, and a capacity and predisposition to participate in terrorist activities against Western targets, including Australian targets.
Additionally, there remain at large anywhere between 200 and 2,000 individuals who have been directly engaged with al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah and/or associated terrorist organisations. As Glen Fisher, the Australian Federal Police's lead investigator on Jemaah Islamiah and one of the country's leading experts on the terrorist organisation, has observed, the fact that JI is restructuring and resuming its operations in response to increasing counter-terrorism efforts means there is a greater need to `run harder' and `stay abreast' of the organisation. As I have said in this parliament before, the first responsibility of the parliament and of the executive government of this country is to provide for the national security of the country. There is no higher responsibility. On this side, we recognise that it is important that, in these changed international circumstances, ASIS must be able to discharge its activities and provide for the adequate protection of its staff and those working for it. 
What does this bill seek to do? Under the proposed amendment bill, ASIS employees would be allowed to carry weapons for self-defence purposes. Under this schema, they would still be unable to initiate acts of violence and would remain an intelligence collection agency that conducts its activities in a non-violent way. Given the enhanced self-defence needs of ASIS employees in the current international environment and the formalisation of self-defence powers involved, three proposed changes need to be considered in some detail.
The first relates to the provision of training in weapons use and self-defence techniques. The new proposed regulations for the training in the use of weapons for self-defence purposes are outlined in clauses 6(5) and 6(6) of schedule 1 and clause 1(1) of schedule 2. Essentially, the new provisions would enable ASIS officers and agents to be trained in the use of weapons only for self-defence purposes. In addition to the conditions attached to the provision of a weapon to an ASIS employee for the purposes of self-protection, for the protection of other ASIS employees, for the protection of individuals assisting ASIS operations or for training purposes, is the requirement that the Minister for Foreign Affairs must provide written notice to the director-general approving the provision of the weapon and the training in the use of the weapon.
Specifically, these provisions relate to the use of a weapon, or self-defence technique, outside of Australia. In other words, ASIS employees will not be authorised to use a weapon within Australia. Schedule 2 also outlines additional constraints involving the use of a weapon. These relate to individual ministerial approval in relation to the provision or use of a weapon: first, the provision of a copy of the approval to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security; and, second, the issuing of guidelines governing the detailed use of weapons for self-defence purposes.
Additionally, a further clarification sought by the Director-General of ASIS has been to ensure that ASIS officers and agents can participate in the planning and undertaking of joint operations with other Australian organisations and approved non-Australian organisations. Once again, this primarily relates to the new challenges arising from terrorism and the possibility of Australians being taken hostage and where operational cooperation with other agencies becomes essential.
This amendment bill would clarify this by introducing a regime in proposed replacement section 6(4) of the amendment bill. Note 1 of proposed section 6(4) states:
This subsection does not prevent ASIS from being involved with the planning or undertaking of activities covered by paragraphs (a) to (c) by other organisations provided that staff members or agents of ASIS do not undertake those activities.
Further, under the proposed amendment bill, the new schedule 2, ASIS would be able to extend physical protection in self-defence to individuals in other organisations that were acting in support of ASIS's activities, such as the Australian Federal Police or members of the Australian Defence Force.
The range of individuals that could be protected by those acting in self-defence is governed by section 13 of the existing act, which defines those organisations with which ASIS may cooperate. The proposed amendments would not alter this in any way, and, in any activity involving armed ASIS officers acting with any other approved organisation, ASIS employees would only be able to operate in self-defence or defence of those engaged in agreed cooperative operations.
When this bill was first introduced into this place late last year we, the opposition, immediately referred it to the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. We believed then that that was an appropriate course of action, given the content and the gravity of the proposed amendments. That committee made a range of unanimous recommendations that would ensure an improved oversight regime for ASIS under the amended legislation.
As far as self-defence and training are concerned, the committee recommended that guidelines on the use of weapons and self-defence techniques contain a detailed protocol for the planning or conduct of activities with foreign organisations and which may involve the use of force. The committee further recommended that these guidelines be produced in consultation with relevant departments and agencies, be agreed by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and be approved by the National Security Committee of cabinet. Second, the committee recommends that the range of weapons be defined in the guidelines under schedule 2 clause 1(6) and that specific types of weapons to be used on each operation be authorised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In its report, the committee emphasised that these guidelines: 
... should comprise a detailed policy framework covering training, handling, use, storage and logistics. ASIS should draw on the expertise of relevant Australian agencies in developing the framework ...
The committee also noted that training guidelines should include a detailed understanding of what is implied by self-defence training.
Third, the committee recommended that the Minister for Foreign Affairs approve a general training program in the use of weapons and self-defence techniques for specific ASIS officer positions as designated by the director-general. This training program would be ongoing and managed by the director-general. In addition, the committee recommended that a copy of the training program be provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, that any changes to it be advised as soon as practicable and that DFAT be consulted in the designation by the director-general of any position as requiring training in the use of weapons and self-defence techniques.
Fourth, the committee recommended that the guidelines on the use of weapons and self-defence techniques also cover all aspects of training, handling, use, storage and logistics, that training courses cover initial training and refresher-requalification training; and that a skills assessment regime be developed, and training certification be managed in such a way as to ensure that ASIS's capabilities are maintained. The current amendment bill requires that the director-general issue guidelines on the use of weapons and self-defence techniques. Finally, the committee recommended that, in developing training and logistics guidelines, the director-general, while consulting broadly, use the training and logistics models of the AFP as a basis.
As far as oversight mechanisms are concerned, the committee recommended that the bill be amended to include a provision setting out oversight mechanisms for the initial approval of operations and for subsequent reporting to enable review and accountability and that, where ASIS anticipates being involved in the planning or undertaking of operations with foreign organisations that may include the use of force, the approvals process be expanded from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to include the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. Second, the committee recommended that the foreign minister approve each deployment of an armed ASIS staff member overseas and/or the training and arming of an ASIS employee overseas. In particular, the committee noted that deploying an armed staff member overseas or agreeing to the training and arming of an agent overseas was of a sufficient risk to warrant ministerial attention to those cases. The committee stated:
ASIS should therefore determine which positions were likely to require appropriate training, and ensure that this was provided for all occupants of those designated positions, without having to seek further Ministerial approval whenever staffing changes occurred. This would enable the Minister to focus on individual operational requests, while the overall planning and conduct of training of ASIS staff in the use of weapons and self-defence techniques could be more effectively managed by the Director General.
Third, the committee recommended that ASIS's request to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for approval of an operation include a detailed assessment of the risks to ASIS staff members and agents involved and to Australia as well as advice from DFAT on possible effects on bilateral relationships. Fourth, the committee recommended that the bill be amended to require the Director-General of ASIS to provide the inspector-general of security with a report on any operational incident with the potential to embarrass Australia. This information could then be included in the inspector-general's reports to government as appropriate.
The government has indicated it is taking up seven of the nine recommendations. These recommendations will enhance the oversight of ASIS's operations and training of ASIS officers. In particular, it is important that the government has accepted the recommendation that the foreign minister first consult the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General for approval of operations with foreign organisations that may include the use of force. As Senator Ray said in the other place on 11 March, it is much less likely that the foreign minister could authorise `mad projects' if the responsibility is spread over to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General.
The adoption of guidelines and protocols governing the type and nature of training in and use of weapons and self-defence techniques strengthens the operational oversight of ASIS's activities and training while allowing ASIS to maintain the necessary operational flexibility that is required of an organisation of this nature. The procedures proposed by the committee would enable ministers to be adequately informed in advance of deciding on ASIS's involvement in foreign operations which may involve violence, and they would enable ministers to determine the overall appropriateness of the type and nature of operations and training that ASIS officers undergo.
We support the government in its decision to adopt seven of the nine recommendations in totality. However, while the government's formal response captures the essence of the PJC's recommendations, we have noted that there are variations between the government's response and the PJC's recommendations with regard to recommendations 2 and 3 in particular. In relation to recommendation 2, the government has accepted the inclusion, in the guidelines on the use of weapons, of a protocol specifying ASIS involvement in the planning or conduct of activities with foreign organisations; however, it has not included that the guidelines should be agreed with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.
We have said to the government that we believe IGIS should be given an instructive role in the development and formulation of guidelines. I understand that the government is proposing that IGIS be given a consultative role but not an actual clearance process. I have been advised that this is because of the potential conflict of interest that would arise if IGIS were to be given a role in formulating the guidelines while also having a role in overseeing adherence to them. We in the opposition remain of the view that there should be a greater role for IGIS in the development of guidelines. We would expect that, should disagreement occur between ASIS and IGIS in the consultation process during the production of these guidelines, IGIS would articulate, at an appropriate time, any such disagreement to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD.
In relation to recommendation 3, the government has accepted that the range of weapons to be used in ASIS training and activities be defined in the guidelines for the use of weapons and self-defence techniques. The government has agreed that the definition will note that the provision of weapons will normally be limited to semi-automatic hand guns, pistols and lesser or non-lethal weapons. However, the government has said that it would not be prudent for the bill itself to be overly restrictive in terms of the specific weapons to be utilised by ASIS staff members or agents. When it comes to assessing variations on weapons used for particular operations, I would expect the Director-General of ASIS, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the IGIS to exercise scrutiny and inspect any variation. Where there is a variation, I would expect that ASIS would provide an explanation to IGIS as to why this variation was necessary.
There has been some concern expressed that these amendments may, through ASIS's potential cooperation in joint operations, lead to ASIS's involvement in operations that include the possibility of assassination. I welcome the foreign minister's commitment and assurances that, in ASIS involvement in joint operations, the possibility of assassination will not be allowed under any circumstances and that internal protocols will be issued proscribing any involvement by ASIS in such activities. I further understand that this will be reflected by the minister, or the parliamentary secretary representing the minister, in the second reading debate.
The opposition support these amendments. We support them because they are an appropriate response to a real need: to provide for the self-defence of our ASIS personnel overseas and to enable cooperation with other Australian and foreign organisations. The intelligence business is a difficult business, and it is a business where, by its nature, violence cannot always be escaped, given the nature of the persons against whom intelligence operations are conducted in an age of terrorism. I said in September 2001, when the original legislation was introduced:
We as a parliament and as a nation need to place on record the fact that we commend the professionalism of these agencies, because they discharge an important function for the nation. ... The work which they do is not only important, it requires a high degree of professional ability; and in some cases the work is arduous and dangerous. The staff of these agencies should be commended for their professionalism. I am happy to join those on this side of the House in our support for the legislation.
Those sentiments were articulated when we passed the bill in 2001. We live in a changed international environment that is fundamentally at risk from the continuing threat of global terrorism. We must be strident in our fight against this threat, and we must ensure that the men and women we send out to fight it are equipped to adequately address it. In the case of ASIS, it is essential that we allow those officers in the field of operations to have the ability to defend themselves. This is not radical legislation; it is sensible legislation. And, thanks to the work of the parliamentary joint committee, in the broad it has the balance correct. We on this side of the parliament therefore extend our support to the legislation.",REPS,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-03-30,"—I am pleased to follow the member for Griffith and to hear that the opposition will be supporting the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003. It is an important bill. It is significant in the new global environment in which we operate—a world that has been changed by September 11 and October 12 and the terrorism that now pervades our communities and the international arena. The challenge is how we approach it. This piece of legislation will assist those who are at the front line, dealing with terrorism, to protect themselves. The Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 will update the 2001 act to allow ASIS officers to protect themselves by being able to carry firearms. It is important to note that this bill does not provide ASIS with a licence to use aggressive force; it still encourages and requires ASIS to maintain the performance of its functions in a nonviolent way. However, it does allow its agents and staff to better defend themselves if placed in a situation of conflict. It provides various checks and balances in that approvals for officers to carry firearms must be given by the minister. If the firearms are discharged then a report on what occurred will need to be submitted.
The Intelligence Services Act 2001 was constructed to provide a legislative base for ASIS to operate on, and also to establish a parliamentary committee to oversee the operations of ASIS. The current legislation does not allow for certain tasks to be performed by ASIS. With the turn of world events since the act's establishment, it is necessary to revise the legislation to allow the security agencies to be brought up to speed with the changing face of terrorism. It is important to note that the primary functions and current responsibilities of ASIS will remain unchanged by this bill. The legislation will ensure that ASIS agents will be protected and able to defend themselves in the various arenas in which they operate, if the need arises.
The bill allows the use of weapons only for the self-defence of agents operating outside Australia. It is important to emphasise that this bill does not in any way change the functions or the mission of ASIS. The sole exemption to the use of weapons clause relates to the use of weapons only for training purposes within Australian territory. The amendment merely assists in protecting the staff of ASIS from the dangers that occur in performing their duties. It is not possible to judge the direction of future terrorism, but the preparedness of our agents is important. ASIS agents will be exempt from state and territorial laws with respect to gun licences when operating under the bill's requirements. This is to assist in the protection of the identity of ASIS operatives and staff.
All the accountabilities of ASIS are still in effect. It is still bound to ministerial approval and still answers to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. There are no provisions in the amendment which allow ASIS to remove itself from any of its responsibilities or from any accountability chains to which it is currently attached. Part of this bill addresses the issue of reporting. When a firearm is discharged by a member of ASIS, a report has to be made and recorded. This method of accountability is to make certain that all incidents are recorded, providing a check on ASIS's operations and ensuring that it operates within the guidelines provided by this bill.
We need to ensure that ASIS is able to communicate, and deal effectively with, intelligence gathered from outside Australian territory that deals directly with domestic Australian security. That is the second important aspect of this bill. This bill seeks to achieve better lines of communication between ASIS and the agencies responsible for conducting counter-terrorism operations. Under this amending legislation, ASIS will be able to communicate to domestic security forces any foreign intelligence that it gathers. Under the current act, ASIS is specifically not allowed to participate in any form of paramilitary operation or planning for or conducting any tasks involving the use of force. This amendment will allow ASIS to work more closely with other agencies, including the Australian Defence Force and other counter-terrorism forces, in order to conduct its operations without the fear of contradicting any legislative requirements.
In conclusion, I point out that this bill is essential to protecting and securing Australia's future way of life. It is important for the day-to-day protection of the staff of ASIS and all those who work with ASIS. We must allow our security agencies to do their job effectively. This bill is not giving ASIS any licence to impinge on the freedoms of the people of Australia. ASIS will still retain its policy of nonviolence and will provide intelligence and support to those agencies which may be at the centre of conflict, along with improving its own defence in line with new levels of conflict. ASIS's functions are crucial to the security of this nation. ASIS is important in the fight against terrorism. It plays an important role in the collection of intelligence on a global basis. This legislation will not only enable ASIS officers to carry firearms for their own self-protection; it will enable them to communicate directly with foreign organisations to assist and enhance the collection of intelligence on a global basis. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2004-03-30,"—I rise to speak on the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003, which was first introduced into the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last October and has now returned having been the subject of an inquiry by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The committee's report on the bill was unanimous and bipartisan. I commend the members of the Jull committee for that achievement. That is as I would expect from a committee whose members include the honourable member for Brand and Senator Robert Ray, both of whom are former defence ministers. The committee's recommendations have significantly improved the bill. It is to the credit of the government members on the committee that they saw the deficiencies in the original bill and accepted the need for them to be amended.
The bill the minister has presented today is to be significantly different from the bill that was introduced last year, and it has considerably improved. The purpose of this bill is to provide protection for the agents of the Australian Security Intelligence Service as they carry out their extremely important role in defending Australia's security in the new and dangerous international situation in which we have found ourselves since September 11 and the Bali bombings of October 2002. The main provisions of the bill are to provide for the self-defence of ASIS agents and officers, including the use of weapons under defined and regulated conditions, and to clarify ASIS's powers to undertake joint operations with other organisations while limiting to self-defence purposes only ASIS's use of weapons in such operations.
This is, in some respects, a reversal of decisions taken by the Hawke government in 1984 as a result of recommendations of the Hope royal commission into ASIS. That royal commission was appointed in the wake of a scandalous raid on the Sheraton Hotel in Melbourne carried out by ASIS in an ill-conceived training exercise in 1983. I am sure the kind of professional work that they are needed for overseas will not see them behave like a bunch of bozos as they did in Melbourne in that particular raid. The commission recommended that ASIS no longer be allowed to engage in covert actions, that ASIS operations be put on a statutory basis and that ASIS be placed under much closer supervision through the office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. I am glad that supervision still exists, but we live in new days.
Those decisions of the Hawke government were correct in the circumstances of 1984. The Sheraton Hotel incident showed that, during the years of the Fraser government, intelligence services had become too loosely supervised by the government and that there was a need to bring their activities under closer supervision. The sad fact is that, in the 20 years since those decisions were made, the world has changed dramatically, particularly our part of the world. We have seen the rise of radical Islamism in countries to our near north, importing ideologies of theocratic totalitarianism from the Middle East and hijacking the great monotheistic faith of the people in those countries for its own purposes.
We saw in October 2002 what the consequences of the spreading of the tentacles of Islamist terrorism in our region mean. The bombs that exploded in Bali and killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, were planted at the instigation of Jemaah Islamiah, the Indonesian franchise of al-Qaeda. I believe that those bombs were deliberately planted where and when they were in order to kill Australians, although they also killed a large number of Indonesians and citizens of some 20 countries. In these circumstances of a direct terrorist threat to Australia and to the lives of Australians when they are travelling in other countries, the role of our intelligence services must change. We can no longer be content with a situation where our intelligence services operate only as observers and gatherers of intelligence. Of course, the gathering of accurate and reliable intelligence is of vital importance, as we know more than ever after the war in Iraq, but the protection of Australia from terrorism now requires more.
Many Australians, and certainly most of us on this side of the House, have traditionally been wary of giving our security agencies this kind of power. Those whose memories go back to the Vietnam War recall the misuse of ASIO by the then Liberal government and their surveillance of people involved in protesting against the war in Vietnam but neglect in doing very much about the Croatian Ustasha or the various Nazi war criminals who found their place in Australia.
I think we need to recognise that, in the current climate, the provisions of this bill have become an unpleasant necessity. I do not seek to make accusations against anyone over the Bali bombing, but the fact is—and the experience of other countries shows this—that good intelligence work and well-targeted pre-emptive interventions can detect plans for this kind of atrocity and prevent them from being executed. I note that the government has undertaken major expenditure in the intelligence area. I hope it is being well directed, particularly to people able to speak Arabic and Indonesian languages who can be trusted long-term analysts in this area. I do not think any member of this House would have objected to a targeted operation by our intelligence services in cooperation with those of Indonesia to disrupt Hambali's Jemaah Islamiah group as it was planning the Bali bombing.
It is very important to understand the mentality of this new Islamist totalitarianism. It is best brought to mind by reference to the Yemeni spokesman of al-Qaeda. Their franchise there is called the Islamic Army of Aden. He was asked why they had blown up a French supertanker, the Limburg, when France had been perceived to be more moderate on issues related to the extreme Islamist view of the world—this was before the banning of the hijab. The al-Qaeda franchise representative from the Islamic Army of Aden said:
We would have preferred to hit a US frigate, but no problem because they are all infidels.
I think that is very instructive of the mentality of the people that we are dealing with. We are all infidels—Left, Right, Australian, American, Indonesian—according to them, and they will have no mercy in dealing with us. The role of our intelligence services therefore becomes very important in protecting this country.
The Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD has approved the central principles of this bill: that ASIS agents should be given the right to carry and use arms in very tightly defined circumstances and that ASIS should have the right to act in cooperation with the intelligence services of other countries in carrying out counter-terrorist operations. The opposition support these objectives. We believe that Australia's intelligence services must be given the right to defend themselves when they are engaged in the difficult, dangerous and absolutely necessary work of penetrating the network of Islamist terrorist organisations operating in our region and preventing any repetition of the terrible crime in Bali. We also believe that ASIS, as Australia's front-line international intelligence organisation, should be given the right to cooperate with the intelligence services of our allies and our neighbours in carrying out these tasks, which may at times necessitate the use of weapons, certainly for purposes of self-defence.
We further believe that the joint parliamentary committee was right to raise doubts about the provisions of the original bill introduced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last year. The first of its recommendations was to insist on a more rigorous mechanism for the approval and oversight of operations. Under the original bill, the power to give approval to operations which may entail the use of force rested solely with the foreign minister. I do not want to say anything derogatory about the current foreign minister but I think, as members of the committee thought, it is wrong that the power to approve the use of force by Australian agents should be vested in one person. That is the principle involved here—it is not that we are denigrating any particular minister. The committee recommended that the power of approval be expanded so that the approval of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General must also be obtained. In addition, the committee recommended that the Minister for Foreign Affairs must specifically approve the deployment of armed ASIS staff overseas.
The committee recommended that there be a detailed protocol for the planning or conduct of such joint activities with foreign organisations which may also involve the use of force. This may seem a rather obvious provision, and I was surprised to learn it was not in the original bill, but that is indeed the case. This shows once again the wisdom of referring this bill to a committee of members whose experience and judgment has enabled them to make important improvements to the bill. It shows the worth of parliamentary oversight of these kinds of bills and issues. 
The committee also recommended that the provisions of the bill be limited to pistols and automatic handguns and that ministers must specifically approve the use of the specific type of weapons in any proposed actions under this bill. This is a useful limitation on the expansion of the powers the bill confers. ASIS is not an army, and it is not the intention of the bill that ASIS should duplicate the functions of the SAS by acquiring sophisticated weapons, RPGs or heavier weapons other than those necessary for self-defence. 
As the recent terrorist atrocity in Madrid showed, the threat of terrorism against civilian targets in Western countries has not yet been defeated, although it is clear that the power of the al-Qaeda network has been greatly reduced by the loss of its base in Afghanistan and the seizure of its key operatives like Hambali and Khalid Sheik Mohammed. The war is not over yet, even though I believe it is being won. Australia is part of that war whether we like it or not. We became a target when we liberated the people of East Timor, when we assisted in the liberation of the people of Afghanistan and also given our current role in Iraq. I think it is absolutely necessary to recognise that, even though it may have been necessary. 
It is therefore necessary that Australia equip itself properly to defend itself, and that means giving to our intelligence services the powers they need to protect this country and its citizens, particularly when they are outside Australia. The bill aims to do that and that is why we are here supporting it. The bill as initially presented to the House had some deficiencies, and the House should be grateful to members of the joint committee for the recommendations to improve this bill. It is now a bill that I and the opposition are pleased to support.",REPS,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-03-30,"—I rise to speak on the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 knowing that all of us in this House are aware of the international climate which faces not just Australia or the Western world but the entire global community. Only two weeks ago, we witnessed the tragedy of the Madrid bombing, where 200 souls were destroyed and over 1,000 people were injured, many of them grievously. That bombing is a tragic and timely reminder that we are faced with a situation not like anything that Australian society has faced before, because it is an insidious movement carried out by a small group who are seeking to sow seeds of disruption, destruction and damage throughout not just the Western world but the moderate Islamic world as well.
In an article in the Herald Sun today, I wrote that al-Qaeda is seeking to establish a Taliban-style Islamic caliphate across the world. That is its objective. It is a clear, 100-year vision and it is an objective which it seeks to bring about through jihad or holy war. There is no capacity to reason, talk or negotiate. Everything that we try is rejected. We are infidels in their mind, and so too are all of those moderate Islamic states which reject the notion of a Taliban-style globe. That is the situation we face today. The strategic objective of al-Qaeda is very clear. It is to bring down the core Islamic states of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Indonesia by destabilising them and breaking down the structures in those societies. In order to do that, it seeks to break down Western connections, to frighten away Western engagement, to break down resolve within those societies and to cause fragmentation. That is the world which we now face. 
There are two core elements in the response to that world. Firstly, there has to be hard security, and that is contained within this bill. It is about taking head-on those who will not negotiate, those who do not seek anything other than the annihilation of a system in which they have no belief. They reject the democracies; they reject the moderate Islamic societies; they reject all groupings other than their own combination of al-Qaeda and a Taliban-style globe. Secondly, and this is something I want to lay before the House in speaking to this bill, there also has to be what is known as soft power. Soft power is the recognition that ideas can move countries and people. They will not change al-Qaeda; they will not change the core Taliban. But it is very important that, whilst we use the hard measures to defend ourselves and to break down the capability of al-Qaeda and those extremists who support al-Qaeda, at the same time we take three key steps to influence the communities from which they draw some of their people. 
Firstly, there has to be a democratisation of both wealth and political power within the Middle East. We see in Afghanistan and Iraq the seeds of that democratisation; we see extraordinary steps. Incidentally, in Iran, Libya and Syria, we see the nascent steps towards some form of disarmament. It is very positive. Let us not overstate it, but it is positive. So, firstly, there has to be a democratisation of wealth and political power in the Middle East. The Western world has to stand up and take responsibility, because we have been too weak on that front in the past. Secondly, we have to encourage those who would support moderate, broad based education as opposed to those who would support extremist education. Thirdly, we have to participate in joint policing operations. But in terms of hard security, intelligence is indispensable and the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 is critical to bringing forth those steps.
What it does is essentially two things: firstly, it allows Australian Secret Intelligence Service personnel to be armed under appropriate circumstances; and, secondly, it allows them to participate in the planning of authorised force operations by other agencies—until this point in time they have not been able to do so. When you look at situations in Indonesia, in the Philippines and in other parts of the world, the lesson from the Bali bombing is that an extraordinary amount can be achieved through cooperation between Australia's security and policing forces and the appropriate security and policing forces in the region and amongst our allies. That is what this bill enables. It enables Australia to participate in the planning of activities which involve authorised force to protect, to preserve and to prevent. Those are the core elements, and that is what we have to do.
We face a threat unlike anything we have faced before. We are a target, not because of any specific actions but because of who we are. As we have seen, whether it was the Philippines, Indonesia, the Middle East, Tanzania or Kenya, numerous countries have suffered from direct actions against them despite the fact that they were not involved in Iraq and they were not involved in Afghanistan. Actions have been taken against countries because al-Qaeda will base its activities on opportunity and capability. So we have to deal with that by confronting them head-on. At the same time, the second thing that we have to do is to make sure that we deal with the communities from which they draw some of their people. We have to do that by emphasising democratisation of wealth and power, by emphasising education and by emphasising joint policing activities. This bill takes a small step and an important step towards protecting Australian Secret Intelligence Service personnel and allowing us to cooperate in the hard security matters with other countries, like-minded countries and those who have genuine concerns. I commend the bill to the House. I recognise that it is an important step in Australia helping to protect itself and to participate in global protection.",REPS,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2004-03-30,"—The Australian Labor Party supports the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 and the proposed amendments to the Intelligence Services Act 2001. As all in the House would know, the proposed amendments provide greater measures for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service—ASIS—to be involved in the planning and undertaking of paramilitary or violent activities by others and to provide, train with and use weapons and self-defence techniques in certain circumstances. Given the current climate and the need for Australia to be active in the fight against terrorism, these measures are necessary. Australia abhors terrorism and is steadfast in its fight against it. That is why the Labor Party supports these amendments. They are necessary and appropriate. The passage of this bill is necessary because the international security climate has changed greatly in recent years.
We now live in a time where terrorism is threatening our very way of life. Terrorism, in all its forms, affronts all that Australia stands for and all Australians find terrorism repugnant. Given the changing circumstances in international security since the September 11 attacks in the United States, Australia must adopt and initiate methods to counter terrorist activities. ASIS today is operating in a range of environments where the security situation is deteriorating and where its work involves intelligence collection on terrorism and weapons proliferation targets in the region. ASIS's work on terrorism and weapons proliferation targets bring additional threats to the safety of ASIS officers and agents. It is a reality that, in this changed international environment, ASIS agents now face much greater levels of personal and physical danger than they have in the more recent past. ASIS officers are now operating in a difficult and uncertain international environment that needs to be dealt with.
The first responsibility of this parliament and of the executive of this country is to provide for the national security of our nation. The ALP recognises that it is important in these changed circumstances that ASIS be able to discharge its activities and provide for the adequate protection of its staff and those working within the organisation. Under the proposed amendment bill, ASIS officers and agents would be allowed to carry weapons for self-defence purposes. This still precludes the initiation of acts of violence and ensures ASIS remains an intelligence collection agency that conducts its activities in a non-violent fashion.
Given the enhanced self-defence needs of ASIS officers and agents in the current international environment and the formalisation of self-defence powers involved, three proposed changes need to be considered in some detail. Firstly, there is the provision of training in weapons use and self-defence techniques. Essentially, the new provisions would enable ASIS officers and agents to be trained in the use of weapons only for self-defence purposes. In addition to the conditions attached to the provision of a weapon to an ASIS officer or agent for the purposes of self-protection, for the protection of individuals assisting ASIS operations or for training purposes, is the requirement that the Minister for Foreign Affairs must provide written notice to the Director-General approving the provision of the weapon and the training in the use of the weapon. Specifically, these provisions relate to the use of a weapon or a self-defence technique outside of Australia. In other words, ASIS agents or officers will not be authorised to use a weapon within Australia.
Secondly, ASIS officers and agents can participate in the planning and undertaking of joint operations with other Australian organisations and approved non-Australian organisations. Another change to the act allows ASIS officers and agents to participate in the planning and undertaking of joint operations—that is, with other Australian organisations and, again, with approved non-Australian organisations. This primarily relates to the new challenges arising from terrorism and the possibility of Australians being taken hostage and where operational cooperation with other agencies becomes an essential element of ASIS agents and officers doing their task. 
Thirdly, ASIS would be able to extend physical protection in self-defence to individuals in other organisations that were acting in support of ASIS's activities. This change, which is part of the new second schedule, relates to Australian Federal Police or members of Australia's military. The range of individuals that could be protected by those acting in self-defence is governed by section 13 of the existing act, which defines those organisations with which ASIS may cooperate. The proposed amendments would not alter this in any way and, in any activity involving armed ASIS officers acting with another approved organisation, ASIS officers and agents would only be able to operate in self-defence or defence of those engaged in agreed cooperative operations.
This bill has been to the Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. It was referred to that most important committee on our intelligence organisations when it was first introduced into the House late last year. The committee has unanimously recommended strengthening the amendment legislation in three key areas: self-defence by ASIS officers, including training; oversight of cooperation with other Australian agencies who are armed, such as the Australian Federal Police and ASIO; and oversight of ASIS involvement in planning paramilitary activity and accompanying overseas agencies who are armed and who are doing what is defined in the legislation as legitimate activity.
The opposition support these amendments. We support them because they are an appropriate response to a real need. While we continually talk—and will do for many years to come—about the changed security environment, the recognition of that changed security environment has to be reflected in government legislation. It also needs to be reflected in the powers that are given to our policing forces, our military and our intelligence organisations in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. The complexity of the environment in which ASIS agents and officers operate necessitates these changes and amendments.
This bill addresses the changes in the international security environment, provides for the self-defence of our ASIS personnel overseas and enables cooperation with other Australian and foreign organisations. With the amendments in this bill, I agree that there is no need for change within Australia, as in the past when officers were armed we have experienced difficulties. That has been talked about quite a few times tonight, so I will not repeat that. Certainly in the international sphere and in the role that our officers play internationally that change is most necessary.
Equipping our personnel so that they may be able to defend themselves is an essential requirement in this day and age if we are to be serious about fighting the war against terrorism. We live in an internationally changed world that is fundamentally at risk from the continuing threat of global terrorism. We must be strident in our fight against this threat. We must ensure that the men and women we send out on our behalf to fight and to protect us are equipped and have the necessary training to carry out their duties safely. In the case of ASIS, it is essential that we allow those officers in the field of operations the ability to defend themselves properly. This is a responsible response to the changing nature of the threat environment that we live in.",REPS,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-30,"—It was on 1 October 2001 that the Intelligence Services Act was passed, establishing the constitutionality and accountability of some critical intelligence agencies in this country—in particular, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Defence Signals Directorate and ASIO, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. That legislation was important, because it established for the first time a proper foundation in law for the secret intelligence agencies which hitherto had been the subject of ministerial direction and exercise of prerogative powers, and ministerial and administrative powers. However, it had been thought—indeed presciently, I might add—that it was time to put these bodies on a proper footing. It is interesting that the September 11 tragedy occurred prior to the enactment of the Intelligence Services Act 2001, but it is also fair to say that it did not take into account the events of 2001 itself. That, of course, was a cataclysmic event, and I want to come to that in a moment.
I wish to draw the attention of the House to a couple of features of the original statute which the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 is amending, because they do establish an important foundation for the conduct of Australia's intelligence agencies. The functions of ASIS, the subject of the amendment before the House, are particularly relevant and are threefold. The first function is to obtain, in accordance with government requirements, intelligence about the capabilities, intentions or activities of people outside Australia; the second function is to conduct counterintelligence activities; and the third function is to liaise with intelligence or security services.
I suppose the word `intelligence' in this context gives rise to interesting observations about spooks and what they do. The fact that Peter Ustinov recently passed away even gives rise to some humorous observations about the clandestine activities of intelligence services and their agents. But it could never be suggested that those observations apply to ASIS—or not as far as we are aware in this country. What is important is that that intelligence gathering concerning the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia is at the heart of the role of ASIS. As a counter to that is its counterintelligence role. As I understand the nature of counterintelligence activities, they particularly involve the organisation infiltrating where it can the organisations of intelligence agencies from competing or rival countries and providing information to government in a way that could not ordinarily be done through straightforward intelligence activities.
The third function of ASIS is to liaise with overseas agencies. It seems to me to be important to point out the limits that currently exist on the activities of those agencies. The first limitation is that the activities must occur outside Australia. That is important, because ASIS has had a particular role in the context of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the relevant ministerial oversight body in respect of the activities of ASIS, subject of course to the provisions of the operation of the Inspector-General of Security and Intelligence.
The second interesting limitation relates to the privacy arrangements which are set out in section 15 of the statute. When the Intelligence Services Act was brought into effect in October 2001, the privacy arrangements were very much at the heart of the concern of many people in this place so far as the future operation of ASIS was concerned—and, indeed, that of DSD and ASIO. It is fair to say that the Australian community has always been a little suspicious of secretive or clandestine agencies such as ASIS—and, I respectfully suggest, properly so in a democracy such as ours. Therefore it was appropriate, when establishing ASIS on a proper footing, to have regard to those concerns in the community. The third limitation, which is critical for present purposes, was that ASIS must not plan for or undertake paramilitary activities or activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons, as provided for in section 6(4) of the statute—and those words speak for themselves.
That being the foundation of ASIS, which is the critical intelligence organisation, as we sit here tonight the question is: what has changed to make the relevant amendments necessary? The first critical change came with the cataclysmic events of September 11 and October 12 and, indeed, the recent events in Madrid, Spain. These events have made the work of such agencies dangerous and even more imperative and important than it was before. The limitation referred to in section 6(4) obviously gives rise to concern, because to limit in that way an agency which is gathering information to assist the Australian government in the protection of the Australian people would certainly hinder its operations. That indeed was the opinion of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. That committee comprised parliamentarians who were very experienced—particularly in this area. It was chaired by the Hon. David Jull and had as members the Hon. Kim Beazley, Mr Stewart McArthur MP and the Hon. Leo McLeay—all very experienced in their concern for and consideration of the national interest in relation to intelligence gathering and, in particular, the limitations that have been placed upon ASIS as a result of the changed international environment to which I have referred.
I do not wish to go into the detail of what happened on September 11 or in the Bali bombings. I have done that on another occasion. Members of this House would well know that from my area of Australia, the eastern suburbs of Sydney, more were killed in the Bali bombings than from any other area of that size in the country, and I attended many of the funerals of those who were killed. So I feel very strongly about the importance of ensuring that those people did not die in vain.
Let me come to the heart of the matter in relation to the amendments now before the House. The first amendment to which I wish to draw attention concerns the operation of section 6(4), which relates to the limitation on the carriage of weapons. The way in which the amendment operates is somewhat curious. Subsection 4 in schedule 1 of the amending bill provides that that section—which is the original section which I have read out—does not prevent the provision of weapons or training in the use of weapons or in self-defence techniques in accordance with schedule 2. So it does not seek to amend section 6(4) at all, but what it does then, in that portion of the statute which deals with so-called limits on the provision of weapons and training, is provide the following under the heading, `Schedule 2—Limits on provisions of weapons, training etc.: 
1 Provision of weapons, training etc.
(1) The provision of a weapon, or training in the use of a weapon ... is not prevented by subsection 6(4) if it is provided:
(a)	to a person who is a staff member or agent of ASIS; and
(b)	for the purpose of enabling the person:
(i)	to protect himself or herself; or
(ii)	to protect a staff member or agent of ASIS; or
(iii)	to protect a person who is co-operating with ASIS ... or to provide training.
Of themselves, those provisions appear to be rather limited in their scope and offer only limited additional protection to service officers. However, it is important to note that subsection (2) of the additional provisions provides as follows:
(2) The use of a weapon or self-defence techniques is not prevented by subsection 6(4) if:
	(a)	the weapon or techniques are used:
	(i)	for a purpose covered by      	paragraph (1)(b); or
	(ii)	in training ... 
(b)	in a case covered by any of subparagraphs (1)(b)(i) to (iii)—the weapon or techniques are used outside Australia; and
	(c)	guidelines have been issued by the Director-General ... and
	(d)	the weapon or techniques are used in compliance with those guidelines.
So what are the protections for the Australian public, having regard to the privacy and other civil liberties issues which I raised or adverted to earlier? The first is that the activities of carrying and using weapons must only occur outside Australia subject to this one limitation: where there is the training of staff members or agents of ASIS, that may occur within Australia without ministerial approval and without any guidelines issued by the director-general; so those limitations that otherwise apply have no operation. 
I suppose it is appropriate to permit the training of ASIS officers within Australia without ministerial approval or without restrictions upon the guidelines issued by the director-general. I would certainly support it, although on balance I would say this to those who administer ASIS in the future: the issue should be carefully monitored. We cannot allow an over-mighty subject anywhere to have complete freedom in relation to the use of firearms, especially as in this case there is no requirement to obtain a licence, permission or indeed registration for the training in the use of those weapons. But then we come to the actual use of weapons or self-defence techniques themselves. These can only occur outside Australia—not within Australia; outside Australia—and then subject to ministerial approval, subject to use in accordance with guidelines issued by the director-general and subject to complete compliance with those guidelines.
I have mentioned concerns that we should not put in place a clandestine organisation not normally subject to the law of this country—or indeed any other country—which has powers that are unusual or not consistent with normal democratic policing techniques. It seems to me that the protections that are being put in place by the proposed schedule 2—and in particular by items 1(1) and 1(2) in that proposed schedule—are satisfactory, both in the interests of the Australian people as a whole and in regard to our responsibilities to ensure that, when those operatives are working outside Australia gathering intelligence or are involved in counterintelligence or in liaising with foreign agencies, the limitations placed upon their use by this amending legislation are appropriate.
For those reasons, I therefore support the amendments. I commend the honourable member for Fadden's committee, which I know has worked very hard in coming up with these amendments, and I commend the members of that committee. But I would make this final comment: in establishing this important power for these agencies, those who are ultimately responsible for monitoring the use of those powers, the use of those weapons and indeed the use of the various self-defence and other techniques which they are now entitled to use—which they were not entitled to have or use before—should be carefully monitored. The guidelines themselves should be the subject of consideration by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security from time to time. In my respectful submission to the House, the minister too, through an appropriate mechanism, should ensure that both the inspector-general and the director-general are carrying out their activities in a way that is consistent with the general interests of the Australian people, their concern for privacy—as in section 15 of the original statute—and, at the same time, the civil liberties of all Australians and those who these laws are ultimately designed to protect. I support the bill.",REPS,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-03-30,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003. I have genuine concerns over this bill, and I am not as comfortable with certain aspects of the bill as the member for Wentworth, who did raise some concerns as well. The purpose of the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill, according to the second reading speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is:
... to allow the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) to undertake its functions more effectively, while maintaining appropriate legislative limitations on the functions of the agency.
The minister went on to say:
ASIS's functions under the act would not be changed by this bill.
At the time the act commenced operation, it was expressly stated that ASIS was not to conduct paramilitary activities, and in the planning and performance of its functions was not allowed to undertake activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons.
Since that time, however, the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001, and the Bali bombing on 12 October 2002, have contributed to a fundamental change in the environments in which ASIS must work. These changes could not have been predicted at the time the act was prepared. As a result, this amendment bill is now required to allow ASIS to provide more adequately for the protection of its staff ... and agents ...
This is rather twisted logic. According to the minister, two terrorist attacks equal fundamental environmental change. It seems to me that the minister is putting the cart before the horse. Surely 9-11 and Bali resulted from a changed environment rather than the reverse. After all, it is not as though they were the first large-scale terrorist actions.
However, there is no doubt that ASIS has an obligation to provide adequately for the protection of its staff, and the government's answer to that is to give the staff and agents guns—not, you understand, that those guns will be used for paramilitary activities or to offer violence against any person. As the minister has told us:
... the bill retains the restraint on ASIS undertaking in its own right activities involving the use of force, including use of weapons, other than for the limited purposes of protection. ASIS will continue to conduct its activities in a non-violent way.
That is reassuring, isn't it, Mr Deputy Speaker? But, if we are not getting involved in state-sanctioned murder just yet, just what is ASIS getting involved in? Let us go back to the foreign minister in his second reading speech, where he said:
Currently the act can prevent the agency—
ASIS, in other words—
from effectively cooperating with other authorities who might use force as a legitimate part of their functions. The amendment addresses this issue.
Let us just try and understand for a minute why that is. Subsection 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 says:
In performing its functions, ASIS must not plan for, or undertake, paramilitary activities or activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons.
The change now proposed by this bill inserts a new section 6(4) which says:
In performing its functions, ASIS must not plan for, or undertake, activities that involve:
(a) paramilitary activities; or
(b) violence against the person; or
(c) the use of weapons;
by staff members or agents of ASIS.
Do you see the subtle change there, Mr Deputy Speaker? Now it is apparently okay for ASIS to take part in paramilitary activities, activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons, as long as they do not do it themselves. There are distinct shades of George Orwell here. I am sure honourable members are familiar with Animal Farm, Orwell's parable about the Russian revolution. In that story, written towards the end of the Second World War, the animals of Manor Farm revolt against Farmer Jones, led by the pigs under Napoleon. The revolution is successful, and the animals draw up a list of principles which includes the precept that no animal shall sleep in a bed. Over time the pigs get greedy. Boxer the horse and Benjamin the donkey discover that the pigs are sleeping in beds in Farmer Jones's old house, and the precept that no animal shall sleep in a bed has the words `with sheets' added—no doubt by a `no sleeping in beds amendment bill'. There is more, but I am sure you get my drift here, Mr Deputy Speaker.
It is an awful lot like what the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill does. Under this bill, ASIS can involve itself in—when they are carried out by other agencies—paramilitary activities, violence against the person or the use of weapons, as long as its staff members and agents do not undertake those functions themselves. We do not know who those agents are, by the way. The enabling legislation is silent on that point. Nor do we know why this has become such a burning issue, except that terrorist attacks 18 and 30 months ago contributed to a fundamental change in the environments in which ASIS must work.
I smell a rat. There is something here that the foreign minister is not telling us—no doubt he will say that is because of security or operational reasons. But whatever it is, it did not happen 30 months ago or even 18 months ago. I believe it is something recent, otherwise the minister's concern to protect ASIS personnel in the conduct of their legitimate functions under the act would be just so much flummery. The minister offers no justification for his claim that the current act can prevent the agency from effectively cooperating with other authorities who might use force as a legitimate part of their functions. Nor does he tell us who those other authorities might be: perhaps they are the Australian Federal Police, state police, the Defence Force. Or maybe, just maybe, they are foreign authorities like the CIA, which has a long and shameful history of state sanctioned assassination. And maybe these operations are taking place in Iraq. It is just a thought, but one which would certainly fit with the government's extraterritorial adventurism.
I have no quarrel with allowing ASIS to provide more adequately for the protection of its staff members and even its agents. Those aspects of the bill I accept. What I cannot accept is any move towards actions such as state sanctioned assassination, and there are aspects of this bill which would suggest a move down that path. I therefore, in conscience, cannot support this bill as it currently stands.",REPS,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2004-03-30,"—I rise to speak on the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 tonight because I am mindful of how times have changed. I can remember when I was a little boy my father being away fighting for Australia in the Second World War. When I was in my teens issues arose with regard to intelligence and intelligence gathering and the sorts of things that used to occur in those days. One of the techniques that I am talking about was that members of the Australian Defence Force were dropped on to isolated islands around New Guinea and beyond to gather intelligence information for the Australian Defence Force and, indeed, for the allies during the Second World War.
I really do get disappointed when I hear the left-wing comments of people like the member for Cunningham who place a sinister emphasis on the changes that are being made to this act in the interest of protecting people going about their business, in the interest of protecting people such as him as an Australian in this great country of ours. I wonder why the political Greens party has gone along this mindless, politically correct direction and is willing to see the lives of good, highly trained Australians put at risk because of its ideology.
The Australian Secret Intelligence Service is an intelligence collection agency. Its primary function is to obtain and distribute intelligence information, not readily available by other means, on the capabilities, intentions and activities of individuals or organisations outside Australia, which may impact on Australian interests and the wellbeing of its citizens. The tasks of ASIS include reporting on major defence, international relations or national economic issues. ASIS can also work against threats from terrorism and weapons proliferation and against other threats to national security.
I would have thought that the two incidents that have shocked the world, which led to a change in this particular bill, would have been sufficient to send a message to people like the member for Cunningham that changes had to be made. I refer of course to the Bali bombings, which were perpetrated by members of terrorist organisations and which killed many fine, young Australians. I also refer to the September 11 aerial bombings of buildings in the United States, which killed thousands of people. One wonders whether people like the member for Cunningham are living in their own special little world, where they can ignore those sorts of incidents and how innocent men, women and children have died because of them. One wonders why they object to a very necessary change to legislation that is designed to, in the long term, protect Australia's best interest by allowing people who risk their life and liberty to go overseas and, in very difficult circumstances, obtain that sort of intelligence.
I am pleased that these amendments have been supported by the Australian Labor Party, because it is one of the very few bills that I have seen in the time that I have been a member of this institution that is going to contribute to the safety of Australia and its citizens that the Australian Labor Party have supported. I commend them for acting in a bipartisan way on a very serious issue.
Back in the late 1970s the royal commission into the intelligence services recommended placing ASIS on a statutory footing. Following the Samuels inquiry in 1995, the then government adopted the proposal that ASIS be placed under legislation. The present government committed to such legislation, and the Intelligence Services Act 2001 came into effect on 28 October 2001. It had, however, been drafted and introduced to parliament before the tragic events that I have just alluded to. It was passed into law when the changes that these and other factors would bring to the environment in which ASIS works could not be foreseen.
As stated in the act, ASIS is not a police or law enforcement agency and it does not plan for or undertake activities involving the use of force. The proposed amendment would not change this but would operate to ensure that the act no longer prevented a staff member or agent from using a weapon or self-defence technique for defensive purposes outside Australia when on ASIS business, providing that the legislative oversight and guidelines requirement of these legislative amendments were met.
Under the act, ASIS is responsible to the government through the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Director-General of ASIS is directly responsible to the minister. ASIS obtains intelligence in response to priorities determined by other government agencies. These priorities are set within the framework of critical interest determined by government. Key agencies involved in the setting of intelligence tasking for ASIS include the Office of National Assessments, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence and various agencies within the defence portfolio. ASIS tasking is kept under ongoing review, as it should be in the interest of protecting individuals within this great country of ours.
The government places a high value on intelligence capabilities and outputs and on ASIS being a strong, professional and vibrant organisation, well equipped to meet the intelligence challenges of the global environment and able to assist in securing the wellbeing of all Australians. ASIS has important obligations to protect those who work with it and to protect information which foreign governments share with it. ASIS relies on people who sometimes put their lives and liberty at considerable risk. ASIS therefore attaches the utmost importance to security and the protection of sources of information.
Those of us who have relatives in one of the organisations that have been mentioned by a number of members here tonight would appreciate that, at times, when there is no other alternative but to take action to protect yourself, people living in that very dangerous environment must be given the means to protect themselves and those working with them. I have a son and daughter-in-law who are AFP officers and I am conscious of the fact that, in this day and age, with the terrorist threat that we know is out there, we are no longer as safe. We do not live in an environment where we can go freely about doing the things that we take for granted in this great democratic society that we live in. But we are also aware that, when people, whether they are in the Australian Defence Force or the Australian Federal Police or any other law enforcement or defence agency, are placed in a position where they are undertaking work on behalf of their organisation and the country in general, they should be able, where appropriate, to take whatever action is needed to protect themselves and, in doing so, to protect the security of Australia and its people.
I have to say that I do get a little upset when I hear the sorts of comments that were made by the member for Cunningham. I get upset because I would have thought that a person of some considerable intelligence, which he obviously is, would think very seriously about running in the ideological direction that drives the party that he is a member of and that he would think on a broader scale—out of that narrow, tunnel-vision ideological view that he has—not only about Australia in general but also about its people and, more importantly, its future generations. We have to take all of those things into consideration when we make changes, which are sometimes very difficult for governments, in bills such as this one. We do not do it because we want to create some sort of controversial argument of a political nature out there in the community; we do it, with the assistance of Her Majesty's opposition, in an environment where we believe collectively that we are doing what is right for this great country of ours.
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that what is occurring with this particular bill is going to be beneficial to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and, more importantly, the men and women that work in it. They will ensure, I have absolutely no doubt, that they will do all that is physically and mentally possible within their highly trained capabilities to gather intelligence and information that we want to be forewarned about—that is, on any terrorist organisation or illegal activity that is being contemplated against Australia and its people—which reaches this great country and that our appropriate organisations will act upon it in a time frame that allows us to neutralise that problem before it occurs. I compliment the bill and I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on it. As I said, I believe it is a very important piece of legislation. Can I say once again that it is very pleasing from my point of view as a member of parliament to see the opposition joining with the coalition in supporting this bill and putting it through the House.",REPS,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2004-03-30,"—I rise to support the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003. It is a very important bill. It will improve Australia's capacity in this area into the future. At the start of my remarks I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the member for Hume with respect to the position of the Greens and the member for Cunningham. I agree with them wholeheartedly. I also agree with his remarks with respect to the opposition and, in that light, I commend people such as the member for Fadden who have worked long and hard, through the committee system, through the detail of this important bill for the benefit of Australia.
As previous speakers have said, this bill is all the more relevant to the security needs of our nation following the tragic events of September 11, the horrific Bali bombing and, of course, in the forefront of our minds, the recent events in Madrid. These events highlight the critical role that our security agencies, such as ASIS and our other defence agencies, play. They also highlight the consequential need for us as a parliament to ensure that they have all the powers and resources necessary to carry out their very important functions for our country.
Australians are only too aware that international security issues have come to the fore, as I have just said. In that context the contents of this bill have been developed in response to the difficult environment in which our security agencies, such as ASIS, operate. As Australia's overseas intelligence collection agency, ASIS has for many years served our interests around the globe. As previous speakers in the debate have outlined, its primary function is to obtain and distribute intelligence information not readily available by other means about the capabilities, intentions and activities of individuals and organisations outside our country which may impact on Australia's interests and, of course, the wellbeing of our citizens. The tasks of ASIS include reporting on defence, international relations and the like. The service can also work against threats of terrorism, weapons proliferation and other threats to our national security.
The rise of international terrorism and other more recent developments means that amendments are needed to ensure that ASIS is not held back in its quest to fulfil its functions and responsibilities for Australia. The changes being debated in this bill this evening will not change the primary functions of ASIS but will rather clarify and—more importantly—expand the existing law relating to the use of weapons and self-defence techniques by ASIS staff. The proposed amendments will mean an ASIS staff member or agent is no longer prohibited from using a weapon or self-defence technique for defensive purposes outside Australia when on ASIS business. In fulfilling their role it is fair to expect that ASIS staff on occasions may find themselves in dangerous situations—situations where they need to be able to defend themselves and those around them. These threats will of course only have increased in recent years as a consequence of the war on terror.
It is important to note that ASIS is not a police force or an agency that plans for or undertakes activities involving the use of force. These amendments, subject to some very strict safeguards, which have been outlined, simply allow for a greater degree of personal protection. Currently, ASIS is prevented from effectively co-operating with other international agencies that might use force as part of their normal functioning. This amendment will allow ASIS to be involved in the planning of activities undertaken by other organisations, provided that ASIS staff members do not themselves undertake such activities. The bill also will allow for the protection of ASIS staff as they perform their duties—that is, another agency can provide the level of personal protection required by ASIS staff.
Once passed, the bill will allow the use of weapons or self-defence techniques only for personal protection on missions outside Australia. The only permitted use inside Australia will be for training purposes. As with other activities covered under the Intelligence Services Act there are very strict guidelines and requirements on ASIS staff, including the director-general.
I am glad, as the member for Hume and most of the other speakers on this side of the House are, that these measures are supported by both sides of the House. As a parliament we should be able to respond quickly when the needs of our Defence Force, police, law enforcement and intelligence agencies require a fast response. ASIS is a key contributor to the efforts needed to protect Australia's national interest and to combat those engaged in terrorism. These amendments are vital, as are other legislative initiatives and policies undertaken by the Howard government. Given that the opposition are supporting these sensible amendments to the act, I also hope they will be able to take a constructive approach and support the government's other defence policy and security initiatives. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech

"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2004-03-30,"—I move:
That the amendments be disagreed to and that the amendments set out in the schedule circulated to honourable members be made in place of them.
The purpose of the government amendments to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 is to remove from the bill the provisions which would have allowed contractors to be included in the range of persons who may be appointed as qualified officers under the Quarantine Act 1908 and to insert new provisions in the bill which extend the range of persons who may be appointed as quarantine officers to members of the Australian Federal Police, members of the state and territory police, Protective Service officers or employees of a body corporate established or continued in existence for a public purpose by or under a Commonwealth law.
Currently the act restricts the pool of persons who may be called upon to assist in the protection of Australia's borders in non-emergency situations to employees under the Public Service Act 1999 and state or territory government employees. This limitation in the act means that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service does not have the flexibility it requires to respond as quickly and efficiently as it would like in order to meet demands for increased levels of intervention to protect Australia's vast quarantine borders. The government has proposed to overcome this limitation by including contractors in the range of persons who could be appointed as quarantine officers. The Senate has rejected this approach, with opposition and Democrat senators claiming that this was some kind of attempt to privatise AQIS by stealth. I reject that assertion absolutely.
However, to avoid further delay in the resolution of this very important issue which directly impacts on the capacity of AQIS to deliver quarantine services, especially in remote areas and at times of unusually high demand for staff resources, the government has decided to propose an alternative approach which seeks to broaden the pool of persons who may be appointed, while remaining within the framework of organisations established under legislation for a public purpose. These amendments demonstrate the government's commitment to ensuring that AQIS has the capacity necessary to protect Australia's long and often remote borders.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2004-03-30,"—I, like many members in New South Wales, awoke this morning to find out that the New South Wales government was recalling the New South Wales parliament next week to have a mini-budget. `Mini-budget' means mismanagement. As a member from the Hunter, it concerned me when I read the Newcastle Herald this morning and saw the headline: `$35m service cuts to Hunter'. The article said:
The people of the Hunter will face state tax increases in the new financial year, as well as the possibility of losing $35 million worth of services.
It went on to say:
Mr Carr and Mr Egan said they did not have specific details of which projects would go “on hold'' and which assets would be sold, but Mr Costa said critical services in the Hunter would suffer.
It continued:
For every dollar spent per capita on capital works in the Hunter, three dollars was spent in Sydney and that is even after 32 per cent of the state's exports come from the Hunter Valley ...
I find this absolutely outrageous, when you consider that the New South Wales state Labor government have had an enormous windfall from stamp duty. In fact, they have had $8.4 billion in unexpected revenues in the last nine years. In 2004-05 they will receive from the Commonwealth a total of $15.9163 billion, which is a total increase of $188 million on the year before. In fact, the amount they will receive in total is nearly double the $8.348 billion they received in 1995-96. As I said, `mini-budget' equals mismanagement.
The Telegraph today highlighted the fact that there has been some $3.3 billion of wastage by the New South Wales Labor government. That includes the political advertising costs of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which were $875,000. Energy Australia's loss on PowerTel was $96 million. The aborted Austeel project cost $21 million. The health write-off for the Allandale Aged Care Facility in the Hunter was $30.5 million. The millennium train stages 1 and 2 blow-out was $114 million. The Hunter and outer suburban train carriages blow-out was $78 million. The Pacific Highway upgrade blow-out was $876 million. The New South Wales government also spent $99 million in 2002-03 on consultants' bills for their mates. The amount spent on displaced public servants was $17.4 million. The one I love most of all is the fact that the department of education failed to budget for a leap year, which led to a blow-out of $8.6 million. State debt recovery office mismanagement cost $32 million. Those in the state government super fund would love the fact that their state Labor government have delivered them a Treasury managed fund negative investment return of $305 million. The list goes on and on. The Labor government in New South Wales have mismanaged $3.3 billion of taxpayers' money.
They talk about the Commonwealth Grants Commission. That is an independent body that distributes to the states the GST revenue—which will be $34 billion in the next financial year. The New South Wales government will receive a minimum of $9.6 billion of that GST revenue. Compare that to Victoria, which receives $7 billion, and Queensland, which receives $6.6 billion. The New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, loved this distribution of funds not so long ago. He wrote in his diary on 19 April 1999:
To my intense relief, (Howard) says he won't—cannot—overturn a recommendation of the Grants Commission unless the States are unanimous. Strong. Fair. I won't hear ill of this man. This gives me a victory to talk about to Sydney media and I praise the Prime Minister. I've learned that the more unaligned electorate loves this kind of non-partisanship.
So when Bob Carr thinks he is getting a good deal, everything is fine and rosy, but when he thinks he is not he complains. New South Wales has the highest tax per person in the entire Australian state system. We pay more tax per person in New South Wales than happens anywhere else. Bob Carr and Michael Egan have more money now than ever before, yet they have run short. We have not seen massive increases in teachers' wages, nurses' wages or police wages. In fact, we have seen effective cutbacks. I call on the Carr Labor government to manage their money properly or get out of the chair and let a New South Wales Liberal-National Party government manage it effectively.

(3)	Is he able to say whether any honey imported from Argentina entered Australia during 2003; if not, why not.
(4)	Will imported honey for sale in Australia be tested in light of international concerns about honey from Argentina and the fact that certain brands of honey available to Australian consumers are labelled as a blend of Australian and Argentine honey; if not, why not.
(5)	Has the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) been directed by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) to begin testing of imported honey shipments for nitrofuran residues; if not, why not.
(6)	Have AQIS's testing capabilities been upgraded to enable it to detect low levels of nitrofuran residues that might be present in imported honey; if not why not.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Honey</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,26,1,question
"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2004-03-30,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1)	Yes. Argentina has applied some restrictions to the export of honey.  These restrictions include requirements for certification and testing prior to export rather than stopping the export of honey.
(2)	Yes. I have been advised that the UK authorities have detected nitrofuran residues in a shipment of honey from Argentina.
(3)	Yes. During 2003, shipments of honey from Argentina have been imported into Australia.
(4)	Yes. All imported honey is tested for residues of the antimicrobial chloramphenicol and pesticide residues.  AQIS is liaising with Australian laboratories to expand the testing of honey to include additional antimicrobials including nitrofuran. 
(5)	Yes. AQIS has been advised by FSANZ to test imported honey for residues of nitrofuran. These tests will be implemented as soon as analysts appointed under the Imported Food Control Act 1992 have developed the analytical capability. 
(6)	Yes. AQIS will be appointing an Australian laboratory under the Imported Food Control Act 1992, to undertake analysis for low-level residues of nitrofuran.  It is anticipated that testing will commence by the end of April 2004.  ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Honey</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,26,1,answer
