"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-09-08,"—The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002 amends the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to partially implement recommendations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its August 2000 report Pregnant and productive. It is a right, not a privilege, to work while pregnant. In case we need it, this bill is further evidence of the government's abysmal track record on work and family issues. It is long overdue and it goes only part of the way to addressing the matters raised in the report to which I have referred. 
The bill shows just how limited and belated the government's work and family approach is. Over three years ago, in March 2000, the member for Jagajaga introduced into the House of Representatives a private member's bill with the same title as this bill. That private member's bill amended the Sex Discrimination Act and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act to make sure that pregnant, potentially pregnant and breastfeeding women are not discriminated against in the workplace. The bill was in response to a clear need for legislative change highlighted in the Pregnant and productive report. That report was presented to the Attorney-General in June 1999—over four years ago. The bill before us today implements only some of its recommendations. It has taken three years for the government to introduce a legislative response to that report. 
Not only is this bill abysmally overdue; it is also totally inadequate. It implements only three out of the 12 recommendations of the report calling for amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act. Nondiscrimination in the workplace is in fact like being pregnant: there is no halfway. You cannot be a little bit pregnant and you cannot have only a bit of nondiscrimination. A workplace is either free of discrimination or it is not. There is no point in the government settling in this instance on half-measures. This bill shows that the government is willing to do exactly that: settle for half-measures by implementing, three years late, only three recommendations from the Pregnant and productive report for amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act. 
When the report was publicly released, Ms Susan Halliday said that the report had uncovered horror stories such as women miscarrying because they were not allowed to sit down at work, men being sacked for attending the births of their babies and women being harassed about their appearance and removed from the front desk where they were visible to the public. In one case documented by the commissioner, a woman working in a car factory was denied a chair despite bleeding and severe pain. She collapsed at work when seven months pregnant and her baby was born prematurely with an underdeveloped heart. Ms Halliday said: 
Something has to be done. It is fair to say that there are lives at stake here.
In the face of such truly shocking stories, it is appalling that it has taken the government so long to implement any of the commission's recommendations. It is willing to settle for half-measures—in fact, only quarter-measures—considering three of the 12 recommendations for more than four years; that is, the time of five pregnancies. How many pregnant women or new mothers have had to combat a form of discrimination because of the government's inaction?
While discrimination and harassment on the grounds of pregnancy and potential pregnancy are grounds for complaint under the Sex Discrimination Act, the Pregnant and productive report found that workplace discrimination and harassment on those grounds remain real issues for many women and that clarification of this act is needed in a number of areas. The commission reported that some employees conceal their pregnancy for as long as possible because they fear pregnancy discrimination and that some senior professional women took accrued annual leave, long service leave and the like so that they would not have to reveal and have recorded on their employment records the fact that they had taken maternity leave.
Amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act were overdue four years ago and now the government has introduced a bill of half-measures or even quarter-measures. The bill in its current form just does not go far enough. The bill only covers three areas of the act identified in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report that relate to, firstly, whether discrimination against breastfeeding women is a ground for sex discrimination; secondly, the asking of questions about pregnancy or potential pregnancy during job interviews; and, thirdly, the use of information obtained in medical examinations. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission recommended that the act be amended to make the law in these areas clearer for the benefit of employers and employees. In particular, the report found:
Erroneous tactics and exploitive practices are to this day being utilised to remove pregnant women from the workplace or deny pregnant and potentially pregnant women equal employment opportunity.
The bill we are debating redrafts the part of the act that prohibits requests for information that are connected to acts of unlawful discrimination and provides clarification by adding an example of a prohibited question. The bill also adds an explanatory note to make it clear that the exception that allows requests for pregnancy related medical information to be made does not override those provisions of the act which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex or pregnancy. The operation of the act is expanded by the amendments. They eliminate confusion identified in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report about the meaning and operation of the acts regarding pregnancy and pregnancy related issues.
Unfortunately, the bill does not address a number of other legislative changes recommended by the HREOC report. These changes are significant, and worthy of noting specifically. They include: empowering HREOC to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy, allowing referrals by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to the Industrial Relations Commission of discriminatory awards or agreements without the need for receipt of a written complaint, enabling the awarding of punitive damages as well as compensatory damages, removing the exemption for educational institutions established for religious purposes in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy, ensuring coverage of unpaid workers and removing the exemption of employment by an instrumentality of a state.  
The amendments we propose in contrast address 10 of the Pregnant and productive report's 46 recommendations. Our proposals will enhance the right of pregnant and potentially pregnant women by: (1) empowering the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy; (2) ensuring unpaid workers are covered by the Sex Discrimination Act; (3) removing the exemption for employment by an instrumentality of a state from the Sex Discrimination Act; (4) removing the exemption for educational institutions established for religious purposes in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy; (5) allowing exemplary damages to be awarded; (6) specifically including breastfeeding as a ground for unlawful discrimination; (7) allowing the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory awards or agreements to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission without the requirement to have received a written complaint; (8) clarifying that a complaint about a discriminatory advertisement may be made by any person; (9) clarifying that the asking of questions to elicit information about whether and when a woman intends to become pregnant and/or her intentions in relation to meeting her current or pending family responsibilities is unlawful; and (10) clarifying that it is unlawful to discriminate in medical examinations of pregnant women during the recruitment process. The amendments also extend the antidiscrimination provisions to employees who are in the process of adopting a child. 
Improving the protections for pregnant women is important, but it is just the tip of the iceberg. A lot more in terms of policy change is needed and called for. Improving the protections is a matter that requires action by this government—not a half report, as provided here. This was recently acknowledged by the Minister for Family and Community Services, who is reported as saying on radio 2UE on 4 August: `I don't know that Australia has really moved ahead in the family friendly workplace in the way that some other countries have.' 
Australia does indeed need a sea change in policies and attitudes that are hindering the capacity of women to take on and survive the complex responsibilities of work on the one hand, and family commitments on the other. It is time women—particularly women who are thinking about starting a family and women who have young families—are supported by policies that will make a difference to their lives and assist them to balance those competing responsibilities. I am not referring to how women who are corporate high-fliers with nannies, housekeepers and the like cope with the challenges they confront, but to the millions of Australian mothers whose jobs are the safety net for their family's economic survival. They literally work to pay bills. They work to support their family.
With the dramatic increases in real estate prices and in credit card debt, it is becoming more the norm for families to require two incomes to survive, and certainly to survive in the capital cities in Australia, where most families reside. But the Howard government refuses to recognise that most families just cannot afford to have one parent at home full time for five years and that most women who leave work to have a baby return to work at some stage after the birth. The proof is in the statistics themselves. Well over 60 per cent of Australian women spend their baby's first year out of the paid work force, but more than half of new mothers in two-parent families are back at work before their baby is just two years old. By the time their child has turned three, nearly 70 per cent of mothers these days are back in the work force, usually, as I indicated, as a result of the economic pressures.  
Mothers understand the importance of staying attached to the work force during these early child-rearing years. Their preference is for part-time work. Among parents of dependent children in June 2000, 57 per cent of employed partnered mothers and five per cent of employed partnered fathers worked part time. What the statistics do not show are the difficulties, the pressures and the anxieties experienced by parents as they negotiate the demands of their double lives. Research is increasingly showing the anxieties and pressures and the effect of those pressures on children in circumstances where their parents are trying to balance the challenges of both work and family responsibilities. 
Now, it seems, many young women think it is all too hard and are deciding not to have children. The evidence is indisputable. Australian women are having fewer babies. The birth rate fell dramatically, from 3.5 babies per woman in the early 1960s to just 1.7 in 2001. This is the lowest rate on record. It is down from 1.75 children on average in the year 2000, and much worse than the previous lows of 1.86 and 1.94 recorded in 1991 and 1981, when these figures were last taken. We are in very real danger of becoming a baby-free society, a place where children are a private responsibility that must never impinge on a parent's working life. If that culture becomes our culture, we will see the birth rate declining even more rapidly than it currently is. The Prime Minister's policies are creating this baby-free society.
The Prime Minister's ideological preference is a world where men are breadwinners, women are full-time homemakers and children are at home with their mothers until they start school. The government's tax and welfare policies clearly favour single-income families. For example, the government's family tax benefit B is only available to single-income families. The election conceived baby bonus offends all notions of equity. It provides the greatest financial help to those who need it least and it is quickly eroded if the stay-at-home parent earns any part-time money. The everyday reality is that it just does not work according to the Prime Minister's view of life. 
The Howard government's policies reflect a very narrow, conservative ideology—not the reality of most families, where both parents work because of the financial pressures that they face these days. That is why Labor is pushing for a sea change in policy and attitude and why it is committed to catching up with the rest of the world and introducing a system of paid maternity leave. Australia is one of just two developed countries that do not yet have a paid maternity leave scheme. Shame on this government! Countries we are lagging behind include Japan, Canada, Austria, Italy, the United Kingdom, Norway, the Slovak Republic and New Zealand—countries which have suitable, family friendly policies and a higher birthrate where assistance is provided to families to have children. Clearly members of the government prefer a system in Australia where only middle-class professionals who work for large organisations have access to paid maternity leave and women in low-income jobs and small businesses simply do not.
If the length of time that the government has taken to introduce and debate this bill is an indication, it will be many, many long years before we get even some response to Pru Goward's report recommending a national, government funded scheme for paid maternity leave. If you are serious, do something about it. The aim of paid maternity leave is to make a contribution towards the income a woman forgoes while she leaves work to have a baby and during the subsequent period of leave needed for the health and welfare of both the mother and the newborn baby. But paid maternity leave is not the beginning and end of work and family issues. We understand and fully appreciate that. 
Paid maternity leave is a fundamental part of the work and family balance but, in itself, is not sufficient to help families meet the challenges and joys that a new child brings. Families confronting that life-changing event need one thing above all else: more options to suit their particular circumstances—more options for striking the balance between work, family and other activities, such as study, that best suit their needs and those of their children. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for families, because no two families are alike. No two families need the same solution. Parents need a range of possible options so they can develop a solution that best suits their needs. Parents want the flexibility to choose different solutions at different stages of their lives. Some parents may want to stay at home with their children; others will return to full-time work as soon as possible, while others may want to work in a part-time capacity.
We need to support and encourage this diversity between families by giving parents a range of viable—and I underscore `viable'—alternatives, at least for the first five years of a child's life when, clearly, children are heavily dependent on the support and nurturing of their parents. Parents need to be able to construct their own long-term parenting plan from a number of options, and discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace must become a thing of the past. That is what we believe a genuine family friendly environment looks like. I urge the government to accept the opposition amendments to this bill to help realise that environment. I move the following second reading amendment:
	At the end of the motion, add: 
		“but the Senate calls on the Government to support all the legislative amendments and other actions necessary to give effect to the recommendations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its report Pregnant and Productive: It's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant”.
 (Senator Ferguson)—I now call Senator Stott Despoja. I should say congratulations are in order, too, Senator.",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-09-08,"—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President—that is much appreciated. I rise today to speak on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002. Like the previous speaker, Senator Ludwig, I support the bill before us. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, we will be voting for the legislation, but we also believe that this bill does not go nearly far enough towards addressing the pressing and the major issues that women continue to face in the workplace.
As has been referred to, in 1999 the then Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Susan Halliday, made 12 recommendations regarding the Sex Discrimination Act in a HREOC report entitled Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant. This bill, however, is a totally inadequate response to the report and, coming a number of years later, it has only taken up three of the 46 recommendations. While these three recommendations are welcome, they really only clarify existing provisions within the act. These recommendations aim to prohibit discrimination against women who are breastfeeding, prohibit potential employers from asking employees questions regarding pregnancy or potential pregnancy and attempt to ensure that medical information collected from pregnant women is only used for appropriate processes and purposes, such as for occupational health and safety reasons. 
The first item in the bill states that breastfeeding and expressing milk pertains `generally to women'. These recommendations make it clear that discrimination against breastfeeding women is a form of sex discrimination, so I am glad to see that item has been included in this bill. The second item inserts a new subsection 27(1) into the act, which defines the rules surrounding questions that can be asked of potential employees regarding pregnancy or potential pregnancy and attempts to make these rules more transparent. Fundamentally, this subsection states that questions regarding pregnancy and potential pregnancy should not be asked unless the question would be asked of everyone—for example, people of both sexes or people of different marital status. This item makes it illegal to take information regarding pregnancy or potential pregnancy into account when deciding on the best candidate for the job.
Item 3 inserts a note to subsection 27(2) clarifying that as long as information about a person's medical condition or pregnancy is used in a legitimate way—for example, for occupational health and safety reasons—it is not discriminatory to ask questions relating to pregnancy or potential pregnancy. Obviously this allows employers to ask questions which distinguish between the sexes for the purpose of enforcing precautionary measures—not for deciding whether or not to employ someone.
While the Democrats generally support the initiatives contained in this bill, we believe the government's failure to act on the remaining recommendations reflects a lack of genuine support by this government for the needs of working women. It is a very limited, narrow and inadequate response to what was a significant and quite groundbreaking report. The proposed changes are indeed superficial and ignore the more important changes that must be made and still need to be made to the Sex Discrimination Act with regard to pregnancy and work.
As Senator Ludwig has pointed out, Australian society is changing very rapidly. Today only one-third of families are in male breadwinner households with a full-time female caregiver. That is half as many as 20 years ago. In 1966, 36 per cent of women were in the labour market compared to 55 per cent of women this year. More and more of us are living alone. At the same time the proportion of single parents has risen sharply. Both members of a couple now work in more than half of all couple households. That is a significant increase. Some 42 per cent of Australian women work part time compared to the OECD average of 24 per cent—and we should remember that almost two-thirds of all part-time work in Australia is casual.
The average weekly hours worked by full-time employees has increased from 39.9 hours per week in 1982 to 42.3 hours in 2001. So this puts Australia at the long hours end, if you like, of the international spectrum of working hours, and our working hours, as we all know, are continuing to grow—they are longer and longer. Almost two-thirds of overtime work is unpaid. In Australia one in six children are being raised in households where no-one has a full-time job. That statistic is amongst the highest in the OECD. So as a result of these changes and I guess the failure of our institutions to adapt to them, Australians, particularly those with caring responsibilities—most of whom are women—are suffering.
As Senator Ludwig mentioned, while the birth rate was 3.5 in 1961 and 2.9 in the 1970s, it is only 1.75 now. HREOC reports that Australian women are increasingly opting out of motherhood or limiting their number of children due to discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and indeed in the absence of paid maternity leave. 
Out of the 46 recommendations made by HREOC in Pregnant and productive, only three have been included in this bill. In some ways they are Clayton's changes in that they do not change the act; they only clarify sections of it. Where is the amendment to empower the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy as stated in recommendation 1? Where is the amendment to extend the coverage of the act to federal statutory employees, judicial officeholders and indeed members of parliament? Where is the amendment to ensure coverage of unpaid workers? Where is the amendment to remove the exemption of employment by an instrumentality of a state? Where is the amendment to remove the exemption contained in section 38 for educational institutions that are established for religious purposes? Where is the amendment to allow the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer awards to the AIRC? Where is the amendment allowing a complaint to be made about a discriminatory advertisement? Where is the amendment that prohibits discrimination against employees who intend to adopt, or are in the process of adopting, a child? 
Why is it that these recommendations were not taken on board by the government? In order to correct these omissions and to ensure that meaningful change is introduced today the Democrats will move amendments to this bill which will address those additional HREOC recommendations relating to the Sex Discrimination Act. The ALP will also move similar amendments, as Senator Ludwig mentioned. These amendments are long overdue. Every day we know that women experience discrimination in the workplace, and we must do everything in our power to ensure that that does not happen.
A recent newspaper article—I believe it was in the Daily Telegraph—cited case studies which revealed the extent of this discrimination. I will list a couple of examples. A clerk claimed she was told by her supervisor to have an abortion after finding out she was pregnant soon after joining a real estate firm. She insisted she did not know she was pregnant when she took the job. She refused to have an abortion and was sacked. After conciliation, she was reinstated and paid $4,000 in damages. A casual worker with a government department was told she could not breastfeed or express milk at work, or take her baby to the office. After conciliation, the department changed its policy and paid her $1,200. An import and wholesale company refused to provide a full-time administrative assistant with light duties, insisting she carry on with heavy duties such as lifting and carrying, despite her doctor's orders. She received $9,000 after conciliation.
These case studies—and there are many more—highlight that there are horror stories out there still. They echo the stories revealed by Susan Halliday in Pregnant and productive. These situations continue to occur years after her initial report. Things have not improved significantly, with discrimination against women, on the grounds of their sex and pregnancy, continuing unabated. This is an appropriate time for us to pay tribute to the work of Susan Halliday, the then Sex Discrimination Commissioner, whose work in this area was groundbreaking. Her work on paid maternity leave was incredibly significant and is not always acknowledged. She, like many people in this chamber and the community, has been campaigning for change in these areas for many years.
It feels a long time since I on behalf of the Democrats began campaigning for the right of women to be able to breastfeed in public and in the workplace without being discriminated against. In May we changed the standing orders of this place to allow breastfeeding in the chamber should it be required. This change brought the standing orders into line with many workplaces around Australia, including two state parliaments. While the Victorian parliament changed its rules to allow breastfeeding in parliament at the Speaker's discretion, the ACT Legislative Assembly changed its standing orders to allow breastfeeding in the chamber without permission from the Speaker, becoming the first state or territory to do so. 
I moved an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 to exclude lactation aids from the goods and services tax. As many people would know, lactation aids play a very important role in facilitating some women's choice to breastfeed their babies. Baby formula is GST-free, as it is classed as a food. In order to facilitate choices for women, the Democrats felt that the tax treatment of the provision of breast milk should be equalised. We continue to endorse calls by the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia and many other representative bodies for the right to breastfeed to be protected in legislation.
I strongly endorsed the recommendations in HREOC's report when it was released almost four years ago and have been calling for the Attorney-General to amend the Sex Discrimination Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of breastfeeding since long before then. It is disappointing that women continue to face discrimination and harassment for the simple, natural act of breastfeeding their baby. Surely this is an activity we should be promoting, not restricting.
Until there is employment protection for breastfeeding, working women will continue to face the choice between work and family. Enshrining the right to breastfeed is one change that would assist thousands of women. Therefore, I will be moving amendments to improve workplace conditions for breastfeeding mothers. The Democrats will be asking for breastfeeding breaks or breaks to express milk and adequate places for mothers to breastfeed and express milk, and will also be encouraging workplaces to provide the necessary storage facilities for milk.
Subsequently, if the government really wanted to end discrimination against working women, it would—as Senator Ludwig has also suggested—introduce a national scheme of paid maternity leave for Australia's working women. At the committee stage I will be introducing an amendment that would do just that: provide a national scheme of paid maternity leave. The amendment would incorporate such a scheme into this bill.
Australian working women deserve some form of support that enables them to take paid time off around the birth or adoption of a new baby. We also support a complementary benefit for women who are looking for work, are self-employed or, indeed, are at home. The Democrats were the only political party to take such a policy of paid maternity leave to the last election. Since that time, after much consultation—and it has been significant—with business groups, women's groups, unions, community organisations and others we have progressed our policy proposals further.
We have asked the government on many occasions to restructure its expensive, poorly structured and regressive baby bonus. The Democrats tried to amend the baby bonus in the Senate. We did not succeed. We have suggested that the baby bonus be abolished and replaced by more equitable, less expensive paid maternity leave. However, the government has offered nothing for working women in its subsequent budgets in 2002 and 2003 beyond the so-called baby bonus. As most people know, and as recent research bears out, the baby bonus fails, in effect, as women increase their paid working time. This will deliver very little to many working women. 
In response to this policy vacuum, on 16 May last year I introduced a private senator's bill to establish paid maternity leave. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Paid Maternity Leave) Bill 2002 offers all non-government employees with more than a year's service 14 weeks paid maternity leave at the rate of the minimum wage, $431.40 at present, or if they are normally paid less—say, they work part time—at their usual lower rate. The payment would be provided by government. That proposal is supported by a number of groups in the community, as we heard through the Senate committee process.
Employers and employees could be involved in negotiations to top up that payment to average weekly earnings, say, or to provide additional facilities or additional leave time. State, federal and territory governments already offer paid leave in many cases. Their exclusion from the basic maternity payment would encourage them to make equivalent or hopefully better payments to their employees.
This scheme—which we have put on record and tabled in the chamber and which has been through a Senate committee process by which a number of important and impressive additions or improvements have been made to the bill—means that all contribute. Employees and employers contribute through their taxes, employers contribute through top-up payments if they choose, employees contribute through forgone earnings where their payment is less than their usual earnings and they take additional unpaid leave, and governments contribute through their funding of leave for their direct employees and through taxes for the basic maternity payment.
The model proposed in this bill, which has pretty much been emulated by the current Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Pru Goward—who has done a lot of work on the issue of paid maternity leave and whose report A time to value is worth reading—is costed at a minimum of $213 million, less than half the cost of the government's baby bonus. The Democrat model has received backing from a number of groups—major business and industry groups such as the Australian Hotels Association and the Australian Industry Group, as well as a number of women's and community organisations.
It is well past time to act on this issue, as Senator Ludwig said. We are one of two OECD nations that do not provide women with this basic working entitlement—the other country that does not do so being the US, of course. I remember Naomi Wolf, when she was here at the beginning of this year, saying that she sometimes wonders whether her home country, the US, exists just to make everyone else look good. Australia is one of only two OECD countries, along with the US, that fails to provide this payment, which would make such a difference to the lives of many Australian women.
I hope that today we will take the opportunity to give Australian women the kind of benefit most women in the OECD enjoy—with, of course, the exception of the US. If this government is serious about its rhetoric on balancing work and family life, I urge it to support the amendments before it today—not just the Democrat amendments but also the ALP amendments. We have worked out an arrangement whereby most of the recommendations contained in the original HREOC report will be implemented if those amendments are supported by a majority in the chamber today. They are impressive amendments—they are appropriate recommendations in that report—and they will make a huge difference to the lives of Australian working women. 
The amendments attempt to balance a number of significant and glaring omissions with recommendations from that groundbreaking report Pregnant and productive. We know that there is much more that can be done—of course there is—to prevent discrimination against women and ensure that the right of women to work while pregnant is fully protected by legislation. The amendments before us today to be moved by the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats are a good start, and I urge the chamber to support them.",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I rise to speak on what I see as the hopelessly deficient Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002. This bill highlights the low regard and priority the Howard government has for, and gives to, stamping out discrimination against women on the basis of pregnancy, potential pregnancy and breastfeeding in the workplace and throughout the wider Australian community. It is a poor and pathetic bill which has made its way to the Senate today and is one which is symptomatic of this government's lax attitude towards working women and working families more broadly in this country.
Like many others, this bill demonstrates that the Howard government is only interested in the most cosmetic of reforms when it comes to addressing the real issues affecting 21st century workers and their families. This is a most unsatisfactory situation. It is bills such as this which offer governments the opportunity to facilitate significant, genuine change in attitude and practice within the community and the labour force on issues of discrimination. It is unfortunate, yet comes as no surprise, that the bill before us today, exhibiting this government's commitment to stamping out workplace discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy and breastfeeding, is no more than hopeless and inadequate policy. The bill before us is yet another indication that this government is simply not willing to address the issues of juggling work and family in this country. The bill represents a sad indictment of a government which professes to have a strong record on family policy.
The few measures contained within this bill are inspired by a HREOC report commissioned by the Attorney-General and developed, researched and written by the then Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Susan Halliday. The report, titled Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant, was presented to the Attorney-General in June 1999. It is only now, in September 2003, that the Senate is offered the chance to debate the government's legislative response to this report. This extremely slow response to the Pregnant and productive report speaks volumes for the level of importance, or lack thereof, which this government places on the issues, the report's findings and its recommendations.
In order for us to understand the very important issues we are dealing with here, and indeed the rationale behind the report's recommendations, I would like to read a couple of passages from the Pregnant and productive report itself. The report stated:
... erroneous tactics and exploitative practices are, to this day, being utilised to remove pregnant women from the workforce or deny pregnant and potentially pregnant women equal employment opportunity. 
Moreover, the 1999 report added that on the 15th anniversary of the Sex Discrimination Actthe fact cannot be ignored that:
... workplace discrimination and harassment on the ground of pregnancy and potential pregnancy remains a real issue for many women in our society. Regardless of status, industry, discipline or level of education, or for that matter age, race or religion, for many women pregnancy results in inequitable workplace treatment as well as long and short term financial impact and career disadvantage.
The findings of the report are stark and require serious attention. Labor recognises that. The fact that it took the government three years to introduce into parliament a legislative response to the report, and that it has taken over four years for that response to have reached this point in the Senate, is really quite appalling. To suggest that this government acts with any sort of vigour, speed or commitment on issues of family and work is simply a joke. The government's abysmally slow response to the report and its 46 recommendations is a clear and certain testament to that.
When we couple this with the fact that the government is proposing, via this bill, to implement only three of the report's 12 recommendations requiring reform of the Sex Discrimination Act, we see how limited and belated the government's approach to issues of family and work really is. Labor believes that the workplace is either free from discrimination or it is not; there is no halfway and as such there is no point in settling for half-measures. I have just outlined a couple of the report's findings which clearly recognise that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, potential pregnancy and breastfeeding are, to this day, serious issues for women in the workplace and for the greater community in general. The bill before us today is a clear indication that the latter is all that this government is willing to commit to.
We on this side of the chamber, however, argue that as a community we should embrace the findings of the report and that the parliament should act upon the recommendations. It is nothing short of a disgrace, in my opinion, that four years after a comprehensive report has been presented to it the Howard government finally acts on its recommendations by settling for half-measures, implementing only three of the recommendations. To add insult to injury, the three recommendations of the report being implemented by the bill before us extend only as far as to clarify existing provisions of the act. In reality, the effect of this bill can best be described by the Attorney-General's own final comment in his explanatory memorandum, where he states:
The amendments will not expand the operation of the Act.
This bill is totally inadequate and, by virtue of its lack of effect, trivialises the issues concerning pregnancy and breastfeeding in the labour force and in the community. It is simply not good enough.
I would like for a moment to refer to and reiterate some of the facts that have prevailed throughout debate on these issues and this bill. It is figures such as the following which reinforce the fact that there are gross inadequacies in the law today and that there is a great need for us to significantly reform these laws. My colleague the member for Throsby, when speaking during the second reading debate on this bill in the House of Representatives last year, outlined that according to HREOC's annual report the number of women making formal complaints to the commission about discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy soared from 86 in 2000-01 to 212 in 2001-02. Ms George reported to the House that pregnancy discrimination jumped, in that one year alone, from 16 per cent of sex discrimination cases in 2000-01 to 30 per cent. 
Sex Discrimination Commissioner Halliday's report itself provided some anecdotal evidence to highlight some of the realities of discrimination within the work force and the community. The report refers to cases where pregnancies miscarried because women were not allowed to sit down at work, where men were sacked for attending their baby's birth and where women were harassed about their appearance or removed from front desk work. These case studies further highlight the imperative and urgent need we as legislators have to address the issues of discrimination against women—and men, for that matter—on the basis of pregnancy, potential pregnancy or breastfeeding in the workplace and in the greater community. These issues are real and they are pertinent.
My colleague the member for Ballarat mentioned in her speech during the second reading debate in the House of Representatives that, according to a study undertaken by the commission, 54 per cent of women believed that their careers had been affected by taking maternity leave. A further 44.1 per cent said their salaries had stalled, 34 per cent believed their careers had taken a backward step and 29.9 per cent said that they had sacrificed their careers to give birth. These findings, coupled with the findings of the Pregnant and productive report, are simply unacceptable in a fair and equitable society such as the one we consider ourselves to be members of.
The federal Sex Discrimination Act reflects Australia's international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the International Labour Organisation's Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, both of which denote the importance of a workplace free from discrimination. The federal Sex Discrimination Act is therefore a direct representation of the attitude of the government towards eliminating sex discrimination in this country.
In 2003, the Sex Discrimination Act is in serious need of reform in order for it to reflect societal attitudes in the 21st century. No longer does the act do all it possibly can to protect the rights of women in today's work force. The act has been for some time, and very much remains, inadequate and in serious need of reform. In March 2000, my colleague the member for Jagajaga introduced into the House of Representatives a private member's bill with the same title as the one before us now. That private member's bill proposed to amend the Sex Discrimination Act and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act to ensure that pregnant, potentially pregnant and breastfeeding women are not discriminated against in the work force. We on this side of the chamber recognise the serious issue discrimination in the work force is and the adverse effects it can have on individuals, groups and the community more broadly.
Labor congratulates Susan Halliday on her wide ranging inquiry which led to the Pregnant and productive report and we welcome her findings. Labor recognises that 51.3 per cent of new mothers in two-parent families are back at work when the child reaches the age of one or two years. Work, both during pregnancy and after birth, is an issue affecting a great deal of the work force and a great many Australian families. Labor recognises the discrimination that pregnant and post pregnant women suffer in the work force. Therefore, Labor is proposing to amend the bill before us today to give effect to eight of the other report recommendations calling on amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act.
Labor's amendments to this bill would have the effect of empowering the Attorney-General to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy—recommendation 1; ensuring the Sex Discrimination Act covers unpaid workers— recommendation 8; removing the exemptions for employment by an instrumentality of the state from the Sex Discrimination Act—recommendation 10; removing the exemptions for educational institutions established for religious purposes in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy—recom-mendation 11; allowing punitive damages to be awarded—recommendation 42; allowing the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory awards or agreements to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission without the requirement to receive a written complaint—recommendation 19; clarifying that a complaint about a discriminatory advertisement may be made by any person—recommendation 35; and extending the antidiscrimination provision to employees who are in the process of adopting a child—recommendation 39. 
While discrimination and harassment on the grounds of pregnancy and potential pregnancy are currently grounds for complaint under the Sex Discrimination Act, Labor note the Pregnant and productive report findings which outline that workplace discrimination and harassment on these grounds remain real issues for many women and that clarification of the act is needed in a number of areas. Labor therefore welcome and will be supporting the three amendments to the act contained in the government bill before us. While we will be supporting these amendments, we again reiterate our disappointment with the total inadequacy of this bill. Labor are pushing for a sea change in policy and attitude in the area of work and family. Labor recognise that the changes to the economy and the labour market over the past couple of decades have led to increased pressures on families. It is a fanciful notion to suggest that these immense pressures on working families will alleviate over time without government intervention. Governments must act.
It is interesting to note that the country's birth rate has fallen dramatically over the past few decades to all-time low levels. In the early 1960s, the rate of fertility stood at 3.5 babies per woman. In 2001, that figure dropped to just 1.7, representing the lowest rate on record. It is down from 1.75 children on average in the year 2000 and much worse than the previous lows of 1.86 and 1.94 recorded in 1991 and 1981, when those figures were last taken. Australia is in very real danger of becoming a baby-free society, a place where children are a private responsibility that must not impinge on a parent's working life. Australia's lack of a system of paid maternity leave is undoubtedly a contributing factor to this decline in the birth rate.
It is rather atrocious that of the 163 signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, some 157 countries have provided paid maternity leave. Australia remains one of only six countries yet to do so. Labor is committed to catching up with the rest of the world and introducing a system of paid maternity leave, a measure consistent with the rights available to families and workers in countries all over the world. The lack of a government bill before the parliament that gives effect to a system of paid maternity leave is a serious concern to us.
Will we wait another four years for the government to acknowledge and act upon Sex Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward's 2002 proposal for a national paid maternity leave scheme? Let us hope we do not. Commissioner Goward's report states:
Paid maternity leave also recognises the disadvantage experienced by women in paid work when they bear children. Not only are they likely to suffer workplace discrimination because they are pregnant or a mother, they frequently find it difficult to combine their new family responsibilities with their obligations to their paid work. Certainly, their lifetime earnings are likely to suffer, and their retirement incomes would be less than if they had not had a child. 
Labor recognise that, and that is why we have argued for some time that a system of paid maternity leave is a necessary policy and one which Australia requires to be in effect today. The government must act on this issue now and do so in totality, not in half-measures—as it has done with the bill before us today. In conclusion, I would like to point out to the Senate a few of the other points made in the Pregnant and productive report which I believe pretty well sum up the situation we find ourselves in. The foreword to the report states:
This inquiry, having confirmed that to be granted a human right does not necessarily ensure its realisation, provides us with an opportunity, via the report recommendations, to support Australian women and their families. Women, who are encouraged by society to have children, should be in a position to view the privilege of being able to have a child as just that, a privilege, rather than something they are penalised for.
Moreover:
It is a human right, not a privilege for a woman to work while she is pregnant. The challenge that lies before us on the eve of the 21st Century is to ensure appropriate, safe and fair management of workplace pregnancy.
Again, we have to bear in mind that the report was released in June 1999 under some false premise that the government would deal with the issues and recommendations contained within it with some sort of urgency. It is a sad indictment on this government that we are only now, in September 2003, in a position to enact some of the change in this regard. What is even worse is that, while the bill will enact three of the report's recommendations, eight other significant yet hardly radical recommendations have been ignored by the government and do not figure at all in this bill. Labor will be supporting the bill before the Senate. However, again—and finally this time—I would like to reiterate my utter disappointment with this bill's inadequacy. ",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-09-08,"—The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002 is deeply disturbing because it fails to make changes needed to protect and support women in the workplace. What is not included in this bill speaks volumes about the government's commitment to developing policies that recognise the many roles that women play, that value caring work and that make women's lives easier. Put simply, the government likes to talk a lot but delivers little. It seems not to understand, or not to care, that the Australian people expect leadership from the national government to help shape more enlightened community attitudes and to enact laws to set community standards.
This bill is an example of the failure of the national leadership under Prime Minister Howard. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquired into discrimination against women in its National Pregnancy and Work Inquiry, reporting to the government a little over four years ago. This bill is designed to respond to that inquiry; yet the government picked up just three of the committee's 12 recommendations to change the Sex Discrimination Act, and not one of the provisions in this bill changes the substance of the legislation. This is quite apparent because the government has made no secret of the fact that this bill does not expand the operation of the act. All these amendments do is clarify the existing legislation—that is, legislation that the commission found to be inadequate. The amendments clarify the fact that discriminating against women who are breastfeeding is prohibited, but the government missed the opportunity to provide stronger protection, as several states provide, by more substantial amendments. The government has also failed to respond to the commission's call to extend unpaid maternity leave to casual workers employed for more than 12 months, who are covered by the Workplace Relations Act. 
The government's delay in addressing the matter of paid parental leave is scandalous. Australia remains just one of two rich, industrialised nations without a national scheme of paid parental leave. The Prime Minister keeps saying that the government does not object to a paid parental leave scheme, but he refuses to commit the government to introducing one. Other cabinet members have expressed open hostility to the concept of a publicly funded national paid leave scheme, describing it as middle-class welfare. The government has argued that these matters are best left to the marketplace for employers and employees to sort out between themselves.
For those workers with bargaining power, such as employees represented by strong trade unions, this approach might work. For example, the National Tertiary Education Union has just secured in-principle agreement from University of Sydney management to introduce 14 weeks paid maternity leave and a further 38 weeks leave at 60 per cent of full-time pay. The entitlement beyond 14 weeks maternity leave may be used by the woman for a phased return to work whilst retaining full-time wages or be redirected to research grants or professional development training. The provisions are subject to the final negotiation of a certified agreement and are similar to the entitlements that the NTEU secured for women employed at the Australian Catholic University. The NTEU is a well-resourced union, operating in a largely unionised workplace.
Low paid workers are particularly disadvantaged. They are the least likely of all employees to have paid parental leave. That is why the Greens' congratulations go out to the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, which has just managed to secure a win for its members with the first paid maternity leave in the hospitality industry. Hundreds of employees of US corporation Starwood Hotels and Resorts working in several capital and regional cities in Australia now have six weeks paid leave as a condition of their new enterprise bargaining agreement. Six weeks, of course, is a long way short of the International Labour Organisation's recommended minimum of 14 weeks, but it is a win for the LHMU. Perhaps that represents the different way in which workers with differing bargaining powers can get entitlements if it is left to the enterprise bargaining scheme.
A quick survey of the state of affairs reveals the inadequacy for most workers of leaving paid parental leave to the marketplace. Paid maternity leave provisions appear in only 3.4 per cent of currently operating certified agreements. Only seven per cent of all current federal certified agreements contain paid maternity leave provisions. The average duration of leave across all current arrangements is just seven weeks. Only 38 per cent of women have access to paid parental leave. Those who do are more likely to be working for large employers or a government or be earning above average wages. Even government employees have varying entitlements.
The current situation is clearly unacceptable, especially when women constitute almost half of the work force. The Greens' conviction that the government needs to play a central role in improving this situation is echoed by the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, who was reported in the Weekend Australian last month as stating: 
One of the cruellest half-truths in this whole debate is the market will fix it, that it will happen at the enterprise-bargaining level ... Why cruel? The average amount of paid leave is six weeks and you have to go back to work to get the balance of your money, so it's actually associated with making women who need the money go back earlier.
The Prime Minister, writing last month in Options, a Liberal backbencher journal, acknowledged that low-paid, part-time and casual workers were less likely to access paid maternity leave and that some schemes involved short periods of leave. The government's response to these matters, however, was to `rule out imposing onerous obligations upon employers, particularly in small business'. That is precisely why a public scheme is required—to provide a fair scheme that covers women in various employment situations and especially lower paid workers.
The government's only significant response to date to the growing chorus demanding a national paid parental leave scheme is the baby bonus—a tax equalisation scheme that gives the biggest benefit to the highest paid workers who stay out of the paid work force for up to five years—at a cost to the national budget of $510 million by 2005-06. Minister Vanstone several weeks ago made a brave call, publicly questioning the benefit of the government's baby bonus. The minister was wrong, though, to suggest that women would benefit more from other measures, such as ongoing support to raise a child, rather than financial support at the time of a birth or adoption.
Australia is a country that is wealthy enough to afford both if we choose to, and we should. There are many changes needed to make it easier for women and men to be involved in paid work and caring for their children. We need more places and more affordable child care, more investment in work based child care, more flexibility in working time and more support for men to take paid and unpaid leave to care for their children, just to name a few. It is odd, to say the least, to focus on the benefits of ongoing assistance to parents while ignoring a woman's need for financial compensation for loss of income when she leaves paid employment to give birth, to bond with her child, to recover from childbirth and to establish breastfeeding.
The funds allocated to the baby bonus could be redirected to establish a national scheme. The Greens have developed such a proposal that would be effectively revenue neutral. Our scheme would particularly assist low-income earners, casual, part-time, seasonal and contract workers with an established attachment to the work force. Under the Greens' proposal, people would be paid replacement wages up to average weekly earnings but not less than the federal minimum wage for 18 weeks, with a right to a further 34 weeks of unpaid leave. A woman's partner would be able to share her entitlement.
We propose a review of such a scheme within three years with a view to expanding the paid leave period to 26 weeks, as applies currently in the United Kingdom, and unpaid leave to 18 months. All of this is achievable today—if only the government cared enough to bring Australia into step with comparable nations. But it is making it clear through this bill today that it does not.
It is clear that the marketplace will not deliver paid parental leave for the majority of workers—just as enterprise bargaining has not delivered other important provisions to ensure that employees are not required to sacrifice their family and community obligations in the pursuit of earning a decent living. The Prime Minister recently claimed that all the flexibility anyone could desire was available through signing an individual contract or an Australian workplace agreement. But we know that the inherent power imbalance in the relationship between an employer and an employee means that all workers cannot rely on business to deliver the minimum conditions to make it possible to engage in paid work, to raise a family and to be involved in community life. 
The Prime Minister points to a rise in part-time work as a major achievement in accommodating family commitments. He ignores the fact that 22 per cent of part-time workers want to work more. He ignores the fact that two-thirds of part-time jobs are casual jobs, which usually come with few if any entitlements. In fact, four out of every 10 employed mothers have no leave entitlements—that is, no paid leave to care for a sick child or to take a child to medical appointments. Amazingly, the Prime Minister declared in Options:
The government's review of policy in each of these areas has led to the conclusion that the current policy mix is about right in providing effective choice for parents.
In the absence of action by the Howard government to address these matters, the ACTU has embarked on a work and family test case, which the Greens support. If successful, the claim will provide significant improvements for workers covered by the five awards involved. Those improvements include the right to return from parental leave to part-time work; allowing employees to buy up to six weeks additional annual leave each year by adjusting their pay, thereby enabling parents to be with their children during school holidays; and extending unpaid maternity leave from 12 months to 24 months.
Of course, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry opposes the test case, arguing that purely creating jobs should be the top priority. But most people do not live to work; they work to live. They deserve a reasonable living, and that means being more than employees; it means being parents, carers, community activists and participants. The government pays lip-service to the importance of family life, the role of women as carers and the raising of children. When it comes to practical support the government goes missing. Unlike the government, the Greens recognise that caring work, including the work of women and men raising children, is a valid occupation. We are committed to practical measures to support people involved in such work, and our paid parental leave scheme is one such measure. It is affordable and it is far superior to the regressive baby bonus, which should be abolished. I foreshadow the Greens' second reading amendment to this legislation.",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I rise this afternoon to provide some comments about the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002. Back on 26 August 1998 the Commonwealth Attorney-General, the Hon. Daryl Williams, referred to the Human Rights And Equal Opportunity Commission a national inquiry into discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy, potential pregnancy and the management of pregnancy in the workplace. The inquiry conducted by HREOC found overwhelmingly that discrimination in the workplace on the basis of pregnancy and potential pregnancy was profound and extensive. Evidence received clearly illustrated that there must be a legislative response to the issues raised in the inquiry. Of course, at the time many of us who had dealt with complaints about discrimination based on pregnancy and the issue of pregnancy in the workplace were pleased that such an inquiry had been initiated by HREOC. Many of us were hopeful that the outcomes would be much more substantial than those we are dealing with today. The government has failed to deliver on the outcomes of the report with this bill. This bill does not remedy the problems that pregnant women face in the work force. In fact, it does not even attempt to facilitate the recommendations made by HREOC, despite this government having called for the inquiry initially.  
The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill before us represents the government's implementation of only three of the 12 recommendations of the commission. The 12 recommendations were the result of the inquiry conducted by the commission in 1999 which was consequently entitled Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant. The title encapsulates perfectly the issues which women in Australia face as participants in the work force. That report was delivered in June 1999, and it took the government 17 months following the tabling and the finalisation of the report to actually respond to it.
I must place on the record my appreciation of the work that Susan Halliday, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner at that time, did in ensuring that the consultations that were undertaken by HREOC were wide reaching and thorough. She and her commission are to be commended for the work that they put into that report. But it is unfortunate that it has taken this government 17 months following the tabling of that report to even issue a response, that it has taken some four years before we have seen legislation that addressed the concerns in that report and that only three of the 12 recommendations have been addressed. It has taken the government two years to come up with this subsequent bill, which clearly fails to address many of the issues. Unfortunately, the bill before us does not do enough to improve the situation for women when it comes to discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy in the work force. The government has basically chosen to ignore the vast majority of the legislative changes that were suggested by HREOC.
The Sex Discrimination Act does contain prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of pregnancy or potential pregnancy under section 7. It must be noted, however, that none of the government's amendments to be made by this bill actually change the substance of the legislation. The government's bill does clarify several important issues which have in the past restricted the effectiveness of the Sex Discrimination Act. As a result of submissions taken, HREOC recommended that the Sex Discrimination Act be amended to specifically cover breastfeeding as a ground for unlawful discrimination. The government has chosen, however, to avoid actually creating a new ground of discrimination under the act to address this recommendation. Currently, discrimination and harassment on the grounds of pregnancy and potential pregnancy are grounds for complaint under the Sex Discrimination Act. However, as the HREOC report concludes, there needs to be a more coherent and comprehensive set of provisions included in the act to ensure that breastfeeding, for example, is specifically covered and that women are protected.
In March 2000 the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Jenny Macklin, introduced a private member's bill that amended the Sex Discrimination Act and the HREOC Act to ensure that pregnant, potentially pregnant and breastfeeding women were not discriminated against in the workplace. In the Senate I subsequently tabled a bill that mirrored the bill that Ms Macklin had tabled in the House of Representatives. This bill was in response to a clear need for legislative change, highlighted in the Pregnant and productive report.
The HREOC inquiry conducted by the then Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Susan Halliday, revealed that parents, especially women, were experiencing situations that were absolutely unacceptable, such as women miscarrying because they were not allowed to sit down at work, men being sacked for attending the birth of their babies, women being harassed about their appearance and women being removed from the front desk where they were visible to the public. In one case documented by the commissioner, a woman working in a car factory was denied a chair, despite bleeding and severe pain. Consequently, she collapsed at work when seven months pregnant and her baby was born prematurely with an underdeveloped heart. 
It is simply and totally unacceptable and extremely distressing to know that women are enduring such circumstances in their place of work to this very day in a country such as Australia. Even more distressing is the fact that this government is doing very little about it. As stated previously, the bill neglects to incorporate a number of key recommendations made by the HREOC report. Why would you bother to get the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to conduct a report into pregnancy and the impact of pregnancy in the workplace if, at the end of the day, you were not going to be totally committed to implementing the recommendations that a body such as HREOC found during its consultations. 
Their report suggested empowering HREOC to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy; allowing referrals by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to the Industrial Relations Commission, enabling the award of punitive damages as well as compensatory damages, removing the exemption of educational institutions established for religious purposes in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy, ensuring coverage of unpaid workers and removing the exemption of employment by an instrumentality of a state. HREOC's pregnancy and work inquiry, in the foreword of the report, revealed: 
Erroneous tactics and exploitative practices are, to this day, being utilised to remove pregnant women from the workplace or deny pregnant, and potentially pregnant women, equal employment opportunity.   
The government's delayed and pathetic response to this report is astonishing. There has not been a legitimate attempt to implement the recommendations made by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. The fact is that women in the work force remain vulnerable to discrimination, and this bill will do little to address that. Hence there has not been a legitimate or, at the very least, sincere attempt by this government to protect people from discrimination based on pregnancy, potential pregnancy, breastfeeding or family responsibilities. At least we can be sure that this government has been consistent in neglecting women. This government has consistently failed to move with the times and keep up with trends relevant to women in the work force.
The issues raised in the Pregnant and productive report are important and immediate and must be dealt with. They are serious and, as the report states quite clearly, life threatening in some cases. Recent examples are readily available for a debate such as this. In recent weeks there have been reports of Telstra, for example, sacking a worker who returned from maternity leave and wanted to resume her employment part time. Discriminatory dismissals are a common basis of sex discrimination complaints under the Sex Discrimination Act and remain the most common reason women formalise complaints of discrimination on the ground of pregnancy under the act. 
There is an unacceptable culture in Australia and in workplaces today which allows discrimination to continue against women in the work force on the grounds of pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is distressing to realise that many women simply accept that they will be discriminated against. I argue that it is beyond doubt and beyond denial that legislation needs to be enacted to change this culture and protect all women in the work force. Last year, complaints to HREOC of pregnancy related discrimination doubled. Whether the significant increase was the result of an increase in acts of discrimination or simply, and more importantly, an increased awareness of the rights of pregnant and breastfeeding women, it certainly highlights the need for stronger laws to protect pregnant and breastfeeding women from unacceptable treatment. The Pregnant and productive report highlighted that, in 1997, 14.7 per cent of all complaints under the Sex Discrimination Act involved discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy. In 1999, after the commencement and publicity of the inquiry, the figure had risen to 17.4 per cent. If nothing else, it demonstrates the need for public education of pregnant women's rights in the workplace. 
The inquiry, not surprisingly, found that discrimination that prevents women from entering or moving within the work force continues to operate as a barrier to redress historical workplace gender imbalances. It also became evident to HREOC that there was a significant level of ignorance amongst employers and some employees when it came to dealing with pregnancy issues in the work force. The level of knowledge simply was not at a level to facilitate the complex and confronting problems that employers and employees face in the workplace. The inquiry confirmed that employers and employees are in need of clear, practical guidelines that are educative in nature. Increased education to ensure compliance with the Sex Discrimination Act and about how the act interrelates with workplace relations and occupational health and safety requirements also emerged as a priority.
HREOC's main recommendation concerns the immediate need for education, guidance and awareness-raising programs around pregnancy and work. As the Pregnant and productive report recognises, the significant increase in the number of women participating in the work force cannot be seen as a separate issue to pregnancy and breastfeeding discrimination. In 1986 women made up 39.6 per cent of the Australian labour force. In 1996 that proportion had grown to 43 per cent. Today that proportion has continued to rise to almost 50 per cent. Some 70 per cent of women in Australia now participate in the work force in some way. Policy must not only reflect this but also promote women's continued participation in the work force as an equal citizen. Of major concern is the acceptance by a considerable number of women of the discrimination that they experience.
A number of submissions to the inquiry suggested that many women simply accept that pregnancy is a personal choice and that they cannot expect to have their cake and eat it too—in other words, they expect to be discriminated against. Women still do not expect to be able to have a family and participate in the work force at whichever level they choose. This was largely attributed to the lack of public awareness and the need for education about what women's rights are, particularly when they are pregnant. As one submission stated:
It is a sad reflection of women's status in Australian society that so many women are prepared to accept this discrimination as part of life.
Internationally, there has been significant recognition of the contribution women make as work force participants. Generally, this has occurred in the form of legislation aimed at ensuring that women are not disadvantaged in the workplace because they bear or want to have children. The UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, for example, specifically addresses women in the work force and discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy. The International Labour Organisation developed the Maternity Protection Convention, which was the first global standard aimed at protecting women before and after childbirth. The European Union implemented the pregnant workers directive in 1992 which protects potentially pregnant, pregnant and breastfeeding women from discrimination in the work force. 
As increasing numbers of women participate in the work force all over the world, it becomes imperative that their rights as workers are protected. It is predicted by the ILO that in just over 10 years 80 per cent of all women in industrialised countries, and 70 per cent globally, will be working outside the home throughout their childbearing years. There must be acknowledgment of the contribution that women make as work force participants and a realisation of basic rights and equal opportunities, in the workplace in particular, which accompany this.
Recently this government has shown its true colours when it comes to women. The Howard government has been all talk and no action—and, in this case, I think actions definitely speak louder than words. Apparently there is a work and family task force in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet coming up with some kind of policy that will accommodate the Prime Minister's personal agenda, but so far nothing concrete has eventuated. This government has done absolutely nothing to assist people in Australia to combine work and family responsibilities and to balance work expectations and family commitments. The Prime Minister has repeatedly changed his tune on the issue of paid maternity leave. It has become another thought bubble in the cartoon on the Prime Minister's bookshelf. Despite claiming it is still on the agenda, the fact is that this government has failed to deliver any national paid maternity leave scheme comparable to almost every other nation in the world.
We have also seen this government finally acknowledge the prevalence of domestic violence in Indigenous communities—after how many years? However, last budget estimates we revealed that in fact this government had diverted $10.1 million from the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence program to pay for a fridge magnet. The Howard government was unable to spend this money to stop domestic violence then, so what is the big change now? Now in this bill before us, having called for the inquiry into pregnancy and work, this government has simply decided to completely reject every recommendation made by HREOC bar three. It becomes obvious that the Howard government has no intention of ensuring there is equal opportunity for women in the work force and absolutely no intention of addressing the issues families are currently facing in Australia.
The amendments that the Labor Party are proposing clearly demonstrate our commitment to stamping out discrimination in the workplace. This will be the second time we have attempted to put these amendments through this parliament—once in the bill that Jenny Macklin and I tabled and now through these amendments. Our amendments will strengthen the law to protect women from discrimination when they are pregnant or breast-feeding. Importantly, Labor's amendments include empowering the Attorney-General to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy. As recommended by the HREOC report, Labor would also specifically include breastfeeding as a ground for unlawful discrimination. Furthermore, we would ensure that unpaid workers are also covered by the Sex Discrimination Act. This is basically in recognition of the contribution of volunteers in our society and the fact that they are also vulnerable to discrimination. 
Labor's amendments are a genuine attempt to implement the recommendations of the Pregnant and productive report, unlike this government. If this government were serious about the issue of pregnancy and potential pregnancy discrimination in the work force, there would be no hesitation whatsoever in enacting all 12 of the recommendations of the Pregnant and productive report. The truth is that the government never, ever had any intention of implementing the recommendations of the report—all talk and very little action. The recommendations documented in HREOC's Pregnant and productive report are the result of community consultation and comprehensive research, which was conducted at the request of this very government. It is imperative that these recommendations be included in the bill and passed in an attempt to stop discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, potential pregnancy and breastfeeding in the workplace for all Australian women.",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2003-09-08,"—Like my colleagues, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002. It is a pleasure to see you all joining me for this important debate. We have been told that these changes to the sex discrimination legislation form the government's response to the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission of June 1999—a report that was titled, as my colleagues earlier outlined, Pregnant and productive: it's a right not aprivilege to work while pregnant'. We may all wonder about this whole approach. We have a report presented in June 1999 and now the Senate debating the government's legislative response. It has been four years and two months after the report has been presented, and now we get a debate in the Senate. It has taken 50 months. I suppose there should be little surprise that this legislation is moving with all the speed of a snail on prozac. I say this because, as we all know, the government did not respond to the report until November 2000. That is only 17 months from the time the report was presented. I can accept that 17 months seems like a fairly rapid response, but that is rapid only when compared to 50 months.
This legislation essentially amends the Sex Discrimination Act in three cases, as has been outlined. Therefore, the government's legislative response to the 12 recommendations of the original report that suggested amendments to the sex discrimination legislation has been to act on only three of them—and we in the Senate are the ones who are constantly told by the government that we are obstructing the passage of legislation.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-09-08,"—My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison. In light of the minister's statement to the Senate on 20 August in which he said, `We have an increase in border control and scrutiny which this country has never seen before,' how is it that two perfect strangers can enter a high security facility with false IDs, not be recognised, remain on the premises for two hours and leave with two computers on a trolley unchallenged? Given that the minister has announced three separate inquiries into this theft in as many days, who will these reports be provided to and will any of them be made public?

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-09-08,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given that the minister has now confirmed that there are at least three inquiries, can the minister advise whether the intruders carried out any other activities apart from stealing two servers, such as downloading of files? If, as the minister and the Attorney-General contend, this is not a breach of national security, what are you able to tell the Senate about the break-in and investigation? Will the minister now commit to a full statement to the parliament outlining the circumstances of this very serious breach, the findings and outcomes of the investigation and the remedial action to be taken? ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Customs Service: Security</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-09-08,"—Senator Bishop should get his facts right for a start. I have not announced three inquiries in as many days. What I have said is that there is an Australian Federal Police investigation into this matter and that there is a Customs internal inquiry. That is an investigation—
—That makes three.
—No. Can I say that these were not announcements which I had initiated. The Australian Federal Police investigation had been in place as a result of their being contacted by the Australian Customs Service, quite properly so. The only inquiry that I announced was the independent one that will be held, as I said, within as many days. That will be done and that will be advised to the parliament.
—That is four.
—That is why Senator Bishop ought to get his facts right. What he does hark back to is that on 20 August, when I answered a question from him in relation to the importation of ammonium nitrate, I outlined to the Senate the extensive border controls which have been introduced by this government. We have introduced as never before an increase in border security. We have seen it with our increased surveillance flights, our sea days being doubled, the 100 per cent X-ray of mail coming into Australia, 70 per cent inspection of air cargo, inspection of passenger baggage, X-ray of containers and having detector dogs. We have increased funding to Customs by around 50 per cent—something that the opposition never did. 
Senator Bishop asked how this could happen. That is what the Australian Federal Police are investigating at the moment. We regard this as a breach of security. We have not downplayed this in any way, but we have said that some of the reports in the media have been misrepresentations. We have not had the theft of thousands of confidential files as alleged. We have not had complaints from the Australian Federal Police or ASIO and we have not had the release of sensitive details relating to Customs. I think it was the CPSU which made that inquiry and we have replied to that. What we have to keep in perspective are those reports which try to sensationalise matters and those which are of a more rational nature. We regard this as a serious matter. The government is mindful that this is a very important issue; there is no question about that. But what I have said is that this does not involve a question of national security. The Attorney-General has said that as well. We have looked at the circumstances of the case. 
—What is on the computers?
—The question has also been raised whether in the course of the theft of these two servers anything else was done. We have carried out inquiries and I can tell you that at this stage there is no evidence of any intrusion into the system. In fact, the Australian Federal Police, with the assistance of DSD, who have great forensic skills in this area, in their investigations have not detected any intrusion into the system as yet, nor has Customs. That is something which Customs immediately set about doing in relation to this whole affair. It took remedial action too in relation to the changing of passwords and access words and also notifying other people who may be affected by that.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-09-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister's failure to provide either an answer or an explanation. 
I do make the point that my office contacted his office prior to question time and advised him that I would be requesting this explanation. The question goes to alternative forms of accommodation for asylum seekers—that is, alternatives to detention centres. As I said, it was put on notice on 21 July, so there has been plenty of time for the minister to answer. In fact, it was due in the last two sitting weeks. The question comes out of a statement which Mr Ruddock made on 3 December. He said:
Within the mandatory detention framework and consistent with the Migration Act, the government is continuing to take innovative approaches to alternative places of detention that meet the objectives of having people available for processing and, if required, removal.
It was to this end that I commissioned the residential housing trial at Woomera last year. The trial, although very costly, has been a success, and I have agreed to expand the eligibility criteria for children and women who wish to participate in the residential housing trial ...
I think it is fair to say that that decision by the minister came about because of pressure within his own party about children and women who are being effectively jailed in detention centres for having committed no crime whatsoever. It was at least some concession to that pressure—and, I must say, to plenty of pressure from this end of the chamber—because essentially it is a very cruel and a very inhumane way of treating people who have come to this country for whatever reason.
In December, the minister also put out what was called `Migration series instruction: alternative places of detention'. He instructed departments that this was what needed to happen. In fact, that document says:
Every effort should be made to enable the placement of women and children in a residential housing project as soon as possible.  
According to the migration series instruction, those projects include residential housing projects, hospitals, nursing homes, mental health facilities, foster carer homes, hotels, motels and community care facilities. 
My question went to the success or otherwise of the progress that has been made on that ministerial undertaking. I asked just how many unlawful non-citizens—to use the minister's language, which I do not like to use, but I will for the purposes of this debate—are currently accommodated in alternative places of detention. We know this to be a very small number indeed, but I think it is fair to ask just how many there are. We asked that data be provided to show gender, age, familial relationship grouping, state, duration in alternative accommodation to date and part- or full-time in alternative accommodation. We also asked what specific places of detention have so far been approved by the minister as alternative accommodation and for details of that, and how many people have lodged expressions of interest in alternative accommodation but which have not been met. 
We asked how many people were currently on the so-called discrete list of detainees who volunteered and are eligible to participate in this program but who are still in detention, how many unaccompanied minors of tender years remain in detention, how many unaccompanied minors older than those remain in detention and how many children were placed in foster care whose parent or parents were held in detention. Following up on the minister's statement that every effort should be made to enable the placement of women and children in these places as soon as possible, we asked just what those efforts were. It is our understanding that they are pretty minimal and whatever effort that has been taken has been taken on the part of voluntary groups and charity organisations. 
We also asked what Commonwealth funding was being provided for those who were placed in alternative accommodation for rent, furniture, food, clothing, footwear, bedding, education, sporting, recreational and leisure activities and religious needs. The answer to that question too is that they rely on donations and the charity, as I said, of organisations that have taken up this cause, and I congratulate them for doing that. They do it for humanitarian reasons and not because the government is funding them to do it. And we asked what was the total cost to the Commonwealth of alternative accommodation in the last month and how that compared with the cost of housing for the same number of people in detention. 
Subsequently, a report has been done by Dr Tony Ward of an organisation called Milbur Consulting for the Justice for Asylum Seekers Network, which looked at just that question—the viability of alternative accommodation and how that compares with putting people in the jails that we call detention centres. To start with, let us take that question of the Woomera alternative detention project, which began in August 2001. Six months into the project, according to this report, DIMIA commissioned a review and the following discussion is summarised from that report:
The project enables up to 25 women and children, previously held in the Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC), to live in family style accommodation some two kilometres from the IRPC. One participant described “we have our own rooms, we can cook, we don't have to queue up for meals, we can do our own washing and watch our own TVs.”
The project was managed by Australasian Correctional Management Pty Ltd (ACM), which also managed the IRPC. The women and children lived in three houses, with a fourth house the base for ACM staff and also used for communal activities such as English classes, life skill classes, sewing groups, and private consultations. Husbands, and male children over the age of 12, were not allowed in the project, but families could visit husbands and fathers in the IRPC. This separation of families was participants' major concern about the project. 
Special nursing and educational facilities, linked to those at the IRPC, were provided.
So, by all accounts, even though the minister says it was expensive—very costly, in fact—it was still less expensive than housing them in the immigration reception centre. In fact, the report shows that the federal government could save millions of dollars a year and, of course, greatly improve the mental health conditions of the asylum seekers who are in these detention centres. The model was fully costed by Dr Ward of Milbur Consulting, and he found high-security camps such as Baxter were nearly two-thirds more expensive than medium-security hostels and twice as expensive as community housing with case management. He concluded that the government could save more than 18 per cent of current costs if it adopted the proposed model, and that would have meant savings of $18.76 million for the financial year. For some of us, cost is not the most important factor. If we can demonstrate that not only are people so much worse off in detention centres but also we as taxpayers are worse off, perhaps there is the slim chance that this government will take some notice of that. 
Moving people to healthier and cheaper environments, such as community housing with the support of caseworkers, is a sensible change. Mr Mark Purcell of the Catholic Commission for Justice, Development and Peace, in commenting on this report said:
It's better for the taxpayer, better for the asylum seekers and has no impact on the government's border control policies. 
He also said:
The Federal government can no longer claim there are no viable and costed alternatives to high security detention camps. There are no more excuses. It is [time] for the government to act.
We do not know whether the government has acted or not. We suspect it has not, but until those questions are answered we are left in the dark.
It is often said that there is a problem with absconding rates if asylum seekers are let out into the community, as it were. This report looked into what goes on in the United Kingdom and the United States and it found that absconding rates are generally low—rates are almost zero where participants have incentives to continue to participate in the assessment process—and that case management by assisting participants to understand their situation helps to keep absconding rates low while also enhancing participants' morale and wellbeing. 
The Hotham Mission Asylum Seeker Project has been deemed suitable by the government to take asylum seekers and give them alternative forms of accommodation. It is based in north Melbourne, my home city, and it started this asylum seeker project in early 1997. It uses vacant houses owned by the churches to house asylum seekers with no accommodation, no income, no work rights, no Medicare, no entitlements or any other means of support. It started with two properties and 15 asylum seekers, and the project now works with over 200 asylum seekers in 30 properties. In 2002 the project won a national human rights award for community work. From late 2000 the project has been providing housing and assistance to 50 asylum seekers released early from detention on bridging visas and without any entitlements. They were in three main categories: those released for psychological or medical reasons, those detained for breaching their bridging visa requirements and those released by a Federal Court order.  
As I said earlier, we find that the Commonwealth is in fact using these organisations to salve its conscience on women and children in detention centres. But it is not actually hitting its kick; it is not actually providing the funds to do that. The project's total expenses are $100,000 a year for administration and $300,000 a year for emergency relief. That is primarily funded through donations and commitments to individual families.
Last week I had one such person in my office who is staying at the Hotham mission, and I saw a broken man. It was an extremely disturbing experience for me to hear the pleas of a person who has no support other than the Hotham mission. His wife and children are in fact in detention in Syria. He has been in detention centres for four years. He is now out in the community, but he has so little support there that he might as well be back where he was in the first place—not that he wishes to be there. I was absolutely struck by the humanitarian tragedy that this man represented in my office. I know that there are hundreds of such people who are being treated this way by the government.
I urge the government to act on finding alternative accommodation. I urge the government to take seriously this question. We are fed up with governments that come up with promises, whether it is to take national action on gambling or it is to relieve this terrible problem of children in detention. We want action that follows up the rhetoric and follows up the commitments that appear to go nowhere. I urge the minister to work quickly not just on answering my questions but on finding alternative forms of accommodation both for the sake of asylum seekers and for the sake of taxpayers in this country.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to questions without notice asked by Senators Bishop, Faulkner, Ludwig, Kirk and Mackay today relating to national security.
Time and time again we hear rhetoric from the Howard government that they are the best placed, the best equipped to protect Australians on national security matters. We are three days away from the anniversary of September 11, and incidents in the last week have cast serious doubt on whether the Howard government have got their act together on national security. Perhaps they believe their own rhetoric that they are keeping Australia in safe hands, but the reality is quite different. The government are not doing the necessary groundwork in these important areas of protecting Australians. What has been exposed over the past week or so is just how seriously incompetent the Howard government are when it comes to matters of national security. We have seen just in the past week three examples of gross incompetence by the Howard government, gross incompetence by the Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Williams—it is a byword of course for Mr Williams—and gross incompetence by Minister Ellison here in the Senate.
Let me go through the examples for the Senate. Example 1 is the Keystone Cops version of national security, where two complete strangers can enter a high-security facility with false IDs, not to be recognised by anybody at all, remain on the premises for two hours and then wheel out on a trolley two computers—and do all this absolutely unchallenged. That is example 1 of incompetence. What about example 2, where an Australian agency—apparently the AFP—only sought a formal interview with the top al-Qaeda suspect Abu Dahdah last week, despite knowing at least 13 months ago that he had made a series of phone calls to two Australians between 1996 and 2001? Then of course we have example 3—it would be funny if it were not so serious—where the Howard government, the Attorney-General and his department are so incompetent that they could not even ensure that the telephone number for the national security hotline was listed in the White Pages nationwide. After having spent 20 million taxpayers' dollars on promoting the national security hotline with that farcical fridge magnet, mailed to every household in Australia, they forgot to put the telephone number in the White Pages. So much for their slogan `Be alert, not alarmed'. I am alarmed that the Howard government are not a great deal more alert on these very important issues.  
Today in question time we had another serious issue raised about the operability of security cameras in a range of very important security facilities. We know that there is an issue whether the security cameras in the Customs building in Sydney were working—and we have mixed messages from the minister there—but we would also like to know, and we demand answers from the government, whether it is true that in March, when the New South Wales Police asked for security camera evidence from ASIO buildings, including the ASIO building in Sydney, following an unprovoked knife attack on a New South Wales police officer, ASIO's external security cameras were not working. We demand to know whether that is the truth. We want answers from this incompetent government.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2003-09-08,"—I am not surprised that it took Senator Faulkner a little while to get steamed up. He was steamed up and then Senator Allison took some quarter of an hour to talk to her motion on a non-response to a question on notice. Senator Faulkner did lose a bit of steam, but he managed to get up near full tilt at the end over his little set piece, prepared long before he came into question time so that he could get maximum amount of exposure. Senator Faulkner, it is a wonderful little set piece, but it does nothing to change the view of the Australian people. You talk about gross incompetence, you talk about border security and you talk about a let-down of the Australian public. Let me tell you, Senator Faulkner, just before you go out of the chamber, that in fact the Australian public will decide who they want running this country when it comes to matters of security and matters of protecting Australians. And they have made that choice three times already. Three times they have had to decide who they want running security matters in Australia, who they want protecting their future. They have decided every time.
Senator Faulkner comes here and uses extreme words like `gross incompetence' and `gross areas of wrongdoing'. Senator Faulkner is certainly guilty of a gross miscalculation if he thinks the little set piece he put on here today is going to sway anybody in the Australian public or alter their views on who they think should be running Australia's security. The problem with the senators opposite is that they simply do not listen to the answers that are given to them. They simply did not listen to Senator Ellison explaining to them in detail the answers to all of their questions. They simply refused to listen. They go on with a supplementary question—which often bears no relation to the original question, having not listened to the answer—and they expect the Australian public to think they are sincere about questioning us on matters of security.
Senator Faulkner made much of the fact that the telephone number was left out of the White Pages. Had he listened carefully to Senator Ellison's reply, he would have noticed that there were, I think, 22,000 calls to that helpline since it was put there—22,000! 
—In Tasmania?
—No, Senator Bishop, I am quite sure they did not all come from Tasmania. There have been 22,000 calls to the hotline, so people who want to find out the hotline number have always been able to do so, and they do. Senator Faulkner also cited three instances where he said that security had been breached. In fact, for one of those cases, Senator Ellison said, `Yes, there was a serious breach of security procedures, and that breach in Customs should not have occurred.' You cannot be any more frank than that. The minister said it was a security breach that should not have occurred. But what he did assure you of was that a full investigation of that breach is under way and arrangements are being put in place nationally to further tighten access to Customs premises and facilities. When something like that does happen, and you admit that there was a breach of security procedures, the most important thing that can take place is for you to make sure it is fixed and does not happen again. Senator Ellison has already announced that arrangements are being put in place. He has also announced that there will be an independent review of security—the details are going to be announced very shortly—and that the AFP are receiving full cooperation from Customs in that investigation.
You get to the inaccuracies that are spread around in the media, partly fuelled by Senator Faulkner's comments. The inaccuracies in those reports include the fact that the servers contained thousands of confidential files. Where on earth anybody got that information from is beyond me and beyond the minister. That was suggested in media reports, but in fact it is simply not the case. Customs has also been advised that the servers did not contain any personal, business related or national security information. So it is important that you listen to the answers. As I said right at the start, when it comes to matters of national security the Australian public will decide who is in the best position to deliver that national security and protection to the Australian community, and they have decided three times already: it is the coalition government.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-09-08,"—Today we have seen the classic Sir Humphrey technique from the Minister for Justice and Customs when you are accountable for a major catastrophe—that is, set up an inquiry, say nothing and hope it all goes away. Let us recap the facts here, just from the Sydney Morning Herald report, none of which has been denied by the government: on the evening of 27 August two men, allegedly of Middle-Eastern appearance, dressed as computer technicians and carrying tool bags, entered the Customs cargo processing and intelligence centre in the Charles Ulm building at Sydney international airport. They presented themselves to the security desk as technicians sent by the outsourced contractors EDS, presumably with false ID—and certainly false names and signatures—and were permitted to enter the high security mainframe room. There they spent two hours unimpeded and uninterrupted. After they had satisfied themselves, they departed with two servers on a trolley, unchallenged—easy as pie.
We are now told that the security cameras were not working. Slowly but surely the facts start emerging, dripping out one by one. So the mystery continues. We now also know that the security guards at the desk were Customs officers, so we cannot blame a contractor. After nine days, the Sydney Morning Herald revealed the breach; 12 days after the breach, the minister ordered an inquiry. Why? He either does not know the answers after 12 days or is stalling for time. We are also told that separate investigations are being carried out by the Australian Federal Police—as one would expect after any break into Commonwealth property—and by the Defence Signals Directorate, the top electronic surveillance organisation in this country. 
This starts to smell a bit. This is much more than a simple break-in. This is clearly being treated as a major security breach whereby the integrity of the whole system is in jeopardy. Yet the minister plays it all down. There was nothing of security value stored on the stolen servers, he says. Another says they were only communication servers. The staff of Customs are reported as saying there was confidential information stored, and it is hard to imagine anything stored electronically in Customs not having some security element attached to it. The AFP and DSD are not there just to change the passwords. The thieves knew what they wanted, and it was not the Yellow Pages. They had two hours to download whatever they wanted and they took two servers containing the most valuable data to use for hacking into later on. This is a major lapse of security, and Customs and their minister have shown that they are the weakest link. 
Minister, by all means hold another inquiry, but you already have had 12 days with Australia's top sleuths on the job. Tell us now what you know. Tell us now what was downloaded in two hours. Tell us what other systems, including ASNET, have been compromised. Tell us what was on the stolen servers. Tell us who was responsible for security, including contractors, and the penalties for breach. Tell us whether it was an inside job. Tell us why the security cameras were not working. Tell us how two perfect strangers got in and tell us you know who they were. How good are the arrangements between Customs and EDS and how good is the system by which ID is given to EDS staff? If EDS have a separate security system for ID, how good is it? How good are the passes? What checks are made and what instructions were the Customs security staff given? Also tell us what this means for all Customs security, including the adequacy of training and processes for their security guards, access obtained to immigration detail from passport control, airport access data and processes, cargo clearance processes, freight manifest security, data and intelligence on narcotics control, information from overseas security agencies and records of current investigations. Most importantly, tell us what information was hacked from linkages to other Customs systems and other agencies.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2003-09-08,"—Mr Deputy President, you might need to help me here. I understand that the Labor Party is lecturing the Howard government on national security. I always love sermons and homilies from the Labor Party, in particular Senator Faulkner, on issues like national security and economic responsibility—
—Honesty.
—Honesty, that is right, and political morality and small business. I get a warm feeling when the Labor Party lectures the government on these sorts of issues. 
The context of this debate is that the Labor Party did not care whether Saddam Hussein stayed in power or not. That is the context and that is the history of this debate. On issues of national security, the Labor Party, and indeed the broad Left in this country, are a farce—in fact, an embarrassment. How can I forget Senator Brown advising the Prime Minister to fly to Baghdad and have a chat—morning tea, I think it was—with Saddam? I hate to misrepresent Senator Bartlett, but I am not sure what the Democrat policy was— 
—If you don't know what it was, don't make it up.
—I remember what it was: it was to workshop the issue and have a group hug. That is what it was. The Left has never understood national security nor tyranny nor totalitarianism. I am not saying Senator Ludwig is soft on terrorism; I am simply saying that the Left is naive. That has always been a problem of the Left with issues like this and it remains the problem. This debate has been brought on by the Labor Party while the Labor Party is split on the issue of fighting terrorism and on a commitment to, for example, removing Saddam Hussein from power. 
Let me briefly outline what the Labor Party did not do when they were in office. The Labor Party left us a very soft target. Labor underfunded our federal law enforcement and border protection agencies and the flow of drugs into Australia reached record levels under their administration. Of course, it has now come right back and the flow of heroin into this country is at an all-time low. Labor continue to demonstrate that they do not quite understand the challenges and needs of modern law enforcement. At the last election, the 2001 election, instead of guaranteeing more operational resources, what did the Labor Party do? They threatened to shackle police with more bureaucracy and administration and even more reviews. At a time when federal law enforcement and border protection should have been boosted, what did the Labor Party do? They cut staff numbers by more than 1,000 between 1990 and 1995 right across the Customs organisation. That was the Labor Party's record. 
Perhaps even more fundamentally, Labor's continued silence on the issue of border protection speaks volumes because it is hopelessly divided on the issue. You have the conservative part of the Labor Party saying, `We should perhaps adopt the government's policy holus-bolus,' and the Left of the party, the other half, saying, `Oh God, we can't do that; it's so unfair.' The Labor Party is split on issues of border protection. They have not even got a view to take to the Australian people on border protection or fighting terrorism. On issues like this the Labor Party are split and divided.
In contrast, the coalition have done this: we have initiated a whole series of legislative changes, improved security at air and sea ports, increased cargo examination rates, introduced new technologies and increased rates of surveillance by Coastwatch and the Customs National Marine Unit. The fundamental problem with the Labor Party on issues of national security is that they are a divided party, and until they can get their act together and come forward with some decent and workable policies to the Australian people they do not deserve to be elected.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>National Security</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-09-08,"—Today we heard three examples from Senator Faulkner of the Howard government's failure to protect national security, but now there is a fourth we can add. Three times in question time today the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, was asked what action he would take to investigate the leaking of top-secret national security information to a National Party senator. Twice Mr Howard equivocated in respect of the leaking of top-secret information to a National Party senator straight from the office of ONA; it was an ONA document. Section 79 of the Crimes Act describes the disclosure, possession or distribution of ONA information as a very serious offence. There is no doubt about that—it is a very serious offence. But it was not until Mr Howard was pressed for a third time that he acceded—`acceded' is perhaps the best word to use in respect of this matter—and said he should have ordered an investigation as soon as he became aware. He said he should have ordered it, not that when he became aware he did order it. After careful deliberation, he said that the matter would be investigated. It is not acceptable that the Prime Minister only agreed to consider investigating this matter following sustained questioning on the matter today. That is the fourth example we have heard today of the government's failure to protect national security.  
Another such example is found in the answers by Senator Ellison today. Despite the whole saga of the time lines and the dates Senator Ellison tries to muddy the water with, we find that Mr Abu Dahdah was under investigation, and questioned, by the Spanish authorities for about 13 months. But the Australian authorities had only started to act by 26 June, as we understand it. By 26 June they had started—or at least so Senator Ellison tells us—a process of questioning as to what was going on. It was not until 2 September that some material result came out of Senator Ellison's office. We then come to the actual request to be able to interview Abu Dahdah. 
This is a serious matter. It is not a matter you can easily put in your back pocket and ignore. The Australian Federal Police put out a press release justifying their position. They started a request through the DPP for mutual legal assistance with Spanish authorities concerning Abu Dahdah. The request was not made until 2 September 2003. So there is no sense of urgency coming from the Australian Federal Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney-General. 
A spirited defence was put forward by Senator Ellison on 6 September. Notwithstanding most of his answers, which said he could not talk about the issues because they were operational issues, on 6 September he goes into operational issues and tells us that two people are under surveillance by ASIO and the AFP. One of those is Bilal Khazal, who is also—we now find out—subject to an extradition bid by the Lebanese government for suspects to face terrorist attack charges. But we do not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon. 
So we have two problems. We want to be able to help with investigations into terrorism overseas. But we also want to talk to Abu Dahdah about the same character. Heaven help Senator Ellison if he lets the guy go without at least finding out from Abu Dahdah whether he has links, whether he has issues and whether he should be questioned in Australia before Senator Ellison concedes that he should be extradited to Lebanon. Given the problems he has had already, I would not be surprised. (Time expired)

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2003-09-08,"—As I was saying when I commenced my remarks in this debate on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002 earlier today, this legislation essentially amends the Sex Discrimination Act in three cases. The government's legislative response to the 12 recommendations of the original report—the report that was tabled some 50 months ago and that suggested amendments to the sex discrimination legislation—has been to act upon only three of them.  
We in the Senate are seen by the government and by some commentators as people who are obstructing the passage of legislation. That is what the government would have the population believe. My response is that you cannot pass that which is not put before you. It should not take 50 months. There is no doubt that this legislation, now it has been presented, will pass quite quickly. There can be no doubt that all of us would want to ensure that pregnancy never forms the grounds for discrimination. 
Initially the Prime Minister told us that work and family pressures were barbecue stoppers. Do you remember that? Even more recently, in regard to gay marriages, we got the extraordinary assertion about survival of the species. It would seem that we are all falling into line—or should I say into context?—with the Prime Minister's concern about the survival of the species—not in relation to gay marriages but in relation to the rights of the mother. None of us are against motherhood. Therefore this legislation will pass relatively quickly. That makes even more amazing the government's ponderous response to the original report.
You would think that, if there were concerns about the species and its survival, the government would want us to safeguard with legislation the rights of those who are pregnant. Yet here we have its inadequate response. It is 50 months since the report was tabled. Years after the famous work and family barbecue stopper statement first appeared, the conservatives managed to give us just three changes. It is clear that this government is not serious about the rights of pregnant women. A serious government would have responded in a more urgent manner. A serious government would have dealt more effectively with the issue of maternity leave, especially paid maternity leave.
The government is not serious about the rights of pregnant women at all. Nor is the Prime Minister serious about the survival of the species. Between June 1999, when the report was presented, and June 2003, a period of four years, an estimated one million babies were born in Australia. Given multiple births and other factors, this does not guarantee that there were a million pregnancies in that same period. However, the difference would not be very significant. What is significant is that none of these pregnancies had the legal protection that will be available once this bill is passed. None of these pregnancies had the legal protection the report recommended they should have had four long years ago. It does not matter how you view it, a million is a very big number. 
I know that senators opposite will say that Labor should have fixed this up, since we are now so concerned about protection for pregnant workers. But were we in government when the report was published? Indeed, were we in government when the report was commissioned? No. As was mentioned earlier by other senators, the member for Jagajaga did introduce a private member's bill with the same title as the bill that is now before us. She did so for the very reasons that are outlined by the government for the current bill—that is, to give effect to the recommendations of the report.
There you have it. The ALP can respond to a report by introducing a bill within nine months of the report being published, yet the government takes 17 months just to respond to the report, not to mention taking 50 months to get it to this place for debate. The government and the Prime Minister can run around the country crying their crocodile tears over work and family and the need to protect and value them. They can cry their crocodile tears over the survival of the species. But what they do not do is act. They do not act on their concern and they do not provide workers and their families with the protection that they need. 
What we get from this government is policy and legislation by inertia, moved by the forces of lethargy and sloth. That is just not good enough. By any reasonable measure, 50 months is far too long to wait for a response to this important report. I urge the Senate to support the opposition's amendments and then the ultimate passage of this legislation.",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-09-08,"—I rise to support the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002 as far as it goes. I do not support the legislation just because of its acronym—SDA, which is the acronym of a highly regarded organisation which I have had something to do with over the years. Incidentally, the shoppies union made a submission to the 1998 inquiry into pregnancy discrimination. I support the legislation because it does something to address the very real problems faced by women every day in the work force. This legislation would prevent medical information being used against pregnant women in a discriminatory manner, prevent recruiters asking questions about pregnancy or potential pregnancy, and outlaw discrimination against women who are breastfeeding.
This bill comes out of the work of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which, in 1998, undertook an inquiry into pregnancy and potential pregnancy discrimination at work. In 1999, the commission produced its report, Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant. The government responded to those recommendations in the year 2000.
In producing the report Pregnant and productive, the human rights commission did great work by uncovering and highlighting a large number of shocking examples of discrimination against women. Other stories have since been produced. One example of the fact of the situation was the case of media officer Jo Perkich at Crown Casino in Melbourne. She was made redundant three days after telling her employer that she was pregnant. Upon being told about the pregnancy, her employer `let out a long whistle and told me a few stories about single motherhood and how difficult it is to juggle career and motherhood financially'. Three days later she was told there was not enough work for her, even though the casino was due to open its main building in three months time. She was offered a two-month contract and seven months redundancy pay. But when the contract was cancelled, and she was faced with the burden of being an unemployed single mother, Ms Perkich felt that the only thing she could do was to have an abortion. No woman should be put in that position and certainly no child of a woman should be put in the situation where it is a question of being killed or of your mother having a job.
My second example is Michelle Hogan, who was working for her fiance. When she told him she was expecting their baby, he broke off the relationship and sacked her. She then sought other work through an employment agency where she was told, `If you want a job, go and get an abortion.' In desperation, she did so the next day. Again, a mother was told to choose between having employment and having a baby. Another example is of Joanne. When Joanne told her boss she was pregnant, she said straight out: `I'm not giving you maternity leave. You leave when you have your baby; you do not have a job to come back to.' She had worked for the company for 17 years. Finally, after almost taking it to arbitration, they gave her three months leave.
Another worker, Thu Anh Viet Tran, worked in the accounting department of a university for three years and had never received any negative feedback about her job performance and was even promoted. Yet when she told her employer that she was pregnant, she was told that her work performance had gone down and that she would be having a weekly review of her work and in a few months would find out whether or not she still had a job there. One month after disclosing her pregnancy she received a letter terminating her employment. She took it further and was awarded $30,000 for lost earnings by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. A further example is of a pregnant call centre worker who was forced to clock off for each toilet break she took. This was over a period of two months and led to a reduction in pay. She took the case to court and was awarded her lost earnings and she received an apology from her employer. 
The human rights commission made 46 recommendations in the Pregnant and productive report. The government has accepted 23 of those recommendations; three of the recommendations accepted are to be implemented in this bill before us. I am rather concerned that the government has chosen not to accept a number of the recommendations by the commission. For example, the government has refused to amend the Workplace Relations Act to extend unpaid maternity leave to casual employees who have been employed for over 12 months. We already know that a great many families face great hardship in making ends meet. You can imagine that a drop in pay from leaving a casual job to give birth can have a substantial impact on the family budget, whether there is another salary coming in or not. This recommendation would not oblige employers to pay a woman while she was on leave. What it would do would be to give a casual employee the assurance there would be a job for her at an appropriate time after she had given birth. Why wouldn't the government support such a measure? We are told time and time again that there are more workers this month than last month, but are we ever told of the break-up to show the number of casuals and part-time workers? I am concerned that in this case the government has not accepted that recommendation. 
Another recommendation rejected by the government was that the Department of Education, Science and Training produce material providing advice and assistance for managing pregnancy at school. I would be cautious about the form of that advice, but if we are talking about assisting young women who are pregnant to have their children and to continue their schooling I think that is a laudable aim. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that teenage births were 18 babies per 1,000 women in 2001, accounting for almost 12,000 teenage mums each year. The majority of those women are not married and are of school age so it is a significant issue. If we can help these young women to finish their schooling and, even better, to complete TAFE or university study, then they and their children will have a much better chance of a decent income.
Many senators would have seen the ABC documentary Plumpton High Babies about a high school in Sydney which supports single mums through their high school education. It was a difficult job for these women and, unfortunately, many of them could not manage. We need to provide such women with adequate support and resources so that they can manage to finish school. It is of significant benefit to them, but it is also a significant benefit to their children and society as a whole. In my view, this recommendation that the Department of Education, Science and Training take an interest in the area of young school-age mothers was certainly worth pursuing.
The government also failed to accept the recommendation that funding be provided to investigate various maternity leave options. The maternity leave debate has moved on since that recommendation, with the Sex Discrimination Commissioner putting up a maternity leave model for discussion. As I recall it, the Prime Minister has been noncommittal about the concept of a broader entitlement to maternity leave. But this is a very important issue, especially for lower income earners, who very much depend on two incomes for a fairly modest lifestyle. Taking time off work without pay could, for example, cut family income by 50 per cent. I think that the government should be supporting a program of maternity leave for all women, but especially for those in lower paid jobs. 
In its submission to the human rights commission inquiry, the SDA also highlighted the fact that many families experience financial difficulties as a result of pregnancy. It recommended that the government increase the level of family payments for low-income families, double the current maternity allowance payment and extend eligibility for the parenting allowance. Whilst I am somewhat concerned that the government has not gone further with some of the human rights commission's recommendations, I am happy to support implementation of the three contained in this bill.",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I also rise to speak on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002. The bill seeks to clarify several sections of the act that deal with the issues of pregnancy and work. In particular, it makes three amendments: firstly, to clarify that discrimination against breastfeeding women is a ground of sex discrimination; secondly, to clarify the legality or otherwise of questioning candidates about pregnancy or potential pregnancy during job interviews; and thirdly, to make clear the proper purposes of the use of information obtained in medical examinations.
In 1998 the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, gave a reference to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to enquire into matters relating to pregnancy and work. These three amendments that are contained within this bill today are the sum of the government's response to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report delivered in June 1999, entitled Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant. It is noteworthy that the government took some 17 months to deliver a response in November 2000. The government accepted approximately half of HREOC's recommendations and, of the 12 recommendations for amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, the government accepted only one-quarter. It is these amendments that are the substance of the bill we are debating here today. When the then sex discrimination commissioner, Susan Halliday, wrote the foreword for the report, she noted that it was 15 years since the Sex Discrimination Act was passed by this parliament. We are now rapidly approaching the 20th anniversary of this legislation.
I make these points because I think it is a very disappointing response from the government. It has been neither timely nor adequate. The government has made very clear that it is pleased that the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act is not expanded by the amendments that this bill makes. Yet the HREOC report found that there was much confusion and much work to be done in the area of pregnancy and work. The existence of legislation is, of course, no guarantee that women will no longer experience sex discrimination. Whilst discrimination and harassment on the grounds of pregnancy and potential pregnancy are grounds for complaint under the Sex Discrimination Act, the Pregnant and productive report found that workplace discrimination and harassment on these grounds remain real issues for many women, and that clarification of the act is needed in a number of areas. There is still significant ignorance and misunderstanding of antidiscrimination law in the Australian community. It is vital that the government takes a more proactive approach to ensure that the rights and responsibilities of women and their employers are known and respected. 
In recent times there have been several high-profile cases of discrimination against pregnant women. In 2001 the All Australia Netball Association decided that women who were pregnant could no longer play in their competitions. At this time, Adelaide Ravens netball player and one of my constituents, Trudy Gardner, was pregnant and was banned from playing in the National Netball League. She subsequently lodged a complaint of sex discrimination with the federal Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and gained an injunction to allow her to continue to play, pending the outcome of her complaint. The complaint was then referred to the Federal Magistrates Court and, in March of this year, the court found that Netball Australia discriminated against Ms Gardner by banning her from playing three games in the 2001 season. The ban was found to have contravened the Sex Discrimination Act.
The initial Netball Australia decision was purportedly made on the basis of fears about the safety of playing netball while pregnant. The right of the unborn child to litigate also played no small part in it. Additional reasons cited by Netball Australia included fear of pregnancy related injuries and the inadequacy of sports injury insurance to cover these. These reasons are fairly typical of those repeatedly trotted out to undermine antidiscrimination law. These reasons create a moral panic about hard cases which are in fact significant exemptions. They attach priority to other bodies of law that may conflict with the Sex Discrimination Act, such as overseas precedents—for example, those that have arisen in the United States. Above all, they invoke so-called medical reasons with little basis in fact.
The Australian Labor Party created the Sex Discrimination Act, and it remains one of the great legacies of former Labor governments. In an address on the 10th anniversary of the Sex Discrimination Act in Sydney on 29 July 1994, almost 10 years ago now, then Prime Minister Paul Keating said:
The Act's underlying purpose was and remains very simple: to end discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy, and to promote community respect for the principle of the equality of men and women.
It is this underlying principle which I believe has been constantly and consistently undermined by this government and its disturbingly inequitable family policies. Whilst Labor will support them, the amendments to this act that have been introduced are, in the context of the HREOC report I referred to, a very small step. This is why Labor seeks to amend this bill to extend it so that it can adequately address some of the key concerns of the HREOC report.
Labor's amendments would, firstly, empower HREOC to publish enforceable standards in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy; secondly, extend coverage to unpaid workers; thirdly, remove the exemption for employment by an instrumentality of a state from the Sex Discrimination Act; fourthly, remove the exemption in relation to pregnancy and potential pregnancy for educational institutions established for religious purposes; fifthly, allow punitive damages to be awarded; sixthly, allow the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory awards or agreements to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission without the requirement to receive a written complaint; seventhly, clarify that a complaint about a discriminatory advertisement may be made by any person; and, finally, extend the antidiscrimination provisions to employees who are in the process of adopting a child. The fact that the government has left out such important recommendations of the HREOC report shows the extent to which the government has carefully picked and chosen its amendments. This government has not even delivered the bare minimum to ensure that the Sex Discrimination Act offers protection to all Australians regardless of their circumstances. 
The act, however, cannot be effective in isolation. It must be backed up, and complemented by, government policy that supports fathers as primary carers and women as workers, and all the diversity that we see in Australian families today. This is no easy task for many families who struggle against a government with a very limited view of who should qualify for support and how. The current government has moved even further away from the small-l liberal origins that its name suggests. On work and family the government's policies have become so narrow as to be tools not of social progression but of social engineering. The government's record on supporting families is, quite frankly, appalling. In all of its policies, the government's preference for single-income families and the assumption that the caring parent is a woman is ubiquitous. Its welfare and tax policies overwhelmingly attempt to mould Australian families into the idealised image held by the Prime Minister.
The baby bonus was unveiled as a centrepiece of the government's work and family policy in the lead-up to the 2001 federal election. So long as the baby bonus remains at the centre of the government's family policy, it is a very hollow policy indeed. The baby bonus offers the greatest levels of assistance to those who need it the least. It is a scheme which defies notions not only of equity but also of justice. On average, the baby bonus delivers just $10 a week to a family on an average income, on the condition that one parent remain outside the work force for five years.
The Australian Labor Party, by contrast, is committed to introducing a scheme of paid maternity leave to assist in balancing work and family life. Labor is also committed to a paid maternity leave scheme that is flexible enough to shift the burden of care from women. It has been shown that paid maternity leave encourages women to participate in the labour force and promotes their economic security by enabling them to retain skills and expertise and maintain income. A national paid maternity leave scheme would go some way towards addressing the male-female wage disadvantage and compensate for the period of childbirth and the time shortly afterwards when women take time off work or reduce their labour force activity.
Australia is one of the few countries in the world where paid maternity leave is left up to separate enterprise bargaining or workplace agreements. What we need as a society is to legislate to extend this to all families, not just those with the bargaining power to demand it from their employers. Labor's policy of paid maternity leave, unlike the government's dearth of policy making in the area, will assist in the creation of family-friendly workplaces.
The HREOC report I have been referring to, Pregnant and productive, pointed out that the terms of reference for the inquiry did not extend to post-pregnancy issues. This was significant because many of the submissions HREOC received advocated that the issue should be looked at as a continuum—that is, without the artificial divide between pregnancy and post-pregnancy, particularly in relation to workplace discrimination. Many of the submissions received indicated that most difficulties are experienced by women after the birth of the child, whilst they are still on leave, and on their return to work. It is at this juncture that opportunistic or inadequately informed employers may take the opportunity to terminate the woman's employment, significantly alter it or even make her position redundant. 
Recently the media reported on the case of Anne-Marie, a Telstra employee of nine years standing, who was made redundant on her return from maternity leave. It was reported that her manager had told her that she would be better able to look after sick kids if she took the redundancy and that her skills had dropped off while she was on maternity leave. It is these kinds of attitudes which pervade many Australian workplaces. Some women take their complaints to their unions, some to the Industrial Relations Commission and some to HREOC. Others, however, are unaware of their rights, or they simply accept discrimination against potential pregnancy, pregnancy or post pregnancy. Most women, in fact, accept that having children will be a major hindrance to their career, many putting off having children indefinitely because of the inflexibility of workplaces that are simply unable to adjust to the realities of family life.
In one study a significant 54 per cent of women believed that their careers had been affected by taking maternity leave. Many others say that their salaries have stalled and that their careers have taken a backwards step. Some women have even considered that they sacrificed their careers when they gave birth. I will quote from the Women's Electoral Lobby submission to the Pregnant and productive report. It states:
Of great concern ... is the acceptance by a considerable number of women of the discrimination that they experience. It appears that they accept that pregnancy is a personal choice and you can't have your cake and eat it too. This clearly indicates that there is a need for public education about what women's rights are when they are pregnant. It is a sad reflection of women's status in Australian society that so many women are prepared to accept this discrimination as part of life.
The government's grudging amendments to this act are simply not good enough. What is required is a genuine commitment to policy that will help to effect changes in community attitudes by recognising that with the right support both men and women can be effective parents and workers. The logical follow-on to this is that discrimination because of pregnancy or potential pregnancy is not only illegal but also illogical. It is my belief that this is one of the great challenges of feminism today. We have, broadly speaking, legislation which seeks to counter sex discrimination in the workplace. What we do not have is a commitment from the government to lead the genuine social change.",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-09-08,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this debate on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002. What we have in the Senate today is a bill which will clarify a number of provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. These provisions deal with the protection of women from discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy, potential pregnancy or breastfeeding. The bill fulfils the government's commitment to address areas of confusion regarding the scope and operation of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 which were identified by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its report entitled Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant.
The amendments to the act put forward in this bill will clarify the operation of the provisions of the act relating to the asking of questions about pregnancy or potential pregnancy during job interviews and the use of pregnancy related medical information. This bill will also amend the act to explicitly recognise breastfeeding as a potential ground of unlawful discrimination. The amendments will clarify the obligations of employers in respect of these issues but will avoid imposing onerous burdens on employers which might lead to disincentives to employ women. The amendments will not only help to prevent discrimination against employees but also assist employers to understand laws that impact on their businesses. 
There have been a number of comments in relation to this bill. Firstly, I wish to refer to the question of any delay in responding to the report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Speakers from the opposition, the Greens and the Democrats have referred to delays in the government's response to the HREOC report. For the record, I will say that there have been no undue delays in democratic processes. The Attorney-General requested HREOC to undertake an inquiry into matters relating to pregnancy and work in August 1998. The report was provided to the Attorney-General close to a year later and launched by him in August 1999.
The recommendations in the HREOC report Pregnant and productive are wide ranging and do not just include legislative amendments but refer extensively to measures focusing on education, guidance and awareness raising. The government's predecessor to this bill before the Senate today was first introduced into parliament in September 2001 but lapsed with the proroguing of parliament at that time. It was reintroduced in February 2002. The process of democracy sometimes takes time. The bill passed the other place in February this year and was introduced into this chamber in March with no delay. In the meantime, the HREOC issued Pregnancy guidelines in April 2001, and the complementary booklet Working your way through pregnancy was distributed by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in April 2002. So a good deal of action was undertaken in anticipation of this proposed legislation. The government therefore rejects any question of delay in responding to the HREOC report.
I note that there are a couple of second reading amendments. Firstly, I refer to that foreshadowed by the Greens. Senator Nettle's foreshadowed second reading amendment states:
... the Senate condemns the Howard Government's Baby Bonus, which is an inequitable payment that does nothing to assist parents to maintain their attachment to the workforce, and calls on the Government to abolish the scheme and redirect the funds to a national scheme of paid leave for parents of newborns and adopted children.
The baby bonus complements a range of measures that the government has in place to assist families. It was introduced in response to the government's recognition that families may need further assistance at the time that they have their first child. This is a time, of course, when many families experience for the first time a reduction in their income. The baby bonus provides for a tax break of up to $2,500 a year each year for a maximum of five years. Mothers who have a child on or after 1 July 2001 are eligible to receive the bonus. This is practical, direct assistance to the cost of raising children. With three children under the age of four, I can only acknowledge this as a very good measure.
It provides a tax offset based on the amount of tax paid by parents before they have the child. This is important. Those parents who have paid a large amount of tax before they have a child are therefore potentially able to claim back more tax. The baby bonus, however, includes a guaranteed $500 annual payment for parents with incomes of $25,000 or less to ensure that low-income families benefit from the measure. This is a measure which has been welcomed. It is one of a range of measures, as I have said, which assist families in this country. It is a positive step and is not one which deserves condemnation. The government, therefore, will oppose the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Nettle for the reasons I have mentioned and others which I will not go into now for the sake of brevity. 
Senator Ludwig's amendment on behalf of the opposition calls on the government to:
 ... support all the legislative amendments and other actions necessary to give effect to the recommendations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its report Pregnant and Productive: It's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant
The government has already provided its response to the recommendations of HREOC. Many of the recommendations in the HREOC report focus on education, guidance and awareness raising. The government considers the most effective means of promoting and protecting the rights of individuals is by means of education and dissemination of information, and it has taken a number of steps to do just that—for example, the Pregnancy guidelines produced by HREOC and the complimentary booklet which I mentioned earlier produced by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations with input from the Attorney-General's Department and the Office of the Status of Women. The government is implementing a number of HREOC recommendations which suggest clarification of the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act. The government considers, however, other recommendations in the HREOC report are unnecessary, as other legislation adequately covers the issues raised. For example, the Workplace Relations Act and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act already provide a number of avenues for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to remedy or vary unfair awards. So for these reasons we believe that the amendment sought by Senator Ludwig on behalf of the opposition is redundant and, like Senator Nettle's amendment, will not have the support of the government.
This is a very important bill and a very worthwhile bill, especially in achieving equity for women and women who have children. I note that there are a number of amendments scheduled to be moved at the committee stage. I do not believe now is the appropriate time to address those. I will deal with each of those in turn during the committee stage. I commend the bill to the Senate.

At the end of the motion, add “and the Senate condemns the Howard Government's Baby Bonus, which is an inequitable payment that does nothing to assist parents to maintain their attachment to the workforce, and calls on the Government to abolish the scheme and redirect the funds into policies that assist families to balance their work and family responsibilities, including paid parental leave”.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-08,"—When the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003 went through the House of Representatives with unnecessary haste in the dying days of the winter sittings Labor indicated that we did not support this bill because of its breadth and its intent. The government wanted to prevent the courts from ordering interlocutory release of people in detention. This is despite the fact that there are very few cases where these interim orders have been granted—and when they have been granted there are very stringent reporting conditions on those released—and this has happened only when credible arguments have been made that the detention has become unlawfully punitive detention. 
This bill, as presented to the House, was an unnecessary restriction on the courts in circumstances where the courts had hardly ever used these powers anyway. Labor did flag at the time that we would be prepared to negotiate with the government a proposal to ensure that criminal deportees and those who have had their visas cancelled on character grounds—section 200 and section 501 persons—were not able to be released on an interim basis. Since that time, Labor have successfully convinced the government to drop its plans in the original bill. Our view has triumphed: the bill in its original form, preventing interlocutory court decisions against all people in detention, was neither fair nor just. We have now come to a negotiated position where people who are in detention under section 200, because of criminal offences or security risks, or people who have had their visas cancelled under the section 501 character test cannot be released at an interlocutory stage by the courts and must wait for final determination. The government has provided examples of the nature of people being held in detention on these grounds, particularly under section 200, and has persuaded us that there are legitimate security and public safety risks which demand a final court determination before release. With the government's amendments moved tonight in the Senate, this will be the full extent of the bill.
Others who are in detention, such as asylum seekers, children and even failed asylum seekers who may have been in immigration detention for extended periods, will continue to be able to apply to the courts for release and the courts will continue to be able to grant interlocutory relief—that is, interim release—pending the final outcome of their cases. Despite our capacity to successfully negotiate on this point, there remain a number of serious concerns of contention between Labor and the government in this area. In the House, Labor moved an amendment to this bill calling for the government to act immediately to remove all children and their families from behind high-security detention fences and razor wire. The government used its numbers to defeat Labor's second reading amendment. Labor remains committed to this fight to ensure children are urgently moved out of detention and is pleased that this small step, which allows a court to make an interim order for the release of children, has been retained. It is not nearly enough, but Labor will fight each step of the way.
In this context, and given the last few months, the issue of children in detention requires more discussion. Since the end of the last parliamentary sitting, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, has appealed a decision by the Family Court to the High Court, arguing that the Family Court should not have the power to make orders to release children from detention on the basis of the welfare of the children. That jurisdictional question is yet to be heard by the High Court, but the minister is arguing it all the way. In the mean time, the Family Court substantive hearing has occurred and the five children have been released. However, this only happened after the Family Court, in an earlier hearing, rejected an application for interim release. In fact the outcome of this case before the Family Court actually supports the position that Labor has taken in relation to this piece of legislation before us this evening. The fact that the court did not order interim release, or was very cautious about so doing, strengthens Labor's views that the court can be trusted to make such orders only in very limited and carefully assessed circumstances. So why should we tie the court's hands on this? If the minister had his way the Family Court, or any other court, would have absolutely no jurisdiction to make this interim order. In fact the minister thinks the Family Court should have no jurisdiction in these matters, full stop—and he is going to argue that in the coming months in the High Court. The minister would have us believe that the Family Court is such an irresponsible body that it cannot be trusted with making decisions about children who are under the minister's care in detention centres.  
The court has shown itself to be a responsible, considered and highly credible institution, capable of making sensible decisions. The court will, in its deliberations, take into consideration all the relevant facts and come to a decision that it is able to justify in a public and transparent way. It is important to note that the Family Court judge who rejected the initial interim order for release, Justice Strickland, did find that, although in this case he did not believe the children's best interests would be served by temporary release, he did believe there was a case that their continued detention was unlawful. The minister's paranoia about court interventions and interlocutory orders has been shown to be unfounded. This supports Labor's position that courts should not be stripped of the power to intervene in cases where there are justifiable reasons for their intervention and that, where appropriate, courts are able to make sensible and justifiable decisions for interim release of people within detention. It also highlights the minister's unreasonable stance of detaining children at all costs in all circumstances. In fact he seems to be the only person left in Australia who believes that the detention, let alone long-term detention, of children is a good idea.
Labor is fundamentally fearful for the wellbeing of the growing numbers of children who have been in detention for long periods of time. As of 11 August, there were 108 children in Australian detention facilities, including 14 on Christmas Island, and 118 children in detention on Nauru. The vast majority of these children are in high-security detention behind razor wire or electric fences, with only seven such children in the much vaunted but highly undersubscribed alternative detention centre in Woomera. Because the government insists on effectively holding the fathers and older male children hostage in high-security detention now in Baxter, and only allowing mothers and children out into the alternative low-security housing program in Woomera many miles away, very few families have chosen to take up this option. They cite the problems associated with the 2½-hour drive between the Woomera housing project and the closest detention centre, which is Baxter, as one of the main reasons for not wanting to use this option. For many of the families in even more remote detention facilities such as Port Hedland, Maribyrnong or Villawood, why would they choose to send the mother and children to the desert of Woomera while leaving the father and the older male children hundreds or even thousands of kilometres behind with absolutely no chance of seeing the rest of their family even on short visits? 
The whole model is based on a complete lack of evidence that every father or older male child in immigration detention is a security or flight risk and a fallacy that the family bond of people in detention is any weaker than that of other families in Australia. This is why Labor has been arguing for children and their families to be released from high-security detention, where there is no security risk involved, for the sake of the family unit as a whole as well as the sake of children whose future health and wellbeing are being destroyed every minute longer they stay in the inappropriate environment of detention centres built for adults. 
By its very nature, this bill demonstrates how inappropriate detention centres are for children by reminding us of the fact that there are people convicted of criminal offences and people of significant security and character risk within these facilities—the very same facilities that are holding innocent children and teenagers. Our position on the bill was informed by our knowledge that there are some people who have been detained for very long periods indeed, sometimes three, four, five or more years. There is a legitimate argument for some of those people that their detention has become punitive rather than related to their immigration status and for whom an appeal for an interlocutory order for release while their substantive claim is still being processed is warranted. 
I am not sure how many people in the Senate or in the general community can comprehend the effect of detention of four or five years on a young child. Some of these children have learnt how to walk, how to talk, how to read and how to play all behind razor wire. Usually they are in the company of loving parents and other family members, but sometimes they are being cared for by people who have been so traumatised by events in their home country and during their journey to Australia that they are extremely distressed, often depressed and sometimes almost dysfunctional with grief and despair at their fate on arrival here.
While Minister Ruddock has made various noises about the needs and interests of innocent children in detention, we have yet to see much more than platitudes on this issue. The minister has the power today and tomorrow—he has had it over the last five years since the large numbers of boat arrivals began—to develop a practical and realistic alternative detention model that acknowledges that high-security detention is not appropriate for the children arriving with their families. We cannot keep waiting.
In fact, only today Senator Allison spoke in this chamber about the minister's lack of action despite his making grand public statements in December last year on the issue of pursuing alternative detention models for children in immigration detention. We now have only a largely defunct alternative model based at Woomera, despite the fact that the Woomera detention centre has been closed for nearly 12 months and a clear message from families in detention that they are not prepared to enter this facility because of the high price of family separation that it requires. The only families who are still using it seem to be those who believe the only alternative of going back into high-security detention is so untenable that they are prepared to put up with the high cost of potentially permanent separation.
In a civilised Western democracy, we would all agree that detaining someone and depriving them of their liberty is probably the biggest, most significant policy decision that the state—the government—can take against any individual in our society. It would be highly inappropriate to sanction a course of conduct whereby we would wholly rob the court of the jurisdiction to make the determination that someone's detention had become unlawful and put us in a position where people could literally be detained for a lifetime—certainly for some of these children it is their lifetime—and have absolutely no means of having that addressed anywhere. 
Under the original form of the bill, it could well have ended up being law that an unaccompanied minor who came here as an unlawful noncitizen at the age of four could still be in detention at the age of 84 because they had nowhere they could go to agitate the case that their detention had moved from being detention under the Migration Act to unlawful punitive detention. That would not be the hallmark of a society with the kinds of values that our society has. Thankfully we have been able to obtain amendments which have been included in the government bill. Labor can now support this bill and ensure that those people who should rightly be given the opportunity to apply for interlocutory orders will be able to do so and those whom we clearly do not think should be easily released into the community are kept in detention until a court finally determines that they should be released or they are returned home.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DURATION OF DETENTION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-09-08,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003. I have spoken before about the interesting language the government uses to describe some of its legislation. This bill is about ensuring that people in detention continue to have no idea of what the duration of their detention may be. Certainly, the bill as it stands is completely unacceptable to the Australian Democrats. I note what has been said and what has been circulated by way of government amendment, and we are pleased that it significantly reduces the scope of people who will be affected by the content of this legislation. Nonetheless, we do have concerns with the principle underlying the legislation. 
There has been a lot of comment, mainly relating to the jurisdiction of the migration area but not solely confined to that, about this government's attempts—particularly this government's—to remove the authority and the jurisdiction of the courts from a range of areas. This trend, if you like, started under the previous Labor government and, of course, the whole mandatory detention regime was put in place by the previous Labor government. As with a few other areas that the Democrats have significant problems with, the coalition government has built on and expanded on the initial precedents and principles that were put in place by the previous Labor government, allowing these sorts of approaches to be taken which attempt to legislate away basic things such as the rule of law and judicial oversight over basic human rights.
The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives said that the additional subsections contained in this legislation are there to clarify the parliament's intention. I was not around when section 196(3) of the current act was put in place, so I cannot really speak for what the parliament's intention was back then, but I hope that the parliament, and particularly the Senate, takes this opportunity to make clear what its intention is now. I believe our intention as a parliament, as a Senate and as people who should be here to uphold the rule of law and the separation of powers between the executive, the parliament and the courts should be to reaffirm the principle that the courts need some ability to have jurisdiction when they are making decisions—interlocutory injunctions, to use a technical term—as to whether people should be kept imprisoned, which is in effect what detention is, while the court is making its decision. It is not uncommon—in fact it is very common—when there are any judicial proceedings on any number of matters for courts to consider whether somebody that is incarcerated should remain incarcerated while the court makes its decision. 
Senator Sherry highlighted the recent case of some children who were released by order of the full bench of the Family Court, even though that matter is, I believe, now going to be the subject of an appeal to the High Court. Basically what it would mean if this bill were to pass as it stands is that any person whom the courts believe should be released from migration detention would nonetheless be required to stay in that detention whilst the government appealed it through every possible avenue. Without going into great detail about why it takes a long time for any sort of appeal to go through every possible avenue, the fact is that it can be and often is a long period of time. The government makes a lot of noise about how immigration applicants, particularly refugee or protection visa applicants, are tying up the courts and the High Court and slowing everything up. At the same time it is this government and, unfortunately, I would have to say, without breaching whatever standing order it is that reflects on a decision of the Senate, the Senate—which has from time to time agreed to allow amendments to legislation that have restricted avenues of appeal and that have forced appeals to go directly to the High Court and then be remitted downwards and often then to come back upwards again—that cause a lot of the legal logjam. To then turn around and say, `We should be able to keep people in detention for as long as it takes to get through every step of that process,' simply compounds the error that has been made in the past.
We are talking about detention, and we can do our little bit of sophistry about whether detention equals imprisonment or jailing or whatever, but the fact is that for these people who are detained it really does not matter whether they are in the jail or whether they are in the detention centre they are imprisoned, they are denied freedom, and that is basically what it is all about. Senator Sherry spoke a lot about razor wire and high-security detention, and it was appropriate for him to do so, but of course there are people who are deemed to be in detention who are not behind razor wire. As some senators would know, I have recently been to one of the two camps on Nauru which contains still over 350 people. They do not have razor wire around them. Certainly the one I went to, the larger one, does not have razor wire around it. It has a very small chain fence that would be easy to get through and a front gate that is not even closable, but obviously with security on the front. Whilst razor wire and the like add to the impression of imprisonment, the bigger problem is the lack of freedom. When I was on Nauru some of the staff that worked at the facility said to me—quite clearly there are a lot of problems with the facilities at Nauru, do not get me wrong—`We could be putting these people up in Club Med and the same stresses, depression, mental illnesses, anxiety and suffering would occur.' It is the lack of freedom that is the clear problem for these people.
Quite frankly, I have a great problem with any piece of legislation that seeks to interfere with the jurisdiction of the courts to determine whether or not people should be free. I think lawmakers, which is what we are, can occasionally underestimate the significance of denying people their freedom. We approach it totally punitively—as payback or as punishment that people require or deserve. Firstly, it always needs to be reiterated that most of the people in immigration detention have not been convicted of anything—indeed, they have not been charged with anything—but, secondly, they have their freedom denied. Most of the people in immigration detention in Australia at the moment have had their freedom denied for a very long time—one year, two years or three years, as Senator Sherry said. Some children have been born in detention centres and others have been in detention centres from a very early age. Spending their formative years in that environment cannot be anything other than damaging to those children. There is an overwhelming weight of evidence that highlights that it is damaging to children to be in that sort of environment for any length of time throughout that childhood phase, yet that is what continually and automatically occurs under our law as it stands. To introduce another law that in any way proposes to increase the chances of children being imprisoned for longer is unacceptable in my view and in the view of the Democrats. 
However, as has been mentioned, amendments to this legislation will reduce the scope of the power the government is attempting to get through this legislation. That is welcomed by the Democrats but is not sufficient in our view. We believe any removal of the jurisdiction of the courts to determine whether or not people should be imprisoned for longer is inappropriate. Imprisonment is a big thing. To remove the ability of courts to determine whether people should stay in that imprisonment I believe is inappropriate. When the amendments are moved in the committee stage, I will highlight some examples of why I think it is still inappropriate even with the reduced scope. But, for the purposes of this particular part of the legislative process, I simply indicate that the Democrats are fundamentally opposed to this legislation and are committed to trying to reduce the length of time that people are in detention, particularly younger people.
As Senator Sherry also pointed out, there are over 100 children—that is, people under the age of 18—detained on Nauru. Senator Sherry said 118. I did not think it was that many, but certainly it is over 100. Fourteen of those children—most under the age of 10 and some under the age of five—have fathers here in Australia on refugee visas. There are nine fathers with 14 kids on Nauru, and all of those fathers have been in Australia for over three years. Their children and their spouses have been in detention offshore—on Christmas Island, on Manus Island and now on Nauru—for nearly two years. As a direct and deliberate result of the temporary visa policy of this government which came into play with the support of the ALP, those children remain separated from their fathers. It was Fathers Day here over the weekend—yesterday, I think.
—Yesterday.
—Without suggesting that Fathers Day is an inherent custom of Iraqi or Afghani children, nonetheless Fathers Day is about celebrating family, about celebrating bonds between fathers and their kids. Most of the kids I met when I was on Nauru remain separated from their fathers, their fathers who have been here now for over three years. I do not care whatever else the government believes it is achieving with its policies to do with unauthorised arrivals, but any policy that leads to young children being separated from their parents or that leads to spouses being deliberately separated for such long periods of time cannot be justified. Find another way to do what you have to do, but if you are going to damage those kids so much in the process then it cannot be acceptable in my view. I would make the plea, even though it is slightly tangential to this legislation, that the government once again look at ways of bringing those families together other than by forcing all of them to reunite back in the very place where the persecution from which they fled occurred. It has to be emphasised that the people on Nauru do not come under the jurisdiction of this legislation or any legislation in Australia. Of course that is why they have been taken to Nauru—so they are outside any jurisdiction—but the problem of long-term detention and the principle of courts having the final say over whether or not people should continue to be imprisoned remain. That is the principle the Democrats support and that is why we will not support this legislation. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DURATION OF DETENTION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-09-08,"—One Nation supports the efficient and effective removal of unlawful non-citizens from Australia. One Nation supports the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003. The bill will ensure that a person in an immigration detention centre cannot be released on the basis of ongoing court proceedings and the possible outcomes of those proceedings. All unlawful non-citizens in Australia must be detained and, unless granted permission to remain in the country through the grant of a visa, they must be removed as soon as practicable.
This mandatory detention policy was set into legislation with bipartisan support in 1992 and endorsed through a major parliamentary inquiry in 1994. Mandatory detention applies to visa overstayers as well as unauthorised arrivals. However, people who arrive illegally or who overstay their visas can apply for refugee status or for a bridging visa. The Migration Act 1958 includes section 196, which provides: 
(1) An unlawful non-citizen ... must be kept in immigration detention until he or she is:
(a) removed from Australia ... 
(b) deported ... or
(c) granted a visa.
The intention of section 196 was to make it clear that there would be no discretion for any person or court to release from detention an unlawful non-citizen who is lawfully being held in an immigration centre.
In the recent past, the Federal Court has ordered the release of several migration detainees and their release has been argued on the basis of subsection 196(3). There is nothing in the section which expressly or implicitly prevents the full Federal Court from ordering the release on an interlocutory basis of a person who establishes that there is a serious question to be tried regarding the lawfulness of that person's detention.
I want to place very clearly on the record what the interlocutory basis is. It is where the respective lawyers for the parties provide each other with the issues relating to what is being repealed. It can take a considerable time for the legal representatives of both parties to eventually come to a point where the situations that they do not agree on are clearly definable. That is what the interlocutory process is. So resolving the question and establishing whether a person may stay in Australia is a lengthy and protracted process. The average time for a migration case is up to 540 days. A person may be released into the community for a year and a half under an interlocutory order and all the while there is a cloud over whether that person's character may be of some concern.
This is problematic. For example, a person's visa is cancelled and they go to an immigration detention centre. They are to be permanently excluded from Australia. However, under the loophole in subsection 196(3), they have the right to appeal the cancellation of the visa and drag it out for a year and a half through the courts. But the court is saying, `Let them back into the community while the interlocutory process occurs.' This raises a very important issue of character concerns. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, stated in his second reading speech: 
... it is essential that the government can determine whether a non-citizen of character concern should be in the Australian community or should be removed from Australia. Without the amendments in this bill, persons of significant character concern may continue to be released into the community until the court finally determines their application. This situation may continue for several months, and it is most undesirable.
So what are the character concerns? Let me detail some information about persons of significant character concern.
Section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 includes a character test to make certain that visa applicants—that is, people seeking to migrate to Australia—and visa holders are of acceptable character. The onus is on visa applicants and holders already in our country to prove that they are of good character. Here are some examples of people who would fail the character test: a person with a significant criminal record; a person who has been incarcerated for 12 months or longer or sentenced to death or life imprisonment; a person sentenced to two or more terms of imprisonment, whether on one or more occasions, where the total of those terms is two years or more; a person acquitted of an offence due to unsound mind or insanity; and, lastly, a person who is likely to engage in criminal conduct, harass, molest, intimidate or stalk another person in Australia, vilify a segment of the Australian community or incite discord in the Australian community or in a segment of that community. These are the sorts of people that could be released by the courts based on interlocutory orders. It is quite obvious that the legal loophole must be closed. The minister has noted that since mid-2002 there have been more than 20 persons released on an interlocutory basis—more than 10 of these have involved persons who were of character concern, including persons with convictions for offences such as rape, armed robbery and drug trafficking. These people while they are released into our community are a threat to the public and to Australia's security.
We have heard a lot from the opposition and some sections of the media about detention centres. Let me put on the record that the people in detention centres are there because they are appealing the decisions of the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal. These are people who have been determined to be here illegally in Australia. If they were to accept the decision of the arbiter and voluntarily leave Australia, they would not be in detention. So the fact that they are in detention is a wilful decision of their own making. It is not society saying, `We want to lock you up.' Those people themselves are making a conscious decision to access the appeals sections of our criminal process. They go to the Federal Court and the full Federal Court and then they can go up the ladder to the High Court, and they do, and should, stay in detention throughout this period.
These systematic court proceedings are waged at a horrendous cost to the Crown—and that is to you and me, the Australian people. The Australian National Audit Office report No. 32 of 1997-98, Performance audit: the management of boat people, gives an indication of what these costs might be. At page 116 it states:
The highest expected cost occurs for a person whose case goes through all the processes in the refugee determination system up to and including the High Court. For such a case, the expected cost is $270,000 per person.
This is the cost we incur because a person who has been determined to be here illegally then decides to access the full appeal process. This cost is borne by the Australian people, and for every one of those people there is $270,000 that is not going into our health system, that is not going into our schools and that is not going into facilities for the Australian people. This is a travesty and this is why One Nation definitely supports the government's process. If we were to turn around and do the reverse, then there is absolutely no disincentive for any person not to go through the appeal process. When you consider the cost to the Australian people, that is not acceptable. The costs are quite significant, and so too is the length of time that it takes for a case to be progressed. As I said earlier, it is in excess of 540 days. 
In 1999-2000 an average case took 197 days in the Federal Court. I am not saying that they were in the court for 197 days. I am saying that it took 197 days for the process to proceed. If it were appealed to the full Federal Court, that took an additional 149 days. If they then went on to the High Court and accessed the appeals process, it took a further 189 days. So in 1999-2000 the average period was 535 days. In 2001 it dropped slightly to 169 days. But again in 2002, when more than 20-odd people accessed this process, we were back up to 149 days in the Federal Court, 156 days in the full Federal Court—that is the appeal court—and then 245 days for the appeal to be processed by the High Court, a total of 550 days. This year, 2003, that average is standing at 540 days, and this is unacceptable. These are people who have been through the courts and initially through the assessment process and deemed not to be suitable, or not eligible, to stay within Australia.
I note Labor's proposal for a special committee to review the asylum claims. This would add yet another layer of appeal with more delays and additional cost to the taxpayer. One Nation opposes that scheme. One Nation believes that unlawful noncitizens must have their status resolved before being released into the community. Persons in detention must not be released on an interlocutory basis until their legal appeals are finalised and all necessary documentation is completed. If their claim is found to be lawful and they are allowed into Australia and are not subject to the Migration Act's detention provisions, then we wish them well.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DURATION OF DETENTION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2003-09-08,"—When the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003 went through the House of Representatives with great haste in the final days of the last sitting session, Labor indicated that we would not support the bill because of its scope and purpose. The effect of the bill in its original form was to prevent the courts from ordering the interlocutory release of people in detention. This was despite the fact that there are very few cases where these interim orders have been granted. Where they have been granted, there are usually very stringent reporting conditions on those who are released. It is only when credible arguments have been made that the detention has become unlawful, punitive detention.
When this bill was presented to the House of Representatives, it was an unnecessary restriction on the power of the courts in circumstances where the courts very rarely used the powers in any event. Labor indicated at the time that we would be prepared to negotiate with the government—to negotiate a proposal to ensure that criminal deportees and those who had had their visas cancelled on character grounds under section 200 and section 501 were not able to be released on an interim basis. We were happy to support that as a compromise. Since that time, Labor have successfully convinced the government to withdraw the plans in its original bill, and we now have before us the bill that we are debating here this evening. 
As a consequence, Labor's view triumphed. As I said, in its original form the bill would have prevented interlocutory court decisions against all people in detention, which we saw as neither fair nor just. It appears that the government has now accepted that position. A negotiated position has been reached so that people who are in detention under section 200 because of criminal offences, because there is a security risk or because they have had their visa cancelled under section 501 and cannot be released into the community at this interlocutory stage by the courts must await final determination before the courts before they can be released. With the government amendments moved today, this will be the full extent of the bill. It is a much modified bill compared with the one that was before the House of Representatives.
Despite the ALP's success in negotiating this position with the government, there remain a number of most significant issues of disagreement between the opposition and the government. In the House of Representatives, Labor moved an amendment to the bill that called for the government to act immediately to remove all children and their families from behind high-security detention fences and razor wire. As we have heard here tonight, the government used its numbers in the House of Representatives to defeat Labor's second reading amendment.
Last month, I and the shadow immigration minister, Nicola Roxon, visited the Baxter detention centre, which is the sole remaining facility in my home state of South Australia. I had been to the Baxter detention centre before; Ms Roxon had not. I visited the Baxter detention centre in August last year before it had opened and before any detainee had set foot in the facility. Since I entered parliament, I have had the opportunity to visit the Baxter detention centre, the Port Hedland detention centre and the once operational, and fortunately now closed, Woomera detention centre in my state of South Australia. My visits to these three centres have certainly made it clear to me that there has to be a better way of detaining people in this country.
The opposition have made clear on numerous occasions that we believe that children should not be behind barbed wire, razor wire or electric fences. We believe that we should not punish the children of asylum seekers who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves on our shores. After all, they are just children. They have a whole life ahead of them. Yet this government chooses to keep them locked up, hidden as though they are some kind of menace to our society.
As I said, I have visited the Baxter detention centre and seen first hand the environment in which we are keeping child asylum seekers. On both occasions that I visited there, I was greatly disturbed and found myself experiencing physical and emotional discomfort when I saw in particular the bars on the windows in the classrooms in the Baxter facility. When I left there, I wondered what sort of life these children could possibly lead. What sort of childhood are we as a country giving these children?
Today we hear much about the value of safety and security during the early years of a child's life. But, rather than giving the children in these detention centres their childhood, we are locking them up behind razor wire. Putting aside any judgment that people may wish to lay upon the asylum-seeker parents, the essential principle here is that the children have done nothing wrong. They do not deserve to be punished; they do not deserve to be locked away. 
A compassionate, caring, modern society, I would think, would ensure the best possible circumstances for a child's upbringing. I would like to believe that Australia is a compassionate and caring society. There is no human rights principle so paramount as the principle of the rights of the child. Australia must embrace its human rights obligations, not only because this is the expectation of the international community but also because we believe in them. We in Australia must surely believe that it is in every child's best interest not to be behind razor wire, not to learn in a classroom with bars on the windows and not to be subjected to imprisonment without cause. Everyone would agree, I think, that children need freedom. I would like to believe that this country values that freedom, encourages that right and sees children as its future. This is what we expect of the rest of the world, and this is what must happen on our own shores. 
This is not just an issue about international obligations, statutes or security, even though these things are important. It is an issue about compassion and freedom. It is an issue about Australian values and the Australian fair go. Australia's international reputation on this issue has become tarnished to the extent that last year the then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Mary Robinson, sent a delegation, headed by Justice Bhagwati, to investigate our immigration detention centre. I quote from the report of his mission to Australia:
He felt that he was in front of a great human tragedy. He saw young boys and girls, who instead of breathing the fresh air of freedom, were confined behind spiked iron bars with gates barred and locked preventing them from going out and playing and running in the open fields. He saw gloom on their faces instead of the joy of youth. These children were growing up in an environment which affected their physical and mental growth and many of them were traumatized and led to harm themselves in utter despair.
One would expect that damning comments such as these from an international human rights investigator would refer to far away, more desolate and disadvantaged parts of the world than to Australia in 2003. These damning comments about the conditions in which children are detained have been reiterated in a report released recently by a QC from South Australia, Robyn Layton, and commissioned by the South Australian government. One of Ms Layton's recommendations was to see the release from detention centres of children and their families.
This should not be a party-political issue. In this place one would hope, irrespective of party membership, that members should be able to put aside their differences and what might seem to be electorally popular or unpopular, and support the fundamental human rights of these children. In October last year the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek, and I began to compile a document tracking the number of children in detention centres in Australia, Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The first edition of the document came out in October last year and there was one released in April this year. Our investigation demonstrated that in October last year there were no fewer than 309 children in Australian controlled detention centres. As at February 2003 that figure had risen to 336. On any assessment, this number is far too high. For anyone who is interested in a breakdown of more recent figures, they are available on my web site or from me or Ms Plibersek. The reason these numbers are so disturbing is that these children are just children; they are not illegals.
I have had the opportunity to visit the Baxter detention centre, Port Hedland and also the Woomera detention centre, which fortunately has now closed. On my travels up that way I also visited the Woomera Residential Housing Project in my state of South Australia. From my visit there I think there is no question that the Woomera alternative detention trial is a vast improvement on the detention centres proper that I have visited. Most people would be familiar with the trial. Essentially what occurs is that, while being processed for their refugee status, the women and children who are part of the housing project are able to live in what one would call reasonably comfortable surroundings and take care of themselves. The houses are fully equipped and have beautiful gardens, complete with an Aussie Hills hoist in the backyard. People have the freedom to move around within their houses and gardens. It has been shown that there have been very few, if any, disturbances and no escapes from the housing project, and the children have been able to grow up in a peaceful and stable household, as all children should. 
We were told in December last year by the minister for immigration that the government had an intention to transfer more children into alternative detention arrangements such as those at the Woomera housing project. Unfortunately, this has not occurred for a number of reasons. One of the problems that has occurred is that, with the closure of the Woomera detention centre, the women and children who were in the housing project were given the choice of either staying in the housing project and being separated from their husbands and fathers who were being moved from the Woomera centre to Baxter, some 150 kilometres away, or moving with them to the Baxter centre. As a consequence, a number of the women and children made the choice, which is understandable, to move with the husbands and fathers to Baxter so as to avoid the tyranny of distance between the two destinations. During my visit to Baxter I was informed that there are measures in place to establish an alternative housing project in the Port Augusta township, but it is only in its very early stages. It seems that, for the time being, women and children are going to remain in the Baxter detention centre.
It is clear to me that when children are held in detention they experience far too much that they should never have to experience. We know that they witness riots, suicide attempts, hunger strikes and other forms of self harm at a time when they should be witnessing friendship, love, affection and such programs as Playschool. On the Sunday program in May 2002, reporters interviewed some of the children who have been in detention in Australia, often for years at a time. One of these child detainees named Zainab described the situation as:
... like when you put a bird in a cage and you feed them but you don't let them go.
Another child, Ashgar, said quite simply and shockingly:
I felt like I was in jail, that's all.
The arguments for keeping children out of detention are not only moral, ethical and legal; they are medical and psychological. This government's policy is putting a significant number of innocent children in conditions where they are exposed to severe psychological harm. This is not acceptable and it must be stopped. I referred before to some work that Ms Plibersek and I had done in relation to this issue. We managed to gather together some of the statistics about child detainees in this country as of late last year. We found that the longest period that a child has been detained in this country was five years, five months and 20 days. As of December 2002, there still remained five unaccompanied minors in detention centres, and at that point there were no auditing arrangements for the provision of schooling in detention centres.
The legislation before us, as I have said, does represent a significant compromise and Labor is able to support it as it is presented. But I also want to refer to the recent case that has arisen in my state of South Australia in relation to the five children who were released from detention a few weeks ago. As has been mentioned here in the chamber tonight, the decision of the Family Court as to whether it has jurisdiction to make decisions in relation to the welfare of children in detention has been appealed by the minister. He has indicated that he wishes to take that matter to the High Court for its determination. I think that is a most unfortunate decision on his part, but we will await the ruling of the High Court on that. In the meantime, on the substantive issue in the Family Court, most people would be aware that the initial decision made by Justice Strickland in the Family Court was not to release the five children into the community. Even though he found that their detention was unlawful, he decided that, at that point, it would not be in their best interests to be released into the community. Subsequently, the full court of the Family Court has reversed this decision and I am pleased to say that the five children in question have now been released into the care of community groups in my home town of Adelaide. They are going to school and living free lives, as children ought to. 
If the minister had had his way, the Family Court, or any other court, would have had absolutely no jurisdiction to make these sorts of orders. It seems that the minister thinks that the Family Court should have no jurisdiction in these matters full stop. He seems to think that the Family Court and I suppose all other courts are irresponsible bodies that cannot be trusted with the power to make decisions about children who are under the minister's care in detention centres.
As I said earlier, the Labor Party are able to support the legislation in its amended form. We are pleased to do so because it is going to have the effect of seeing children—other than the five children who were released recently—being released from high-security detention when no security risk is involved. This of course will be of benefit not only to the children but to the families involved. It is crucial to their health and wellbeing, which would only be destroyed and undermined by continued detention. To sum up: the Labor Party were unable to support the bill in its original form, but in view of the amendments that have been presented we think it is a bill that needs our support. It should ensure that those persons who need not be held behind razor wire in high-security detention can, following an order of the court, be released into the community.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DURATION OF DETENTION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I rise to speak only briefly on the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003, given the government's amendments, but I do want to make a couple of points about the process and the political agenda of the government and the way this bill has been handled. This government obviously thinks it has a pretty good game plan in continuing to try and drum up fear of asylum seekers as a political issue. Just when some very significant allegations regarding cash for visas were aired in the last sitting period of the parliament, we had this urgent bill—surprise, surprise!—rushed through the lower house in the dying days of those last sittings. The government trumpeted how important it was for the bill to be passed urgently, that it would be a dreadful thing if the bill was not passed, that it would not compromise on the legislation—one would have thought the sky would have fallen in. Frankly, what we have seen is that the government failed to gain any political traction with that approach.
Just maybe, the media and the public are starting to wake up to the game plan. There are only so many card tricks of that sort you can pull. Because you got no political mileage out of it, you have now come up with amendments that are precisely those that our then shadow minister indicated we would be prepared to consider and that were reasonable. These are reasonable amendments. Those that you had proposed were totally unreasonable and were not justified on the basis of the decision which you said the bill sought to address. Nevertheless, you again attempted to make political mileage and play on the fear of `the other'. 
It is a bit like what happened with the ASIO bill, when we all had to sit here until the dying hours of the morning because you would not compromise on the legislation because it was going to be dreadful and there would be all these terrorists in Australia. But—surprise, surprise!—when you failed to gain political traction on that issue you came to a compromise with the Labor Party, largely and substantively in accordance with the principles and items that we had indicated to you at that time. So I make the point that the clear political agenda of this legislation was, yet again, to try and drum up more fear in the community about asylum seekers—that the courts would somehow release all these dangerous people into our communities. You failed in that agenda and now you have to put up a significantly amended bill because you simply cannot get the political support to put forward the bill as it originally was.
I will comment very briefly about the original bill. Frankly, it was quite a draconian piece of legislation seeking to prevent the courts from properly considering the circumstances of asylum seekers whose detention may not be lawful and who have a case to argue in respect of that. I understand that the government's assertion that the legislation was urgent and necessary arose from the VFAD decision. The draconian character of the bill is demonstrated by the provisions of subsections 4 and 5 of section 196 of the bill as it then was, which stated that detention was to continue until a court finally determined that detention was unlawful or the detainee was not an unlawful noncitizen and, moreover, that that rule would apply regardless of whether there was a real likelihood of removal or deportation in the reasonably foreseeable future or of a judgment as to the lawfulness of a decision relating to a visa.
The bill sought to prevent or limit courts from issuing interim orders for the release of migration detainees. As I think the shadow minister's representative in this chamber, Senator Sherry, has gone through previously, those persons fall essentially into three categories: failed asylum seekers, which was the category that the minister unsuccessfully sought to make political mileage from; criminal deportees; and persons whose visas have been cancelled for character reasons under section 501 of the Migration Act. Any reasonable reading of the decision the minister said required this urgent legislation would, I think, have indicated that this legislation in the form in which it was previously presented was unnecessary.
The authority the VFAD decision essentially stood for was that the Federal Court could order, in appropriate circumstances and if the case had been proved, interim release from detention of persons who had a case to argue about whether or not their detention was lawful. The chamber may recall that the particular facts of the case were that the asylum seeker in question, having obtained through various legal means a copy of his file as held by the department, could demonstrate that there had been a decision not acted upon to grant a protection visa. It was a case extremely limited on its facts and, frankly, quite a reasonable proposition. I would have thought that even supporters of the government's system of detention could hardly have seen this decision as a nail in its coffin.
As I said at the outset, we are pleased that the government has seen sense—although, for the reasons I have outlined, I do not think it was for any reason of principle—and has limited the application of the amendments to people who are criminal deportees or security risks and people who have had their visas cancelled under section 501. For that reason, the opposition have indicated that we will be supporting the legislation.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-09-08,"—I do not think it helps a great deal, if we are looking at bipartisanship in an area, to impute motives to others. I would just like to congratulate the government for seeing sense in respect of this matter and Senator Sherry and the Labor Party for bringing this about as well—for the ability to negotiate important changes to such an extent that even I will be able to vote for the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003. I thank them for that.
It is clear that these devices—these court actions—will not be possible to implement where there is a failure of the character test. That includes consideration of a number of factors which are listed in the bill, including whether the person has a substantial criminal record; the person's past and present general conduct and character; and whether, if the person were allowed to remain in Australia, there would be a significant risk that the person would represent a danger to the Australian community. I think that is important.
I would like to raise again the issue of children in detention. I have had the opportunity to go around detention centres, including Woomera and Baxter, and the effect that detention has on children concerns me considerably. I know there is an argument that the parents of the children should not have exposed them to this sort of risk, but in the final analysis we really have responsibility for those children who are living in Australia.
Bear in mind—and it is very interesting indeed—a report by Britain's Chief Inspector of Prisons, Anne Owers, written in October 2002 which was only made public a month or so ago. The report is entitled An inspection of Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre. The conclusion Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons came to is this:
This confirms our view, expressed in other reports, that the detention of children should be an exceptional measure, and should not in any event exceed a very short period—no more than a matter of days. The key principle here is not the precise number of days—whether it is the seven days we proposed for short-term removal centres in England, or the two weeks beyond which even their educational needs cannot be guaranteed, in spite of the better, and improved, facilities at Dungavel. It is that the welfare and development of children is likely to be compromised by detention, however humane the provisions, and that this will increase the longer detention is maintained.
We should have regard to that and to the evidence that has been given to the Human Rights Subcommittee of our Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade over a period of time.
Putting children in immigration detention centres is, I believe, completely unacceptable for any period of time. We have to find a solution to this particular problem, and that solution should put the best interests of the children first. There is a good deal of thought being given to this, and I do not want to criticise the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs or officers, because this is something for all of us to approach.
Ironically, the Owers report in England caused a great controversy when it discovered that four children had been held in detention there for over a year. By contrast, as we have heard during the debate, Australia has had many such cases. The case dealt with by the full bench of the Family Court is but one. The children in that case had been held in detention for over 2½ years. A recent media report in August stated that one of the children: 
... pictured himself in terms of “sadness, grief and disbelief that he could be perceived as someone bad enough to be incarcerated for such an extensive period”.
The boy had harmed himself and suffered self-doubt and disturbed sleeping patterns. None of us have a monopoly on compassion. But I feel that jointly we should all sit down and see how we can devise another system or another regime which will put the interests of the children at heart and maintain the interests of Australians and Australian taxpayers.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DURATION OF DETENTION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-09-08,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this debate. I remind the Senate that the purpose of the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003 is to restate and uphold the intention of section 196 of the Migration Act 1958. Section 196 provides that an unlawful non-citizen must remain in immigration detention until he or she is removed from Australia, deported or granted a visa. Section 196 makes it clear that there is to be no discretion for any person or any court to release an unlawful non-citizen from detention until one of these three events occurs. However, in spite of the clear intention of section 196, a trend has emerged since the middle of 2002 for the Federal Court to order the interlocutory release of persons in immigration detention. This means that unlawful non-citizens must be released into the community before the court has finally determined their application for review.
The bill in its present form amends section 196 of the act to put it beyond doubt that there is no discretion for any person or court to release a person from immigration detention until a court has finally determined that the detention is unlawful or the person is not an unlawful citizen. The bill in its present form, as I said, amends section 196. It does so to apply to all unlawful non-citizens in immigration detention. During debate in the other place the opposition indicated that it would not support the bill in its current form but it would support it if its effect were narrowed. I foreshadow that the government intends to move amendments to the bill so that the bill only applies to unlawful non-citizens who are of character concern. In doing this I also foreshadow that further legislation will be brought in at a later date to deal with the remainder of the issues. 
Specifically, the proposed amendments to the bill narrow the application of the bill to persons who have been detained because either their visa has been cancelled on character grounds under section 501 of the act or they are awaiting deportation from Australia under section 200 of the act. That is where their deportation has been ordered because they have certain criminal convictions or because they pose a threat to national security. The amendments will apply to such persons regardless of whether there is a real likelihood of that person detained being removed from Australia or deported in the reasonably foreseeable future or whether a visa decision relating to the person detained is or may be unlawful.
There have now been more than 20 persons released from immigration detention on the basis of interlocutory orders made by the courts. In about half of these cases, the persons released are of significant character concern. They include persons with convictions for serious offences such as rape, armed robbery and drug trafficking. Many of these persons are in the process of being removed from Australia, and their release would represent a significant threat to the Australian community. Given that the courts have now demonstrated an increased willingness to release persons from immigration detention pending final determination of their case, it is absolutely crucial that the bill is passed, as amended, as a matter of urgency. 
The government acknowledges that it is accountable to the Australian public in ensuring the safety of persons within our community. With this in mind, it is essential that the government can determine whether a non-citizen of character concern should be in the Australian community or should be removed from Australia. If the bill is not passed, a person of character concern could be in the community for several months until their court case is finalised. This is a most undesirable consequence. In summary, the amendments contained in this bill will enhance the safety of the Australian community by ensuring that persons of character concern are not released before the courts finally determine their cases. This is a very important bill, and I commend it to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (DURATION OF DETENTION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-09-08,"—The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 contains five schedules, most of which enhance the operations of the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997, the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. The main provisions of this bill are acceptable and technical enhancements of existing legislation. Four out of the five of the bill's provisions have the full support of Labor. These are schedules 1, 3, 4 and 5. 
Schedule 1 of the bill enhances the Australian Communications Authority's ability to make written determinations under the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997. Schedule 3 enables Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement and anticorruption bodies to use licensed radio communications devices for covert surveillance to gather evidence in serious criminal and anticorruption investigations. By disallowable instrument, the ACA can exempt certain law enforcement and anticorruption bodies from the operation of the Radiocommunications Act dealing with unlicensed transmissions, equipment standards and interference emissions. The provisions also expand the objects clause of the Radiocommunications Act to ensure that adequate radio frequency spectrum is set aside for national security, law enforcement and emergency service use or for use by other public and community services.
Schedule 4 abolishes the specially constituted Australian Communications Authority or the SCACA. The SCACA has not served its purpose of considering carrier applications for facilities installation permits. Carriers have used other means to advance these projects, and the SCACA has not considered one application in its four years of operation.
Schedule 5 makes minor amendments to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection Service Standards) Act 1999 dealing with the key National Relay Service standard, the telephone service for deaf and hearing impaired people, customer guarantee standards and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman or TIO. The National Relay Service amendments improve the government's ability to effectively collect NRS levy debts from carriers. The customer service guarantee amendments ensure that revocations or variations of customer service guarantee standards are disallowable instruments. The TIO amendments ensure carriers cannot on-charge consumers for TIO complaint handling fees and give the TIO explicit powers to investigate complaints about charges or fees not directly related to telecommunications carriage services such as early contract termination fees for mobile phone services. These are all worthy and sensible amendments and are supported by Labor. So, in isolation, four of the five amendment schedules are sensible and minor reforms which will improve the operation and effect of the various communication acts in question. 
Labor's key concerns with this bill rest with schedule 2. Schedule 2 amends the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to exempt four agencies—the Australian Broadcasting Authority, or ABA; the Office of Film and Literature Classification, or OFLC; the Classification Board; and the Classification Review Board—from freedom of information, or FOI, requests in relation to certain documents containing material described by the bill as `offensive Internet content'. In effect, schedule 2 is an attempt by the government to remove FOI scrutiny from government agencies involved in the regulation of offensive Internet content. If this schedule were enacted, there would be no way to access the material on which an agency based a censorship decision in order to challenge the lawfulness or reasonableness of that decision.
It is worth looking at the history of how these sites came to be classified as offensive and the role these agencies have in the process. It relates back to the Howard government's failed online content regulation regime established by the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act 1999. This act gave these four agencies the role of censoring Internet content. The Classification Board of the Office of Film and Literature Classification classifies Internet content and the ABA enforces the classification, for example, by issuing a takedown notice if the material is considered offensive—that is, it is either refused classification or is classified X or R, is hosted in Australia and is not subject to a restricted access regime approved by the ABA.
The obvious glaring issue is that there is nothing the government can do about content hosted overseas that is not subject to Australian law. Labor's sensible position was, and has always been, that there is still a need for public investment in educating and empowering Internet users. This is the best way to help people manage their Internet content beyond a complaint and take-down process. The online services act and the accompanying rhetoric attempted to deceive Australians concerned about unwanted Internet content. The deception was trying to trick them into believing that the problem was solved. But it was not. But since when has the coalition let the facts get in the way of sensational rhetoric? So schedule 2 of the bill currently before us represents round 2 of the Howard government's attempt to deceive Australians into believing it has solved the problem of unwanted and inappropriate Internet content. I do not think that anything is further from the truth. What we have is a government trying to make out it is doing more and covering up the flaws in the existing regime.
Labor believes that schedule 2 will undermine the level of transparency and accountability of the decision making processes of the stated agencies. It should be remembered that the government's Internet classification decisions are not freely accessible through the OFLC's online classification database in the same way that decisions relating to books, films and games are. In these circumstances, FOI is the only practical means to scrutinise these agencies' decisions beyond the information contained in their annual reports. 
So why does the government believe this legislation to be necessary? According to the minister, under the current environment the FOI process would allow people to get information about illegal Internet content from government agencies such as the ABA or the OFLC. Earlier this year the minister made a quite hysterical and laughable assertion that under the current FOI regime:
... the ABA could become a one-stop shop for deviants seeking the most despicable and morally contemptible material.
The idea that FOI could allow people to access and then peddle sites—for example, that could relate to child pornography—is completely absurd. It is a smokescreen being used by the government to try and scare non-government senators—and, I think, the general public—into thinking that a bill that effectively excludes key government agencies from any public scrutiny with regard to their management of offensive Internet content is somehow meritorious. I think it is dishonest and, for the following three reasons, demonstrably untrue.
First, government agencies are already in a position to withhold certain information on offensive Internet sites under the existing arrangements. They may block out, and have blocked out, web addresses or information that will identify the actual Internet location of offensive Internet sites. In June last year the Administrative Appeals Tribunal upheld the ABA's decision not to provide documents sought on the ground that disclosure could reasonably be expected to `have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of the agency'. They found this within the meaning of section 41(1)(d) of the FOI Act and indicated that this outweighed the public interest in disclosing the information.
This independent review tribunal made its call on the merits of the application and decided against providing the documents regarding offensive Internet content. It reached its decision after balancing the potential of disclosure to prejudice the operation of the ABA against the public interest in disclosure. These existing arrangements requiring these agencies and the tribunal to undertake this balancing exercise with regard to the proper level of public disclosure are more appropriate than granting agencies a blanket exemption. It is not unreasonable to require these agencies to justify their refusal to provide information about their Internet censorship decisions.
The second reason is that the government's claim that these blanket FOI exemptions are necessary rests on the implausible assumption that people would willingly identify themselves to government agencies as seeking, for improper purposes, access to material the possession of which is likely to constitute a criminal offence. People with commonsense would recognise how far-fetched it is to claim that criminals would seek to engage in such illegal activity in full view of the government through the use of the FOI Act.
Finally, the third reason is that there is no evidence that the FOI is being used inappropriately. Questioning in Senate estimates earlier in the year revealed that, between then and the commencement of the online content regime, the ABA and the OFLC had received just one freedom of information request relating to their Internet censorship decisions—only one. Let me put that in perspective. The online content regime has been operating since the year 2000. In this time, over 1,000 decisions regarding Internet content classification, take-down notices and referrals to makers of Internet filters were made by the OFLC and the ABA. That is over 1,000 relevant decisions over three years with just one FOI request, fully resolved without the release of a single URL or Internet address. 
So why is the government persisting with this new schedule? It is a question that only the world's worst communications minister could possibly answer, and I hope he will in the course of this debate. If the government has evidence that the FOI Act is being abused, it should produce it. It is certainly not apparent from the single FOI request received so far. The fact is that there has been no evidence that people are using FOI requests to the OFLC or the ABA as a means of procuring the addresses of offensive or illegal Internet sites for public dissemination or misuse. There is no evidence.
Instead, in the one known case where FOI was used—and it was by an organisation called Electronic Frontiers Australia—the information received was used to expose the cover-up of the legislation. When comparing their FOI information with the government's reports, the EFA found the following:
... discrepancies appear to exist between information released to EFA and Government reports on the operation of the regime. For example, the figures reported in the ABA's first quarter report (issued in April 2000), and the six-month report issued by Senator Alston (on 5 September 2000), do not accord with information released to EFA under FOI. The number of complaints received in January and February do not match, nor does the number of complaints received that resulted in findings of prohibited content hosted in Australia.
The government has made no attempt to justify by evidence or argument that schedule 2 is necessary. Labor believes it is not justified. Senator Alston's cynical scaremongering and wedge politicking on this issue will not stop Labor from opposing this schedule. We do not see it as anything but an attempt to exempt government agencies from being subject to the proper public scrutiny in their roles. Covering up this information would do nothing to prevent sites hosted in Australia from moving offshore and continuing to use the `.au' domain name, but it could prevent people from finding out if the government is aware that this had happened.
Labor is opposed to schedule 2 and will be moving amendments in the committee stage to strike this schedule from the bill. Labor sincerely hopes that senators on the crossbenches will support the amendments and treat the shameless scare campaign being used to justify the amendments with the contempt it deserves.
Senator Alston has occupied some of his time by spreading scurrilous and slanderous misinformation about Labor's opposition to this schedule. In March this year, Senator Alston put out an outrageous press release claiming that Labor supports easier access to child pornography. Nothing could be further from the truth, and Senator Alston knows it. As with his war on the ABC, the truth is no obstacle when Senator Alston tries to score a cheap political point. Whether attacking the independence of the ABC or spreading misinformation about his political opponents, he has taken it to a new low.
What Labor can point out is that earlier this year, following questioning from Senator Kirk, it was revealed that the government has been dragging its heels in ratifying the protocol in relation to the sale of children, which does contain provisions against child pornography. This is clearly inexcusable and exposes the hypocrisy in some of the government's actions. 
In summary, schedule 2 of this bill is nothing more than an attempt by the Howard government to cover up the failure of its Internet content regime. It will protect no-one and simply create more government secrecy. Labor believes this schedule should be removed from the bill. As I said in my opening remarks in the committee stage of this debate, we will be supporting all other schedules contained in the bill.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-09-08,"—I rise tonight to discuss the question of housing affordability and to touch on an important related issue—that is, Australia's savings culture. The housing boom is a phenomenon which no Australian can fail to observe at the present time. This housing boom is, in many respects, a result of this government's sound economic management. Rising incomes, low interest rates and economic stability are, of course, good things, but at the same time they have delivered the capacity for Australians to enter into significant debt in order to buy housing, particularly investment properties.
The market, naturally, has reacted to the increased demand for property, and prices have skyrocketed. This has acted as a significant barrier to those seeking to enter the market—something this government is rightly concerned about. Recently, a joint report from the Commonwealth Bank and the Housing Industry Association said that housing affordability is at a lower level than it was when interest rates were 17 per cent. In May, the proportion of loans to first home buyers was at its lowest level since the ABS began measuring it in 1991.
These are concerning trends, and the government should be commended for directing the Productivity Commission to inquire into the affordability and availability of housing for families and individuals wishing to purchase their first home. This inquiry is particularly important because home ownership is bound up with the national ethos. The ability to achieve home ownership continues to be of vital importance in maintaining family and social stability.
The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have wisely put the property boom into broader perspective. They have correctly pointed out that millions of Australians have welcomed the substantial jump in the price of their homes. I for one do not begrudge them this windfall. These people, often termed `mainstream Australia', have invested a very significant proportion of their finances in their homes.
The family home is the most significant asset that people ever acquire in their lifetimes—generally speaking—and represents around two-thirds of all household wealth in Australia. I am determined that future generations are not locked out of what Robert Menzies coined `the great Australian dream'. Menzies stated that the home represented the tangible expression of the habits of frugality and thrift. In other words, he viewed home ownership as the result of disciplined saving. Tonight, we should reaffirm that philosophy.
In my first speech, earlier this year, I stated that 99½ per cent of Australians' disposable income is spent and not saved. This figure derives from the household saving ratio published in the national quarterly accounts. Since 1980, household debt to financial institutions has roughly doubled in relation to income, from around 45 per cent of income to more than 90 per cent. 
At face value, this seems startling. However, the majority of these debtors have a significant pool of savings they can one day draw on to clear this debt. I refer, of course, to superannuation. Estimates indicate that life insurance and superannuation assets constituted only seven per cent of household wealth in 1960, compared with 22 per cent in 1997. In 1987, 41 per cent of employees had superannuation coverage; today it is well over 90 per cent. Today, Australia's superannuation assets are worth over 70 per cent of GDP compared with around 20 per cent in the early 1960s.
I am part of the Senate's inquiry into poverty and financial hardship. At a hearing in Canberra, the Australia Institute's Clive Hamilton made some interesting remarks. He said we need to distinguish very clearly between genuine hardship and what the Australia Institute calls `middle-class whinging'. He said that the last decade has seen a rapid increase in middle-class expectations of what it takes to have a decent lifestyle and an adequate standard of living. Subsequently, families are going into a large amount of debt in order to fund a lifestyle that the genuinely struggling would regard as luxurious. He said middle-class people were bidding each other out of the housing market because they were willing to commit more of their current and future incomes to paying off a mortgage. This was what he said was driving housing prices up.
Dr Hamilton also touched on the issue of savings, stating that middle-class people were going into debt at unprecedented levels so they could buy the bigger house, the newer kitchen, the second car or the holiday in Europe. On the other hand, he said, low-income earners balance their budgets much more effectively. Whether that is true or not, whether the phenomenon he describes is class based or not, or income based or not, I think we are all obliged to encourage a savings culture by developing policies that encourage additional saving on the part of Australians. I mentioned before that Australia's compulsory superannuation regime has delivered Australians the ability to pay off large amounts of debt on retirement. I also stated that the property boom has provided a windfall for those already in the market. But what about those people who do not own their own housing and who are on low incomes? In spite of their best endeavours, many of them simply cannot save enough money for an adequate deposit.
That is why, appropriately, governments need to take steps to assist people on low incomes. There are a number of ways in which, beyond what is already being done, this might occur. One option is to abolish taxation of interest earned by savings because savings effectively is deferred consumption that will eventually be taxed anyway. This government has a very good record when it comes to taxation reform. There is also, it is true to say, an overemphasis in the thinking of many people on retirement savings rather than on long-term savings for other purposes. I believe people should have greater choice in where their superannuation contributions go.
As a Liberal I believe individual choice is of great, if not paramount, importance. I also believe individuals are invariably better judges of how to spend their money than are governments. It may be appropriate for low-income earners in particular to have access to their superannuation contributions for the purpose of raising a housing deposit. Indeed, why should low-income earners be forced to risk their savings in private superannuation funds when housing, in some cases at least, may be a better long-term option? Unlike shares, a house is an asset that can be utilised while it gains value. A system of rebates or taxation concessions designed to bolster the saving of low-income earners might also be worth consideration. Some states of the United States have introduced what they have called individual development accounts, which is money provided by individuals and matched by a number of sources, such as government, financial institutions and local businesses. Admittedly, facilitating a savings culture is a long-term strategy to increase housing affordability. There are other short-term options as well. 
In my electorate of the ACT, the median housing price has increased 23.8 per cent in the past year alone to over $300,000. This has led to calls for the ACT government to influence the supply side of the market—in other words, to release more land and to cut fees, taxes and charges on the construction of new dwellings. In fact, the substantial revenue flowing to states and territories as a result of the GST should be leading eventually to the abolition of various forms of stamp duty and associated taxes. Unfortunately, we have seen little indication that the state and territory governments are giving this serious consideration.
I think the housing boom will have a soft landing, largely because this government has fostered a historically low inflationary environment and has paid back two-thirds of Labor's debt which has substantially reduced the pressure to raise interest rates. Home ownership is fundamental to Australia's way of life and social stability. I think it is worth quoting the founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies, who, in his famous `Forgotten People' address in May 1942 had this to say:
The home is the foundation of sanity and sobriety; it is the indispensable condition of continuity; its health determines the health of society as a whole. ... Your advanced socialist may rage against private property while he acquires it; but one of the best instincts in us is that which induces us to have one little piece of earth with a house and a garden which is ours: to which we can withdraw, in which we can be among our friends, into which no stranger may come against our will.
The language may be slightly archaic these days but the sentiment is as sound as ever.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Housing: Affordability</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-09-08,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	The decision was made on 26 October 1998 by the then Capability Forum. Source approval of Tenix as the prime contractor and Tropical Reef (Cairns), as principal subcontractor, was endorsed in early September 1999. 
(2)	The options apart from LOTE, considered by the Capability Forum in October 1998, were disposal of the current LCHs without replacement or replace LCHs with a new build. 
(3)	Yes. One proposal from Tenix and one from Sea Transport Corporation.  
	(a)	Tenix Proposal - Following a review of the LCH LOTE in July 2000; Tenix proposed building three new LCH hulls in Western Australia at a cost of $5.2 million per hull, based on the current design being provided by the Commonwealth and the re-use of existing LCH equipment. At that point in time cancellation of the LOTE would have resulted in only two LCH completing the LOTE, these were Wewak and Balikpapan. 
	(b)	Sea Transport Corporation Proposal - An unsolicited proposal was received from Sea Transport Corporation. The proposal was received in November 2001 when the Commonwealth was deliberating on the cost effectiveness of proceeding with the refit of the last LCH HMAS Brunei due to the state of its hull.
(4)	(a)	The Tenix proposal was rejected, as there were a number of unknowns and risks to the Commonwealth in terms of cost uncertainties and supply of Commonwealth equipment. In addition, it is believed the Tenix proposal would have drawn criticism from the major subcontractor, Tropical Reef, who would have a lesser part, if any, to play in such an arrangement. It was also likely to draw criticism from a range of other prospective shipbuilders. Moreover, Tenix proposed to construct the new hulls in Western Australia thus the original premise of undertaking the LOTE in Darwin and/or Cairns to ensure a local base for ongoing support for the LCHs would be defeated.  
The Sea Transport Corporation Proposal was rejected on the basis of commercial risk. 
	(b)	Tenix Option - Support Command Australia - Navy estimated that the total indicative cost of the Tenix option would be similar to the cost of new vessels. This, together with sunk costs and the likely industry outcry at a sole source build to Tenix, contributed to making this an unattractive option.
Sea Transport Corporation Option - While cancellation of the sixth LCH LOTE and the charter of a suitable commercial vessel appeared to be cost effective the benefits were outweighed by the risk to Navy's image. A last minute decision to cancel the LOTE and charter a commercial vessel would have drawn considerable political, government and commercial criticism. 
(5)	Of the proposals submitted: 
	(a)	Tenix had no existing units that could be directly evaluated by the Navy. 
A Sea Transport Corporation design was assessed against the present level of amphibious capability provided by the LCH. The outcome of this comparison demonstrated that a suitable charter vessel could be obtained and operated at a slightly lower overall cost than an LCH, however the Sea Transport design would have become a `orphan craft' noting that five LCHs would have remained in service. A full cost and capability analysis was not possible due to time constraints imposed by operational requirements. 
	(b)	The advantages of the Sea Transport Corporation design was innovative features. The disadvantages were: 
(i)	the design was more suited to sea transport missions (commercial orientation) as opposed to amphibious assaults (tactical operations); 
(ii)	the design's level of integration with existing Royal Australian Navy units; and
(iii)	lack of commonality of equipment fit with the existing fleet.
(6)	$18.760 million (all figures are expressed in 2002 pricing).  
(7)	The other option considered to conducting the LOTE was the purchase of replacement LCHs and the cost of this option was $100 million based on a six ship buy and inclusive of other project costs.
(8)	(a)	The cost of the refit to the LCH fleet to date is $37.808 million.
	(b)	The complete refit is expected to cost $37.923 million.
(9)	The LOTE project was completed 8 November 2002.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Landing Craft Heavy Fleet</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,23,1,answer
