"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2005-08-09,"—Mr Clerk, I remind the Senate that the time has come when it is necessary for the Senate to choose one of its members to be President. I propose to the Senate for its President Senator Calvert, and I move:
That Senator Calvert take the chair of the Senate as President.
—Are there any other nominations?",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-08-09,"—Mr Clerk, I propose to the Senate for its President Senator Nettle, and I move:
That Senator Nettle take the chair of the Senate as President.
I commend Senator Nettle because she will not fail to promote the Senate’s independence as a watchdog on the government. She will consult with all senators and acknowledge the crossbench. Senator Nettle will, perhaps most importantly, protect and preserve the independence of the Senate and the President of the Senate and not allow the Senate to become a rubber stamp or cipher of either the executive in another place or the office of the Prime Minister. I commend Senator Nettle to this high office.
—Are there any further nominations? There being two candidates for the presidency, I invite the candidates to address the Senate.
—I submit myself to the will of the Senate.
—I submit myself to the will of the Senate.
—There being two candidates, the Senate will proceed to a ballot. Before proceeding to a ballot, the bells will be rung for four minutes.
The bells having been rung—
—The Senate will now proceed to a ballot. Ballot papers will be distributed to honourable senators, who are requested to write upon the paper the name of the candidate for whom they wish to vote. The clerks will now distribute ballot papers to all honourable senators. The candidates are Senator Calvert and Senator Nettle.
A ballot having been taken—
—The result of the ballot is: Senator Calvert, 67 votes; and Senator Nettle, seven votes. Senator Calvert is therefore elected President of the Senate in accordance with the standing orders and will take the chair.

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2005-08-09,"—Honourable senators, thank you again for according me the immense privilege of being your President. I will endeavour to undertake the duties of office and particularly to regulate debate in this chamber in a fair and impartial manner, with perhaps a little humour along the way.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2005-08-09,"—Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to again congratulate you on assuming the role of President of the Senate. In your case we have had the benefit of seeing you in practice, and you have been judged on performance. It is good to see that you received such a strong vote across the chamber, and I take that as a cross-chamber expression of support for the way in which you have carried out your office. Your office is obviously an important one, not only symbolically but also in practice. The task of chairing the Senate and being its President is not an easy one. Even though the numbers might have changed somewhat, I suspect the task will still be a challenging one. We on this side of the chamber, and obviously others, believe that you have conducted your responsibilities objectively and fairly. We congratulate you on that, and for that you receive our further endorsement.
We believe the personal dignity you have brought to the chamber, recognising the importance of this institution as a critical part of Australian democracy, is something that should also be commended, and it is another reason why we support you today. You also have a governance role in terms of the Department of the Senate and in ensuring that the Senate is served efficiently and well. I know from my experience that you have taken on that task responsibly and carried it out to the standard that we would wish to see.
We thank you for your service in the past. We are pleased to be able to congratulate you, in my case personally, on behalf of the government and on behalf of coalition senators. We wish you well for the future.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-08-09,"—Mr President, I want to congratulate you, on behalf of the Labor opposition, on your re-election to the important office of Senate President. It is the case, as is clear from the numbers, that the Labor Party to a person voted for you.
Government senators interjecting—
—Even though it is a secret ballot, I can assure you all the Labor senators voted for you. We may be down on numbers but the old practices remain! We congratulate you because we think it is a very important position, and we also continue to support the practice that the President comes from the government party. We think there are a range of practices, procedures and precedents that have been developed by the Senate over time that have served the Senate and Australian democracy well. This is one of them, and we will continue to argue for the others as well.
Senator Calvert, you as President did justice to the office in your previous term. We do accept that you have acted impartially—despite perhaps paying a little too much attention to Senator Conroy’s and my own contributions to the Senate on occasions! But hopefully we will continue to enjoy a positive relationship and you will continue to bring credit to the office.
I do want to say that of course I think there is a fundamental difference with this term: the President is now responsible for a Senate where there is a government majority. That has not been the practice for a long time and I think that will put extra pressure on the President, as governments inevitably apply that pressure to Presiding Officers. I urge you to resist that and to continue to act with independence and impartiality, but I do accept that the processes will result in greater pressure on the office of the President. We also urge you to continue the process of consultation with non-government senators that has marked the practice in the Senate for a long time—of consulting widely and trying to get agreement where possible—so allowing the smooth functioning of the Senate and allowing all senators to fulfil their obligations to the electorate and the states they represent. We think that has been an important part of the efficient functioning of the Senate and has made for a stronger democracy.
Unfortunately, I think there is an issue I will have to take up with you later today which is of serious concern, and I flag that. But I do want to indicate on this occasion our congratulations, Mr President, and I look forward to your success in the office.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-08-09,"—Mr President, I add the congratulations of the Australian Democrats to your re-election as President of this chamber.
Government senators interjecting—
—Order!
—I join with the Labor Party in asking you to ensure that people do not interrupt when people are speaking in the chamber. We know from experience that you have presided over the chamber with fairness and integrity, and we look forward to more of that. We expect that you will be impartial, and I think you have shown that in the past. But we also ask you to do better, if anything, in consulting with those members of this chamber who are not part of the government. Again, we will take this issue up, along with Labor, a little later today.
It will be a challenge. The next while is not a time that many of us in this chamber have experienced—that is, when the government has the numbers—so your role will be more important than ever before. We ask you to make sure that you consider the views of those in this chamber who are not part of the government, and I am sure you will do that.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2005-08-09,"—Mr President, I congratulate you on your newly appointed position and say that the vote you received is indicative of the esteem in which you are held in the Senate. It was a magnificent vote from all sides of the Senate, and I look forward to working with you in the coming years. On behalf of my National Party colleagues, we join with other members of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party and other Independent members in congratulating you on your appointment.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-08-09,"—Mr President, I add my congratulations to you on reassuming the role of President of the Senate. It is a very great duty on your shoulders to carry out your commitment to fairness in the coming years. That will be under close scrutiny and will be called into order if it is a commitment not made.
Let me also say at the outset, Mr President, that the role of President is to be there for all senators, it is to avoid politics from that chair, it is to rule without fear and favour and it is to treat all senators equally. The matter has already been alluded to as regards a rearrangement of question time and allocations this afternoon without consultation—without reference to senators who are involved. Your first process there is more on the foul than the fair. This is early days, but it is our responsibility as senators to defend the office. The challenge for you is to reach the measures that the office requires. I offer you all assistance in achieving that and wish you well in the role.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2005-08-09,"—Mr President, on behalf of Family First, I congratulate you on your re-election. I do not know you well, but I know that since the election last year you and your staff have been very helpful, and I am hoping to continue to work with you.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2005-08-09,"—I thank party leaders and other honourable senators for their kind words of congratulations on my re-election as President.
As well as your President, I genuinely consider myself to be the servant of the wonderful Australian Senate that a lot of you have just become a part of. I remind all senators that my door is always open to you in regard to any matter relating to the Senate, and in relation to my wider responsibilities for the administration of the parliament.
During the last three years, I have been pleased to be involved in further measures to streamline the administration of the parliament. Notably this has involved the amalgamation of the three joint departments after 90 years of attempts.
But in particular I note my satisfaction at the cooperation between the parliamentary departments to further the public understanding of our democracy and its importance to Australia.
I record my thanks to the Clerk and the other clerks at the table, to the Black Rod, the attendants and the other chamber staff, and to all the other officers of the Senate for their support for me as President since 2002.
The Department of the Senate is perhaps one of the smaller departments in the Commonwealth, but that size is not reflected in the diligence of its staff, the quality of its work and the exceptional support given to all honourable senators.
I also record my warm thanks to the previous Deputy President, Senator John Hogg, and to the panel of temporary chairmen of committees, some of whom have now retired from the Senate.
Much has been said in other places about what this new Senate will or will not bring about. It is not appropriate for me as your President to speculate on this, but I do know, after 18 years in the chamber, that more will be achieved with an attitude of goodwill and cooperation on all sides, which has usually been the hallmark of this place.
Having said that, I want to make a particular point: it is my firm expectation that the courtesies of debate, convention and proper behaviour in this chamber will be adhered to. That applies to all senators. I hope that can be done in a cooperative manner, but if not I make clear now that the chair will not hesitate to act to protect and enforce the standing orders.
There is one other person, outside this chamber, who is important to me today. I refer to my wife, Jill, in the gallery. She has been there to temper my wilder ideas in the past and I am sure she will be a very good sounding board for me in the future. She is always there to remind me of any mistakes I make. I could not do the job without her and I thank her very much for her help. I thank you all again for your confidence in me as your President.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1

I table the commission.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-08-09,"—I propose to the Senate for its Deputy President and Chair of Committees Senator Hogg, and I move:
That Senator Hogg be appointed Deputy President and Chair of Committees.
In support of that nomination can I say that I think Senator Hogg served the parliament very well in the role in the last term and has earnt the respect of all senators. I commend his nomination to the Senate.
—Are there any further nominations?",SENATE,<title>DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-08-09,"—I propose to the Senate for its Deputy President and Chair of Committees Senator Milne, and I move:
That Senator Milne be appointed Deputy President and Chair of Committees.
Senator Milne has extensive parliamentary experience in Tasmania where she was both in the accord arrangement with the Labor Party and then led the Greens during the period in which the Liberal government was in office. She also has extensive experience in national and international fora including in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, including in the chair. Mr President, I am informed that the vote we had for your office this afternoon was the first since 1987. I think this will be perhaps the first vote for the Deputy President in nearly a decade. It is a very healthy thing. We have in Senator Milne an extremely accomplished potential Deputy President and Chair of Committees. I recommend her to the Senate.
—Mr President, I submit myself to the will of the Senate.
—Mr President, I submit myself to the will of the Senate.
—There being two nominations, in accordance with the standing orders a ballot will be held. Before proceeding to ballot, the bells will be rung for four minutes.

The bells having been rung—

—Order! The Senate will now proceed to ballot. Ballot papers will be distributed to all honourable senators, who are requested to write upon the paper the name of the candidate for whom they wish to vote. The candidates are Senator Hogg and Senator Milne. I invite Senator George Campbell and Senator Siewert to act as scrutineers.
A ballot having been taken—
—The result of the ballot is as follows: Senator Hogg, 70 votes; and Senator Milne, four votes.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2005-08-09,"—Firstly, I would like to thank the Senate for its support and the honour conferred upon me again. Secondly, I would like to congratulate you, Mr President, on your re-election. I will continue to work with you in the same manner that I have over the previous term. I would like to thank my colleagues for their support. Last but not least I would like to thank my wife, Sue, and my family for the support they have given me in helping me to perform my duties. Thank you.",SENATE,<title>DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2005-08-09,"—On behalf of the government side, I congratulate Senator Hogg on his election as Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. As will be obvious from the vote, he was supported by the coalition, and that is a recognition—a bit like in your case, Mr President—of our observation of his performance. We believe that Senator Hogg has acted impartially and has carried out his functions in a way that builds on the dignity and the standing of the chamber. It also allows all individual senators to have a fair opportunity to contribute to the processes of this place.
We firstly supported him for those reasons and we secondly supported him in these circumstances because we believe that the practice of electing the President from the government side and the Deputy President from the opposition side has worked well. Practice has shown that it can contribute to the better management of the chamber. I wanted to make that point because some might see this as the first test for the government in the utilisation of its numbers—its new majority in the chamber. In its first test, in demonstrating its desire for this chamber to continue to function in a cooperative way, it voted for a Labor Party representative. When that continues to be in the best interests of the chamber and the functioning of this Senate, that is the way that the government intends to operate.
In making those points, I want to mention what might be described as the particular generosity of the National Party in joining with the Liberals as part of the coalition in making that decision. The tradition was that when the coalition had the numbers in the chamber it took both positions: the Liberals obtained the presidency and the deputy presidency went to the National Party. So I want to put on the public record our thanks to the National Party for their cooperation in that regard. It is again an illustration of the strength of this coalition to ensure that it will act in the best interests of good government and good Senate practice.
I will make two further points. I congratulate Senator Hogg also on getting the votes of all the Australian Democrats. It is in the spirit of what I was talking about: the parties in this place wanting to cooperate to get the outcome that will best serve the interests of the Senate. Three of the Australian Democrats might reflect on that further.
Finally, in his continuing tasks as Chairman of Committees, I invite Senator Hogg to look again at the functioning of the Senate committee system. In my view it has not worked as well as it could in recent years. That has had something to do with the proliferation of committees that has occurred. The advantage of practice over some years is that you have the opportunity to assess what is working well and what is not working so well. One of the responsibilities of the Chairman of Committees in his oversight of the committee system of this chamber is to make an objective and sensible judgment on those matters and help guide the Senate towards the best outcome of its committee structure and the ability of the Senate to use its committee system to advance the interests of the nation.

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—Order! Senator Conroy, you will withdraw that remark. It is unparliamentary and you know it is.
—I withdraw the remark.
—It did not take long to get an objection from Senator Conroy. With those few words, I again congratulate Senator Hogg and wish him well.",SENATE,<title>DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-08-09,"—I will go back to the subject matter after that contribution and congratulate Senator Hogg on his election as Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. It is a testament to the work he has done over the last few years that he enjoys the support of senators around the chamber for his diligence, his application and his fairness in doing the job. We were very pleased to nominate and support him again and I am sure he will continue to work constructively for the betterment of the Senate.
I must say that Senator Hill’s suggestion that this is the first test of the government’s commitment to accountability is an interesting one. There are much sterner tests ahead than that. While he might congratulate the National Party, some of us might think that there are other reasons for the National Party not having a candidate that could get the support of the government in this ballot. That might have had more to do with it, but I do not want to go there. Also, I think the government had a fairly bitter experience the last time it decided to support a candidate for the job who was not a nominee of the Australian Labor Party. There is a bit of history to that.
In congratulating Senator Hogg I will say that, while there is a practice and a precedent that the government have chosen to uphold on this occasion, I would urge them to be consistent with that, and that certainly does not fit with their propositions for question time or estimates processes, as flagged by Senator Hill. I also note the warning to us that there is an agenda on the Senate committees, which again has not been discussed with anyone, but I do not think that will fall to Senator Hogg. I think Senator Hogg will find that others who are inside the government will be beavering away on that subject and we will be informed when they have come to a concluded view. I do not want to divert from the main function, which is to congratulate Senator Hogg, wish him well in the job and assure him of the continuing support of Labor senators.",SENATE,<title>DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2005-08-09,"—I too would like to join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in congratulating Senator Hogg. I think he makes a very good back-up for you, Mr President, and he is held in high esteem on both sides of the chamber. In fact, Senator Hill made the observation that the National Party are generous enough not to go for this position, but if it were not for Senator Hogg I think we may have had other views. We support him and we wish him the best.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Opposition senators are extremely ungracious.",SENATE,<title>DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-08-09,"—I add my words of congratulation on the election of Senator Hogg. I think he has done his job very well both as Deputy President in this place and as Chairman of Committees. However, I would take issue with your remarks, Senator Hill—the snide assumptions you have made to do with the vote that we just had. It is a secret ballot in this place and it is not for you to suggest that persons voted one way or the other, because you do not know, just as I do not know. So I suggest that you desist from that approach.
I would also like to raise—and this is nothing to do with Senator Hogg, so perhaps we should leave it for another day—the matter of committees. The reason that they are not working well, according to the government, is that they are exposing what the government is up to. We would like to continue to do that. If I can make a suggestion to the government through you, Mr President, it is that the government should allow the committees to continue to do their very good work in the way that they have been. They have been objective, they have been sensible, and there is no call to suggest otherwise.",SENATE,<title>DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-08-09,"—I congratulate Senator John Hogg as well, and wish him well in the coming period. We are sailing from smooth waters into much more turbulent waters. We may have speculated about that forecast until Senator Hill got to his feet. The statement by Senator Hill that the Democrats should or might reflect on the vote for the President was an extraordinary revelation of a message from the Prime Minister to senators: if you are going to get out of line and not support the government then you are going to be treated differently. That was an extraordinary indication that this government is going to divide the Senate according to who supports it and who does not. At the outset, that shows a government that intends to use this Senate for its purposes and not for the benefit of the Australian people on whose behalf we are elected to debate issues.
Government senators interjecting—
—The government may not like this, but it is going to get a lot more of it.
The voting trend here has been very clear, but let me say—and this applies to the committee system as well as to the other functions of the Senate—that the Greens will be fearless defenders of the Senate and its right to inquire into the government. You may truncate the powers of the committee system, you may try to close down the committee system, and you may try to pull a blind down on what the government is doing with taxpayers’ money and with the governance of this country, but the Greens—and I am sure our colleagues variously on this side of the chamber—are here to make sure you are held to account.
So, Mr President, there it is. We congratulate you and the Deputy President again. We look forward to the coming years in this Senate. Above all, we commit ourselves to the Australian people who put us here and give an assurance to those voters that we are here to defend this Senate and its role against the unelected executive in the other place, who quite clearly began their effort to impact on this Senate through the statement that Senator Hill made just a moment ago.",SENATE,<title>DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-08-09,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, I present the report of the committee entitled Review of the listing of seven terrorist organisations, and seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard.

Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I present the fourth report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD under section 102.1A of the Criminal Code Act 1995. In this report the Committee reviewed the re-listings of seven proscribed terrorist organisations, namely:
Ansar al-Islam;
Asbat al-Ansar;
The Egyptian Islamic Jihad;
The Islamic Army of Aden;
Jaish-e-Mohammad;
Lashkar-e Jhangvi; and
The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.
These organisations were initially proscribed under the Criminal Code in 2003. Subsection 102.1 (3) of the Code provides that these regulations cease to have effect after two years. However, section 102.1A states the Committee may review re-listings, and report its findings and recommendations to the Parliament. In this report, the Committee decided to concentrate on the procedure and criteria for listing an organisation.
Overall, the Committee was satisfied with the re-listings process. The Committee was pleased to receive unclassified Statements of Reasons from ASIO outlining why it felt each organisation should be re-listed, and was satisfied that the Government was developing a more efficient and comprehensive process of listing terrorist organisations.
However, the Committee was concerned that the States and Territories received only one week’s notice for the re-listing of Ansar al-Islam and only one day’s notice for the re-listing of the Islamic Army of Aden. Under subclause 3.4(6) of the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Counter-Terrorism Laws, the Government is required to give the States and Territories reasonable time to consider their response to a proposed listing.
In response, the Attorney-General’s Department has submitted it intended to give more notice for future listings. The Committee would like to note it was pleased that, for the other five organisations, the States and Territories were given about three weeks to consider the listings.
Furthermore, in its report, Review of the Listing of Six Terrorist Organisations, the Committee recommended the Attorney-General’s Department conduct community consultation on listings. The Committee notes that community consultations were not held on these re-listings, but would encourage the Department to implement this recommendation.
Moreover, in its report on the listing of the al-Zarqawi network as a terrorist organisation, the Committee noted that DFAT’s input on the listing was ‘still…somewhat inadequate.’ The Committee is disappointed to have to report that DFAT ‘does not appear to have provided substantive input’ on the seven re-listings. The Department was requested to provide assessments of the foreign policy implications of the re-listings, on the strategic circumstances in which the organisations operate and any information relating to Australia’s obligations to the United Nations on particular organisations. However, its submissions were not sufficiently detailed to be particularly useful.
The Committee was pleased to receive greater detail on ASIO’s evaluation criteria for selecting organisations for listing. Nonetheless, the Committee would still appreciate more details on organisations’ links and potential threat to Australia in future listings. In particular, the Committee understands that a terrorist attack could damage Australian interests overseas, but also would like more information on how organisations presented a direct threat to Australia domestically.
In addition, the Committee believes ASIO must take care to address all its own criteria for listing in the Statements of Reason.
The Committee is grateful for the input of Government agencies and members of the public into these reviews, and hopes that there will continue to be constructive debate on the matter.
Notwithstanding any of the above concerns, the Committee does not recommend to the Parliament that any of these regulations be disallowed.
I commend the report to the Senate.

Moreover, in its report on the listing of the al-Zarqawi network as a terrorist organisation, the Committee noted that DFAT’s input on the listing was ‘still…somewhat inadequate.’ The Committee is disappointed to have to report that DFAT ‘does not appear to have provided substantive input’ on the seven re-listings. The Department was requested to provide assessments of the foreign policy implications of the re-listings, on the strategic circumstances in which the organisations operate and any information relating to Australia’s obligations to the United Nations on particular organisations. However, its submissions were not sufficiently detailed to be particularly useful.
The Committee was pleased to receive greater detail on ASIO’s evaluation criteria for selecting organisations for listing. Nonetheless, the Committee would still appreciate more details on organisations’ links and potential threat to Australia in future listings. In particular, the Committee understands that a terrorist attack could damage Australian interests overseas, but also would like more information on how organisations presented a direct threat to Australia domestically.
In addition, the Committee believes ASIO must take care to address all its own criteria for listing in the Statements of Reason.
The Committee is grateful for the input of Government agencies and members of the public into these reviews, and hopes that there will continue to be constructive debate on the matter.
Notwithstanding any of the above concerns, the Committee does not recommend to the Parliament that any of these regulations be disallowed.
I commend the report to the Senate.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Being a treaty tabled in this chamber by the government, this treaty will stand referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which I am a member, so I will have further opportunity for examination. I just want to take the opportunity to make a few brief comments on this. There will be further opportunity for the parliament through the treaties committee process.
It is worth noting, though, the peculiar circumstances surrounding the government’s decision to enter into the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. It is an action that has been advocated by many—by the opposition, by the Democrats and by others—but which the government was not only unwilling to do but also scathing about doing. Minister Downer came up with a range of reasons this was inappropriate, unacceptable and unworkable. We now have a situation where that position has been reversed. It is part of an arrangement or requirement that enabled Australia to be involved in meetings with South-East Asian nations. That is a development that should be welcomed. It is certainly welcomed by me. The general approach of engaging with nations in our region in this way is also one that I welcome.
But you do have to wonder why it was such a tortuous process and also why so many red herrings were put out along the way by the minister as to why this was a bad idea—particularly the farcical idea that, if we entered into a treaty of amity arrangement with South-East Asian nations, that would prohibit Australia from being able to make criticisms about the human rights records of nations such as Burma. The absurd aspect of that is that other South-East Asian nations such as Indonesia have actually been more vocal than Australia about the unacceptability of the Burmese regime, the Burmese military junta and their complete lack of progress in dealing with re-establishing democracy in that country, and some of the appalling human rights abuses.
The sad situation is that the federal government is actually softer on criticising the Burmese military dictatorship than a number of other nations that are part of ASEAN and that have signed up to the treaty of amity, and it is softer even than the US government. That is a pretty sad indictment on the willingness to turn a blind eye to a major human rights abuser and a major offender when it comes to subverting democracy and oppressing those that seek to fight for it. There is not even the excuse this time that it is a major trading partner, which is the excuse used for somewhere like China—not that I think that that is a reasonable excuse anyway. But they do not even have reasons like that.
Whilst this is a welcome move, I do think it is worth noting some of the spurious reasons that were used early on and in recent times by the federal government in not moving towards ratifying the treaty of amity. That is something that unnecessarily hindered improvements in our relationship with South-East Asian nations in areas where there needs to be improvement. I think there are significant grounds for optimism with the progress of a number of nations in our region—progress in a democratic sense as well as in an economic development sense. There are difficulties there, but working through a framework like this will actually assist our nation as well as other nations in the region. I think it is a sign that, once again, we had the Minister for Foreign Affairs taking a very longwinded, roundabout and unnecessarily complicated way of reaching a situation we should have been in much more easily and much more quickly.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-09,"—I rise tonight to speak about a serious matter that has distressed many Australians: a man who came to Australia to share our prosperity and security but rejected our traditions of tolerance and respect. Instead, he has been spreading propaganda of hatred and division, claiming that Australians who do not share his culture and his race are inferior. He disparages their capacity and denigrates their character. I am talking, of course, about Associate Professor Andrew Fraser.
Andrew Fraser recently garnered a great deal of publicity for himself by making inflammatory and racist remarks. I will not mince words. To claim, as Fraser did, that a person’s intellect, their ability and their character can be judged by the colour of their skin is plain and simple racism. As a result, Macquarie University felt that the risk to public safety on campus was so great they had to suspend Associate Professor Fraser from teaching. Subsequently, when Fraser continued to use his academic position and title to buttress his racist statements, Macquarie University Vice-Chancellor Di Yerbury determined to continue that suspension until Fraser’s retirement next year.
As the perhaps inevitable result of that action, the usual suspects such as Paddy McGuinness and Mr Brendan Nelson have come out claiming Andrew Fraser as a martyr for the cause of free speech. There have been the usual predictable statements. I quote the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson:
Those who so strongly argue for free speech and academic freedom and rigour, I think they should strongly disagree with what he’s said if that’s their view ... but nonetheless respect the fact that he as an academic has a right to express it.
I am absolutely in favour of free speech. I am absolutely in favour of academic freedom and rigour. Entirely by accident, the minister has got right to the core of the issue, although, as usual, he has completely misunderstood it. The action taken by Macquarie University is about academic freedom and academic rigour. One cannot be detached from the other. Academic freedom is founded on academic rigour. Associate Professor Fraser represented opinion as fact and bigotry as science. When he used his lectern as a bully pulpit to preach hatred and intolerance, he laid down the burden of academic rigour and surrendered the privilege of academic freedom.
For all the misguided and confused comments by people such as Brendan Nelson, Andrew Fraser is still as free as any other member of the community to speak his mind. Freedom of speech, amongst other things, means being free to express an opinion without government persecution. Andrew Fraser is hardly in danger of government persecution. As with Pauline Hanson, we see Howard government ministers rushing forward in support, very vocal in defending the rights of those who vilify and attack other Australians yet strangely silent about the rights of those vilified and those attacked. Although still free to speak, Associate Professor Andrew Fraser is no longer able to use his position with Macquarie University as a megaphone to make himself heard more loudly than his fellow citizens.
That is the reality of free speech. A university lecturer, an opinion columnist or, indeed, a politician is free to speak but also privileged to be heard. A Chinese migrant woman in south-western Sydney or an Afghani girl in Baxter detention centre have no such luck. As far as the media are concerned, their speech is so free it is worthless. But how free is any speech? Australians are not free to defame or threaten each other. Our freedom of speech is not the right to make jokes about carrying a bomb on an airplane, nor the right to advertise cigarettes. It is not the right to incite or advocate violence. These are just a few of the many restrictions on speech in Australia. Every civilised community since history began has had to negotiate this balance between individual liberties and mutual respect. We lift those restrictions for some of our citizens in certain circumstances—that is, politicians speaking in parliament, lawyers and judges in the courtroom and, yes, academics in the classroom. We grant those people privileged exemptions from the laws that apply to other Australians in the expectation that those exemptions will only be used for the purpose intended.
Free speech is never quite free; it always has limitations and it always has costs. In Australia we accept that limitations should be placed on speech that harms other people. Defamatory speech hurts an individual and hate speech hurts many people. In fact, it hurts our whole community. It strains the bonds which have made Australia so resilient in the face of adversity. It weakens us as a nation and it diminishes us all as Australians. I do not intend to give Mr Fraser’s comments greater currency by repeating them in detail. I want to note one particularly invidious tendency in these remarks: the repeated false contrast he tries to draw between ‘ordinary Australians’ and those people Andrew Fraser does not like the look of—those he maligns and vilifies.
Andrew Fraser’s victims are ordinary Australians. They are ordinary Australians who can trace their family history back to every corner of the globe, to places as near as Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and China and to places as far away as Italy, Peru, England, Turkey, Kenya and Canada. They share with other Australians the same hopes and dreams: good health, a secure job, a safe home and a good school for their children. Those hopes and dreams are hardly extravagant or unreasonable, but it is these hopes and dreams which are threatened by the intolerance that Andrew Fraser has inflamed.
Andrew Fraser may think that a typical Australian is the sun-bronzed, blonde, blue-eyed Aussie but, as everyone in this place knows, being Australian goes deeper than a tan and a bottle of peroxide. When we talk of the Australian spirit at Eureka or Gallipoli, we remember how Australians will risk life and limb for the sake of a mate in danger. That great Australian Sister Elizabeth Kenny developed quite a tan during her work as a bush nurse, but we prize and honour her determination in her fight to help those most vulnerable and in need—that is, paralysed polio patients. The words ‘a fair go’ are typically Australian; the words of Andrew Fraser are not.
But those few atypical Australians emboldened by the widespread media coverage of Andrew Fraser’s views and the spurious authority his university affiliation gave his bigotry have done tremendous damage in our community similar to that which occurred when John Howard defended Pauline Hanson. As a member of the Chinese community, I remember well the rise in racist incidents and the hurt and the fear of those days. Now racist poster and pamphlet activity similar to that undertaken by the neo-Nazi Patriotic Youth League, of which Fraser has said he approves, has increased. There has been a reported increase in racist hate mail. Perhaps the most horrible irony is that one family, having fled their home in the Sudan in fear of their lives, have now had to flee their new home in Toowoomba.
These victims of the thuggery and intimidation are ordinary Australians who, like the parents, grandparents or great-great-grandparents of everybody in this place, came here to build Australia into the nation it is today: a country whose calibre is a tribute to the extraordinary qualities of ordinary Australians. Our great country has the great values of tolerance and of mutual respect for all Australians. We the Australian community have a responsibility to protect each other from vilification and abuse, and Macquarie University has a responsibility as an institution to prevent its name being used as a shield for someone perpetrating that kind of vilification and abuse.
Let us contrast on the one hand Andrew Fraser, who associates with the views of people who commit violent acts against their fellow citizens and delights in the vilification of his fellow Australians, with the responsible parties at Macquarie University who acted to protect the safety of staff, students and visitors and the integrity of the university and who sought to undo the damage Fraser did to the integrity of our Australian community. These were responsible and compassionate acts. In striving to balance intellectual freedom with academic responsibility and to weigh individual privilege against community needs, Macquarie University sets an example. And those in the opinion pages and on the government benches bleating about a wholly imaginary censorship would do better to apply to their own actions Macquarie University’s principles of rigour and responsibility and the values of cooperation and compassion.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Associate Professor Andrew Fraser</title>,Adjournment,21,1
