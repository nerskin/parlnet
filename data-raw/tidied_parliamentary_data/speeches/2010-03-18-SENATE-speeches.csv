"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-03-18,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Economics References Committee for inquiry and report by 24 June 2010:
allegations of abuse, recently widely reported in the Australian media, against employees, volunteers and followers (including ex‑employees, ex‑volunteers and ex‑followers) of the Church of Scientology and any associated entities, including:
coerced abortions,
unsafe occupational health and safety practices,
unconscionable, misleading and deceptive conduct in the context of goods and services provided and charged for by the Church of Scientology and any associated entities, and
the harassment of followers and ex-followers of the Church of Scientology and any associated entities;
the adequacy of the Model Criminal Code and its application in respect of the offence of psychological harm;
the adequacy of current consumer protection laws in respect of goods and services provided by the Church of Scientology and any associated entities, and its fundraising practices generally;
the adequacy of current occupational health and safety laws and workplace relations laws in respect of the allegations of conduct occurring within the Church of Scientology and any associated entities; and
any related matters.
That in undertaking this inquiry, the committee will not inquire into the validity or otherwise of the belief systems of the Church of Scientology and any associated entities.
This relates to matters that were in part dealt with last week. We are back again, dealing with the concerns that have been put to me by many Australians who are former members of the Church of Scientology. These individuals have told terrible stories of horrendous abuse. The intent of last week’s motion, as is the intent of this week’s motion, was to have an inquiry where people can have their say. The reason people need to have their say is that they need a voice. They need an opportunity to speak out safely in the context of a Senate committee where consideration can be given to whether we need to change the law so that people, such as those who have approached me, can get the protection they deserve as Australian citizens.
The issues are these. Initially, several months ago, when I spoke out about this organisation—which I see as a dangerous organisation that engages in criminal activity on a systematic basis—I put up a motion that there be a specific look at the Church of Scientology. It was put to me privately by a number of colleagues—and I will not name them because what they put to me was very much in good faith and with goodwill—that it would be more appropriate that there be a broader discussion about the tax-free status of charities and religious organisations as to whether a public benefit test should apply, as is the case in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has a test that has been in place for many of years, which has withstood rigorous examination and which looks at the public benefit an organisation does balanced by the harms of that organisation. It is interesting to note that in the United Kingdom the Church of Scientology has had difficulty in getting a tax-free status because of their activities, because of the harm caused and because of the nature of the organisation and the way it is structured. Secrecy has something to do with that to a considerable degree.
That motion for an inquiry was not successful because it was deemed to be too broad an inquiry. I accept fully that those senators who spoke to me privately, thinking this was a way forward, did so in good faith. I am back to square one in a sense in looking at a specific inquiry into this organisation that does not—and I emphasise does not and will not—inquire into the validity or otherwise of the belief systems of the Church of Scientology and any associated entities.
This is not about religious belief. This is not about belief systems, this is about behaviour. There is a fundamental difference. I do not want to stand in the way, and nor should this place stand in the way, of questioning a person’s belief systems, but when we have mounting evidence of cases of abuse, of cases where this organisation says it is above the law because of its own court system—a parallel court system, it seems, to the laws of this nation—then I think that is worth looking at. I think it is worth looking at because no-one should be above the law; no organisation should be above the law.
This motion follows extensive media reports—we saw one on Four Corners last week about this organisation; the Sunday Night program on Channel 7 looked at the Church of Scientology—and it is important that we look at these allegations of abuse made against employees, volunteers and followers, including by ex-employees, ex-volunteers and ex-followers of the Church of Scientology and all of its associated entities. A number of very disturbing practices have been alleged, including coerced abortions; unsafe occupational health and safety practices; unconscionable, misleading and deceptive conduct in the context of goods and services provided and charged for by the Church of Scientology and other associated entities; and the harassment of followers and ex-followers. These are matters that ought to be looked at in the context of a Senate inquiry because a Senate inquiry can hear the evidence and make recommendations. I emphasise and note that there will be ample opportunity for the organisation, for the Church of Scientology, to give its evidence fairly before any inquiry so that those former followers, the victims of the church, can give their evidence. They can be questioned, as can the Church of Scientology.
But we need to look at the adequacy of the Model Criminal Code. We need to look at whether there should be a definition of psychological harm in our laws and whether our current laws, for instance in relation to stalking and harassment, are adequate. I say they are not, because the evidence that has been put to me by many followers, ex-followers of the Church of Scientology, is that the modus operandi of this organisation is that they will have numerous operatives from this organisation harassing people, and our current anti-stalking and harassment laws are inadequate because they relate to one individual harassing someone on a continual, a repeated, basis. But where you have a situation where a number of individuals from the same organisation, on a daily basis on some occasions—day in, day out—harassing people, it is very hard to get a conviction under our current laws because there are different individuals involved in doing this, not one organisation. That is a flaw in the current law and that is something I believe a Senate inquiry could look at.
It also needs to look at the adequacy of current consumer protection laws in respect of the goods and services provided by this organisation and the tactics they employ, and I say they are unconscionable tactics. They are getting people to part with their money or to sign over their homes by using incredible high-pressure tactics and people lose their homes to this so-called ‘church’. These are matters that I think need to be the subject of scrutiny. Do we need stronger trade practices laws, laws that relate to this sort of unconscionable behaviour? It seems that our current laws are too narrow. And if somebody wants to take on the church, this is an organisation that has spent literally tens of millions of dollars in its annual budgets in years gone by to take on people, to sue them for defamation, to basically, in many cases, render people bankrupt because they cannot afford to take on the very deep pockets of the Church of Scientology in litigation. There is no access to justice for these individuals when you are talking about an organisation that can spend millions and millions of dollars on any one piece of litigation.
There is also an issue about the adequacy of current occupational health and safety laws as they apply to those followers, those who have worked, who have volunteered for this organisation. So many people have come forward and told me about their work, that they were working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and getting paid $30, $40, $50 a week, or less than that. I was told this morning outside the front of Parliament House that if you were really lucky you could get $50 a week. Here we have a government which has put up fair work legislation repealing Work Choices, and I commend the government for doing that. But here are some horrendous stories of occupational health and safety breaches, industrial relations breaches, which I believe our current laws do not adequately cover, and that concerns me deeply.
I just wanted to read a statement that was made to the media yesterday, and I want to read it onto the record because I think it is important to do so. It is from Janette Lang, who very courageously and bravely spoke out about her experiences in the Church of Scientology. I want to read in full what she said to the media, to the public yesterday, because it took a lot of courage on her part and I am very grateful that she has done so. Her statement goes as follows:
My name is Janette Lang and for 13 years I was a member of the Church of Scientology.
I cannot find the words to express the damage that has been done to me by this organisation, and the hardships that members are forced to endure.
I have never told this story publicly, in fact, I haven’t even told members of my family.
But I am speaking out today because the time has come for victims of Scientology to be heard.
When I was 20 years old I fell pregnant to my boyfriend.
At the time he had been recently recruited into the Church.
When his Scientology bosses found out about the pregnancy, they told him that I had to have an abortion or it would ruin his career as a Scientologist and destroy any chance of me being accepted by the organisation.
We fought for a week. I was devastated, I felt abused. I was lost ... and eventually I gave in.
On the day I had the abortion I asked not to be fully sedated just in case I got the courage to say ‘no’ and pull out of the operation.
But I was fully sedated, and the operation took place.
It was my baby, my body and my choice, and all that was taken away from me by Scientology.
After the abortion my partner did not even pick me up.
Scientology would not allow him to leave work.
In 2002 my husband and I were separated by the Church.
My husband was told to go to America to train as a spiritual counsellor and if I objected I was told I would be kicked out of the Church and never see him again.
While he was over there I was forbidden from contacting him.
After a year we agreed to divorce.
At the time I was a full member of Scientology. I worked full-time, making just $2000 a year.
At nights I would be forced to stay and work back until 2am, with my five-year-old and eight-month-old daughters sleeping on the couch in the office.
In 2003 I fell pregnant again to another man who was studying to be a Scientologist.
I was put through the Scientologist court system because of this relationship, and was ultimately ordered by an official of the Canberra church to have another abortion.
If I didn’t do this I would be cut off from the organisation. My children would not be able to see their father, I would not be able to see my sister and I was told I would get cancer and die.
I am speaking out today because I know I am not alone.
There are others that have gone through what I have gone through, and I am scared that more people will go through the same horrors unless there is an inquiry.
All we want is a chance to have our say to a Senate Inquiry.
And I say to Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott, please don’t make us suffer in silence.
They are powerful words, from a woman on whose part it took a lot of courage to speak out. I think it is important that we hear those words. I am very grateful also to Liz and James Anderson, who spoke out on Four Corners and met a number of my colleagues and senators yesterday. I am very grateful to all of my colleagues that had meetings with Liz and James and Janette. All of them gave them a sympathetic and fair hearing. I am very grateful for the decency of my colleagues for doing that. They saw as many people as they could yesterday, and I was very impressed at the decency of my colleagues on both sides who were prepared to see these people at short notice to hear their story. I am very grateful for that.
I believe having a Senate inquiry is the best way forward. This is about law reform, about the protections we need to give to individuals that are caught up in organisations which behave unconscionably, unfairly and in some cases absolutely brutally. It is important that we have this inquiry. To say that this goes to the police indicates, I think, a lack of knowledge in the way that the police operate and their constraints. It is not a criticism of the police forces in this nation. They are constrained by our current laws. Our harassment laws and our laws in respect to psychological harm are not adequate.
I refer honourable senators to the Model Criminal Code, which has not, as I understand it, been adopted fully in relation to psychological harm in the states. It states:
Harm to a person’s mental health includes significant psychological harm, but does not include mere ordinary emotional reactions such as those of only distress, grief, fear or anger.
That is fair enough. But it is interesting to note what was said by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee in relation to consideration of the psychological harm back in September 1998. They received a number of submissions. I think this extract is quite revealing in terms of the way this organisation operates to stifle debate, to stifle people having their human rights being respected. The committee report said, in relation to submissions made about psychological harm:
...the Church of Scientology produced a very lengthy submission which argued that the activities of religious groups should not be included but rather that the activities of “de-programmers” should be included. The manifesting inconsistency in such an approach did not appear to occur to them. There was also apparent a letter writing campaign to similar effect. Neither the Church of Scientology nor the letter writers addressed the undoubted fact that some groups employee such harmful and extreme techniques, whether or not a particular group does in fact do so. It is likely that some groups from both sides of the contest between religious groups and ‘deprogrammers’, employ harmful and extreme techniques.
I think that ‘manifest inconsistency’ of this organisation ought to be noted. It was noted by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and it indicates, I think, a need for law reform in terms of harassment laws and the issue of psychological harm.
There are also, broadly, the issues of protecting consumers in this country. Liz and James Anderson, for instance, spent something like $450,000 on courses for this church. It is the very different from other religions. But this is not about a person’s religious beliefs; it is about the high-pressure tactics that are employed for people to part with their money, to sign over their houses, to work for years and years and years for a pittance. At the end of that they have nothing. They have to restart their lives again in order to provide for their families, in order to get on with their lives to be able to even afford a down payment on a home. They are left with nothing. I spoke to people outside the front of Parliament House this morning and a number of our colleagues visited them. I was very grateful that Senator Christine Milne and Senator Ludlam from the Australian Greens spoke to them and very grateful for the support that Senator Milne gave to Janette yesterday at a media conference in relation to this. I am grateful that the member for Bass, Jodie Campbell, came out and spoke to these people. I am very grateful for Jodie Campbell’s support in terms of speaking to them and hearing their stories. I am also grateful for Senators Joyce and Scullion coming out and speaking to them.
I urge my colleagues to reconsider their position. If you say that this is not the way forward, then tell me what is the way forward. These are Australians who have been treated horrendously, without recourse to justice and without recourse even to telling their stories. The time has come for them to tell their stories safely and for us as legislators to look at some fundamental reforms so that people can be treated decently.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,27,1
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I will say at the outset that I appreciate the sincerity and the passion that Senator Xenophon brings to this issue. I know it is genuine, and I know he seeks to represent people who have been damaged by their engagement with the Church of Scientology. I think, though, that we have had difficulty in responding to Senator Xenophon’s various motions on the subject, as he seeks with his normal persistence to get support for a proposition that effectively would have the Senate inquire into the Church of Scientology. He has packaged it in different ways. Today he stressed some of the legal issues and consumer issues and other things that he would like to have examined, but I think Senator Xenophon is honest enough to say that at the heart of this is an inquiry into the Church of Scientology and how they react and interact with their members.
I acknowledge that the concerns Senator Xenophon raises are serious. The evidence of persons he referred to who have been in parliament over the past day or two and others who have been in the media is quite disturbing. In response, though, we have seen this before. There were similar allegations about the operations of the Exclusive Brethren, into whose activities Senator Bob Brown sought to have a similar type of inquiry. I am happy that, for once, I can say with some confidence that the government has been totally consistent on this matter. I responded to the issues that Senator Brown raised in relation to the activities of the Exclusive Brethren in the same way that I do today to those Senator Xenophon raised in relation to the Church of Scientology.
I am no fan of sects or religions that look to control their members. In fact, I am passionately opposed to such activity. To be brutally frank, I am not a great supporter of what I have seen of the operations of either the Exclusive Brethren or the Church of Scientology, but that is a personal opinion and should be valued no more highly than anyone else’s personal opinion about these organisations. But what I am strongly against is any suggestion that Senate committee processes be used in a way that I do not think fits with the role of the Senate. It is tempting to address some of these concerns in that way, but the role of the Senate is to inquire into issues of public policy and public administration. We do have to use our powers and capacity wisely. It would be very easy for Senate committee processes to be brought into disrepute if people thought these processes were being used for purposes beyond the Senate’s role in public policy and public administration.
I have a fundamental concern about our saying that we are going to have an inquiry into a particular organisation, because at various times a majority in this chamber will have a view about a particular organisation. At times there might have been a majority in this chamber in favour of inquiring into the Wilderness Society or into the CFMEU and the way it operates. It is very appealing for some. I see Senator Abetz’s eyebrows being raised. He is thinking, ‘That has some merit,’ because of his particular concerns about that union, but I think on this issue Senator Abetz has fundamentally been consistent as well—and I am worried that we actually agree on this matter as it is very rare that we do agree. But think through what happens if you single out an organisation and say that the Senate is going to inquire into it because it wants to use that inquiry to air claims about that organisation, to allow people under parliamentary privilege to make claims about those organisations—not in a court but to make very serious claims of criminal behaviour as referred to by Senator Xenophon—and to have them tested by the Senate in a Senate hearing.
The Senate is not a court of law. We do not have the protection and the processes that a court of law has. We are a group of senators who come together to inquire into issues of public policy and public interest. I think it is a fundamentally dangerous step for us to say that we are going to inquire into particular organisations and allow people to make their claims in regard to those organisations—not claims about policies but claims about personal treatment and, very fundamentally to the issues Senator Xenophon raises, claims about criminal behaviour. I think this is a step that the Senate ought to consider very carefully, and the government takes the view that we should not take that step. As I said, we responded to the claims about the Exclusive Brethren the same way. I would respond to claims about the Menzies Research Institute, the CFMEU or the Wilderness Society in the same way. It is a very dangerous thing for us to have what could be seen as a witch-hunt against an individual organisation, be it a religion, a trade union, a community organisation or a company. I do not think that is a step we ought to take.
However, I do regard the allegations made by Senator Xenophon and the former members of the Church of Scientology very seriously. They are allegations, in large part, about criminal behaviour. We have always argued that those matters ought to be referred to the police: if people have issues of concern that involve alleged criminal behaviour, the police are the appropriate authority to go to. I understand that Senator Xenophon, when he received earlier advice regarding allegations of criminal behaviour, did take those allegations to the Australian Federal Police—I think at the end of last year. I understand that the AFP made a preliminary assessment of the allegations and advised Senator Xenophon that, unless there was further evidence of a Commonwealth offence, the allegations he raised would be best brought to the attention of state police, which has been done, and it is the appropriate thing to do. Senator Xenophon has sought today and in other debates to focus on some of the policy issues around these concerns, but I think fundamentally it is about having an inquiry into the Church of Scientology, bringing forward witnesses who are concerned about their treatment and airing those claims. As I said, that has some appeal, but I think there are some serious concerns that really need to be considered by the Senate before we go down that path.
I am personally open to trying to assist Senator Xenophon to find a way through on this. We have dealt with, over the years in Australia, real difficulties in tackling activities of sects or religions that have perhaps too much control over their members or are closed organisations. The claims about the Exclusive Brethren were not the first. The Church of Scientology will not be the last. There have been a range of sects over the years about which there have been concerns with the way that they have related to their members and the way that they have operated. That is of public concern. We need to work out how we deal with those more properly. Senator Xenophon referred to psychological issues of control and other things. These are not easily dealt with by state laws or by state police departments. That is a fair point. He identifies a serious public policy issue about how government authorities, police authorities and law enforcement authorities should respond to those problems.
But my view, and the government’s view, is that a Senate inquiry is not the way to go. A Senate inquiry into a particular organisation is not the way forward. We need to deal with these claims in way such that procedural fairness, respect for people’s rights in terms of claims made against them, people’s ability to defend themselves adequately and protection against capricious or badly motivated claims—all those sorts of issues that we have to take seriously—are maintained. Those things are not address properly in the Senate inquiry process. The government will not be supporting this particular proposal by Senator Xenophon. It is not the first and I am sure that it will not be the last. Persistence is one of his great traits, and he is dealing with a serious issue. But I do not think that this is the answer.
On a personal level, I am prepared to engage in how we might come up with a better answer. The issue of the Exclusive Brethren troubled me, this troubles me and claims about other sects have troubled me. I think that as political leaders and public policy makers we need to work through how we adequately respond to very serious allegations against these sorts of organisations but equally against other community based organisations.
As I said, we understand Senator Xenophon’s motives. I am sympathetic, obviously, to those who have provided their concerns to him and publicly. We need to be able to respond to those. But I do not think that this is the way forward. It is not an attempt to fob Senator Xenophon off, but I fundamentally think that the Senate ought to be very cautious about how it proceeds in inquiring into individual organisations.
I recall that the Howard government had a majority in this place only a little while ago. A precedent that said that one could inquire into individual organisations may look very attractive to someone who has a majority in this place. It may look very attractive to a coalition of interests in this place. I am not sure that we want to set a precedent like that, which would be set if Senator Xenophon’s motion is carried, so we will be opposing it, consistent with the position that we have taken on the other matters that Senator Xenophon has raised and consistent with our response to the matters that Senator Brown raised in relation to the Exclusive Brethren.
Maybe what our focus should be is how we actually organise public administration and law enforcement in this nation to allow such concerns and claims to be properly tested and responded to in a way that is not looking at any particular organisation. We need to establish a framework. I am happy to continue to look at that issue and take up any ideas that come forward from Senator Xenophon or others. But we will not be supporting the resolution.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,27,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-03-18,"—I thought that the coalition might wish to speak on this, but clearly not. I am also very aware that we have a number of Senate reports to discuss in a very short time, so I am not going to take all the time that is available. But I want to say how very disappointed that I am at the contribution from Senator Evans for the government. I have no doubt about his sincerity when he says that he is concerned about these organisations. But the excuse that the government uses every single time that the issue of cults is brought to this Senate is that they will not inquire into an organisation. The terms of reference of this particular inquiry are very clear. They are looking into the appropriateness of exemptions in regards to tax law, occupational health and safety practices—which is again the responsibility of the Commonwealth—and the adequacy of consumer protection. All of these things are responsibilities of this parliament. To stand here and say, ‘Oh, that’s code for a general look and therefore we’re not going there,’ is to suggest that Senate committees are incapable of framing an inquiry to its terms of reference. It is to suggest that Senate chairs and committees cannot ask witnesses to be relevant to the terms of reference. Of course they can. What we have here is a total copout.
We heard the government and the coalition when they were in government saying, ‘Oh, yes, we’re terribly concerned about this happening.’ But they never offer any solutions. How are you going to address it, then? We are going to have a tax law debate here very shortly and we are going to be looking at the tax benefits provided to those who invest in managed investment schemes. So it is okay to have a debate on the appropriateness of tax deductions upfront on managed investment schemes and changes to the tax law in relation to that. But when it comes to talking about tax laws as they pertain to religious or any other organisations, religious organisations are not allowed to be discussed in this Senate. Why not? Why shouldn’t we be able to apply the public benefit test?
You will find that most religious organisations would be able to come here and talk about that. The United Church would talk about Uniting Care. The Anglican Church would talk about Anglicare. The Catholic Church would talk about St Vincent de Paul, their education systems, their health systems and their welfare provisions. There are an endless number of things that those religious organisations could and would talk about in the event that they were ever asked.
In Britain, there is a public benefits test. We talk all the time about which organisations and initiatives should have tax deductibility. We talk all the time about accelerated depreciation for private sector business and so on. Why would we not ask about the appropriateness of tax deductibility or tax exemption for this particular group of people in our society? It seems to me that in this country if you want to get a huge tax benefit, if you want to completely abuse the health and safety laws of this country, if you want to have absolutely no scrutiny of how you extract money from the people in your organisation and how you spend it, then you need only declare yourself to be a religion and you will be immune. Can you imagine any other workplace where people are exploited, are expected to work long hours every single day of the year and are paid very poorly, but about which everybody says, ‘No, we wouldn’t go into that workplace’? Unions are trying to support people in workplaces yet we have non-unionised workplaces about which we say, ‘We don’t want to know. We don’t want to know if people are exploited. We don’t want to know how they raise their money or how they spend it.’ In fact, this is an ideal scenario for someone: all you have to do is declare yourself to be a religion and you can declare yourself exempt from scrutiny of the laws of Australia, whether they relate to raising money, occupational health and safety, wages, exploitation or brainwashing—the whole shebang.
I heard this morning, for example, that this organisation puts pressure on parents to sign over the guardianship of their children, as young as eight years old, to part of the organisation. Senator Bernardi said the other day, ‘Leave then, if you don’t like it.’ That suggests no understanding of the level of brainwashing that goes on in this particular cult, or in the Exclusive Brethren for that matter, because if you leave you leave behind contact with your children, parents, siblings and/or friends—all of the group that you have spent your time with. You are harassed. You are cut off. Everyone in this parliament knows what it is like when you fall out with friends, family or whomever for whatever reason and how difficult that is to manage. But imagine if you were being coerced. Imagine if you had this kind of pressure. Yesterday, Senator Xenophon read out a statement from an ex-member of the Scientology group. We heard about a situation where people were being pressured into doing things that they did not want to do. You cannot walk away from that. A belief system that is enforced through the levels of psychological coercion really bothers me and it should not be exempt from public scrutiny.
Having said that, what has the government or the coalition done since they both expressed concern about what is going on in the Exclusive Brethren cult? Nothing. When truth in advertising legislation was introduced to stop these kinds of cults putting out election advertising material that told blatant lies, what did they say? They said, ‘No, we don’t want truth in advertising.’ We even had the Liberal party lying, saying that they had nothing to do with Exclusive Brethren advertising and then being forced to admit after a state election that Damien Mantach, a former director of the Liberal party in Tasmania, was up to his neck in it, that they had written, authorised and placed ads with complete lies attacking the Greens. This is a problem we have—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. I think that expression has always been viewed as being unparliamentary and I think it is not unreasonable to view it as being directed at this side. I ask the Senator to withdraw.
 (Senator Crossin)—Senator Milne, I am sure you will be careful with your choice of words in this instance.
—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I believe the parliamentary expression is ‘a stranger to the truth’. I will use the parliamentary expression for the words I used—that is, the pamphlets were a stranger to the truth.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, a point of order: I know it is always very difficult for a Green to say they got it wrong but the standing orders do require an unequivocal withdrawal and I seek such an unequivocal withdrawal.
—I withdraw the term ‘lie’, but I point out that Damien Mantach, a friend of Senator Abetz, had to admit in court that the Liberal party placed and wrote those advertisements for the Exclusive Brethren, having said previously that they had nothing to do with them and had no knowledge of them.
Returning to Senator Xenophon’s motion, it is inexcusable for this parliament to turn its back on group of people who are bringing forward allegations of not adhering to Commonwealth law. That is what I am asking about. I want to see occupational health and safety laws enforced in Australia. I want to see appropriate tax deductibility, tax exemptions and so on, because every time you have an organisation not paying tax there is a dollar less to be spent on health, welfare and all the things the community agrees we need to spend money on. If you say they should not pay tax then they should be able to demonstrate a public benefit. I think that is a reasonable expectation from the community.
I hear around this parliament that once again we are not going to have support for an investigation into the appropriateness of the tax law, we are not going to have an investigation into occupational health and safety practices, we are not going to have an investigation into not adhering to the laws in relation to fair remuneration in this country and we are not going to have an investigation into the adequacy of consumer protection. So I ask the government and the coalition to tell me how they are going to address these matters if we are not going to have a Senate inquiry. Saying, ‘Go to the police,’ is no good because if you go to the police you have to have evidence to get a conviction. But from where are you going to get people to come forward and give evidence, when clearly part of the allegation is that people are brainwashed and coerced and their families are harassed? If someone wants to give evidence, there is absolutely no doubt there will be other people inside the sect giving evidence against them—people reinforce all the fears and divisions that are going on in those communities. It is an unrealistic expectation and they know it, which is why we need to have a Senate inquiry into compliance with Australian law.
I think it is disgraceful and cowardly for the Senate not to support this motion, which seeks the law to be applied and which calls for an investigation into whether or not the law as it pertains to this matter is being applied in Australia and into the appropriateness of the law as it stands. I say to Senator Xenophon that I have been moving on every single tax law in relation to tax exemption for carbon sink forests. I suggest that he should join me on every single tax bill that comes through here from now on. He can join me. I will move mine on exemptions for carbon sink forests and he can move his on exemptions for this, and we will have this debate every time until the government or the coalition comes up with a suggestion about how they intend to deal with it if it is not going to be through a Senate inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,27,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-03-18,"—I indicate on behalf of the coalition that we will not be supporting the motion. To seek to curtail the time on this debate—I know it is not the usual thing to do—I would draw the attention of those who want to reflect on the reasons and rationale, to the speech I gave on Thursday, 11 March in the Senate Hansard, commencing on page 19, because that sets out a lot of the reasons. I once again put on the record that we accept that Senator Xenophon comes to this with sincerity and genuineness, but I would also ask him—and Senator Milne, without her getting too upset about these things—to understand that men and women of good will can approach a topic and come to different conclusions as to how a matter or an issue ought be dealt with. But we so often see the extreme nature of the Australian Greens in that it has to be their way or the highway. There is no shade of grey; it has to be completely their way.
I have been asked, in relation to a number of matters—I dare say rhetorically—that if this is not the way forward, what is? Interestingly enough, given that I have led the coalition in this debate, I have received a lot of emails for and against this inquiry. There is one former scientologist who has emailed me to say that they have reported a matter to the New South Wales Police and it is being investigated. I say to that person, ‘Well done. That’s the proper way to go.’
I thank Senator Xenophon for bringing three former scientologists to my office yesterday afternoon. I see them in the gallery and I thank them for the time that they spent with me. As a result of that discussion I simply say—and I will say this now publicly—that, in relation to the allegations made by Senator Xenophon about people working long hours and not being paid for them, I publicly call on the Fair Work Ombudsman to examine the records. We have a Fair Work Ombudsman in this country—formerly the Workplace Ombudsman, now with a different name—who has the power, on the basis of a complaint, to examine such things. Indeed, of his own volition the Ombudsman could undertake an examination. I make that public call today for the Fair Work Ombudsman to follow up, and I will also give him notice that at Senate estimates in May I will be asking the Fair Work Ombudsman what he has done in relation to this matter.
In relation to allegations of taxation I say they should be reported to the Australian Taxation Office. I remember on one occasion I had concerns about the way the Australian Greens were dealing with their situations financially in relation to the electoral laws. I did not seek a Senate inquiry into it. I reported the matter to the Australian Electoral Commission and they undoubtedly made a determination.
Similarly, I have very real problems and concerns about the way the Wilderness Society does business, which has now been highlighted. Let us remind ourselves that the Wilderness Society is the industrial arm of the Australian Greens. They have now descended into a fiasco, with court orders being issued against each other. An AGM was held here, which was declared illegal, and another AGM held. They are in absolute disarray. The temptation is sweet to have a Senate inquiry into the Wilderness Society. But would it be the right thing to do? I have to say that I think the answer is no. What I have done in the past in relation to the Wilderness Society is refer my concerns to the Australian Taxation Office. They have, I believe, according to law, dealt with those matters appropriately.
In this public debate about whether there should be such an inquiry I have heard raised all manner of arguments, including that we have had inquiries into Australia Post. Yes, we did; but, with respect, that is a government business enterprise, and I would say that that is different. Has the Senate had an inquiry into whether Tasmania ought to have an AFL team? Yes, we have. But, despite being a Tasmanian and passionately wanting a Tasmanian team in the ALF, I got some criticism in my home state of Tasmania for not supporting such a move—because I thought it was inappropriate.
I would like to think that I—and the coalition—come to this debate with absolutely clean hands and a consistency of purpose. I ask those in this place: do we have the power to have such an investigation? You betchya; absolutely. But the way individual freedoms are protected in this country is not by the government or the parliament using all the powers that are potentially available to it.
In relation to the motion dealing with unconscionable, misleading and deceptive conduct, I am reminded of a leader of a political party in this place, who claimed that if he had to pay his legal bills he would become bankrupt and would therefore have to forfeit his seat in the Senate. The bill was only about $200,000. He had assets and a capacity to mortgage and get a loan. Nevertheless, he put that out there—aided and abetted by a nearly compliant and sycophantic media in this country. He said, ‘I am opening an account or people can donate.’ And donate they did. He raised $200,000. But, when the required amount of money had been raised, did he put out a media release saying, ‘Stop donating please; that which I have called for has come in’? No. He allowed the fund to keep going—didn’t he, Senator Milne?—from $200,000 to $400,000 to $600,000 to $800,000 to $1 million and more. People were genuinely donating thinking they were saving Senator Bob Brown from bankruptcy and expulsion from the Senate when he already had more than $200,000—more than the money needed—in his own back pocket. I say ‘in his own back pocket’ because the money was paid into an account that only bore his signature—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I would ask Senator Abetz to withdraw that. As he well knows, Senator Brown has conformed to all of the disclosure provisions required in this parliament. All the details of that account are clearly there on the disclosure provisions of the parliament for everyone to see.
 (Senator Crossin)—Senator Milne, this is a debating point, but I will draw Senator Abetz’s attention to the motion that we have before us of Senator Xenophon’s.
—Which seeks an inquiry into unconscionable, misleading and deceptive conduct. I thought I was making the point so exceptionally well that it forced Senator Milne to seek to raise a spurious point of order. Those in the gallery listening and those reading the Hansard in the future will note that the allegation I made about the money going into his personal account only bearing his signature was not denied. It is a great sense of disclosure when you can put in $10,000 anonymously. That is disclosure, according to the Australian Greens. But enough of that. All I am saying is that people that want to come to this debate need to come with clean hands. Senator Xenophon does, and I accept that without doubt. I say to some of the others in this debate that their own conduct may not necessarily be in the same category as Senator Xenophon’s.
It is my very strong view that these matters that are complained about should be going to the appropriate authority. I met with a young group of Mormons just the other day. It was interesting. They put in a submission to the Henry tax review about tax deductibility for church organisations. I wonder whether other organisations have done so, because that could have and would have been a good and appropriate vehicle for some of these things to be canvassed. We still await the outcome of the Henry tax review. I will not be holding my breath that we will be seeing that any time soon, but let us hope that we do see it some time before the budget. Given that the Australian people paid for it, I dare say they are entitled to see it as well. Once again, it may be asserted that I digress, albeit slightly.
In relation to the email traffic that has come to my account in recent days, there is a lot of ‘He said’, ‘She said’. ‘My name is being used in public,’ according to one. ‘I categorically deny the allegations’ was the email that came back. Should we, as a Senate, try to set ourselves up as a judge and jury to decide between ‘He said’ and ‘She said’? I do not think so. Unfortunately, that is what we will be asked to do when we have to determine things such as whether people had coerced abortions. For somebody who is about as anti-abortion as one can be, this is a very painful and concerning topic. I do not like abortions full stop, let alone coercive ones. It is a very serious matter.
I recall my time as a lawyer dealing with people that believed they had been coerced into having an abortion by mums and dads who were of the view that if the pregnancy went ahead it would bring shame upon the family. The tears and the heartbreak were just as real, undoubtedly, as those that were coaxed and coerced whilst they were with Scientology. But are we going to have an inquiry into all those coerced abortions? I also know of examples where mainly menfolk—it does not reflect well on us—were coercing girlfriends to have abortions, with similar pain and similar trauma. Do we inquire into those coerced abortions as well or do we say that only when an organisation coerces somebody into an abortion is it worthy of inquiry? We have to be very careful as to the path we seek to go down in relation to these matters.
With these issues, to use terms such as Senator Milne did, that this is a total copout by Senator Chris Evans, does not really add any maturity, any intellectual rigour or, indeed, any compassion to the debate. What I would invite honourable senators to do is to consider the principles.
People are sometimes harassed when they leave organisations. I know it happens from time to time when someone ‘rats’ on their political party. I saw what happened to somebody who left the Greens. I saw what happened to somebody who was a sitting senator in this place when he decided to leave the Australian Labor Party and sit on the crossbenches. Do we have an inquiry into the Greens and the ALP for their harassment of these individuals? Let me say quite clearly that I am sure that that may well have been the case for people who left the Liberal Party as well—that people may well have reacted with a considerable degree of displeasure. I dare say that if former Senator Don Chipp were still alive he might be able to tell some stories about some of the harassment he may have suffered when he left the Liberal Party to form the Australian Democrats. Do we really want to have full-scale inquiries into these things?
The issue is whether the law is being abided by. That is the threshold test. If the tax law is being breached, the case should be taken to the tax office. If employment laws are being breached, the case should be taken to the Fair Work Ombudsman. If occupational health and safety laws are being breached, the case should be taken to Safe Work Australia. And so the list goes on. If there has been false imprisonment, the case should be raised with the police. We have the crime of false imprisonment on our statute books.
In relation to the capacity of people to air their concerns and grievances, I say to you, Senator Xenophon, that you have done a fantastic job. You have aired people’s concerns and grievances exceptionally well. The media have also aired those concerns. They have shown an orange traffic signal—if not a red one—to people, cautioning them that, before they get involved in the Church of Scientology, they may well want to think not once or twice but many times, given the very genuine and heartfelt stories of those who see and quite rightly describe themselves as victims of the Church of Scientology.
I leave my comments there simply to sum up as I began: we accept the sincerity with which Senator Xenophon approaches this matter, but I ask him to accept that men and women of goodwill can look at an issue and come to different conclusions.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,27,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-03-18,"—I will not go over old ground in summing up the debate on this motion, but I want to make this clear to my colleagues: mark my words that, if this vote goes down, I will be talking about it again in the first sitting week after the break. There will be another motion. This issue will not go away.
I thank my colleagues for their contributions. Senator Milne, thank you for your support and for the compassion that you showed to Janette Lang yesterday. I am very grateful for that. I am also grateful for the contribution of Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who spoke on this motion today. He said a number of things that indicated to me that the language of the government on this issue has shifted in the last week. Last week the government was saying, ‘We’ve got the Henry tax review; we’re not going to look at this.’ That was it, basically. I do not take issue with that. The government is entitled to go down that path. But I think there has been a shift in the government’s language. There is genuine concern about what is going on in the Church of Scientology and about whether the laws of this nation are adequate to protect those people who are victims of the Church of Scientology, both those who have escaped from the Church of Scientology and those who are still in it.
I will refer to the contribution of Senator Abetz in more detail in a moment, but there is consistency between the government and Senator Abetz in that they both opposed a past motion on the Exclusive Brethren and now oppose a motion on the Church of Scientology. But sometimes consistency can be bad if you are consistent for the wrong reasons. Senator Evans says that we should use the Senate committee process wisely to look at issues of public policy, public administration and matters in the public interest. I think that fairly summarises the position of Senator Evans. Surely it is in the public interest to look at these allegations in the context of whether the laws of this nation are adequate to protect people in cases of horrendous abuses of their human rights and where they have become destitute because they have worked for an organisation for years and years for a pittance. Surely it is in the public interest to look at whether our consumer protection laws can afford protection in relation to serious allegations where people have lost everything.
We have had an inquiry into occupational health and safety matters at Australia Post. The fact that Australia Post is a statutory body does not mean that we should not have an inquiry into the Church of Scientology. The Church of Scientology is still a separate organisation. There were specific allegations relating to Australia Post, and the Senate thought that it should go down the path of an inquiry into occupational health and safety issues there. But the matters raised here in relation to the Church of Scientology are much more serious.
Regarding Senator Evans’s comment that we are not a court of law, that is true—it is axiomatic: we are not a court of law and we are not here to make judgments of guilt or innocence. But, if a Senate inquiry heard evidence about alleged criminal conduct, or conduct that may not be criminal under our current laws but begs the question of whether, firstly, laws are being adequately enforced or, secondly, there ought to be some fundamental law reform, surely they are matters in the public interest. It is not for us to make findings of guilt or innocence—that is not our job. But, if allegations are brought forward, it begs the question of whether our laws are adequate. If they are not adequate we ought to look at law reform. That is what we should be doing here.
This is about allegations not just of criminal behaviour but of unconscionable behaviour such as psychological harm that are not covered by our laws, and that should be an issue for this inquiry. This is a serious public policy issue. I know what the position of the government and the opposition is, but I implore my colleagues to think of it in these terms. If we have an inquiry we will hear from a number of victims of the Church of Scientology. That might take a day or two of hearings. No doubt we will hear from the Church of Scientology, because they have been outspoken and they had a right of reply, which they exercised, to the comments that I made about that organisation a number of months ago. That is a fair and right thing to do. If the Church of Scientology says, ‘We don’t do these sorts of things; we think it’s wrong and outrageous,’ then surely they will not have a problem with our laws being changed to protect people from the circumstances that have been alleged. I think that the language of the government has changed in relation to this and I undertake here and now to engage with Senator Evans and other members of the government to see if there is a way forward so that these legitimate grievances can be dealt with such that people can have a voice and actually get some justice.
At the meeting this morning it was interesting to see how the Church of Scientology treats this place and the laws of this nation. It has a separate court system which strikes terror into the heart of anyone who is a member of the Church of Scientology. I spoke to a woman recently who was dragged before a so-called court process for days and days and days—a kangaroo court set up under the rules of the Church of Scientology. It was interesting that today a couple of goons from the Church of Scientology were in attendance, as I understand it. They were busy taking photographs of people at the very peaceful, civil meeting of former members of the Church of Scientology. They were quite happy to take photos of members of parliament as well. These people think they are above the law and they are not.
I am grateful for Senator Abetz’s time yesterday and the genuine and sincere way that he met with and discussed the concerns of former members—Liz and James Anderson and Janette Lang. I am very appreciative of that. Senator Abetz is right: you can have goodwill on an issue and there are different ways of approaching it. I am glad he will call on the Fair Work Ombudsman to look at these matters and will take it up at estimates. But I suggest to Senator Abetz that current laws are not adequate when you deal with this organisation, because, if you speak out or make a complaint, you are cut off from your family—you are cut off from every support mechanism that you know. You are left completely alone, and that raises some big issues and big public policy questions. But, again, I am grateful to Senator Abetz for taking this up and seeking the intervention of the Fair Work Ombudsman also. I congratulate him for doing so.
Senator Abetz raised some tax issues. Again, I appreciate the context in which Senator Abetz raised these matters. They were raised in good faith and with goodwill and I do appreciate that. But, on the whole issue of our current taxation law, the decision of Justice Murphy—former Senator Murphy—in the High Court back in 1983 was quite transparent. It effectively indicated that you basically can get these tax benefits; we do not care what the norms are or what you believe in—that is it. I think that we need to look at the UK’s public benefit test. Senator Abetz raised the issue of ‘he said, she said’, particularly in relation to coerced abortions. I appreciate his genuine and passionate views in relation to this. My views are different: I believe that current abortion laws should stay as they are, particularly in my home state. I believe in a woman’s right to choose, but I also believe it should be a true choice and a free choice. And what we have heard about this organisation is that it is not. It was quite chilling to see the interview of Tommy Davis, spokesperson for the Church of Scientology in Los Angeles, by Four Corners. He said that if you are in the Sea Organisation—the Sea Org, their elite organisation—you cannot have children. The way he said it was quite chilling: ‘You cannot have children.’ How do they effect that? They put incredible pressure on women and on their partners to have an abortion. If you are in the Sea Org or, indeed, in other parts of Scientology and you have a child, you lose everything. My plea to Senator Abetz is that, if he is concerned about a ‘he said, she said’ approach, and if genuine concerns are raised, let’s look at that whole issue of forced abortions against the adequacy or inadequacy of our current criminal law on psychological harm and related matters.
Regarding harassment, Senator Abetz made the point that if you leave a political party you can be harassed. I saw some of the treatment that two members in the Legislative Council of the South Australian parliament got when they left the Labor Party—and I am sure it happens when you leave other political parties on both sides of the fence. That harassment might be a bit of abuse or vilification. What we are dealing with here is people being followed around the clock. They have people directly in their face. They are photographed. This morning, outside the front of Parliament House, one man told me how his house was under siege for 10 days. There was either a car outside or he was followed. That is not an uncommon story. I do not think anyone can reasonably say that any major political party would do that to their former members. They might give them some stick and a bit of grief, but nothing like this systematic abuse of people’s rights.
I want to thank again the senators, MPs and staffers who have taken the time this week to talk to victims of Scientology. One of the main reasons so many victims tell me they want an inquiry into allegations of abuse within Scientology is that they believe there is some sort of therapeutic benefit in speaking out. As they emerge from an organisation whose very existence appears to rely on secrecy, they say they achieve real benefit from having someone publicly acknowledge their suffering. But it is much more than the therapeutic benefit, that cathartic benefit, of speaking out. It is because what is raised raises fundamental issues as to whether the laws of this nation need to be changed to protect individuals—whether we need to have that reform.
I expect that some senators have genuine reasons for wondering whether a Senate inquiry is the right way forward. One concern that has been raised with me is that a Senate inquiry could somehow be seen to be some kind of religious witch-hunt. Nothing could be further from the truth. I understand the fears, but I truly believe those fears are baseless. The terms of reference in this new motion specifically say that the inquiry is not to examine the beliefs of Scientology, only the behaviour of its members. It is there in black and white. I ask my fellow senators to consider what a slavish adherence to this stance might mean. If the Senate says we cannot inquire into the behaviour of any organisation if it claims to be a religion, haven’t we just given the green light to anyone who wants to be able to abuse others without scrutiny, without any accountability? Haven’t we just told those people, ‘Do what you like, abuse people, coerce abortion, commit fraud, exploit children, break up families, incarcerate followers, and as long as you call yourself a religion you can guarantee that we will look the other way’? That may not be what this parliament is saying, but I can tell you that is what some people are hearing. Is that what we were elected to do?
Other senators have argued that if there is evidence of criminal activity people should go to the police. The problem is that in a number of jurisdictions in this country some abuses are just not illegal; that the current Criminal Code, our laws, has not kept up with the behaviour of these organisations. I have said that Janette Lang bravely spoke yesterday, and I read her full statement into the Hansard. She spoke yesterday just a few metres from here in the Senate courtyard about how she was forced by Scientology bosses and by her Scientology boyfriend to have abortions. She was told that if she did not she would be cut off from her religion, her contacts, her support network and her husband and she would die of cancer. As she put it, it was her baby, her body, her choice, and Scientology took that all away from her.
Is this appalling? Of course. Is this illegal? In most places in Australia, the sad truth is probably not. What do you think would happen to Janette if she showed up at your average suburban police station with her story? Does anyone think seriously that there could be an investigation, let alone charges? The problem, as I see it, with being here in this place is that we can all be lulled into a false sense of security. There is a danger of thinking that just because we pass a law or another parliament passes a law it will be enforced. But, for most people, life does not happen in here; it happens out there. Out there, the victims of Scientology have suffered in silence for decades.
The criminal law safeguards that some are quoting in here have not protected anyone out there. There are defects and people fall through gaping cracks in the system. Others have suggested that critics pursued by Scientology should use stalking laws to protect themselves. But what happens if you are followed by a different person from the same organisation every day? There are no laws in this country to deal with institutional stalking like that. Yet critics of Scientology, ex-members and journalists say that is what happens. What are the victims to do then?
The truth is that most politicians will, if they really want to, be able to find an excuse not to act, but over time excuses wear thin especially with victims who continue to suffer. But I do want to acknowledge Senator Evans and Senator Abetz and the very considered way they have put forward their position. I think there is a shift, a shift in the major parties in dealing with this, because they know this issue will not go away. The victims of Scientology just want the opportunity to speak out safely. One suggestion was that the victims turn to the media. Some have, and some will continue to do so. I promise you all now that I will help them as much as I can. But let us not pretend that the media do not get worried about long and expensive, albeit groundless, law suits that could cost a network millions of dollars and years of litigation, even when the stories are 100 per cent true.
Remember: this is an organisation that has spent tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of dollars over the years silencing its critics in the courts. Ex-members say that Scientology sees the bankrupting of a critic as a victory. Ex-members and other critics have also claimed to have been followed, harassed, blackmailed and threatened after speaking out. Don’t we have an obligation to find a way to allow victims of Scientology to speak out safely? If we do not find a way to listen that will protect them, who will?
Let me be clear. If this motion goes down, I will come back in the next sitting week with another motion, and if that goes down I will come back with another and another. I will also continue to engage with my colleagues—with Senator Abetz, with Senator Evans—about a way forward. If there is another way forward to deal with these grievances, then I will be happy to hear it and work collaboratively with my colleagues on this. From what I am being told privately, I believe those stories of suffering are starting to cut through with many of my colleagues, and I understand why. My office and I have been listening to these heartbreaking stories for the last six months, so my challenge to my fellow politicians is simple: if you vote this down, if you say no today, please come back to me and talk to me about a way forward. The victims of Scientology want to be heard and I believe they deserve to be heard. It is time for all of us to stop thinking of new ways to say no and start thinking about better ways to say yes. It is time to stop talking about what we cannot do and start talking about what we can do for these people. I commend this motion.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Xenophon’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,27,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-03-18,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Economics References Committee for inquiry and report by 24 June 2010:
allegations of abuse, recently widely reported in the Australian media, against employees, volunteers and followers (including ex‑employees, ex‑volunteers and ex‑followers) of the Church of Scientology and any associated entities, including:
coerced abortions,
unsafe occupational health and safety practices,
unconscionable, misleading and deceptive conduct in the context of goods and services provided and charged for by the Church of Scientology and any associated entities, and
the harassment of followers and ex-followers of the Church of Scientology and any associated entities;
the adequacy of the Model Criminal Code and its application in respect of the offence of psychological harm;
the adequacy of current consumer protection laws in respect of goods and services provided by the Church of Scientology and any associated entities, and its fundraising practices generally;
the adequacy of current occupational health and safety laws and workplace relations laws in respect of the allegations of conduct occurring within the Church of Scientology and any associated entities; and
any related matters.
That in undertaking this inquiry, the committee will not inquire into the validity or otherwise of the belief systems of the Church of Scientology and any associated entities.
This relates to matters that were in part dealt with last week. We are back again, dealing with the concerns that have been put to me by many Australians who are former members of the Church of Scientology. These individuals have told terrible stories of horrendous abuse. The intent of last week’s motion, as is the intent of this week’s motion, was to have an inquiry where people can have their say. The reason people need to have their say is that they need a voice. They need an opportunity to speak out safely in the context of a Senate committee where consideration can be given to whether we need to change the law so that people, such as those who have approached me, can get the protection they deserve as Australian citizens.
The issues are these. Initially, several months ago, when I spoke out about this organisation—which I see as a dangerous organisation that engages in criminal activity on a systematic basis—I put up a motion that there be a specific look at the Church of Scientology. It was put to me privately by a number of colleagues—and I will not name them because what they put to me was very much in good faith and with goodwill—that it would be more appropriate that there be a broader discussion about the tax-free status of charities and religious organisations as to whether a public benefit test should apply, as is the case in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has a test that has been in place for many of years, which has withstood rigorous examination and which looks at the public benefit an organisation does balanced by the harms of that organisation. It is interesting to note that in the United Kingdom the Church of Scientology has had difficulty in getting a tax-free status because of their activities, because of the harm caused and because of the nature of the organisation and the way it is structured. Secrecy has something to do with that to a considerable degree.
That motion for an inquiry was not successful because it was deemed to be too broad an inquiry. I accept fully that those senators who spoke to me privately, thinking this was a way forward, did so in good faith. I am back to square one in a sense in looking at a specific inquiry into this organisation that does not—and I emphasise does not and will not—inquire into the validity or otherwise of the belief systems of the Church of Scientology and any associated entities.
This is not about religious belief. This is not about belief systems, this is about behaviour. There is a fundamental difference. I do not want to stand in the way, and nor should this place stand in the way, of questioning a person’s belief systems, but when we have mounting evidence of cases of abuse, of cases where this organisation says it is above the law because of its own court system—a parallel court system, it seems, to the laws of this nation—then I think that is worth looking at. I think it is worth looking at because no-one should be above the law; no organisation should be above the law.
This motion follows extensive media reports—we saw one on Four Corners last week about this organisation; the Sunday Night program on Channel 7 looked at the Church of Scientology—and it is important that we look at these allegations of abuse made against employees, volunteers and followers, including by ex-employees, ex-volunteers and ex-followers of the Church of Scientology and all of its associated entities. A number of very disturbing practices have been alleged, including coerced abortions; unsafe occupational health and safety practices; unconscionable, misleading and deceptive conduct in the context of goods and services provided and charged for by the Church of Scientology and other associated entities; and the harassment of followers and ex-followers. These are matters that ought to be looked at in the context of a Senate inquiry because a Senate inquiry can hear the evidence and make recommendations. I emphasise and note that there will be ample opportunity for the organisation, for the Church of Scientology, to give its evidence fairly before any inquiry so that those former followers, the victims of the church, can give their evidence. They can be questioned, as can the Church of Scientology.
But we need to look at the adequacy of the Model Criminal Code. We need to look at whether there should be a definition of psychological harm in our laws and whether our current laws, for instance in relation to stalking and harassment, are adequate. I say they are not, because the evidence that has been put to me by many followers, ex-followers of the Church of Scientology, is that the modus operandi of this organisation is that they will have numerous operatives from this organisation harassing people, and our current anti-stalking and harassment laws are inadequate because they relate to one individual harassing someone on a continual, a repeated, basis. But where you have a situation where a number of individuals from the same organisation, on a daily basis on some occasions—day in, day out—harassing people, it is very hard to get a conviction under our current laws because there are different individuals involved in doing this, not one organisation. That is a flaw in the current law and that is something I believe a Senate inquiry could look at.
It also needs to look at the adequacy of current consumer protection laws in respect of the goods and services provided by this organisation and the tactics they employ, and I say they are unconscionable tactics. They are getting people to part with their money or to sign over their homes by using incredible high-pressure tactics and people lose their homes to this so-called ‘church’. These are matters that I think need to be the subject of scrutiny. Do we need stronger trade practices laws, laws that relate to this sort of unconscionable behaviour? It seems that our current laws are too narrow. And if somebody wants to take on the church, this is an organisation that has spent literally tens of millions of dollars in its annual budgets in years gone by to take on people, to sue them for defamation, to basically, in many cases, render people bankrupt because they cannot afford to take on the very deep pockets of the Church of Scientology in litigation. There is no access to justice for these individuals when you are talking about an organisation that can spend millions and millions of dollars on any one piece of litigation.
There is also an issue about the adequacy of current occupational health and safety laws as they apply to those followers, those who have worked, who have volunteered for this organisation. So many people have come forward and told me about their work, that they were working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and getting paid $30, $40, $50 a week, or less than that. I was told this morning outside the front of Parliament House that if you were really lucky you could get $50 a week. Here we have a government which has put up fair work legislation repealing Work Choices, and I commend the government for doing that. But here are some horrendous stories of occupational health and safety breaches, industrial relations breaches, which I believe our current laws do not adequately cover, and that concerns me deeply.
I just wanted to read a statement that was made to the media yesterday, and I want to read it onto the record because I think it is important to do so. It is from Janette Lang, who very courageously and bravely spoke out about her experiences in the Church of Scientology. I want to read in full what she said to the media, to the public yesterday, because it took a lot of courage on her part and I am very grateful that she has done so. Her statement goes as follows:
My name is Janette Lang and for 13 years I was a member of the Church of Scientology.
I cannot find the words to express the damage that has been done to me by this organisation, and the hardships that members are forced to endure.
I have never told this story publicly, in fact, I haven’t even told members of my family.
But I am speaking out today because the time has come for victims of Scientology to be heard.
When I was 20 years old I fell pregnant to my boyfriend.
At the time he had been recently recruited into the Church.
When his Scientology bosses found out about the pregnancy, they told him that I had to have an abortion or it would ruin his career as a Scientologist and destroy any chance of me being accepted by the organisation.
We fought for a week. I was devastated, I felt abused. I was lost ... and eventually I gave in.
On the day I had the abortion I asked not to be fully sedated just in case I got the courage to say ‘no’ and pull out of the operation.
But I was fully sedated, and the operation took place.
It was my baby, my body and my choice, and all that was taken away from me by Scientology.
After the abortion my partner did not even pick me up.
Scientology would not allow him to leave work.
In 2002 my husband and I were separated by the Church.
My husband was told to go to America to train as a spiritual counsellor and if I objected I was told I would be kicked out of the Church and never see him again.
While he was over there I was forbidden from contacting him.
After a year we agreed to divorce.
At the time I was a full member of Scientology. I worked full-time, making just $2000 a year.
At nights I would be forced to stay and work back until 2am, with my five-year-old and eight-month-old daughters sleeping on the couch in the office.
In 2003 I fell pregnant again to another man who was studying to be a Scientologist.
I was put through the Scientologist court system because of this relationship, and was ultimately ordered by an official of the Canberra church to have another abortion.
If I didn’t do this I would be cut off from the organisation. My children would not be able to see their father, I would not be able to see my sister and I was told I would get cancer and die.
I am speaking out today because I know I am not alone.
There are others that have gone through what I have gone through, and I am scared that more people will go through the same horrors unless there is an inquiry.
All we want is a chance to have our say to a Senate Inquiry.
And I say to Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott, please don’t make us suffer in silence.
They are powerful words, from a woman on whose part it took a lot of courage to speak out. I think it is important that we hear those words. I am very grateful also to Liz and James Anderson, who spoke out on Four Corners and met a number of my colleagues and senators yesterday. I am very grateful to all of my colleagues that had meetings with Liz and James and Janette. All of them gave them a sympathetic and fair hearing. I am very grateful for the decency of my colleagues for doing that. They saw as many people as they could yesterday, and I was very impressed at the decency of my colleagues on both sides who were prepared to see these people at short notice to hear their story. I am very grateful for that.
I believe having a Senate inquiry is the best way forward. This is about law reform, about the protections we need to give to individuals that are caught up in organisations which behave unconscionably, unfairly and in some cases absolutely brutally. It is important that we have this inquiry. To say that this goes to the police indicates, I think, a lack of knowledge in the way that the police operate and their constraints. It is not a criticism of the police forces in this nation. They are constrained by our current laws. Our harassment laws and our laws in respect to psychological harm are not adequate.
I refer honourable senators to the Model Criminal Code, which has not, as I understand it, been adopted fully in relation to psychological harm in the states. It states:
Harm to a person’s mental health includes significant psychological harm, but does not include mere ordinary emotional reactions such as those of only distress, grief, fear or anger.
That is fair enough. But it is interesting to note what was said by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee in relation to consideration of the psychological harm back in September 1998. They received a number of submissions. I think this extract is quite revealing in terms of the way this organisation operates to stifle debate, to stifle people having their human rights being respected. The committee report said, in relation to submissions made about psychological harm:
...the Church of Scientology produced a very lengthy submission which argued that the activities of religious groups should not be included but rather that the activities of “de-programmers” should be included. The manifesting inconsistency in such an approach did not appear to occur to them. There was also apparent a letter writing campaign to similar effect. Neither the Church of Scientology nor the letter writers addressed the undoubted fact that some groups employee such harmful and extreme techniques, whether or not a particular group does in fact do so. It is likely that some groups from both sides of the contest between religious groups and ‘deprogrammers’, employ harmful and extreme techniques.
I think that ‘manifest inconsistency’ of this organisation ought to be noted. It was noted by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and it indicates, I think, a need for law reform in terms of harassment laws and the issue of psychological harm.
There are also, broadly, the issues of protecting consumers in this country. Liz and James Anderson, for instance, spent something like $450,000 on courses for this church. It is the very different from other religions. But this is not about a person’s religious beliefs; it is about the high-pressure tactics that are employed for people to part with their money, to sign over their houses, to work for years and years and years for a pittance. At the end of that they have nothing. They have to restart their lives again in order to provide for their families, in order to get on with their lives to be able to even afford a down payment on a home. They are left with nothing. I spoke to people outside the front of Parliament House this morning and a number of our colleagues visited them. I was very grateful that Senator Christine Milne and Senator Ludlam from the Australian Greens spoke to them and very grateful for the support that Senator Milne gave to Janette yesterday at a media conference in relation to this. I am grateful that the member for Bass, Jodie Campbell, came out and spoke to these people. I am very grateful for Jodie Campbell’s support in terms of speaking to them and hearing their stories. I am also grateful for Senators Joyce and Scullion coming out and speaking to them.
I urge my colleagues to reconsider their position. If you say that this is not the way forward, then tell me what is the way forward. These are Australians who have been treated horrendously, without recourse to justice and without recourse even to telling their stories. The time has come for them to tell their stories safely and for us as legislators to look at some fundamental reforms so that people can be treated decently.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,27,2
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I will say at the outset that I appreciate the sincerity and the passion that Senator Xenophon brings to this issue. I know it is genuine, and I know he seeks to represent people who have been damaged by their engagement with the Church of Scientology. I think, though, that we have had difficulty in responding to Senator Xenophon’s various motions on the subject, as he seeks with his normal persistence to get support for a proposition that effectively would have the Senate inquire into the Church of Scientology. He has packaged it in different ways. Today he stressed some of the legal issues and consumer issues and other things that he would like to have examined, but I think Senator Xenophon is honest enough to say that at the heart of this is an inquiry into the Church of Scientology and how they react and interact with their members.
I acknowledge that the concerns Senator Xenophon raises are serious. The evidence of persons he referred to who have been in parliament over the past day or two and others who have been in the media is quite disturbing. In response, though, we have seen this before. There were similar allegations about the operations of the Exclusive Brethren, into whose activities Senator Bob Brown sought to have a similar type of inquiry. I am happy that, for once, I can say with some confidence that the government has been totally consistent on this matter. I responded to the issues that Senator Brown raised in relation to the activities of the Exclusive Brethren in the same way that I do today to those Senator Xenophon raised in relation to the Church of Scientology.
I am no fan of sects or religions that look to control their members. In fact, I am passionately opposed to such activity. To be brutally frank, I am not a great supporter of what I have seen of the operations of either the Exclusive Brethren or the Church of Scientology, but that is a personal opinion and should be valued no more highly than anyone else’s personal opinion about these organisations. But what I am strongly against is any suggestion that Senate committee processes be used in a way that I do not think fits with the role of the Senate. It is tempting to address some of these concerns in that way, but the role of the Senate is to inquire into issues of public policy and public administration. We do have to use our powers and capacity wisely. It would be very easy for Senate committee processes to be brought into disrepute if people thought these processes were being used for purposes beyond the Senate’s role in public policy and public administration.
I have a fundamental concern about our saying that we are going to have an inquiry into a particular organisation, because at various times a majority in this chamber will have a view about a particular organisation. At times there might have been a majority in this chamber in favour of inquiring into the Wilderness Society or into the CFMEU and the way it operates. It is very appealing for some. I see Senator Abetz’s eyebrows being raised. He is thinking, ‘That has some merit,’ because of his particular concerns about that union, but I think on this issue Senator Abetz has fundamentally been consistent as well—and I am worried that we actually agree on this matter as it is very rare that we do agree. But think through what happens if you single out an organisation and say that the Senate is going to inquire into it because it wants to use that inquiry to air claims about that organisation, to allow people under parliamentary privilege to make claims about those organisations—not in a court but to make very serious claims of criminal behaviour as referred to by Senator Xenophon—and to have them tested by the Senate in a Senate hearing.
The Senate is not a court of law. We do not have the protection and the processes that a court of law has. We are a group of senators who come together to inquire into issues of public policy and public interest. I think it is a fundamentally dangerous step for us to say that we are going to inquire into particular organisations and allow people to make their claims in regard to those organisations—not claims about policies but claims about personal treatment and, very fundamentally to the issues Senator Xenophon raises, claims about criminal behaviour. I think this is a step that the Senate ought to consider very carefully, and the government takes the view that we should not take that step. As I said, we responded to the claims about the Exclusive Brethren the same way. I would respond to claims about the Menzies Research Institute, the CFMEU or the Wilderness Society in the same way. It is a very dangerous thing for us to have what could be seen as a witch-hunt against an individual organisation, be it a religion, a trade union, a community organisation or a company. I do not think that is a step we ought to take.
However, I do regard the allegations made by Senator Xenophon and the former members of the Church of Scientology very seriously. They are allegations, in large part, about criminal behaviour. We have always argued that those matters ought to be referred to the police: if people have issues of concern that involve alleged criminal behaviour, the police are the appropriate authority to go to. I understand that Senator Xenophon, when he received earlier advice regarding allegations of criminal behaviour, did take those allegations to the Australian Federal Police—I think at the end of last year. I understand that the AFP made a preliminary assessment of the allegations and advised Senator Xenophon that, unless there was further evidence of a Commonwealth offence, the allegations he raised would be best brought to the attention of state police, which has been done, and it is the appropriate thing to do. Senator Xenophon has sought today and in other debates to focus on some of the policy issues around these concerns, but I think fundamentally it is about having an inquiry into the Church of Scientology, bringing forward witnesses who are concerned about their treatment and airing those claims. As I said, that has some appeal, but I think there are some serious concerns that really need to be considered by the Senate before we go down that path.
I am personally open to trying to assist Senator Xenophon to find a way through on this. We have dealt with, over the years in Australia, real difficulties in tackling activities of sects or religions that have perhaps too much control over their members or are closed organisations. The claims about the Exclusive Brethren were not the first. The Church of Scientology will not be the last. There have been a range of sects over the years about which there have been concerns with the way that they have related to their members and the way that they have operated. That is of public concern. We need to work out how we deal with those more properly. Senator Xenophon referred to psychological issues of control and other things. These are not easily dealt with by state laws or by state police departments. That is a fair point. He identifies a serious public policy issue about how government authorities, police authorities and law enforcement authorities should respond to those problems.
But my view, and the government’s view, is that a Senate inquiry is not the way to go. A Senate inquiry into a particular organisation is not the way forward. We need to deal with these claims in way such that procedural fairness, respect for people’s rights in terms of claims made against them, people’s ability to defend themselves adequately and protection against capricious or badly motivated claims—all those sorts of issues that we have to take seriously—are maintained. Those things are not address properly in the Senate inquiry process. The government will not be supporting this particular proposal by Senator Xenophon. It is not the first and I am sure that it will not be the last. Persistence is one of his great traits, and he is dealing with a serious issue. But I do not think that this is the answer.
On a personal level, I am prepared to engage in how we might come up with a better answer. The issue of the Exclusive Brethren troubled me, this troubles me and claims about other sects have troubled me. I think that as political leaders and public policy makers we need to work through how we adequately respond to very serious allegations against these sorts of organisations but equally against other community based organisations.
As I said, we understand Senator Xenophon’s motives. I am sympathetic, obviously, to those who have provided their concerns to him and publicly. We need to be able to respond to those. But I do not think that this is the way forward. It is not an attempt to fob Senator Xenophon off, but I fundamentally think that the Senate ought to be very cautious about how it proceeds in inquiring into individual organisations.
I recall that the Howard government had a majority in this place only a little while ago. A precedent that said that one could inquire into individual organisations may look very attractive to someone who has a majority in this place. It may look very attractive to a coalition of interests in this place. I am not sure that we want to set a precedent like that, which would be set if Senator Xenophon’s motion is carried, so we will be opposing it, consistent with the position that we have taken on the other matters that Senator Xenophon has raised and consistent with our response to the matters that Senator Brown raised in relation to the Exclusive Brethren.
Maybe what our focus should be is how we actually organise public administration and law enforcement in this nation to allow such concerns and claims to be properly tested and responded to in a way that is not looking at any particular organisation. We need to establish a framework. I am happy to continue to look at that issue and take up any ideas that come forward from Senator Xenophon or others. But we will not be supporting the resolution.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,27,2
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-03-18,"—I thought that the coalition might wish to speak on this, but clearly not. I am also very aware that we have a number of Senate reports to discuss in a very short time, so I am not going to take all the time that is available. But I want to say how very disappointed that I am at the contribution from Senator Evans for the government. I have no doubt about his sincerity when he says that he is concerned about these organisations. But the excuse that the government uses every single time that the issue of cults is brought to this Senate is that they will not inquire into an organisation. The terms of reference of this particular inquiry are very clear. They are looking into the appropriateness of exemptions in regards to tax law, occupational health and safety practices—which is again the responsibility of the Commonwealth—and the adequacy of consumer protection. All of these things are responsibilities of this parliament. To stand here and say, ‘Oh, that’s code for a general look and therefore we’re not going there,’ is to suggest that Senate committees are incapable of framing an inquiry to its terms of reference. It is to suggest that Senate chairs and committees cannot ask witnesses to be relevant to the terms of reference. Of course they can. What we have here is a total copout.
We heard the government and the coalition when they were in government saying, ‘Oh, yes, we’re terribly concerned about this happening.’ But they never offer any solutions. How are you going to address it, then? We are going to have a tax law debate here very shortly and we are going to be looking at the tax benefits provided to those who invest in managed investment schemes. So it is okay to have a debate on the appropriateness of tax deductions upfront on managed investment schemes and changes to the tax law in relation to that. But when it comes to talking about tax laws as they pertain to religious or any other organisations, religious organisations are not allowed to be discussed in this Senate. Why not? Why shouldn’t we be able to apply the public benefit test?
You will find that most religious organisations would be able to come here and talk about that. The United Church would talk about Uniting Care. The Anglican Church would talk about Anglicare. The Catholic Church would talk about St Vincent de Paul, their education systems, their health systems and their welfare provisions. There are an endless number of things that those religious organisations could and would talk about in the event that they were ever asked.
In Britain, there is a public benefits test. We talk all the time about which organisations and initiatives should have tax deductibility. We talk all the time about accelerated depreciation for private sector business and so on. Why would we not ask about the appropriateness of tax deductibility or tax exemption for this particular group of people in our society? It seems to me that in this country if you want to get a huge tax benefit, if you want to completely abuse the health and safety laws of this country, if you want to have absolutely no scrutiny of how you extract money from the people in your organisation and how you spend it, then you need only declare yourself to be a religion and you will be immune. Can you imagine any other workplace where people are exploited, are expected to work long hours every single day of the year and are paid very poorly, but about which everybody says, ‘No, we wouldn’t go into that workplace’? Unions are trying to support people in workplaces yet we have non-unionised workplaces about which we say, ‘We don’t want to know. We don’t want to know if people are exploited. We don’t want to know how they raise their money or how they spend it.’ In fact, this is an ideal scenario for someone: all you have to do is declare yourself to be a religion and you can declare yourself exempt from scrutiny of the laws of Australia, whether they relate to raising money, occupational health and safety, wages, exploitation or brainwashing—the whole shebang.
I heard this morning, for example, that this organisation puts pressure on parents to sign over the guardianship of their children, as young as eight years old, to part of the organisation. Senator Bernardi said the other day, ‘Leave then, if you don’t like it.’ That suggests no understanding of the level of brainwashing that goes on in this particular cult, or in the Exclusive Brethren for that matter, because if you leave you leave behind contact with your children, parents, siblings and/or friends—all of the group that you have spent your time with. You are harassed. You are cut off. Everyone in this parliament knows what it is like when you fall out with friends, family or whomever for whatever reason and how difficult that is to manage. But imagine if you were being coerced. Imagine if you had this kind of pressure. Yesterday, Senator Xenophon read out a statement from an ex-member of the Scientology group. We heard about a situation where people were being pressured into doing things that they did not want to do. You cannot walk away from that. A belief system that is enforced through the levels of psychological coercion really bothers me and it should not be exempt from public scrutiny.
Having said that, what has the government or the coalition done since they both expressed concern about what is going on in the Exclusive Brethren cult? Nothing. When truth in advertising legislation was introduced to stop these kinds of cults putting out election advertising material that told blatant lies, what did they say? They said, ‘No, we don’t want truth in advertising.’ We even had the Liberal party lying, saying that they had nothing to do with Exclusive Brethren advertising and then being forced to admit after a state election that Damien Mantach, a former director of the Liberal party in Tasmania, was up to his neck in it, that they had written, authorised and placed ads with complete lies attacking the Greens. This is a problem we have—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. I think that expression has always been viewed as being unparliamentary and I think it is not unreasonable to view it as being directed at this side. I ask the Senator to withdraw.
 (Senator Crossin)—Senator Milne, I am sure you will be careful with your choice of words in this instance.
—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I believe the parliamentary expression is ‘a stranger to the truth’. I will use the parliamentary expression for the words I used—that is, the pamphlets were a stranger to the truth.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, a point of order: I know it is always very difficult for a Green to say they got it wrong but the standing orders do require an unequivocal withdrawal and I seek such an unequivocal withdrawal.
—I withdraw the term ‘lie’, but I point out that Damien Mantach, a friend of Senator Abetz, had to admit in court that the Liberal party placed and wrote those advertisements for the Exclusive Brethren, having said previously that they had nothing to do with them and had no knowledge of them.
Returning to Senator Xenophon’s motion, it is inexcusable for this parliament to turn its back on group of people who are bringing forward allegations of not adhering to Commonwealth law. That is what I am asking about. I want to see occupational health and safety laws enforced in Australia. I want to see appropriate tax deductibility, tax exemptions and so on, because every time you have an organisation not paying tax there is a dollar less to be spent on health, welfare and all the things the community agrees we need to spend money on. If you say they should not pay tax then they should be able to demonstrate a public benefit. I think that is a reasonable expectation from the community.
I hear around this parliament that once again we are not going to have support for an investigation into the appropriateness of the tax law, we are not going to have an investigation into occupational health and safety practices, we are not going to have an investigation into not adhering to the laws in relation to fair remuneration in this country and we are not going to have an investigation into the adequacy of consumer protection. So I ask the government and the coalition to tell me how they are going to address these matters if we are not going to have a Senate inquiry. Saying, ‘Go to the police,’ is no good because if you go to the police you have to have evidence to get a conviction. But from where are you going to get people to come forward and give evidence, when clearly part of the allegation is that people are brainwashed and coerced and their families are harassed? If someone wants to give evidence, there is absolutely no doubt there will be other people inside the sect giving evidence against them—people reinforce all the fears and divisions that are going on in those communities. It is an unrealistic expectation and they know it, which is why we need to have a Senate inquiry into compliance with Australian law.
I think it is disgraceful and cowardly for the Senate not to support this motion, which seeks the law to be applied and which calls for an investigation into whether or not the law as it pertains to this matter is being applied in Australia and into the appropriateness of the law as it stands. I say to Senator Xenophon that I have been moving on every single tax law in relation to tax exemption for carbon sink forests. I suggest that he should join me on every single tax bill that comes through here from now on. He can join me. I will move mine on exemptions for carbon sink forests and he can move his on exemptions for this, and we will have this debate every time until the government or the coalition comes up with a suggestion about how they intend to deal with it if it is not going to be through a Senate inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,27,2
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-03-18,"—I indicate on behalf of the coalition that we will not be supporting the motion. To seek to curtail the time on this debate—I know it is not the usual thing to do—I would draw the attention of those who want to reflect on the reasons and rationale, to the speech I gave on Thursday, 11 March in the Senate Hansard, commencing on page 19, because that sets out a lot of the reasons. I once again put on the record that we accept that Senator Xenophon comes to this with sincerity and genuineness, but I would also ask him—and Senator Milne, without her getting too upset about these things—to understand that men and women of good will can approach a topic and come to different conclusions as to how a matter or an issue ought be dealt with. But we so often see the extreme nature of the Australian Greens in that it has to be their way or the highway. There is no shade of grey; it has to be completely their way.
I have been asked, in relation to a number of matters—I dare say rhetorically—that if this is not the way forward, what is? Interestingly enough, given that I have led the coalition in this debate, I have received a lot of emails for and against this inquiry. There is one former scientologist who has emailed me to say that they have reported a matter to the New South Wales Police and it is being investigated. I say to that person, ‘Well done. That’s the proper way to go.’
I thank Senator Xenophon for bringing three former scientologists to my office yesterday afternoon. I see them in the gallery and I thank them for the time that they spent with me. As a result of that discussion I simply say—and I will say this now publicly—that, in relation to the allegations made by Senator Xenophon about people working long hours and not being paid for them, I publicly call on the Fair Work Ombudsman to examine the records. We have a Fair Work Ombudsman in this country—formerly the Workplace Ombudsman, now with a different name—who has the power, on the basis of a complaint, to examine such things. Indeed, of his own volition the Ombudsman could undertake an examination. I make that public call today for the Fair Work Ombudsman to follow up, and I will also give him notice that at Senate estimates in May I will be asking the Fair Work Ombudsman what he has done in relation to this matter.
In relation to allegations of taxation I say they should be reported to the Australian Taxation Office. I remember on one occasion I had concerns about the way the Australian Greens were dealing with their situations financially in relation to the electoral laws. I did not seek a Senate inquiry into it. I reported the matter to the Australian Electoral Commission and they undoubtedly made a determination.
Similarly, I have very real problems and concerns about the way the Wilderness Society does business, which has now been highlighted. Let us remind ourselves that the Wilderness Society is the industrial arm of the Australian Greens. They have now descended into a fiasco, with court orders being issued against each other. An AGM was held here, which was declared illegal, and another AGM held. They are in absolute disarray. The temptation is sweet to have a Senate inquiry into the Wilderness Society. But would it be the right thing to do? I have to say that I think the answer is no. What I have done in the past in relation to the Wilderness Society is refer my concerns to the Australian Taxation Office. They have, I believe, according to law, dealt with those matters appropriately.
In this public debate about whether there should be such an inquiry I have heard raised all manner of arguments, including that we have had inquiries into Australia Post. Yes, we did; but, with respect, that is a government business enterprise, and I would say that that is different. Has the Senate had an inquiry into whether Tasmania ought to have an AFL team? Yes, we have. But, despite being a Tasmanian and passionately wanting a Tasmanian team in the ALF, I got some criticism in my home state of Tasmania for not supporting such a move—because I thought it was inappropriate.
I would like to think that I—and the coalition—come to this debate with absolutely clean hands and a consistency of purpose. I ask those in this place: do we have the power to have such an investigation? You betchya; absolutely. But the way individual freedoms are protected in this country is not by the government or the parliament using all the powers that are potentially available to it.
In relation to the motion dealing with unconscionable, misleading and deceptive conduct, I am reminded of a leader of a political party in this place, who claimed that if he had to pay his legal bills he would become bankrupt and would therefore have to forfeit his seat in the Senate. The bill was only about $200,000. He had assets and a capacity to mortgage and get a loan. Nevertheless, he put that out there—aided and abetted by a nearly compliant and sycophantic media in this country. He said, ‘I am opening an account or people can donate.’ And donate they did. He raised $200,000. But, when the required amount of money had been raised, did he put out a media release saying, ‘Stop donating please; that which I have called for has come in’? No. He allowed the fund to keep going—didn’t he, Senator Milne?—from $200,000 to $400,000 to $600,000 to $800,000 to $1 million and more. People were genuinely donating thinking they were saving Senator Bob Brown from bankruptcy and expulsion from the Senate when he already had more than $200,000—more than the money needed—in his own back pocket. I say ‘in his own back pocket’ because the money was paid into an account that only bore his signature—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I would ask Senator Abetz to withdraw that. As he well knows, Senator Brown has conformed to all of the disclosure provisions required in this parliament. All the details of that account are clearly there on the disclosure provisions of the parliament for everyone to see.
 (Senator Crossin)—Senator Milne, this is a debating point, but I will draw Senator Abetz’s attention to the motion that we have before us of Senator Xenophon’s.
—Which seeks an inquiry into unconscionable, misleading and deceptive conduct. I thought I was making the point so exceptionally well that it forced Senator Milne to seek to raise a spurious point of order. Those in the gallery listening and those reading the Hansard in the future will note that the allegation I made about the money going into his personal account only bearing his signature was not denied. It is a great sense of disclosure when you can put in $10,000 anonymously. That is disclosure, according to the Australian Greens. But enough of that. All I am saying is that people that want to come to this debate need to come with clean hands. Senator Xenophon does, and I accept that without doubt. I say to some of the others in this debate that their own conduct may not necessarily be in the same category as Senator Xenophon’s.
It is my very strong view that these matters that are complained about should be going to the appropriate authority. I met with a young group of Mormons just the other day. It was interesting. They put in a submission to the Henry tax review about tax deductibility for church organisations. I wonder whether other organisations have done so, because that could have and would have been a good and appropriate vehicle for some of these things to be canvassed. We still await the outcome of the Henry tax review. I will not be holding my breath that we will be seeing that any time soon, but let us hope that we do see it some time before the budget. Given that the Australian people paid for it, I dare say they are entitled to see it as well. Once again, it may be asserted that I digress, albeit slightly.
In relation to the email traffic that has come to my account in recent days, there is a lot of ‘He said’, ‘She said’. ‘My name is being used in public,’ according to one. ‘I categorically deny the allegations’ was the email that came back. Should we, as a Senate, try to set ourselves up as a judge and jury to decide between ‘He said’ and ‘She said’? I do not think so. Unfortunately, that is what we will be asked to do when we have to determine things such as whether people had coerced abortions. For somebody who is about as anti-abortion as one can be, this is a very painful and concerning topic. I do not like abortions full stop, let alone coercive ones. It is a very serious matter.
I recall my time as a lawyer dealing with people that believed they had been coerced into having an abortion by mums and dads who were of the view that if the pregnancy went ahead it would bring shame upon the family. The tears and the heartbreak were just as real, undoubtedly, as those that were coaxed and coerced whilst they were with Scientology. But are we going to have an inquiry into all those coerced abortions? I also know of examples where mainly menfolk—it does not reflect well on us—were coercing girlfriends to have abortions, with similar pain and similar trauma. Do we inquire into those coerced abortions as well or do we say that only when an organisation coerces somebody into an abortion is it worthy of inquiry? We have to be very careful as to the path we seek to go down in relation to these matters.
With these issues, to use terms such as Senator Milne did, that this is a total copout by Senator Chris Evans, does not really add any maturity, any intellectual rigour or, indeed, any compassion to the debate. What I would invite honourable senators to do is to consider the principles.
People are sometimes harassed when they leave organisations. I know it happens from time to time when someone ‘rats’ on their political party. I saw what happened to somebody who left the Greens. I saw what happened to somebody who was a sitting senator in this place when he decided to leave the Australian Labor Party and sit on the crossbenches. Do we have an inquiry into the Greens and the ALP for their harassment of these individuals? Let me say quite clearly that I am sure that that may well have been the case for people who left the Liberal Party as well—that people may well have reacted with a considerable degree of displeasure. I dare say that if former Senator Don Chipp were still alive he might be able to tell some stories about some of the harassment he may have suffered when he left the Liberal Party to form the Australian Democrats. Do we really want to have full-scale inquiries into these things?
The issue is whether the law is being abided by. That is the threshold test. If the tax law is being breached, the case should be taken to the tax office. If employment laws are being breached, the case should be taken to the Fair Work Ombudsman. If occupational health and safety laws are being breached, the case should be taken to Safe Work Australia. And so the list goes on. If there has been false imprisonment, the case should be raised with the police. We have the crime of false imprisonment on our statute books.
In relation to the capacity of people to air their concerns and grievances, I say to you, Senator Xenophon, that you have done a fantastic job. You have aired people’s concerns and grievances exceptionally well. The media have also aired those concerns. They have shown an orange traffic signal—if not a red one—to people, cautioning them that, before they get involved in the Church of Scientology, they may well want to think not once or twice but many times, given the very genuine and heartfelt stories of those who see and quite rightly describe themselves as victims of the Church of Scientology.
I leave my comments there simply to sum up as I began: we accept the sincerity with which Senator Xenophon approaches this matter, but I ask him to accept that men and women of goodwill can look at an issue and come to different conclusions.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,27,2
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-03-18,"—I will not go over old ground in summing up the debate on this motion, but I want to make this clear to my colleagues: mark my words that, if this vote goes down, I will be talking about it again in the first sitting week after the break. There will be another motion. This issue will not go away.
I thank my colleagues for their contributions. Senator Milne, thank you for your support and for the compassion that you showed to Janette Lang yesterday. I am very grateful for that. I am also grateful for the contribution of Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who spoke on this motion today. He said a number of things that indicated to me that the language of the government on this issue has shifted in the last week. Last week the government was saying, ‘We’ve got the Henry tax review; we’re not going to look at this.’ That was it, basically. I do not take issue with that. The government is entitled to go down that path. But I think there has been a shift in the government’s language. There is genuine concern about what is going on in the Church of Scientology and about whether the laws of this nation are adequate to protect those people who are victims of the Church of Scientology, both those who have escaped from the Church of Scientology and those who are still in it.
I will refer to the contribution of Senator Abetz in more detail in a moment, but there is consistency between the government and Senator Abetz in that they both opposed a past motion on the Exclusive Brethren and now oppose a motion on the Church of Scientology. But sometimes consistency can be bad if you are consistent for the wrong reasons. Senator Evans says that we should use the Senate committee process wisely to look at issues of public policy, public administration and matters in the public interest. I think that fairly summarises the position of Senator Evans. Surely it is in the public interest to look at these allegations in the context of whether the laws of this nation are adequate to protect people in cases of horrendous abuses of their human rights and where they have become destitute because they have worked for an organisation for years and years for a pittance. Surely it is in the public interest to look at whether our consumer protection laws can afford protection in relation to serious allegations where people have lost everything.
We have had an inquiry into occupational health and safety matters at Australia Post. The fact that Australia Post is a statutory body does not mean that we should not have an inquiry into the Church of Scientology. The Church of Scientology is still a separate organisation. There were specific allegations relating to Australia Post, and the Senate thought that it should go down the path of an inquiry into occupational health and safety issues there. But the matters raised here in relation to the Church of Scientology are much more serious.
Regarding Senator Evans’s comment that we are not a court of law, that is true—it is axiomatic: we are not a court of law and we are not here to make judgments of guilt or innocence. But, if a Senate inquiry heard evidence about alleged criminal conduct, or conduct that may not be criminal under our current laws but begs the question of whether, firstly, laws are being adequately enforced or, secondly, there ought to be some fundamental law reform, surely they are matters in the public interest. It is not for us to make findings of guilt or innocence—that is not our job. But, if allegations are brought forward, it begs the question of whether our laws are adequate. If they are not adequate we ought to look at law reform. That is what we should be doing here.
This is about allegations not just of criminal behaviour but of unconscionable behaviour such as psychological harm that are not covered by our laws, and that should be an issue for this inquiry. This is a serious public policy issue. I know what the position of the government and the opposition is, but I implore my colleagues to think of it in these terms. If we have an inquiry we will hear from a number of victims of the Church of Scientology. That might take a day or two of hearings. No doubt we will hear from the Church of Scientology, because they have been outspoken and they had a right of reply, which they exercised, to the comments that I made about that organisation a number of months ago. That is a fair and right thing to do. If the Church of Scientology says, ‘We don’t do these sorts of things; we think it’s wrong and outrageous,’ then surely they will not have a problem with our laws being changed to protect people from the circumstances that have been alleged. I think that the language of the government has changed in relation to this and I undertake here and now to engage with Senator Evans and other members of the government to see if there is a way forward so that these legitimate grievances can be dealt with such that people can have a voice and actually get some justice.
At the meeting this morning it was interesting to see how the Church of Scientology treats this place and the laws of this nation. It has a separate court system which strikes terror into the heart of anyone who is a member of the Church of Scientology. I spoke to a woman recently who was dragged before a so-called court process for days and days and days—a kangaroo court set up under the rules of the Church of Scientology. It was interesting that today a couple of goons from the Church of Scientology were in attendance, as I understand it. They were busy taking photographs of people at the very peaceful, civil meeting of former members of the Church of Scientology. They were quite happy to take photos of members of parliament as well. These people think they are above the law and they are not.
I am grateful for Senator Abetz’s time yesterday and the genuine and sincere way that he met with and discussed the concerns of former members—Liz and James Anderson and Janette Lang. I am very appreciative of that. Senator Abetz is right: you can have goodwill on an issue and there are different ways of approaching it. I am glad he will call on the Fair Work Ombudsman to look at these matters and will take it up at estimates. But I suggest to Senator Abetz that current laws are not adequate when you deal with this organisation, because, if you speak out or make a complaint, you are cut off from your family—you are cut off from every support mechanism that you know. You are left completely alone, and that raises some big issues and big public policy questions. But, again, I am grateful to Senator Abetz for taking this up and seeking the intervention of the Fair Work Ombudsman also. I congratulate him for doing so.
Senator Abetz raised some tax issues. Again, I appreciate the context in which Senator Abetz raised these matters. They were raised in good faith and with goodwill and I do appreciate that. But, on the whole issue of our current taxation law, the decision of Justice Murphy—former Senator Murphy—in the High Court back in 1983 was quite transparent. It effectively indicated that you basically can get these tax benefits; we do not care what the norms are or what you believe in—that is it. I think that we need to look at the UK’s public benefit test. Senator Abetz raised the issue of ‘he said, she said’, particularly in relation to coerced abortions. I appreciate his genuine and passionate views in relation to this. My views are different: I believe that current abortion laws should stay as they are, particularly in my home state. I believe in a woman’s right to choose, but I also believe it should be a true choice and a free choice. And what we have heard about this organisation is that it is not. It was quite chilling to see the interview of Tommy Davis, spokesperson for the Church of Scientology in Los Angeles, by Four Corners. He said that if you are in the Sea Organisation—the Sea Org, their elite organisation—you cannot have children. The way he said it was quite chilling: ‘You cannot have children.’ How do they effect that? They put incredible pressure on women and on their partners to have an abortion. If you are in the Sea Org or, indeed, in other parts of Scientology and you have a child, you lose everything. My plea to Senator Abetz is that, if he is concerned about a ‘he said, she said’ approach, and if genuine concerns are raised, let’s look at that whole issue of forced abortions against the adequacy or inadequacy of our current criminal law on psychological harm and related matters.
Regarding harassment, Senator Abetz made the point that if you leave a political party you can be harassed. I saw some of the treatment that two members in the Legislative Council of the South Australian parliament got when they left the Labor Party—and I am sure it happens when you leave other political parties on both sides of the fence. That harassment might be a bit of abuse or vilification. What we are dealing with here is people being followed around the clock. They have people directly in their face. They are photographed. This morning, outside the front of Parliament House, one man told me how his house was under siege for 10 days. There was either a car outside or he was followed. That is not an uncommon story. I do not think anyone can reasonably say that any major political party would do that to their former members. They might give them some stick and a bit of grief, but nothing like this systematic abuse of people’s rights.
I want to thank again the senators, MPs and staffers who have taken the time this week to talk to victims of Scientology. One of the main reasons so many victims tell me they want an inquiry into allegations of abuse within Scientology is that they believe there is some sort of therapeutic benefit in speaking out. As they emerge from an organisation whose very existence appears to rely on secrecy, they say they achieve real benefit from having someone publicly acknowledge their suffering. But it is much more than the therapeutic benefit, that cathartic benefit, of speaking out. It is because what is raised raises fundamental issues as to whether the laws of this nation need to be changed to protect individuals—whether we need to have that reform.
I expect that some senators have genuine reasons for wondering whether a Senate inquiry is the right way forward. One concern that has been raised with me is that a Senate inquiry could somehow be seen to be some kind of religious witch-hunt. Nothing could be further from the truth. I understand the fears, but I truly believe those fears are baseless. The terms of reference in this new motion specifically say that the inquiry is not to examine the beliefs of Scientology, only the behaviour of its members. It is there in black and white. I ask my fellow senators to consider what a slavish adherence to this stance might mean. If the Senate says we cannot inquire into the behaviour of any organisation if it claims to be a religion, haven’t we just given the green light to anyone who wants to be able to abuse others without scrutiny, without any accountability? Haven’t we just told those people, ‘Do what you like, abuse people, coerce abortion, commit fraud, exploit children, break up families, incarcerate followers, and as long as you call yourself a religion you can guarantee that we will look the other way’? That may not be what this parliament is saying, but I can tell you that is what some people are hearing. Is that what we were elected to do?
Other senators have argued that if there is evidence of criminal activity people should go to the police. The problem is that in a number of jurisdictions in this country some abuses are just not illegal; that the current Criminal Code, our laws, has not kept up with the behaviour of these organisations. I have said that Janette Lang bravely spoke yesterday, and I read her full statement into the Hansard. She spoke yesterday just a few metres from here in the Senate courtyard about how she was forced by Scientology bosses and by her Scientology boyfriend to have abortions. She was told that if she did not she would be cut off from her religion, her contacts, her support network and her husband and she would die of cancer. As she put it, it was her baby, her body, her choice, and Scientology took that all away from her.
Is this appalling? Of course. Is this illegal? In most places in Australia, the sad truth is probably not. What do you think would happen to Janette if she showed up at your average suburban police station with her story? Does anyone think seriously that there could be an investigation, let alone charges? The problem, as I see it, with being here in this place is that we can all be lulled into a false sense of security. There is a danger of thinking that just because we pass a law or another parliament passes a law it will be enforced. But, for most people, life does not happen in here; it happens out there. Out there, the victims of Scientology have suffered in silence for decades.
The criminal law safeguards that some are quoting in here have not protected anyone out there. There are defects and people fall through gaping cracks in the system. Others have suggested that critics pursued by Scientology should use stalking laws to protect themselves. But what happens if you are followed by a different person from the same organisation every day? There are no laws in this country to deal with institutional stalking like that. Yet critics of Scientology, ex-members and journalists say that is what happens. What are the victims to do then?
The truth is that most politicians will, if they really want to, be able to find an excuse not to act, but over time excuses wear thin especially with victims who continue to suffer. But I do want to acknowledge Senator Evans and Senator Abetz and the very considered way they have put forward their position. I think there is a shift, a shift in the major parties in dealing with this, because they know this issue will not go away. The victims of Scientology just want the opportunity to speak out safely. One suggestion was that the victims turn to the media. Some have, and some will continue to do so. I promise you all now that I will help them as much as I can. But let us not pretend that the media do not get worried about long and expensive, albeit groundless, law suits that could cost a network millions of dollars and years of litigation, even when the stories are 100 per cent true.
Remember: this is an organisation that has spent tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of dollars over the years silencing its critics in the courts. Ex-members say that Scientology sees the bankrupting of a critic as a victory. Ex-members and other critics have also claimed to have been followed, harassed, blackmailed and threatened after speaking out. Don’t we have an obligation to find a way to allow victims of Scientology to speak out safely? If we do not find a way to listen that will protect them, who will?
Let me be clear. If this motion goes down, I will come back in the next sitting week with another motion, and if that goes down I will come back with another and another. I will also continue to engage with my colleagues—with Senator Abetz, with Senator Evans—about a way forward. If there is another way forward to deal with these grievances, then I will be happy to hear it and work collaboratively with my colleagues on this. From what I am being told privately, I believe those stories of suffering are starting to cut through with many of my colleagues, and I understand why. My office and I have been listening to these heartbreaking stories for the last six months, so my challenge to my fellow politicians is simple: if you vote this down, if you say no today, please come back to me and talk to me about a way forward. The victims of Scientology want to be heard and I believe they deserve to be heard. It is time for all of us to stop thinking of new ways to say no and start thinking about better ways to say yes. It is time to stop talking about what we cannot do and start talking about what we can do for these people. I commend this motion.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2010-03-18,"—I rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008. This bill makes some minor changes to social security law and family assistance law to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in dealing with individual cases. This has been a bipartisan approach and that clearly is why it is in the non-controversial section today. There are a number of changes that allow Centrelink, when giving evidence through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, to now make oral submissions, which is far more convenient. I know you are familiar with this matter, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore. The amendments are relatively minor in nature but will definitely improve the operation of the appeals tribunal.
We have always supported the bill. We support the bill today as much as we did when it was debated in the other place over a year ago. This bill was introduced into the Senate on 5 February 2009. It is a bill that is going to improve the operation of government service delivery and yet, tragically, it has been delayed by the process of government business in this place for a year. We have absolutely no idea why it has not been brought forward. I urge the government to stop delaying the passage of this important piece of legislation and pass it without further delay.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-03-18,"—I rise to speak on the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009. Before I speak on that, I would like to pick up the point that the minister just made. If we are going to look at filibustering in this place, and if we are going to look at the health area, the minister should look at her own side before she turns around and criticises this side. In particular, she should look no further than in the health area where her minister, Ms Roxon, has bungled bill after bill and area after area. So do not come into this place and sanctimoniously tell us that we are filibustering. Look at your own side, look at the bungling and look at why legislation is not coming to this place. It is not coming to this place because of your own bungling.
—Look at the mote in your own eye.
—Thank you for that poetic interjection, Senator Brandis. This bill, the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009, amends the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 to allow the minister to conditionally list prostheses on the Commonwealth Prostheses List and to allow her to create rules specifying criteria for listing. Prostheses are artificial devices attached to the body as an aid or substitute for body parts that are missing or non-functional. They can include cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators; cardiac stents to clear blockages in blood vessels around the heart; hip and knee replacements for sufferers of arthritis; intraocular lenses to treat cataracts in human tissues such as human heart valves, corneas; bones, part and whole; and muscle tissue. On the mention of cataracts: there was a bungle if ever I saw one.
The Private Health Insurance Act requires private health insurers to pay benefits for prostheses and for hospital treatment or hospital substitute treatment that is eligible for a Medicare rebate. Currently, more than 9,500 prostheses are listed. They are listed on the advice of the Prostheses and Devices Committee according to the mandatory and non-mandatory criteria. In order for new prostheses to be listed, an application requesting this must be made to the Minister for Health and Ageing. The minister can take advice when deciding whether or not to grant an application to list. As stated, there are also non-mandatory criteria set out in the administrative guidelines. These non-mandatory criteria state that a listed prosthesis should:
(a) be surgically implanted in the patient and be purposely designed in order to:
(i) replace an anatomical body part; or
(ii) combat a pathological process; or
(iii) modulate a physiological process …
As highlighted in the second reading speech, the bill has particular relevance for people with diabetes who use insulin pumps to control blood glucose levels. Whilst insulin pumps are currently listed, there has been some ambiguity concerning their status due to the fact that they are not surgically implanted and do not require hospital admission. Insulin pumps may not be surgically implanted but they do replicate the function of pancreatic cells, which produce insulin. Accordingly, they may be considered a prosthetic. This amendment bill will facilitate a new part of the prostheses list to include devices that are not surgically implanted but have an internal component that is integral to their effectiveness. This will remove the ambiguity for insulin pumps. The importance of this bill, by removing the ambiguity, is that it recognises the needs of many stakeholders with diabetes and the coalition supports such a move.
I would like to take the opportunity today to mention the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and Kids in the House. JDRF represents 140,000 children and adults with type 1 diabetes and the tens of thousands more who care for them. I know that the JDRF is supported by many colleagues and I am proud of the support that the coalition gave them when in 2004, for example, Tony Abbott, the then health minister, committed $30 million to establish a centre for excellence for diabetes research over five years. The coalition government provided $442 million between 2000-01 and 2005-06 for Diabetes Australia and the National Diabetes Services Scheme. The scheme enables people with diabetes to access subsidies for essential products such as syringes, insulin infusion pump consumables and diagnostic products. The coalition government committed a further $667 million for the period beyond 2006-07 and supports the provisions of this bill affecting insulin pumps.
With respect to the conditional listing component of the bill, the important issue is how conditional listing is implemented in practice. The bill provides very little detail as to the process for conditional listing and the conditions which may be imposed. While we do not oppose the passage of this bill today, we have concerns about the lack of consultation undertaken and the lack of detail provided in relation to the conditional listing process.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her contribution, and on behalf of the government I acknowledged the opposition’s support for the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Bill 2009, which will make amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Act 2007 to broaden the scope of the Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme. The bill, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells said, establishes the transitional arrangements for existing diagnostic imaging practices, providing non-radiology services or a combination of non-radiology and radiology services that are not accredited under the scheme to enter stage 2 of the scheme on 1 July this year. These arrangements will enable non-radiology practices to transit into stage 2 of the scheme with minimal disruption to their business of providing Medicare eligible diagnostic imaging services to patients.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-03-18,"—I rise today to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Bill 2009, which proposes amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Act 2007 which established the Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme. The amendments seek to broaden the existing accreditation scheme to practices offering non-radiological diagnostic imaging procedures, which are currently not covered by the accreditation scheme. Diagnostic imaging covers a wide range of technologies used by medical practitioners to assist in diagnosis by allowing them to effectively look inside the human body and which includes X-rays, CT scans, MRI, ultrasound, mammography and PET scans. The Australian government provides Medicare rebates for diagnostic imaging services listed in the diagnostic imaging services table as set out in the Medicare Benefits Schedule. It is estimated that approximately 70 per cent of these services are funded by Medicare, and that amounts to several billion dollars of expenditure annually for around 20 million diagnostic imaging services.
The process of accreditation ensures that organisations meet defined safety and quality standards in the delivery of services. Importantly, accreditation provides a mechanism through which government can be assured that services supported by Medicare are being provided by organisations that are performing against those standards. The Leader of the Opposition, who was the then health minister, Tony Abbott, introduced legislation in 2007 to establish the Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme. At the time he recognised that accreditation would in time be extended to other diagnostic imaging procedures and the legislation was designed to allow for the introduction of accreditation schemes for other diagnostic imaging services. Minister Roxon has decided to proceed with further legislation, and this bill will amend the coalition’s 2007 legislation. It will also expand the reach of the accreditation scheme to all diagnostic imaging services provided to the Australian community.
Stakeholder groups were generally accepting of the initial scheme, and also of this move to widen accreditation across the diagnostic imaging sector. In general, they have not voiced major concerns and accept the scheme and its extension as an expected development and part of the ongoing staged process. However, through consultation processes concerns have been raised that include the suitability of a single accreditation model across a diverse range of medical practices and worries about duplication, costs and administrative burdens. Departmental information has suggested the costs for accreditation would not be overly onerous. However, the government must take note of these concerns and maintain ongoing consultations with all stakeholders on these issues as they develop the accreditation process, particularly as many of the stakeholders captured under this bill are private specialist practices.
I note that the Minister for Health and Ageing has assured the House that the Department of Health and Ageing has consulted comprehensively with the health professions and industry and that the government will keep the burden of compliance to a minimum. In introducing this scheme in 2007, the coalition acknowledged that the scheme would provide benefits for consumers, the provider and the Commonwealth, which could be assured that services supported by Medicare were being provided only by organisations meeting an endorsed set of standards. While we do not oppose the passage of this bill today, the coalition seeks an assurance that an evaluation be carried out to ensure the scheme is working reasonably without an onerous cost burden being passed on to consumers.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING ACCREDITATION) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2010-03-18,"—The coalition does not oppose the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care) Bill 2010, which makes sensible, technical amendments to the childcare payment process. This bill will streamline the payment process and provide greater equity in certain important cases. It also allows the payment in arrears of childcare benefit, or CCB, when a childcare service cannot report daily attendance numbers because of circumstances beyond their control—that is, it is intended to deal with matters of natural disasters like a bushfire in Victoria or a flood in northern New South Wales or Queensland which may affect service lines and a childcare centre cannot send its electronic data reports.
This bill also simplifies requirements for four-weekly statements of payments to parents. It changes the suspension of childcare benefit automatically after 10 infringement notices in a 12-month period. In fact, soon this will be a discretionary process rather than an automatic suspension, depending on the circumstances of the case. The bill also extends the 30-day notification requirement of a childcare service ceasing to operate to 42 days when a centre is to cease functioning. It also clarifies the authority of the government to recover over advanced payments paid under the previous quarterly reporting system. It is the opposition’s view that these are all sensible amendments.
All childcare benefit approved childcare service providers are now required by law to operate under the Child Care Management System—the CCMS. This will bring all childcare services online and, using CCMS registered software, child enrolment and attendance information can be recorded daily. The data is given to the department electronically to allow calculation and payment of the childcare benefit fee reductions on behalf of those children using the childcare service. This bill ensures reporting can be done where circumstances beyond one’s control, making it hard or even impossible to do the report.
The other amendments in this bill deal with compliance issues. Approved childcare services are required to provide statements to individual families receiving the childcare benefit fee reductions every four weeks. However, varying start dates for the statement period can vary for the children in the care of a centre. At times this has made it difficult and caused unintended complexities for the services and increased administrative costs. These will be ameliorated by more flexibility in when parents have their payments reported.
There is currently within the legislation an automatic outcome where if there are 10 infringement notices in 12 months for a contravention of civil penalty provisions relating to record keeping, access to records, requests from the secretary for further information and payback of remittances—those sorts of things—there is automatic suspension of the childcare benefit approval. Other suspension cancellation provisions applying to the CCB approval are discretionary. This amendment will extend suspension discretion to the secretary for the 10 infringement notices in 12 months. They can then consider the impact of an automatic ceasing of remittances on the families who are actually using the service.
Further, if a childcare operator intends to close a service, currently it is required to notify the secretary at least 30 days before it ceases operations. This does have an enormous impact on families, as it is very difficult to find alternative child care quickly in any location really, and we have seen what has happened with the collapse of certain childcare centres recently and what would happen to most families in those circumstances. Under this bill, the notification date is extended to 42 days, which will give greater time to families to find alternative care. I would also note for the record that the existing penalty regime will continue to apply in relation to failure to comply with this new 42-day requirement.
Prior to the CCMS, childcare benefit was paid quarterly in advance. If there was an overpayment, it was recovered during the next quarter. Services are now paid CCB weekly, or fortnightly in arrears. The amendments are retrospective to 29 June 2007, and will clarify that the authority to recover over-advanced amounts does in fact exist in law.
While the coalition does not oppose these sensible, technical changes, we continue to have serious concerns about the state of child care and early childhood education in this country. We note that there are differences, discrepancies even, between the operation of child care between the states and territories and differences in the interpretation of standards as a result. We also note that recent reviews are inevitably, in our view—and we have put these questions to officers through estimates process and in the other chamber—going to lead to increased costs in childcare centres in relation to some of the requirements which will be introduced by the minister. The government is not talking about those issues. The opposition believes they need more attention, but in relation to this particular bill we support these changes.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2010-03-18,"—The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 will amend the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 with three main objectives: to improve the ability of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, AFMA, to provide an efficient, cost-efficient and effective fisheries management service through changes to the administration of fisheries licensing and the introduction of electronic decision making; to ensure that fisheries officers engaged in investigating suspected illegal fishing can be properly equipped to safely perform that function; and, to provide for consolidated arrangements regulating holders of fish receivers licences in the Torres Strait.
The e-licensing provision is something that has been developed in conjunction with the industry. It has been operating for a period of time. While that new provision comes into effect there is also the capacity for fishers to continue to operate with the current paper-based system or the new e-licensing system. It does remove some of the restrictions on the trading of the trading of fishing concessions subject to certain prescribed circumstances.
With respect to defensive equipment, the provision is about things like bulletproof vests, extendable batons and handcuffs, and any other equipment that would need to be purchased under the prescribed regulations, but there are still opportunities for new pieces of equipment to be considered. With respect to the Torres Strait fish receiver licence, the provision clarifies the operation of the current scheme, which on commencement was found to be quite cumbersome and repetitive. Accepting this amendment to the legislation certainly makes it easier for people to operate within the system and reflects the true intent of the original act.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-03-18,"—The Trans-Tasman Proceedings Bill 2009 implements the agreement between the governments of Australia and New Zealand on trans-Tasman court proceedings and regulatory enforcement. The bill came about following the establishment of the Trans-Tasman Working Group on Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement in 2003. The working group’s terms of reference were to examine the effectiveness and appropriateness of current arrangements relating to civil proceedings, civil penalty proceedings and criminal proceedings relating to regulatory matters. Its membership comprised senior officials from relevant government departments in both countries.
In 2007 the Australian and New Zealand governments agreed to implement the recommendations of the working group. The agreement, based on those recommendations, was signed on 24 July 2008 by the Attorney-General and the New Zealand Associate Minister for Justice, Lianne Dalziel. Pursuant to that agreement, the bill allows civil proceedings from a court in one country to be served in the other country without additional requirements; extends the range of civil court judgments enforceable between the two countries—judgments could be refused to be enforced only if they conflicted with public policy in the country of enforcement; provides for interim relief to be obtained from a court in one country in support of civil proceedings in the other; allows the regime to be extended to tribunals on a case-by-case basis; adopts a common rule to apply when a dispute could be heard by a court in either country; encourages greater use of technology for trans-Tasman court appearances; allows enforcement of civil penalty orders across the Tasman; and allows fines for certain regulatory offences to be enforced across the Tasman where there is a strong mutual interest in doing so.
Introduced with this bill is the Trans-Tasman Proceedings (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009, which amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 in relation to the conduct of trans-Tasman market proceedings, makes consequential amendments to seven acts and repeals the Evidence and Procedure (New Zealand) Act. The two bills reflect a mutual and bipartisan determination on the part of the governments of Australia and New Zealand to harmonise their legal systems as much as is possible. The negotiations that culminated in these bills commenced and were essentially concluded under the Howard government and have the support of the coalition.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-03-18,"—Like my colleagues, we want to assist the government in getting this non-controversial legislation through in the time allowed. We realise that all of these are important pieces of legislation, and we are keen to help. That, of course, does not mean that we will not make some comments on legislation that is important. The Aviation Transport Security Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009 provides a more flexible and appropriate security regime that will enhance air cargo security without imposing undue and excessive restrictions on industry participants. The air cargo sector plays an important role in Australia’s transport networks. In recent years, security in the sector has been challenged by developments and the industry and governments have met these challenges.
Given Australia’s record in air cargo security, we conclude that the security regime established by previous governments has in fact been effective, and we take some pride in that. As the security environment changes, Australia needs to respond. It should be the goal of both governments and the air cargo sector to ensure that the Australian airfreight network remains secure without imposing excessive regulation and costs on industry and the ordinary Australians who depend upon that sector. This legislation before us builds upon the strong foundation left by the coalition. It will enable us to maintain an air cargo security apparatus that enhances Australia’s reputation amongst our major trading partners for robust security. We want to ensure that we continue to have a system that is as effective and efficient as possible.
My only concern is that we seem to have one of these types of bills through every session. We appreciate that the government is not terribly good at running programs, running the country or, indeed, running its legislative program. That is why we have had to come in and help them today by restricting our speeches. We know from things like the insulation program delivery and what a fiasco that was that the government simply is not capable of governing. Notwithstanding that, it is a pity that transport security amendments—there are several such bills that have been through in recent times and more are being flagged—cannot all be brought together and dealt with so that we can ensure that our aviation security is as effective and safe as it could possibly be. With those very few comments, I indicate that the opposition support the bill and we commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2010-03-18,"—The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Building Innovative Capability) Bill 2009 amends the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Act 1999 to allow for a new Clothing and Household Textile (Building Innovative Capability) Scheme, which replaces the coalition’s TCF Post-2005 Strategic Investment Program for the 2010-11 to 2014-15 years. The new scheme will continue to provide grants to clothing and household textile designers and manufacturers in Australia to invest in innovation, but in various respects will be more restricted.
In November 2003 the then coalition government announced a long-term assistance package of $747 million for Australia’s textile, clothing and footwear industry. An important component was the extension of the TCF strategic investment program through to 2015. The post-2005 SIP scheme provided up to $575 million over 10 years. The object of the scheme was to foster the development of a sustainable and competitive TCF manufacturing and designing industry in Australia. The scheme was capped at $487.5 million for the first five years and $87.5 million for the last five.
The bill replaces the coalition’s post-2005 SIP scheme for the 2010-11 to 2014-15 years. While slightly more funding has been allocated, there are some concerns within the industry that the bill is unduly restrictive and uncertain. Particular issues include: exclusion of capital expenditure; the reduction in the grant for research and innovation, from 80 per cent to 50 per cent; concern that eligible entities do not include entities undertaking advanced textile related processes—for example, specialised coating and quilting—but could include major retailers; and concern that the eligible activities will not include those involved in the production of specialised textiles. The bill itself does not establish the details of the scheme; it provides authority, when enacted, for the scheme to be formulated.
I note that the coalition has proposed some amendments and I am very pleased that the government has acceded to them. I give notice that I will move those amendments when we move to the committee stage.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-03-18,"—I indicate at the outset that the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Offences Against Children) Bill 2010 has the strong support of the coalition. The bill aims to strengthen the existing child sex tourism offence regime and makes amendments to child sex offences committed outside Australia. The bill also introduces new offences for steps leading to actual sexual activity with a child. The bill aims to, among other things, ensure that behaviour involving sexual offences against children committed by Australians within Australia is also criminalised when it is committed by Australians overseas.
In 1994 the Commonwealth enacted a suite of new criminal offences targeting Australians who engage in the sexual abuse of children overseas, which is sometimes referred to as child sex tourism. The introduction of these offences fulfilled Australia’s international obligations to protect children internationally from sexual exploitation. In 2005 the former coalition government enacted a range of offences directed at the use of a carriage service, such as the internet or a mobile phone, for the sexual exploitation of children. That action was taken in response to the increasing use by offenders of new technical tools, such as the internet, to engage in the sexual exploitation of children.
This bill will implement a range of reforms to the 1994 and 2005 offence regimes to ensure that they remain effective and continue to meet the needs of law enforcement agencies in combating sexual predatory practices. The reality we face today is that rapidly changing technologies and the anonymity that the internet provides have resulted in unprecedented opportunities for child sex offenders. The coalition supports these reforms and the creation of the new offences which strengthened the current system so as to ensure that sexual exploitation is comprehensively covered whether committed online or through other devices, such as mobile phones or the mail.
On behalf of the coalition I want to briefly pay tribute to the Australian Federal Police and to acknowledge the role of the AFP’s Child Protection Operations in performing investigative and coordination functions within Australia for multijurisdictional and international online child sexual exploitation matters. These matters include those from Australian state and territory police; government and non-government organisations, including internet service providers and internet content hosts; the Virtual Global Taskforce; international law enforcement agencies; Interpol; and members of the public. The AFP investigates online child exploitation which occurs using a telecommunications service, such as the internet or a mobile phone. The types of offences investigated include accessing, sending or uploading child exportation and abuse material.
Grooming or procuring children over the internet is also investigated by the AFP. AFP investigators may also focus on internet sites carrying child abuse material and operated from an ISP in Australia. In cases where the site content is not hosted within Australia, the matter is referred to overseas law enforcement agencies. The coalition applauds the Australian Federal Police and state police forces for their hard and sometimes very distressing work to combat those who seek to harm the most vulnerable members of our community.
In closing, I want to point out that on 17 June 2008 Senator Bernardi introduced a private senator’s bill. His Crimes Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Child Protection from Predatory Tourism Offences) Bill 2008 did not receive government support and, as a result of a decision of the government, his bill was not allowed to be debated. Many of the measures in this bill are similar to the measures that Senator Bernardi sought to have the Senate enact two years ago. The delay of two years in legislating for these protective measures lies at the feet of the Rudd government. Nevertheless, tardy though it is, the government has at last acted, and the coalition supports the measures.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SEXUAL OFFENCES AGAINST CHILDREN) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-03-18,"—I, too, strongly support the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Offences Against Children) Bill 2010. I welcome it. It is essential legislation for the protection of our children in the terms of the conduct that occurs overseas as well. I note Senator Brandis’s comments about the work that Senator Bernardi has done in relation to this and the bill that he put up in this place some two years ago. I, too, acknowledge the hard work of Senator Bernardi in relation to this.
I just want to seek leave in a moment to table a letter I have from the Minister for Home Affairs. I have been particularly concerned about the grooming of children via misleading information being put out online. A classic example is when a person lies about their age in communicating with a child they could also be lying about other circumstances. Honourable senators may be aware of the tragic circumstances involving Carly Ryan, where the perpetrator, the person responsible for her murder, was recently found guilty in the South Australian Supreme Court. The minister’s office—and I am grateful for the work of the minister, his staff and advisers in relation to this—proposed that a working group be established to address the issues raised in the bill that I have introduced with respect to misrepresentation of age to a minor and that the working group would consider how misrepresentation of age to a minor could be addressed by criminal laws both as preparatory conduct and also as criminal conduct in itself. They propose setting up a working group from the minister’s office, my office, the Attorney-General’s Department and the Australian Federal Police, as well as Susan McLean, Director of Cyber Safety Solutions. I seek leave to table that letter. I welcome that degree of cooperation with the government and I am looking forward to the law being strengthened as a result of the work of that working party.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I thank the senators for their support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Offences Against Children) Bill 2010, which reforms the Commonwealth child sex offences to ensure that children in Australia and internationally are better protected from abhorrent crimes. I would like to add my thanks, and the thanks of the government, to Senator Brandis’s comments in relation to the work of the Australian Federal Police and other international agencies involved in this work. Those who have to deal with these matters need to be supported. Sexual offences against children are abhorrent crimes.
But I would like to put on the record just for history that it was Senator Ludwig in opposition who tried to introduce a private senator’s bill, which did not have the support of the then government. This is an issue that is of concern to all sides of politics and not made any better by trying to score points in that regard. Having said that, I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-03-18,"—The Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Amendment Bill 2010 aims to amend the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act to broaden the definitions of flora and fauna protected and not permitted to be brought into Antarctica. The key amendments give authority to the minister to include invertebrates as specially protected species and prohibit invertebrates being taken from Antarctica. The bill also broadens the definitions of organisms. It increases safeguards of specially protected species and it strengthens offences relating to the accidental introduction of non-native organisms into the Antarctic.
The treaty which governs the Antarctic continent for those who are parties to the treaty—and that is not everyone, I might add—was introduced and adopted to protect Antarctica from environmental harm and not to allow the continent to become the object of international discord. In fact it was always said that the Antarctic should remain an area of peace and science and, generally speaking, that has happened. The agreements that form part of the treaty have been enacted into Australian law to strengthen that scientific cooperation that I mentioned, protection of the Antarctic environment, conservation of plants and animals and preservation of historic sites—and I might just say there that the Mawson’s Huts Foundation, a privately funded group of people, have done a marvellous job in protecting Mawson’s Huts.
The bill also introduces into Australian law the designation and management of protected areas and the management of tourism—again very important, with the increasing number of international tourists visiting the Antarctic and Antarctic waters. It also provides for information exchange, the collection of meteorological data, hydrographic charting, logistical cooperation and communications and safety. Last year, in April, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting amended the Madrid protocol which underpins the treaty and agreed to include increased protection of the Antarctic’s flora and fauna. Those amendments are outlined in this bill. So we are actually discharging our duty as a participant in the treaty by introducing these new protocols into Australian law.
In an attempt to save just a fraction of time, I might indicate that, whilst we support the bill, we will not be supporting the amendments that, I understand, are going to be moved by the Greens. I want to indicate that the coalition and the shadow minister very much support the intent of the proposed amendments, but we do understand that it is important to get this bill through in the dying hours of this session of parliament. We will not be meeting again until May, when we will be entirely consumed by the budget issues. So, whilst the shadow minister has indicated general support for the proposed amendments, we have given an undertaking to the government to deal with this bill as noncontroversial and not to participate in what could become a quite lengthy debate on the amendments. Perhaps the amendments are of a nature that would support additional legislative action later in the year to achieve the goals that they attempt to promote. Certainly, for the moment, we will be supporting the bill so that it can pass into law and give even further and greater protection to the Antarctic continent.",SENATE,<title>ANTARCTIC TREATY (ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-03-18,"—In 1990, as one of the Goldman Environmental Prize recipients, I handed President George Bush Sr a letter, at the White House, calling for him to endorse the Madrid protocol. America was holding out at the time. I like to think that the Goldman Environmental Prize winners had some influence on the United States going on to support the Madrid protocol, which is the vital document, by the world agreed, to protect Antarctica as a zone of peace and science. So I am very pleased that we are now adding extra Australian legal strength to the protection of Antarctica, following ratification of the annex to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty 1998.
We must see this in light of the threat to Antarctica. There are now over 40,000 tourists going to Antarctica each year. There is an increasing scientific establishment, there are many more countries involved and the threat of introduced organisms and the unwanted invasion of species into the Antarctic ecosystem is increasing every year. So this legislation is to be welcomed. I might add that the threat to Antarctica at the moment from human action is cataclysmic. In addition, climate change and ocean acidification—and, indeed, the whaling activity of the Japanese, in contravention of the Antarctic Treaty—are just parts of a suite of unprecedented threats to the whole of the Antarctic ecosystem which will in turn affect every ecosystem on the planet, including our own continent.
The first amendment which I shall move is to recognise the World Heritage value of the Antarctic. There is no argument about that. But, once again, the opposition are saying that they support it but they will vote against it. They support the intent of it, but they will vote against their own intent on a simple matter like that. The second group of amendments requires the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts to use the powers available to protect whales in the Antarctic. Again, the opposition say they are in support of that but they will vote against it. Senator Macdonald said that the opposition support the intent of that but they will vote against it. This is a historic failure of the opposition. I do not want to gainsay the government here; this is a great opportunity for the government to support these amendments. But I note the failure of the opposition, through 13 years of government, to do the right thing and to recognise the obvious intrinsic values of the Antarctic continent bioregion and its oceans—that is, being not only of World Heritage value but the greatest World Heritage area that we have on this whole planet. It is the great white continent, this world park, which deserves recognition. I look forward to the government taking a different point of view and supporting these amendments so that they can pass the Senate today.",SENATE,<title>ANTARCTIC TREATY (ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I thank Senators Ian Macdonald and Bob Brown, who have contributed to this debate on the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Amendment Bill 2010. The government agrees with the opposition that the proposed amendments to the bill are unacceptable because they are actually inconsistent with Australia’s longstanding policy position for Antarctica. Because of the unique legal and political circumstances of the Antarctic region, the Antarctic Treaty parties, including Australia, take the view that issues relating to the environmental protection and management of the Antarctic should be dealt with primarily in the forums of the Antarctic Treaty system and should not be conflated with issues relevant to World Heritage and the conservation of whales. Article 7 of annex II to the Madrid protocol specifically provides:
Nothing in this Annex shall derogate from the rights and obligations of Parties under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.
Australia actively pursues international measures for the comprehensive protection of whales in the appropriate international forum, the International Whaling Commission. On that basis, I commend the bill to the Senate.

The largest elements of this bill include: $510.8 million for the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts for the Solar Homes and Communities Plan, now rebadged as the solar credits scheme, and I will return to that issue soon; $290.1 million for the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts to meet increased demand under the Home Insulation Program brought forward from 2011 and 2012, and I would also like to elaborate on that wondrous scheme in just a short while; and $639.2 million for the Department of Defence, although this amount will be offset by reductions in non-operating appropriations.
Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010 appropriates $311 million for the other annual services of government. The largest element of this bill includes: $167 million for the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the bulk of which, $120 million, will be allocated to strategic projects, or ‘slush funds’, some may suggest; and $34.1 million for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to expand the accommodation capacity of Christmas Island, a venue that the Labor Party used to deride and are now expanding in response to increased ‘irregular’ maritime arrivals. Unfortunately, the ‘irregular’ is becoming far more regular under a Labor government.
In addition to these appropriations, these bills provide for the minister to claw back unused funds provided previously for depreciation and make-good amounts. I have talked to those issues in previous appropriations. Neither the bills nor the explanatory memorandum provide estimates of the savings expected from these clawbacks. This mechanism is part of the government’s so-called Operation Sunlight. After all the Labor Party’s blow-outs and reckless and wasteful spending, savings must be found somewhere. So the government has turned to Operation Sunlight to claw back funds put away in previous years to replace and maintain assets. Provisions to fund future asset maintenance and replacement are an oft-used management and accountancy practice. Taking money from these provisional accounts does not make a saving for the taxpayer. Future taxpayers will need to make up the amounts that we previously put away. In summary, the government, having borrowed too much from our future, is now borrowing from our past.
Let’s consider Operation Sunlight in more detail. The name makes you think about openness, transparency and good ordering of the taxpayers’ balance sheet, but it is nothing of the kind. There is no transparency or openness, and the government has not provided any certainty on what savings Operation Sunlight will deliver—nor at what cost. So in the end we are not even sure if this aspect of Operation Sunlight will deliver. No doubt there will be an army of public servants tracking down every last provision for funds set aside against every last printer. But how much will all this cost? Will they actually provide returns commensurate with all the effort? This is the kind of information that the taxpayer deserves to know. At the very best, it is the sort of information that competent managers of the public purse would find out before making a decision to claw back these funds. The concept of due diligence seems a foreign one to this government. All of this shows that the forecast of Operation Sunlight is not so much more sunlight as more cloudiness. The lack of transparency is a function of the Labor Party trying to hide its reckless and wasteful spending. The Labor Party is looking in every hollow log they can find. Nothing is safe from a government that has no idea how to balance the books and absolutely no idea about the value of money.
These bills will be supported, as appropriation bills always are, by the coalition, but people are waking up to the waste of this government and people are fearful of the monumental debt that this Labor government is building up. You cannot escape from the waste by giving the green light to shonky pink batt installers and then spending hundreds of millions in removing or fixing that insulation. The critique of Labor Party management is best exemplified by the so-called Home Insulation Scheme. You cannot escape from the waste of building school halls for one student or paying three or four times normal construction rates. The Australian public are once more awake to the overspending and lack of control of costs that the Labor Party are responsible for in their Building the Education Revolution. It certainly was revolutionary for the people who were lucky enough to score a contract from the Prime Minister. He provided a once-in-a-lifetime windfall gain for the people in the appropriate places. You cannot escape the $850 million blow-out in a $150 million program in only 18 months.
In summary, the government cannot escape from the charge that it is an incompetent manager of the public purse. It fails at due diligence, it fails to protect the taxpayers’ dollars and it is sinking this country into debt that will take decades to pay off. But, worse, the money is simply being wasted. There will be no legacy for the Australian people except a large interest bill that we will keep on having to fund every year.
These appropriation bills once more highlight to the Australian people that the Labor Party in their form, in their verse, in what they say, in how they act, have absolutely no control over costs. It is an absolute travesty that they sit there on the treasury benches without any diligence whatsoever. They lack the decisiveness, they lack the capacity and they lack the acumen to be able to manage the nation’s books, and the result of that is for all to see. The result of that is there every week when we see the extension of the nation’s debt. This is a result of not only ridiculous ideas but absolutely no control over how that appropriation is spent. It is no wonder when it comes from a party that has no experience of running a business. There is no-one on the Labor Party frontbench, from what we can perceive, that has any real experience of ever running anything. So the capacity to control costs has become self-evident. They have the rhetorical flair, no doubt; their rhetorical flair is in abundance. But their actual capacity to control the costs, to bring things in on budget, to make sure that we are prudent with the nation’s finances, to keep our debt down, is not there. As is the case with appropriations, we will be supporting these appropriations. We will be supporting the appropriations under process but we support the appropriations with absolute contempt for this government’s growing and excessive lack of financial prudence. If the Australian people do not pull these people into gear, we are going to get ourselves in a financial predicament that will take decades to fix up.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2009-2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-03-18,"—Senator Joyce has concluded his remarks and we do have a couple of minutes left before we need to vote on this very important piece of legislation. Part of the appropriations is the running of this particular establishment. I am livid that the government has spent money on rearranging the roadway around this Parliament House. I am also livid at the money they have spent on the fuehrer bunker in this building. And it distresses me that the water features around this building, which have now been turned off for a couple of years, remain in a most undignified state—they have canvas across them. Yet, where money for this building could be properly used—on addressing those issues and stopping the sacking, as I understand, of some 25 or more attendants in this building, meaning that those attendants remaining have to do twice the work—we have the government wasting money on not only rearranging the traffic around this building but then, having done it once, coming back with an expenditure of something like over a million dollars, I understand, to put in traffic calming around this building.
All this money is spent at the same time as this government is taking out the offices of senators and members—not ministers, I understand, but senators and members—those pot plants which were such an attractive feature of this building and which helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which the Labor Party used to be keen on but we do not seem to hear much about these days. I wish the government in its appropriations of money would spend money in this building appropriately and not on stupid things like rearranging the traffic flow around this building. I do hope the government will redress the expenditure allowing senators and members pot plants, that do help with greenhouse gas emissions and do make offices and the arrangements for our staff working in this building much more pleasant, rather than wasting money on a traffic system around this parliament which was not broken and did not need fixing.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2009-2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-03-18,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to a question without notice asked by Senator Joyce today, relating to the report from Australia’s Future Tax System Review Panel.
It seems interesting that we have a government that are starting to accumulate a virtual library of unpresented reports. They are not going to release that KPMG-McKinsey report and now, most importantly, we have the Henry tax review. They stated that they would release this report early in the year. We now have the latest from Mr Swan, which is that it will be released by 11 May.
—Order! Would Senators please conduct their conversations outside the chamber. If you wish to remain, please sit.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. It is not infrequently that Senator Joyce gets an opportunity to speak and I would be appreciative if people could move outside the chamber.
—Senator Hutchins, that is out of order because I had already asked senators to leave the chamber, and you well know it.
—I am enamoured by the fact that the Labor Party like to hang around to listen to every word I say. That is good. They should listen. The point I want them to take note of—and it is very important—is this. When are we going to get the Henry tax review? If these people are supposed to be prudent fiscal conservatives, when will we get the opportunity to plan how the major revenue item of our nation is going to be ascertained? It is not just the opposition that has huge queries about the competence of this government and its incapacity to release the document. Where is this document? On which coffee table in Mr Swan’s office is this document now sitting?
—Maybe they just can’t understand it!
—Or they can understand it but they are terrified by what it says. More to the point, why is there strategic leaking by the Labor Party of sections of this report? How do you possibly manage to put the statement of a fiscal conservative hand in glove with the leaking of details of the major revenue-obtaining item of the government? Why don’t you just have the fortitude and the decisiveness to release this report? Now Mr Swan, in his latest contribution to ACCI, said they will definitely release it by 11 May. Surprisingly enough, that is budget day. They will have it released by the day of the budget. They said it was going to be released early in the year. Has May now become early in the year? As far as the Labor Party is concerned, the middle of the year has now become early in the year. This is the height of imprudence by the Labor Party. This is the height of irresponsibility by the Labor Party. Major questions are being put by our major exporters. Don Argus is on the record clearly stating that he has serious concerns. This concern is being fanned by the flames of the uncertainty that has been brought about by the Labor Party.
Our good friends in the fourth estate are starting to ask serious questions about why the Labor Party has been so coy about releasing a major document. What do people in the press gallery need to do? When do they get their chance to go through this document? The Australian public have a right to know what is in it. Are you going to go forward with the Henry tax review? Every day these questions have to be asked. Are you serious about this? Are you going to withdraw it? What is the purpose of the Henry tax review if no-one gets to see it? It has been about 85 days now. What on earth are you doing with it? Has this become a new form of origami? What is the purpose of this document? Does the paper come in soft crunching forms to be used around other sections of Mr Swan’s office? What are you up to? The nation is fascinated. Has the Henry tax review become an elaborate doorstop? Is it now being used by Dr Henry to entice hairy nosed wombats from their burrow? Maybe it is ceiling insulation. We know we have paper for ceiling insulation. Who would know with this crowd, the Australian Labor Party? What exactly has happened to this premier financial document of the nation?
This is a crowd that is financially out of control. This is a crowd that is racking up debt on a trajectory never seen before. This is a crowd that has no control over finances. This is a crowd that is putting upward pressure on interest rates. This is a crowd that owes money to every man, woman and child everywhere else in the world. This is a crowd that is a huge financial risk to our nation. It is there for all to see. Their critique of management is no better exemplified than in the Home Insulation Program. The same management critique that brought a national disaster out of putting fluffy stuff in the ceiling is now being given to the Henry tax review.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Taxation</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,47,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-03-18,"—Senator Joyce ends his contribution by saying, ‘What is this crowd over there doing?’ What is this crowd doing? I will take the bait, and I will give Senator Joyce and the chamber some guidance as to what this government is doing in responsible fiscal administration of the Australian economy. This crowd is being balanced, this crowd is being responsible, this crowd is being responsive, this crowd is being considered and this crowd is being thoughtful. All of those adjectives describe our approach, as demonstrated in the past 2½ years, to the administration of the Australian economy: thoughtful, responsible, balanced, responsive and considered.
And in the context of the Henry tax review, it is not really greatly surprising to hear those opposite have not had any interest at all in engaging in the content or the substance of that debate. In terms of the independent tax review, we have taken, as I said, a sensible, responsible approach to long-term tax reform and that is why the government, which has received the report from Dr Henry, is giving it active consideration in the responsible offices and, as has been indicated by the Treasurer, at the appropriate time prior to the budget in May the report will be released.
We have not engaged in any useless or senseless or inconsistent speculation as to what the review might contain; we have not been floating stories and suggestions in the media as to where it might be going. The report has been commissioned, its terms of reference were made public, it has been the subject of thorough analysis, and it is now the subject of response to the government of the day, and the Treasurer, as I indicated, is giving it active consideration. But, as I have said, all along we have provided a well-considered explanation as to where we are going, as to the importance of tax reform in this country, which I might suggest has been the hallmark of all governments since the Hawke government took power in 1983.
The Hawke government instituted tax reform at a range of levels in this country, and I must say that when the Howard government came into power in 1996, for good or for bad, it introduced the GST, which was a form of tax reform. So all we are doing is continuing the long-term path that has been established in this country by successive governments: identify a problem, appoint an expert or a panel of experts to investigate the issue, consider community input and views, receive the report, and then, instead of releasing the report the day after it is received in the responsible office, give it some thoughtful consideration and consider how it might be integrated with the other issues that face the government of the day.
That is a considered, thoughtful, responsive, responsible approach to the Henry tax inquiry. It is a thoughtful, considered, balanced, responsive plan for going ahead in due course when Mr Swan chooses to release the report for publication some time prior to the budget. When one thinks about it that will be some time over the next 10 weeks. This review has been two years in the making, but it is part of 25 years of ongoing reforms. There has been 25 years of substantial reform by, first, the Hawke and Keating governments and then by the Howard government. Further work has been commissioned. It has been received and it will be released, along with, I suggest, a very useful action plan for the implementation of those matters that are considered worthwhile and appropriate.
In terms of the other matters that were raised by Senator Joyce, he cloaks his argument by presenting questions on the Henry tax review relating to the mishmash of a maternity leave policy that his leader presented early last week. That was simply a plan for uncertainty in the future. It is a reckless idea, thought up the night before, put on paper as a few words in a public forum and released as such. There was no consideration as to its real costings, no consideration as to its impact on the corporate sector in this country, no consideration as to its flow-on effects on those smaller elements in the business community, no consideration given at all as to whether it can be a one-off payment— (Time expired)

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-03-18,"—The Rudd Labor government is a secretive government; it is not an open and transparent government. The Rudd Labor government is a tricky government which selectively leaks, according to its political self-interest, parts of reports whenever it suits it. This is a government that is no longer governing in the national interest; it is a government that is focused on its political self-interest. And we are now being told that the Henry review report is going to be released before the budget. The government has had it for 85 days, and we are now being told it is going to be released before the budget. But was that a spontaneous decision? Was that as a result of the Prime Minister’s instinct for openness and transparency? No, it was not. The Prime Minister had to be shamed into it. The Prime Minister had to be shamed into a concession when even his senior cabinet colleagues could see that he was going down the wrong path. They tapped him on the shoulder and they said, ‘Kevin, we should really release this before the budget.’ Finally there was a degree of concession.
But who knows in what form it is going to be put out there, because we now have a plethora of reviews across government that are being kept secret, whether it is the National Broadband Network implementation study, which is being kept secret, whether it is the underlying information on the economic modelling of the government’s flawed emissions trading scheme—its $120 billion great big new tax on everything—or whether it is reports into when the government was first told about serious safety risks for workers involved in the home insulation fiasco. They are just some of the reports that the government is keeping secret, and of course before the election we were told that this was going to be a new era of openness and transparency.
The Rudd Labor government, like Labor governments before it, is a high-taxing, high-spending, high-borrowing government. This government did not wait for the economic downturn to start ratcheting up taxing and spending. In its first budget, well before the global economic downturn, the Rudd Labor government increased taxes by $20 billion. That included the $3.1 billion tax grab on alcopops, the $2½ billion tax grab on the North West Shelf project in Western Australia. It also included student taxes. You really have to wonder: what does this government have against young people?
Here we are, 85 days from when the government received the Henry tax review report, and we still have not seen it. What do they have to hide? What is their secret tax plan? Are they planning to remove the capital gains tax discount? Are they planning to increase capital gains tax? Are they planning to increase the GST? We know that the Prime Minister wants to steal 30 per cent of the GST from the states, but do they want to increase the rate? Do they want to increase the Medicare levy? Do they want to introduce death taxes? Do they want to introduce a resource rent tax, which is going to be another attack on states like Western Australia? Do they want to get rid of negative gearing? Who knows, because this secretive and tricky government are keeping it secret. This is a government of all spin, no substance. They are focused on a pre-election political strategy to time the release of this report to minimise any fall out for themselves in terms of their re-election chances. All talk, no action; all spin, no substance.
Contrast this with us. Tony Abbott and the coalition put forward a proposal for a national paid parental leave scheme which is fully funded. We were very transparent about how we would raise the funds to pay for it. We are out there, open in the public domain. Contrast that with Labor’s secret plan. If Labor, in the lead-up to the next election, were to come out and rule out taxes, I would say to the Australian people: you cannot trust a word they are saying. Just look at what they said before the last election. Before the last election Kevin Rudd and Nicola Roxon gave the most emphatic promise that they would retain the existing private health insurance rebates. What happened after the next election? We know what happened after the election: they have now tried twice to ram legislation through this Senate which would reduce or scrap altogether private health insurance rebates for millions of Australian, a measure which would be bad for our health system and bad for 11 million privately insured Australians. We know that this government has a track record of saying one thing before an election and doing another after the election. Clearly, Australians cannot believe one single word that this government says about taxes. (Time expired)

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I find it absolutely amazing that Senator Joyce, in his belated return to the floor of the Senate, after being told by the party leader that he needs to pull his head in, is raising the issue of tax and the Henry tax review. For Senator Joyce to talk about issues such as irresponsibility and uncertainty is the height of hypocrisy. The irresponsibility of Senator Joyce in terms of his lack of understanding, lack of grip, lack of knowledge about the portfolio that was given to him by an opposition leader who was desperate to paper over the cracks and the problems in the coalition—as part of that papering over he gave Senator Joyce and the National Party the hold of the levers of what could be the economy of this country—is absolutely mind boggling.
This government has a good record on tax. We are proud of our record on tax. I will tell you what we want to do: we want to make sure that the people who can pay the tax pay tax and those who need the help can get help. That is the way this government operates. For Senator Cormann to start mentioning Western Australia, after the National Party in the west have said that Senator Cormann has failed Western Australia, that Senator Cormann is not delivering for Western Australia, again shows he has a bit of a hide. He is trying to take the heat off the divisions and the cracks between the coalition and the Nationals in Western Australia. To come here and try to attack us on tax is a bit rich. If you are not doing the job for Western Australia, let someone come in that is going to do the job for Western Australia. The Nationals know that you are not doing the job for Western Australia. Your own side know that you are not doing the job!
They talk about secrecy. This is a former government, under Howard, who their own side described as mean, tricky and nasty. Your own national president described you as mean, tricky and nasty! So don’t come in here trying to tell us about what we should be doing, because on tax we are not mean, we are not tricky and we are not nasty the way the coalition were mean, tricky and nasty in their political position when they were in government. We will be delivering a doubling of the low-income tax offset from $750 in 2007-08 to $1,500 by 1 July 2010. We are delivering on tax. We are not like the coalition, who want to sit back and do negative carping—just say no to everything that comes up here. For the coalition to talk about the national interest is an absolute joke. You have not put the national interest upfront with any issue. It has been short-termism, trying to score political points and ignoring the interests of this nation.
You are an absolute rabble and a joke as an opposition—an absolute joke. You do not have the courage of your own convictions. What are you doing with this great big new tax that you want to introduce on big business in this country? You are actually trashing the values and the commitments that you have argued for years is the way forward—the low-tax coalition! What does Mr Abbott do as soon as he becomes leader? He starts a big new tax on the top end of town—a big new tax on big business. It is clear that not even Andrew Bolt can find a good word for your taxation approach. Not even Peter Costello can find a good word for your big new tax—not one word of support for what you are doing. Everyone knows it was just a thought bubble. Everyone knows it was a knee-jerk reaction. It is quite clear that you have no idea what to do in the national interest, and your own side has you picked. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-03-18,"—I have a confession to make. I hesitate to do so, because I fear I might earn the ire of Senator Adams and Senator Cormann, but I am actually quite a fan of Senator Conroy. I know the Prime Minister is not, so I am very proud to stand with Senator Conroy today. I think he more closely approximates an economic rationalist than most of his Labor colleagues, putting a box around the NBN. What’s $42 billion between friends? He is very solid on the US alliance and he is a bit of a fan of free trade. I think many of my colleagues on this side were very sad when Senator Conroy lost his position in this chamber representing the Treasurer, so I was delighted today to see Senator Conroy reprise that role in the absence of Senator Sherry.
It is because I am such a fan of Senator Conroy that I felt disappointed by him today—or let down would probably be a better way of putting it. That is why I feel compelled to join in the debate today to take note of his lack of answers to Senator Joyce’s questions on the Henry tax review. I think we all remember when the Henry tax review was announced on 13 May 2008—almost two years ago—the excitement about and anticipation of the review. The review was announced in the context that there had not been—and I quote from the press release of the Treasurer, Mr Swan—‘a comprehensive review of the Australian taxation system, including state taxes, for at least the last 50 years’. That is true if you ignore the new tax system of the coalition. It is also true if you ignore that great economic summit down at Old Parliament House, out of which came the famous option C: the Keating consumption tax model. If you ignore those two significant events, Mr Swan’s statement is true.
We were extremely excited when we heard about the tax review. At that time we were told that the final report to the Treasurer would be by the end of 2009. The government were true to their word: on the death knock of 2009—I think it was Christmas Eve—the report was handed to the Treasurer. We have waited and waited and waited for the government’s response, but waiting is sometimes a good thing because it gives you a chance to reflect. While I have been waiting I have been reflecting on another project that Dr Henry was deeply and intimately involved with, and that of course was the new tax system—the GST. I recall the response of the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, at that time when he said:
When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written, 30 June 1999 will be recorded as a day of fundamental injustice—an injustice which is real, an injustice which is not simply conjured up by the fleeting rhetoric of politicians. It will be recorded as the day when the social compact that governed this nation for the last 100 years was torn up.
He went on:
It will be recorded as the day when the parliament of this country said to the poor of the country that they could all go and take a running jump.
The member for Griffith would have been extremely disappointed when the then leader of his party, Mr Beazley, announced the end of the rollback policy. Labor were going to abandon the rollback policy of repealing the GST. I was incredibly surprised that the Henry review specifically said that it would look all Australian government taxes except the GST, because I would have thought that, remembering Fundamental Injustice Day, the member for Griffith would have thought, ‘The first thing I want to do with a new tax system is abolish the GST,’ which he did not do. I am glad he did not, because I think the GST was an important reform. Clearly this government does not have the strength of its own convictions.
The Treasurer, on the Insiders program a few weeks ago, finally declared that we would have the benefit of the Henry review by the budget. He did not say ‘before the budget’; he said ‘by the budget’. The reason was that this is a review that this government wants to bury. Senator Bishop did acknowledge the work of the Howard government and the previous Keating government in tax. This government has yet to do anything on tax. It will not do anything on tax. It wants to bury this review. This is not a reformist government.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I present four government responses to committee reports as listed on today’s Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.
The documents read as follows—

Economics References Committee—Government’s economic stimulus initiatives.


Majority Recommendation


That the Government commission an urgent independent report to be prepared on the fiscal stimulus packages listed in Appendix 3 to include


(a) A cost benefit analysis of all the remaining projects, including the timing implementation for spending on those projects


(b) Recommendations on the feasibility of reducing, postponing or recalibrating the remaining discretionary funding, on a project by project basis.


That the Report be published on the Department of Treasury’s website within 14 days of its receipt.


Government Response

The Government does not consider it necessary to commission such a report.
The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed in February 2009 that a Coordinator‑General would oversee the Nation Building and Jobs package and would be supported by Commonwealth‑Coordinators from key agencies, and Coordinators-General in each State and Territory.  These governance structures, including regular and detailed reporting at the program and project level, are designed to ensure that projects are effectively rolled out, value for money is achieved, there is sharing of information and best practice and that any problems are quickly identified and addressed.  Key programs covered by the COAG agreement with states and territories, including Building the Education Revolution and Social Housing, are reporting monthly.
Commonwealth agencies are relying on long-established processes and, where necessary, enhanced systems to ensure public funds are managed appropriately.  A range of audit and compliance strategies have been put in place across programs.  The Commonwealth is also working closely with the states and territories to ensure their tendering and procurement processes demonstrate value for money.
The projects announced in the 2009-10 Budget, which form part of the Government’s longer term third phase of the stimulus, reflect advice provided by Infrastructure Australia.  Infrastructure Australia made project recommendations to the Government following economic analysis against its publicly available assessment methodology of seven key themes.  These recommendations were guided by Infrastructure Australia’s national priority list of key infrastructure needs for Australia.
The fiscal stimulus measures have made an important contribution to this performance.
In year-average terms, the Australian economy grew by 1.4 per cent in 2009. This compares to the IMF estimate of an average contraction of 3.2 per cent for the advanced economies collectively. Without the fiscal stimulus, Treasury estimates that the Australian economy would have contracted for three of the four quarters in 2009 and by 0.7 per cent overall.
The Government notes that Australia was one of only three advanced economies to avoid recession during the global financial crisis.  While full year growth data for 2009 is not yet available for all economies, it appears that Australia will prove to be the top ranking advanced economy for 2009.
Compared to the major advanced economies, Australia has the second lowest unemployment rate (behind Japan).  Australia’s current unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent compares to double-digit rates reached in the US and European economies during the global recession.  Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, while all of the major advanced economies have recorded job losses, Australia has managed to create over 170,000 jobs.
The fiscal stimulus measures have been designed to ensure they do not affect the sustainability of the budget and are withdrawn as the economy recovers.  As indicated in the 2009-10 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the stimulus peaked in the June quarter of 2009 and the gradual phasing down is expected to subtract from growth through 2010. This means that Australia is withdrawing stimulus one year ahead of the timetable recommended by the IMF for advanced economies.
Some aspects of the stimulus have been recalibrated to allow flexibility in managing the demand for individual programs and to ensure an appropriate level of support is provided to the economy.  The Government has already announced re-phasing of some key components of the stimulus to ensure that the stimulus provides value for money.
The Government already has a robust reporting and accountability regime that includes: the requirements for all new spending proposals to be scrutinised by the Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet; for costings to be agreed with the Department of Finance and Deregulation; and all new spending measures to be disclosed in the Budget Papers.

Senator Xenophon’s first recommendation


That the government advise the Committee its plans and timeline for a scale back of economic stimulus measures, with and/or without a coordinated approach by G20 nations. Further, that the Government advise what consultation will occur to prepare a clear and effective exit strategy.


Government Response

The stimulus measures have been designed to be withdrawn as the economy recovers.  As indicated in the 2009-10 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the stimulus peaked in the June quarter of 2009.  The staged withdrawal of stimulus measures, that is already underway, will detract from economic growth in 2010.
The Government has also outlined its strategy for returning the budget to surplus as the economy recovers.
The Government’s medium-term fiscal strategy is to achieve budget surpluses on average, over the economic cycle; to keep taxation as a share of GDP, on average, below the level for 2007-08; and to improve the Government’s net financial worth over the medium term.
The Government will pursue a disciplined fiscal strategy to return the budget balance to surplus by:
offsetting all new spending decisions taken since the 2009-10 Budget across the forward estimates by finding savings in other parts of the Budget;
restraining real spending growth to two per cent a year when the economy is projected to return to above trend growth (2011-12); and
banking increased tax revenue as the economy improves.
The implementation of the Government’s fiscal strategy is expected to result in the budget deficit falling from 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2009-10 to 1.1 per cent of GDP in 2012-13, and returning to surplus by 2015-16.
The Government’s approach to phasing out the stimulus and other support measures is consistent with the position agreed by the G20. 
The G20 has played a central role in facilitating a decisive and coordinated response to the financial crisis and subsequent recession involving the introduction of unprecedented fiscal, monetary and financial support measures.  As a result of these measures, economic and financial conditions have improved. 
At their most recent meeting at St Andrews on 6‑7 November 2009, G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors agreed on the need to avoid premature withdrawal of support measures.  At the same time, they also agreed to cooperate on the withdrawal of support measures when recovery is assured, including through information sharing and working together to address any adverse spill‑over effects of individual country strategies.  At the same time, Ministers and Governors acknowledged that national plans will need to be implemented flexibly, taking full account of variations across countries and regions in the pace of recovery and financial market conditions. 

Senator Xenophon’s second recommendation


Further to the Committee’s majority report, that an urgent independent report is conducted, it is recommended that this report include [a] review of the method in which household stimulus incentives are distributed, with a view to assess future options to distribute funds, if needed, via a debit card or voucher system.


Government Response

The Government does not consider it necessary to commission such a report.
Australia’s stimulus was designed on the principles of best practice fiscal policy of being timely, temporary, and targeted. 
On timeliness, the Government responded quickly and decisively to the deterioration in the global outlook, implementing stimulus measures from October 2008.  The measures were temporary as they did not lock the Government into higher ongoing expenditure, thereby not affecting the sustainability of the budget and these measures are being withdrawn as the economy recovers.  Finally, the stimulus measures were targeted to ensure their effectiveness in boosting demand, in turn supporting jobs and economic activity.  The large capital component of the stimulus also addressed long‑term needs for economic and social infrastructure.
The first phase of the stimulus was primarily focused on providing immediate support to the economy and a large proportion consisted of direct payments to households.  These payments were provided to low and middle-income individuals and households with dependent children.  These are most likely to be liquidity constrained households and/or at the stage of their life cycle where they are most likely to spend a sizeable proportion of any cash payment.
There is now considerable evidence that the cash stimulus payments helped support the economy during its weakest phase.  For example, in January 2010 retail turnover was 7.5 per cent higher than the pre‑stimulus levels of November 2008, having remained largely flat throughout 2008.  In addition, consumer confidence remains 43.0 per cent higher than the pre-stimulus levels of October 2008.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS REPORT


STOLEN GENERATION COMPENSATION BILL 2008


December 2009


INTRODUCTION

The Commonwealth Government welcomes the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs’ report on the Stolen Generation Compensation Bill 2008. 
The Government is committed to addressing the damaging and negative effects that resulted from the past policies of removing Indigenous children from their families, and it is mindful of the hardships endured in the past by members of the Stolen Generations1, and of how much the consequences of these hardships must still be felt today. 
The Government offered the apology on 13 February 2008 in a spirit of respect, acknowledgement and recognition of the past mistreatment of all Indigenous peoples, and particularly the profound grief, suffering and loss inflicted on the Stolen Generations. This is in keeping with relevant elements of the Bringing Them Home report recommendation around reparations.
The Government has indicated on a number of occasions that it will not be providing compensation to members of the Stolen Generations.  For this reason the Government has no specific comments to make on the aspects of the Bill relating to compensation for the Stolen Generations.
The Government continues its commitment to the ongoing healing of the Stolen Generations, and to working with them to make sure their voices are heard in the design of policies and programs to improve outcomes for Indigenous Australians.
On the 22 November 2009 the Australian Government announced its support for the establishment of a new national representative body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to be known as the National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples, and committed $29.2 million to the setting up and initial operation of the body up until December 2013. The decision follows consideration by the Government of the report Our Future in Our Hands from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma, and an Indigenous Steering Committee and presented to the Government in August 2009. The model set out in the report resulted from twelve months of extensive community consultation across Australia including a national workshop of 100 Indigenous leaders and was based on the feedback from all of those consultations. The establishment of this body underpins the Government’s commitment to resetting the relationship with Indigenous peoples. It provides a voice for Indigenous peoples, the opportunity for partnership and the genuine engagement necessary if there is to be progress in closing the gap in life outcomes and opportunity.
The Government recognises that the Stolen Generations are in need of critical services to help trace and reconnect their families.  In 2007-08, the Government committed an additional $15.7 million to important initiatives such as Link Up family reunion services and Bringing Them Home counsellors for Stolen Generation survivors.
On 13 February 2009, the first anniversary of the motion of Apology to Australia’s Indigenous Peoples, the Government announced a further expansion to the Link Up program with additional Link Up caseworkers and more administrative support to help more members of the Stolen Generations trace, locate and reunite with their families.   This was provided for in the 2009-10 Budget with an additional $13.8 million over four years.  This additional investment will allow for up to 140 ‘Return to Country’ and institutional reunions.
The Government also recognises the critical need for healing services to overcome the trauma of removal, the impact of colonisation and the associated intergenerational effects. The     2009-10 Budget provided $26.6 million over four years for the establishment of a Healing Foundation to address trauma and healing in the wider Indigenous community, with a focus on the Stolen Generations. This initiative addresses a major recommendation of the Bringing Them Home report concerning healing and rehabilitation, and will help individuals, families and communities to move forward.
The Foundation has been established to support practical and innovative healing services, as well as training and research.  It will work towards stopping the cycle of trauma and grief in Indigenous communities, particularly affecting the Stolen Generations and their families.  The Foundation’s inaugural Board has been appointed and held its first meeting on              14 December 2009.  The Foundation is expected to become fully operational in early 2010.
The Government’s national priorities for Australia, including the National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children endorsed on 30 April 2009 by the Council of Australian Governments, and giving children the best start in life through early childhood and parenting programs, reflect a number of the measures recommended in the Bringing Them Home report.
The Government is working on an ongoing basis with Stolen Generations organisations and members at the grassroots level.
Since coming to office the Government has set a national priority to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.  Australian Governments have agreed to a number of ambitious targets for Closing the Gap. By improving outcomes for all Indigenous people, members of the Stolen Generations will also benefit. Healing in particular underpins the Closing the Gap work.
Through a range of initiatives the Government has responded, and continues to respond to, the Bringing Them Home report. The Government recognises that members of the Stolen Generations have particular needs. For this reason, the Government has allocated additional funds in the 2009-10 Budget to address the specific healing and family reunion needs of Stolen Generations members, supported by dedicated consultative mechanisms which ensure respectful participation in the implementation of those measures.
——————

1 The Australian Government uses the plural when referring to the Stolen Generations to emphasise that the practice of removing children from their families, which began in the early nineteenth century and continued until the 1970s, affects more than one generation.
 

RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS

This section provides the Government response to each of the Committee recommendations.

Recommendation 1

The committee recommends that the Bill not proceed in its current form. (3.129)

Response

Supported.  The Government has stated that it will not be providing compensation to members of the Stolen Generations.

Recommendation 2

The committee recommends that the Federal Government’s Stolen Generations Working Group (comprised of Stolen Generations’ representatives from the National Sorry Day Committee and the Stolen Generations Alliance) be charged with the responsibility of monitoring the implementation of the recommendations of the Bringing Them Home report, and providing advice to government on the implementation of outstanding recommendations of that report by the end of 2008. (3.130)

Response

Noted.  The Government is mindful of the importance of engaging with the Stolen Generations in ways that will meet their needs. In mid 2008, members of the Stolen Generations’ Working Group came to a mutual agreement that future engagement would be through separate processes outside the group. 
In accordance with this request, the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (the Department) now meets regularly with the Stolen Generations’ Alliance (SGA) Executive.  The Department has corresponded and met with the National Sorry Day Committee (NSDC) to propose regular meetings, similar to those undertaken by SGA.  The NSDC is still considering this proposal.  The Stolen Generations Working Group no longer meets.
The Department is also engaging with members of the Stolen Generations at the grassroots level through meetings with local groups and individuals not represented by the two national organisations. The needs of the Stolen Generations in general and in relation to the Bringing the Home report recommendations are raised at these meetings.

Recommendation 3

The committee recommends that the Federal Government’s ‘closing the gap’ initiative be extended to establish a National Indigenous Healing Fund to provide health, housing, ageing, funding for funerals, and other family support services for members of the Stolen Generations as a matter of priority. The committee recommends that the National Indigenous Healing Fund be incorporated within the ‘closing the gap’ initiative as an additional and discrete element of focus and funding. (3.131)

Response

Noted. 
On 26 May 2008, the Prime Minister announced that a forum of experts would be convened to map ways forward for healing among Australia’s Indigenous peoples, in particular the Stolen Generations. The Indigenous Healing Forum held on 16 and 17 September 2008 looked at the real impacts of trauma on individuals, families and communities, including children, and best practice models for recovery.
In order to get a range of views on Indigenous healing and its potential applications, a very broad representation from the government, community and other sectors as well as members of the Stolen Generations were invited to attend and contribute to the discussion.
The National Indigenous Healing Fund concept proposed by the Committee differs to the views expressed at the Forum and, indeed, in conversations with experts and members of the Stolen Generations themselves.
The Government recognises the critical need for healing services to overcome the trauma of removal, the impact of colonisation and the associated intergenerational effects. The 2009-10 Budget provided $26.6 million over four years for the establishment of a Healing Foundation to address trauma and healing in the wider Indigenous community, with a focus on the Stolen Generations. This initiative addresses a major recommendation of the Bringing Them Home report concerning healing and rehabilitation, and will help individuals, families and communities to move forward.
Ms May O’Brien from Western Australian and Mr Gregory Phillips from Victoria were appointed to lead the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Healing Foundation Development Team of nine Indigenous members. The members of the Development Team included persons with strong expertise in healing programs, knowledge of Stolen Generations issues and knowledge around establishing a Foundation.  Several members of the Development Team identify as Stolen Generations.
The team undertook consultations with key organisations and individuals as well as conducting community workshops across Australia to listen to community ideas for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Healing Foundation.
Following the consultations, a report was presented to the Government on the consultations,  including recommendations for the establishment and remit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Healing Foundation.  The report was launched on 24 September 2009.
An Interim Board was appointed from the Development Team to organise incorporation and selection of Board members.  The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Healing Foundation was incorporated on 30 October 2009.  The Inaugural Board was appointed in late 2009 and held its first meeting on 14 December 2009.  Current membership is:
Chair:  Ms Florence Onus
Deputy Chair: Debra Hocking
Secretary:  Judy Atkinson
Treasurer:  Noeleen Lopes
Members:  Graham Gee,  Toni Janke-Demmery
Three further Board members are expected to be appointed early in 2010. With the finalisation of appointments to the Board, the Foundation will become fully operational in the first half of 2010.

Recommendation 4

The committee recommends that the terms and conditions of the National Indigenous Healing Fund be determined through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), and that its processes and practical application be decided after consultation with the Stolen Generations Working Group (comprising of stolen generation representatives from the National Sorry Day Committee and the Stolen Generations Alliance). (3.132)

Response

Noted.  The Government will consult with members of the Stolen Generations in formulating any policy and program delivery frameworks in this area. 
With respect to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Healing Foundation, Stolen Generations were represented on the team developing proposals and consultations have included key Stolen Generations organisations as well as grassroots members.
Two key office bearers on the Healing Foundation’s Inaugural Board are Stolen Generations members, Chairperson, Ms Florence Onus and Deputy Chair, Ms Debra Hocking.
The Foundation has been established to provide practical and innovative healing services, as well as training and research and aims to stop the cycle of trauma and grief in Indigenous communities, particularly affecting the Stolen Generations and their families.

Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade


Inquiry into Australia’s Relationship with ASEAN


Recommendation 1

The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade develop a single method of costing non-tariff barriers, to assist Australian FTA negotiators to identify, evaluate and target barriers to trade.
In negotiating Free Trade Agreements, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade seeks to affirm World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations relating to non-tariff measures and, where appropriate, to eliminate the application of non-tariff measures that operate to restrict market access or impose undue costs on exporters. 
Non-tariff barriers to trade take a variety of forms and have varying impacts on trade.  The range of non-tariff measures applied by Australia’s FTA negotiating partners, and the impact of these measures on Australia’s trade with them, varies considerably.  The nature of such measures and their impact on Australian market access interests are always identified as part of Australia’s stance in negotiating FTAs. 
However, determining a single “cost” of these measures would not be practicable, or necessarily meaningful, given the variety of different types of non-tariff measures.  The variety of measures means that a range of analytical tools are needed to analyse their effects.  While some measures (e.g. quantitative import barriers) may be susceptible to conversion to “tariff equivalent” measures, which can then be subject to reduction like normal tariffs, this approach is not appropriate for other measures (e.g. quarantine measures or technical regulations) which are best addressed through disciplines governing their application.  The following examples illustrate the variety of measures that could potentially be major non-tariff barriers:
quantitative limits – or tariff rate quotas - on the volume of imports of agricultural products.  Such measures are required to be applied in accordance with WTO commitments. 
import licensing - which may be administered on either an automatic basis (e.g. for statistical purposes) or non-automatic basis (e.g. for the administration of tariff rate quotas).
fees and charges associated with importation (or exportation) which are required under the WTO to be limited to the approximate cost of services rendered and not to represent an indirect protection of domestic products or taxation of imports (or exports) for fiscal purposes.
restrictions on imports for specific purposes, e.g. bans or quantitative limits on imports of alcohol products for religious reasons, or on imports of particular types of weapons for public safety reasons.
other non-tariff measures that may have an impact on Australian market access interests can include standards and sanitary and phytosanitary measures – which are also subject to WTO rights and obligations.
A range of research and academic work has been done on measuring non-tariff barriers and assessing their effects, and Australian negotiators take this work into account in trade negotiations, including FTAs.  This work has proved valuable mainly as a research and analytical tool to inform negotiations.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reports annually to the Parliament on the impacts of individual free trade agreements.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) reports regularly to the Minister for Trade on the impacts of individual free trade agreements.
The Department also regularly provides publicly-available assessments of the trade and investment relationship with partner countries including those with which Australia has negotiated FTAs.  Examples of these analyses include articles on Australia’s trade relations with FTA partners Thailand and the United States, available on the DFAT website.  In addition, information, statistics and resources on Australia’s trade partners, including FTA partners, is also available from the DFAT website and the Australian Bureau of Statistics
While liberalised market access provided for by FTAs can be very significant in influencing exporters’ commercial decisions, a number of other factors also impact on international trade flows, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, the health of the international economy and variations in economic growth in different countries over time.  It would not be possible to attribute differences in annual trade outcomes solely to the effects of FTAs.  Assessments of FTA impacts need to be both qualitative and quantitative and should be on a medium to long-term basis as many of the impacts of a trade agreement take a number of years to be realised (e.g. through new investment decisions).
For the above reasons, the Government does not consider that annual reports by DFAT would be of value.
It should also be noted that the Minister for Trade reports to the Parliament at the commencement of an FTA negotiation.  This includes an assessment of the expected impacts of the FTA.  The Minister for Trade also provides the Parliament with regular updates on bilateral, regional and multilateral trade negotiations with significant developments through Statements to the Parliament.

Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that when Parliamentary delegations visit South East Asian countries with which Australia has a free trade agreement, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade facilitate meetings with Asian policy makers to monitor progress with these treaties.
The Government considers that outgoing Parliamentary delegation visits are important to projecting Australian interests and to understanding the policy directions being adopted by foreign trade partners.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), through its network of overseas posts, provides advice and other assistance to Parliamentary delegations, including the facilitation of meetings.  Arranging programmes and itineraries for Parliamentary delegations is a key responsibility of DFAT, and it will continue to make every effort to arrange meetings with Asian policy makers in accordance with the requests made to it by the Parliament of Australia prior to each proposed visit.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should ensure that future free trade agreements contain effective telecommunications chapters.
The Government will continue to make every effort to ensure that FTAs contain effective outcomes for the telecommunications sector, including pro-competitive regulatory provisions and substantial market access commitments for Australian telecommunication providers.  The Government notes that recently concluded FTAs contain such provisions.

Recommendation 5

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government make representations to the Singapore Government with a view to assisting Engineers Australia, and other professions not covered by the free trade agreement, to obtain a mutual recognition agreement with Singapore.
For several years the Government has been engaging Singaporean authorities and the Professional Engineers Board (PEB) - through the Australian High Commission in Singapore - with a view to assisting Engineers Australia to obtain a mutual recognition agreement with Singapore.  The Government will continue to make representations to the relevant Singaporean authorities on this matter, and on other mutual recognition issues, seeking to obtain mutual recognition agreements.

Recommendation 6

The Committee recommends that future bilateral free trade agreements include a professional services working group to assist in creating professional linkages, including mutual recognition agreements and when existing free trade agreements which do not contain a professional services working group are reviewed, this issue should be pursued.
Enhancing the ability of Australian professional service providers to sell their services abroad will continue to be a key objective in FTAs negotiated by the Government.  This includes supporting efforts by Australian service providers to have Australian professional service qualifications recognised in foreign markets through mutual recognition arrangements.  As professional services are largely industry-regulated, there is limited scope for governments alone to solve these issues.  The question of whether seeking to include a professional services working group in an FTA is the most effective means for Australia to advance this objective will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with relevant industry stakeholders.  The Government further notes that demands for professional service recognition can also be made of Australia, and that a balanced approach is required in order to ensure that access opportunities in overseas markets are improved while maintaining professional service standards in Australia.

Recommendation 7

The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government should use its influence with the Asian Development Bank to ensure that the adherence to core labour standards become a precondition for loans.
The Government will seek opportunities when Asian Development Bank loan programmes are under discussion to ensure adherence with core labour standards, as articulated through the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation.

Recommendation 8

The Committee recommends that human rights, core labour standards, and the environment be pursued in future free trade agreements and, when existing free trade agreements which do not contain such issues are reviewed, these issues should be pursued.
The Government will explore the inclusion of environmental protection and labour standards issues in FTA negotiations and reviews, on a case-by-case basis.

Recommendation 9

The Committee recommends that when the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reports annually to the Parliament under Recommendation 2, progress with regard to human rights, core labour standards, and the environment be included.
As noted in the response to Recommendation 2, the Government does not consider that reporting to Parliament on an annual basis would have value given the need to assess FTAs on a medium to long term basis, and because of the difficulties in isolating FTA impacts from annual trade flows.

Government Response to Report 94 of the Joint Standing Committee on TreatiesGovernment Response to Report 94 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties:


Australia-Russia Nuclear Cooperation Agreement

The Government thanks the Committee for its consideration of the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Russian Federation on Cooperation in the Use of Nuclear Energy for Peaceful Purposes, done at Sydney on 7 September 2007 (“the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement”), which was tabled on 14 May 2008, and gives the following responses to the Committee’s recommendations.  The question of taking binding treaty action remains under consideration. 
The Committee’s recommendations covered a range of aspects related to Russia’s nuclear fuel cycle and the operation of the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement. Most of these recommendations related broadly to the question of confidence that Australian nuclear material would be used appropriately. As such, this response will consist of a section addressing the safeguards that would be applied to Australian nuclear material, followed by specific responses to the Committee’s recommendations.

Protection of Australian Uranium – the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement in Context

Confidence that Australian Obligated Nuclear Material (AONM), i.e. Australian uranium and nuclear material derived from its use, would not be diverted for military purposes in Russia is based on a combination of factors:
Russia’s commitments under the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement are binding in international law;
Russia ceased production of fissile material for nuclear weapons many years ago;
over time Russia will become increasingly reliant on imported uranium for its expanding civil power sector, so to breach a uranium supply agreement could have significant energy and economic consequences for Russia;
all facilities using AONM must be on Russia’s Eligible Facility List with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), so to use such facilities for military purposes would also be a breach of Russia’s safeguards agreement with the IAEA;
facilities on Russia’s Eligible Facility List are, by definition, eligible for, and may be subject to, IAEA inspections so should be prepared for that possibility;
the facilities in which AONM is processed and utilised would be mutually determined through consultation with Australia;
application of international-standard nuclear material accountancy and control measures at Russian facilities handling AONM would apply; and
the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office (ASNO) will receive detailed information on the disposition of AONM in Russia, which it will analyse for consistency with information from other sources including the IAEA and other suppliers, and ASNO’s knowledge of the processes and facilities involved.
Russia’s nuclear material security and accountancy have improved significantly in recent years.  However, to ensure that Australia’s robust nuclear material accountancy and control requirements for AONM are understood and will be consistently applied, ASNO conducted a technical workshop for a group of Russian safeguards officials in Canberra on 8-11 December 2008.  These discussions highlighted that Russian officials have a thorough understanding of nuclear accountancy and control, and provided further confidence that AONM in Russia will be appropriately controlled and accounted for.  Further training could be provided if required. Furthermore, the US Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) reports that it has trained over 1,100 Russian and former Soviet Union state personnel in physical protection and accountancy and control of nuclear materials at three training facilities of the Russian Federal Atomic Energy Agency (Rosatom).

Safeguards address risk of diversion

Safeguards are legal and technical measures to provide assurance that nuclear material and nuclear items are not diverted from peaceful use to nuclear weapons.  Safeguards may be applied at the multilateral level – usually by the IAEA – and at the bilateral level, through bilateral agreements.
Confidence that a state will not divert nuclear material from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons is not based solely on safeguards measures, but takes into account a number of factors.  These include whether the state might have a motivation to divert, and its participation in relevant treaty regimes.  Safeguards are not mechanistic.  Determining the level of safeguards sufficient to provide confidence of non-diversion is a matter of judgment based on implementation experience by the IAEA and national safeguards authorities. 
In the case of the five nuclear-weapon states recognised by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the risk they might divert nuclear material subject to safeguards from civil programs to nuclear weapons programs is remote.  They would simply have no need to divert such material as all nuclear-weapon states have sufficient stocks of fissile material for their nuclear weapon programs.  Furthermore, all the NPT nuclear-weapon states ceased production of fissile material for nuclear weapons in the 1980s or early 1990s.
In the case of Russia it stopped fissile material production for weapons many years ago.  In 1989 the Soviet Union declared it no longer produced high enriched uranium (HEU) for weapons, and in 1994 Russia declared its cessation of plutonium production for weapons.  Indeed, Russia is pursuing an active program of releasing fissile material from its military stocks for civil use.  Under the “Megatons to Megawatts” program Russia has down-blended some 380 metric tonnes of HEU, equivalent to at least 15,000 nuclear warheads, to supply the United States with low enriched uranium for power generation.  This program is on-going, and will ultimately see the elimination of 500 tonnes of HEU, equivalent to at least 20,000 nuclear warheads.  Russia has also committed to a program of disposal of  surplus weapons-grade plutonium.  In the Joint Statement on Nuclear Cooperation by United States President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 6 July 2009, the US and Russia committed to “executing the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation Concerning the Management and Disposition of Plutonium Designated as No Longer Required for Defense Purposes and Related Cooperation to dispose of 34 metric tons each of weapons-grade plutonium.” Under this Plutonium Disposition Agreement the plutonium will be converted into mixed oxide fuel for use in commercial nuclear power plants, thereby rendering it unsuitable for weapons use.
It is highly unlikely that Russia would, on the one hand dispose of its enormous surplus stocks of fissile material, and on the other hand seek to divert uranium from Australia or elsewhere and subject such uranium to all the processing required in order to produce material suitable for a weapon. 
As surplus fissile material stocks run down, the need to verify that more is not produced will grow.  Australia is a long-standing proponent of a fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT), prohibiting further production of fissile material for nuclear weapons, and applying verification measures to relevant facilities, including in nuclear-weapon states.  Verification will also be required as further nuclear disarmament steps progress.

Legal basis for safeguards

For states that are party to the NPT, the obligation to accept IAEA safeguards – and the corresponding responsibility of the IAEA to apply safeguards – is based on the states’ commitments under that Treaty. 
Article III of the NPT requires non-nuclear-weapon states to accept IAEA safeguards on all their nuclear material, to verify fulfilment of obligations under the NPT not to acquire nuclear weapons.  The IAEA has a corresponding responsibility to apply safeguards on all nuclear material and facilities in these states. 
In the case of the five nuclear-weapon states recognised under the NPT (United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France and China) there is no obligation in the NPT for these countries to accept IAEA safeguards, and there is no obligation for the IAEA to apply safeguards.  It is bilateral agreements such as Australia’s Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with Russia that create an obligation for nuclear material or facilities to be eligible for safeguards.  The United States and Canada have similar requirements in their bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia.  However, there is no country arguing for the general application of IAEA safeguards inspections in nuclear-weapon states.
While under no obligation under the NPT, nuclear-weapon states have concluded “voluntary offer” safeguards agreements with the IAEA.  Under such agreements nuclear-weapon states designate nuclear material as being subject to safeguards, and therefore eligible for IAEA inspection, by designating facilities using this material on an “Eligible Facility List”. 
The IAEA selects those facilities on the Eligible Facility List that it wishes to inspect.  In practice the IAEA only inspects facilities where inspectors benefit through gaining experience with a particular type of facility, or where there is nuclear material being transferred to or received from a non-nuclear-weapon state.  Where the IAEA chooses not to inspect particular facilities, this does not mean that inclusion of a facility on the Eligible Facility List is of no safeguards value.  If a nuclear-weapon state were to use a facility on its Eligible Facility List for military purposes, this would place it in breach of its safeguards agreement with the IAEA.  Furthermore, because any eligible facility may be selected for inspection, the facility operator should maintain nuclear accountancy records and other safeguards procedures at IAEA standards so that an inspection can be readily performed if the facility is selected. 

Australia’s safeguards policy

The Government permits supply of Australian uranium only where it is satisfied the uranium will be used exclusively for peaceful purposes.  A network of bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements creates legally-binding commitments that AONM will not be diverted to any non-peaceful use.  The Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with Russia meets all of Australia’s long-standing safeguards policy requirements.
To confirm that undertakings in the safeguards agreements are met, Australia makes use of several measures.  In addition to the international safeguards system established pursuant to the NPT, and applied by the IAEA, ASNO maintains a nuclear accounting system for all AONM, consistent with internationally accepted standards for best practice for nuclear material accountancy and control.
ASNO receives regular reports and notifications from bilateral partners and consults with them to account for how all AONM  is used.  ASNO draws a conclusion on whether AONM has been satisfactorily accounted for, taking into account:
- information provided by, and through consultations with, bilateral partners;
- IAEA safeguards findings, transit matching data, etc; and
- other information and analysis on nuclear activities in each country.
The details of the nuclear accounting system that Russia would apply under the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement would be outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between ASNO and the Russian Federal Atomic Energy Agency (Rosatom).  The provisions of the MOU would be based on long-standing practice by Australia and other suppliers of nuclear material (e.g. European Union, United States, Canada).  This practice is being reinforced through a document of “common understandings and practices with regard to the administration of obligation accounting and transfers pursuant to nuclear cooperation agreements” that Australia is developing with counterparts in the United States, Canada and the European Union, which will further validate Australia’s rigorous standards for obligation accounting.

Recommendation 1


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government not proceed with ratification of the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Russian Federation on Cooperation in the Use of Nuclear Energy for Peaceful Purposes until:


(a) Russia’s reform process to clearly separate its civilian nuclear and military nuclear facilities is completed and independently verified.

The Nuclear Cooperation Agreement requires that all facilities eligible to process, use or store AONM be included on Russia’s Eligible Facility List under its safeguards agreement with the IAEA – a designation that formalises such facilities as civil.  To use these facilities for military purposes would not only be a breach of Russia’s agreement with Australia, but also its safeguards agreement with the IAEA.
ASNO’s discussions with international counterparts, the nuclear industry and other reporting, as well as discussions with Russian authorities, indicate that the separation of Russia’s civil and military nuclear sectors has been completed.  Russia’s civil and military nuclear programs were not closely intertwined prior to the separation.  They were operated by the same organisation, but many facilities, including most if not all power reactors, have been used only for civil purposes. 
Furthermore, as noted in the “Safeguards address risk of diversion” section above, Russia ceased production of fissile material for nuclear weapons many years ago.  This fact further reinforces confidence that AONM will be processed, used or stored only in civil facilities.

(b) IAEA inspections are implemented for Russian facilities that will handle Australian Obligated Nuclear Materials.

The Government has no scope to implement this recommendation, as prioritisation of safeguards resources is a matter for the IAEA.  The Government accepts the judgment by the IAEA Secretariat (with full support of the IAEA Board of Governors) that the priority for safeguards inspection resources is countering “horizontal proliferation” – i.e. ensuring that no further states acquire nuclear weapons.  To redirect IAEA resources to increased inspections in nuclear-weapon states is not supported by a risk-based assessment of safeguards priorities.
The IAEA will be conducting some inspections in Russia where there are particular safeguards advantages in doing so.  For example, during 2008 the IAEA inspected fuel assemblies in Russia prepared for supply to the Bushehr power reactor in Iran.  Furthermore, Russia is committed to having IAEA inspections at the Angarsk international enrichment centre.  Russia and the IAEA are discussing the modalities of the necessary arrangements, and inspections are expected to commence in 2010.  Russia has asked the IAEA to perform inspections at other facilities, but to date the IAEA has not done so, for the reasons outlined in the “Legal basis for safeguards” section above.  In light of this particular JSCOT recommendation, Australia has also asked the IAEA to consider some additional inspections in Russia, but again the IAEA has shown no inclination to do so.

(c) The Government is satisfied that the Russian Federation is complying with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Pro-lifera-tion of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) noting that this treaty is scheduled for review in 2010.

The Government is confident that Russia takes seriously its obligations under the NPT. 
The Soviet Union was one of the initiators of the NPT, and it and its successor state Russia have a long record of strong support for the Treaty.  There have been no findings by the IAEA or NPT Parties of non-compliance by the Soviet Union or Russia with its NPT obligations.  Russia’s commitment to the NPT was re-stated on 8 July 2009 in the G8 Summit in L’Aquila, Italy. The G8 members’ statement on non-proliferation included: “We underscore that the NPT remains the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament, and reiterate our full commitment to the objectives and obligations of its three pillars: non-proliferation, the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and disarmament”.
As a nuclear-weapon state under the NPT, Russia has committed to several nuclear energy, disarmament and non-proliferation obligations, in particular:

Article I:
 
 Each nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices directly, or indirectly; and not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or control over such weapons or explosive devices.

There is no evidence that Russia is in non-compliance with its obligation not to transfer nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices to any recipient country.  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, apart from Russia, three former Soviet republics – Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine – were left with Soviet nuclear weapons on their territory.  These three states agreed to the return of these weapons to Russia, and joined the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon states.
Furthermore, there is no evidence that Russia is in non-compliance with its obligation not to assist, encourage or induce any non-nuclear-weapon state to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons. 
Russia is a member of the Six Party Talks whose aim is to disarm North Korea of its nuclear weapons, and reacted strongly to North Korea’s May 2009 nuclear test.  Russia is also active as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in international efforts to halt Iran’s uranium enrichment and reprocessing-related activities.

Article III (2):
 
 Each State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide: (a) source or special fissionable material, or (b) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material, to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes, unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this Article.

In accordance with NPT obligations, Russia requires the application of IAEA safeguards to nuclear material it supplies to non-nuclear-weapon states. 

Article IV (2):
 
 All the Parties to the Treaty undertake to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
 
 Parties to the Treaty in a position to do so shall also co-operate in contributing alone or together with other States or international organizations to the further development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the territories of non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty, with due consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the world.

Russia fulfils its obligations under this Article through its extensive civil nuclear energy industry and its peaceful nuclear cooperation with other states.  A key example is its creation of the international nuclear fuel cycle centre at Angarsk, which aims to provide security of supply for states requiring nuclear fuel, thereby removing any need for them to consider developing national enrichment capabilities.
Russia is also establishing a reserve of low enriched uranium for use by IAEA member states, which is likewise aimed at providing security of supply.  The IAEA Board of Governors on 27 November 2009 welcomed this initiative, and authorised the IAEA Director General to conclude an agreement with Russia to facilitate such supply.

Article VI:
 
 Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.

Although there is debate about the pace and scale of the nuclear-weapon states’ compliance with this Article, since the NPT entered into force the Soviet Union/Russia has made reductions to its nuclear arsenal and has contributed to the effective cessation of the nuclear arms race, beginning with the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in 1972. 
Under the verifiable 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) between the US and Russia, Russia is estimated to have reduced its nuclear arsenal to about 15,000 warheads (6,000 strategic and 9,000 tactical), down from a cold war peak of about 45,000.  Under the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT or the Moscow Treaty), Russia and the United States both agreed to limit their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 each by 2012.  Furthermore, on 6 July 2009 Presidents Obama and Medvedev in a statement of joint understanding outlined their goals to reduce their strategic warheads even further to between 1,500 and 1,675 under a replacement to START, which expired on 5 December 2009.  In a joint statement on 4 December 2009 Presidents Obama and Medvedev expressed their commitment to work together in the spirit of the START treaty following its expiration and their firm intention that a replacement treaty enter into force at the earliest possible date.
Russia ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 2000. It has contributed responsibly to the development of verification arrangements for that treaty, including the establishment of the International Monitoring System. 
Australia has been active in promoting nuclear disarmament and adherence to Article VI of the NPT, in various fora, including the Conference on Disarmament, the NPT preparatory and review processes and with nuclear-weapons states bilaterally.  Australia will continue to do so, including with Russia.

(d) The Government is satisfied that Russia will not subsequently abandon this treaty or other nuclear treaties.

It is the view of the Australian Government that Russia will not abandon the NPT or other nuclear treaties, including the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with Australia.  The NPT is regarded by most states, including Russia, as the cornerstone of the international nuclear non-prolifera-tion and disarmament regimes.  Russia’s national security interests are served by the NPT.  The Treaty constrains global nuclear weapons capabilities, including Russia’s major strategic rivals – notably China and the United States. The NPT stems the proliferation of nuclear weapons, thus decreasing the likelihood of regional nuclear wars, including on Russia’s extensive borders, thereby increasing Russia’s security.  In addition, the NPT helps Russia’s commercial interests by establishing the conditions under which civil nuclear technology can be supplied.
The Nuclear Cooperation Agreement states that it is to remain in force for an initial period of 30 years (Article XVIII(2)).  After the initial 30 year period, the Agreement shall remain in force indefinitely and shall only terminate 180 days after receipt of a notice to terminate by either Party (Article XVIII(3)).  In the event of a termination of the Agreement, the peaceful-use and safeguards obligations remain in perpetuity on any nuclear material already supplied.  If Russia did act in a manner inconsistent with the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, the Agreement provides that Australia has the right to suspend its supply of uranium and require Russia to take corrective steps (Article XV).
Further nuclear disarmament is vital – this is why the Government is committed to Australia playing a strong leadership role on nuclear non-pro-liferation and disarmament.  This commitment is reflected in Australia’s establishment, with Japan, of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament to reinvigorate international efforts on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.  The Commission’s report “Elim-ina-ting Nuclear Threats” was launched on 15 December 2009.  The goal of nuc-lear disarmament will be best enhanced through constructive engagement with the nuclear-weapon states, including through nuclear cooperation agreements.

(e) Further consideration is given to the potential ramifications for this agreement of recent political events affecting Russia.

The Government expressed deep concern about Russia’s military action in Georgia and its subsequent recognition of the “independence” of the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  The Government supports the territorial integrity of Georgia and provided A$ 1 million in assistance to help Georgia recover from the intervention.  As the Committee notes, on 1 September 2008, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith MP, said that when considering the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, the Government would take into account events in Georgia, Australia’s bilateral relationship with Russia and the merits of the agreement.
Since the publication of the Committee’s report, there has been progress under a European Union mediated ceasefire agreement of 12 August 2008 and an additional agreement of 8 September 2008.  Russian troops have withdrawn from positions deep within Georgia to the disputed regions.  Several rounds of international discussions on stability and security in the region have been held and are on-going.
The Government welcomes these developments.  The Government notes also that members of the international community have moved – bilaterally and multilaterally – to re-engage Russia on issues of common interest and concern.  The US Administration of President Barack Obama has sought to “reset” relations with Russia, and President Obama visited Moscow on 6-8 July 2009.  Negotiations on a European Union-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement have resumed and EU-Russia Leaders Summits were held in May and November of 2009.  NATO began a phased re-engagement with Russia and NATO foreign ministers met for a NATO-Russia Council ministerial meeting in Corfu on 27 June 2009.
The Government continues to monitor events in Georgia.  A long-term solution to this long-run-n-ing dispute remains elusive.  Russia and Georgia remain in dispute over some elements of the agreements of August-September 2008.  The maintenance of peace and security in Georgia will require ongoing commitment to the ceasefire agree-ments, including access by international monitors.  The Government continues to call on Russia to exercise restraint, to respect the terms of the agreements, including in relation to its military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and to engage constructively in international discussions on stability and security. 

(f)
 
 Further consideration is given to Article IX of the Agreement’s ‘State Secrets’, and the Government is confident that this article will not undermine the intent of this agreement.

The Government is satisfied that Article IX of the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement does not undermine the intent of the Agreement.   
Article IX does not compromise ASNO’s right to information about the use of AONM in Russia.  This Article reflects the position that already applies under Russian and Australian law, namely that nationally classified information is not exchanged under nuclear cooperation agreements such as this.  Russia proposed this provision to satisfy its domestic requirements for cooperation agreements to be clear on the kind of information to which they apply.  Furthermore, this Article contains reciprocal rights and ensures adequate and appropriate protection of Australian information.
During the technical workshop with Russian safeguards officials on 8-11 December 2008, the application of Article IX was discussed to confirm mutual understandings of how this article would apply.

(g)
 
 Further consideration is given to the justification for secrecy of ‘Material Unaccounted For’.

The Government is of the view that no further consideration of this matter is required.  The term “material unaccounted for” (MUF) relates to the difference between recorded quantities and measured quantities of nuclear material, and is a normal occurrence in the verification of nuclear accounts.  It is a nuclear accounting measure that results from factors such as differences in measurement values from different measurement equipment or small traces of nuclear material held up in processing equipment (e.g. tanks, pipes, vessels).  It does not necessarily equate to material missing.  MUF can be negative (i.e. the measured quantity is greater than the recorded quantity) corresponding to an apparent “gain”, or positive (i.e. the measured quantity is less than the recorded quantity) corresponding to an apparent “loss”.  Examples of MUF include the accumulation of small amounts of nuclear material in processing facilities, reconciliation of estimated and measured quantities, and rounding of measurements.  When ASNO concludes that all AONM is satisfactorily accounted for, or when the IAEA draws the conclusion that all declared nuclear material is accounted for, this means that the explanation for any MUF is accepted as being satisfactory.
The question of publishing data on MUF in other countries is not a decision that can be made by Australia, but rather a decision for each bilateral partner.  It is generally not the practice of governments or nuclear operators to publish MUF figures (though ASNO publishes Australia’s figures in its Annual Reports), and Australia’s bilateral partners do not agree to ASNO publishing MUF figures for AONM in their jurisdiction.
There can be legitimate commercial sensitivity issues with publishing MUF figures for facilities.  This matter was last considered more broadly in the context of the details of administrative arrangements as part of the Government-com-mis-sioned review of Australia’s role in the nuclear fuel cycle in 1983-85 (report to the Prime Minister by the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) – known as the ASTEC Report).  The importance of respecting commercial confidentiality was reflected in ASTEC recommendation 15 that “the Australian Government seek agreement with its bilateral partners to make public the texts of the Administrative Arrangements, in such a way as to avoid adverse implications for physical protection and commercial confidentiality.” 
In line with this ASTEC recommendation, at various times Australian officials have sought the agreement of bilateral partners to publish the Administrative Arrangements but agreement has not been forthcoming. 

(h) The Australian Government discusses with the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada and Japan, whether the problems of the past in relation to Russian nuclear material being stolen, have now been addressed satisfactorily.

Australian officials have had a series of discussions with officials from the United States, United Kingdom, the European Union, Canada, Japan, and the IAEA, to ensure the Government remains informed of the status of nuclear and radiological security in Russia, and will continue such discussions in order to ensure that the information available to the Government remains current.  The information gathered to date by ASNO indicates that the security risks to AONM in Russia are not significant. 
The improvement in security of nuclear materials in Russia over the last decade is important here.  It is the nature of nuclear security that it remains under ongoing examination, and in that regard Russia is not alone in continuing to make improvements in nuclear security practices.  Furthermore, Russia has committed itself in the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement to meet the requirements of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) and the security guidelines set out by the IAEA in protecting AONM.  Russia has also deposited its instrument of ratification with the IAEA (on 19 September 2008) for the Amended CPPNM, making Russia the eighteenth state to do so out of the approximately 90 ratifications required to bring the Amended CPPNM into force.
Many of the countries with which Australian officials have consulted are also in the process of expanding, or have expanded nuclear cooperation with Russia. The US and Russia signed a nuclear cooperation agreement in May 2008.  This was subsequently withdrawn from Congressional review in September 2008, but US President Obama and Russian President Medvedev announced in a Joint Statement on 1 April 2009 that the US and Russia would work to bring the agreement into force.  Japan signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia on 12 May 2009, and on 3 June 2009 Canada and Russia concluded an amendment to their nuclear cooperation agreement to expand the terms under which Canadian uranium can be used in Russia.
ASNO has also made use of the IAEA’s Illicit Trafficking Database (ITDB). The ITDB is an information system that lists incidents across a broad range of categories (including discoveries, unauthorised activities, unintended transfers and trafficking) related to both nuclear and radioactive material. The ITDB spans 1993 to the present.
In September 2009 the IAEA published a fact sheet on its ITDB reporting the total number of incidents world-wide for the period 1993-2008.  The vast majority of incidents over this period relate to radioactive materials (e.g. radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine), not nuclear material.  Moreover, in most cases, including in Russia, the quantities of material involved were small (typically in the gram to kilogram range).
Furthermore, according to the ITDB only a small number of confirmed incidences of unauthorised possession – 15 in total from 1993 to 2008 – have involved materials of significant proliferation concern, namely HEU and plutonium.  Of these, the ITDB reports only two incidents having occurred in Russia – one in 1993-94 involving 2.972 kg of HEU and the other in 1995-96 involving 1.7 kg of HEU1. 
Any theft of nuclear material is a serious matter – especially in the case of HEU or plutonium that could contribute to a nuclear explosive.  Nuclear material of Russian origin has been found in the black market, however, this material is believed to have come from thefts in the 1990s, and importantly, not from the facilities that would be handling AONM. 
AONM in Russia would be handled in civil facilities of the following types: conversion facilities; enrichment facilities; fuel fabrication facilities; and light water reactors.  The AONM would be in forms that are less sensitive for nuclear proliferation:
- natural uranium – in the form of uranium ore concentrates and natural uranium hexafluoride;
- depleted uranium – in the form of uranium hexafluoride; and
- low enriched uranium (LEU) – in the form of uranium hexafluoride, uranium oxide fuel pellets, and fuel assemblies.
Natural, depleted and low enriched uranium is of low strategic value and will be mostly in forms that would be difficult to remove illegally – 400 kg drums of yellowcake, cylinders of uranium hexafluoride weighing between two and thirteen tonnes, and fuel assemblies, weighing around one tonne.  Spent fuel has a high degree of “self-protection” against theft due to high radiation levels.  As Australia has not given consent to high enrichment or reprocessing of AONM by Russia, in the foreseeable future AONM in Russia will not include material of high strategic value, i.e. HEU or separated plutonium.
While the quantities of Russian origin nuclear material described in the ITDB have been relatively small from the perspective of use in a nuclear weapon, there has been a considerable international effort to address the security of nuclear material in Russia over the last decade or more.  In particular, the United States, European Union, Japan and Canada established substantial assistance programs in training, equipment upgrades etc – worth over $US10 billion – to improve the state of nuclear security in Russia. 
A summary of international viewpoints on some of the nuclear and radiological security programs in Russia are outlined below. These reinforce the strong non-proliferation and security benefits that have resulted over the years through cooperative engagement with Russia.
A report commissioned by the Nuclear Threat Initiative in 2007 concluded that nuclear security in Russia had dramatically improved since the mid-1990s as a result of US and other international assistance, and Russia’s own efforts.  Further, then IAEA Director-General ElBaradei stated that “the cooperation between the Agency and Russia has also been exemplary in support of efforts for the application of international standards and guidelines to enhance the safety and security of nuclear power plants, research reactors and radioactive sources.”2

In a media release issued on 23 December 2008, the then Secretary of the US Department of Energy Mr Samuel W Bodman said that “US cooperation with Russia to reach the goals of the Bratislava Nuclear Security Initiative has made the world a safer place”.  Secretary Bodman went on to say that he was “proud of the work we [i.e. US and Russia] have accomplished together, which has made an enormous contribution to global security.  These efforts demonstrate our recognition of the grave threat posed by a terrorist’s acquisition of nuclear weapons and our determination to prevent this from happening.”
On 15 July 2009 NNSA reported that NNSA, Rosatom and the Russian Ministry of Defence had successfully completed by the end of 2008 all nuclear security upgrades to Russian civilian and military sites under a plan crafted in 2005 by then-US President Bush and then-Russian President Putin at a summit in Bratislava, Slovakia (known as the Bratislava Nuclear Security Initiative).  The US and Russia have also reached agreement on principles to sustain security upgrades over the longer term.
NNSA, through its Second Line of Defense Core Program has been also working with the Russian Customs Service to strengthen Russia’s overall capacity to detect, deter and interdict illicit trafficking of nuclear and radioactive materials at its borders.  In this, NNSA is working to equip all 370 Russian border crossings with radioactive detection equipment by the end of 2011.  As of July 2009, equipment had been installed at 161 sites. Additionally, NNSA has also been working with Russian authorities since 1996 to improve training, equipment and procedures for guard forces accompanying nuclear material shipments.
Russia has recently reiterated its support for measures to strengthen the non-proliferation regime and nuclear security. The Joint Statement of 6 July 2009 by United States President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Nuclear Cooperation included the following undertakings: 
“The United States of America and the Russian Federation confirm their commitment to strengthening their cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and stop acts of nuclear terrorism.”
“To continue to improve the level of nuclear security and to combat existing and emerging threats, our experts will continue working to further improve physical protection systems at nuclear facilities and ensure that these improvements will be sustained in the long term.”
“We express our mutual desire to expand capabilities to combat illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and radioactive substances at the borders of our countries.”
Russia’s cooperation with NNSA has not been restricted to improving nuclear security in Russia.  Since the establishment of the NNSA’s Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) in 2004, the NNSA and Russia have been working closely together to repatriate Russian-origin HEU fuel to Russia.  Some recent actions under the GTRI include the return from Kazakhstan of 73.7 kg of Russian-origin HEU spent fuel, and the return from Romania of 53.7 kg of Russian-origin HEU spent and fresh fuel.  The NNSA reported in a press release of 30 June 2009 that with the successful completion of the HEU removal from Romania, a total of approximately 862 kilograms of Russian-origin spent and fresh HEU fuel has been returned from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Libya, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.

Recommendation 2


The Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation, made in Report 81:


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government lobbies the IAEA and the five declared nuclear weapon states under the NPT to make the safeguarding of all conversion facilities mandatory.

For the reasons set out in the response provided to the recommendation in Report 81, the Government does not intend to action this recommendation.
Uranium conversion is not a primary point of proliferation concern, even less so in respect of nuclear-weapon states.  The IAEA has not made safeguarding of conversion facilities in nuclear-weapon states a priority.  Safeguarding of conversion facilities in nuclear-weapon states would not be an effective use of limited international safeguards resources. 
The safeguards resource requirements would be substantial since most conversion facilities do not incorporate design features to facilitate application of safeguards.

Recommendation 3


The Committee recommends that Australian efforts to strengthen the resourcing of the IAEA be continued.

The Government accepts this recommendation.
Australia’s approach to budgetary issues in the UN and other agencies such as the IAEA aims to ensure that international organisations prioritise their work and deliver their outcomes in the most efficient and effective way.  Australia works closely with other members of the Board of Governors of the IAEA to ensure the Agency is adequately resourced. To this end, at a special session on 3 August 2009, the IAEA Board of Governors approved a 2.7 percent real increase to the IAEA’s 2010 budget along with a 2.7 percent price adjustment. The IAEA’s regular budget for 2010 is Euro 318.3 million.
In addition to our annual assessed contribution to the IAEA’s regular budget, Australia makes regular voluntary contributions to the IAEA’s Technical Cooperation Fund and has also contributed to the Nuclear Security Fund.

2 Message of then DG IAEA, Dr Mohamed El Baradei to the 50th anniversary conference at the Diplomatic Academy, Moscow 11 December 2007.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,52,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-03-18,"—by leave—I wish to speak briefly on the government response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which Senator Faulkner has just tabled. The report was tabled a short time after I began my term here. It was just being wound up when I was appointed to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. This committee does enormously valuable work. It is a very valuable addition to the committees that we have here. The report was on the proposed Russian uranium deal which was on the verge of being signed at the time of the change of government. It was just as well that that deal was put on hold, because the JSCOT report worked very hard in scrutinising the expert evidence that was presented to the committee.
The committee has been resoundingly insulted by the government in the response that the minister has just tabled. John Carlson, the Director General of the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office was quite conspicuous in his spruiking of safeguards as the answer to every concern raised by the committee, while failing to tell the committee that there had been no inspections of Russian nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency since 2001. So how does the world know, as ASNO and the government so firmly believe with such enormous faith, that all is well in the Russian nuclear programs?
The government has issued a glib and dismissive response to the JSCOT report. To say that Russia is desperate for nuclear fuel and will therefore behave is not an argument that carries much weight or allays many of the concerns of the committee or, indeed, of the international community. That the government says that Australia has no scope to implement the suggestion that the IAEA actually do some inspections begs the questions: what exactly is our delegation doing in Vienna; how can we share the extraordinary confidence expressed at every turn by the government in the IAEA inspections when we cannot call upon them to actually do anything; and what opportunities are provided by being a member state of the IAEA if we have no voice in these fora?
There is no opportunity or leverage whatsoever to make suggestions or interventions regarding the appropriateness of safeguards activities in the countries to which we are considering selling uranium. Instead, we get these dismissive government responses saying, ‘Everything’s fine.’ The fact is that the people who wrote that government response do not know that everything is fine; rather, they are taking the word of people who do not know themselves. To say that no other countries are arguing for the general application of IAEA safeguards inspections in nuclear weapons states is to ignore the concerns that have been expressed quite regularly at Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty meetings and other fora by non-nuclear weapons states about the highly discriminatory nature of this treaty and the asymmetrical obligations and degrees of inspection that they are subject to in contrast to the cone of silence under which the nuclear weapons states—and none more so than Russia—conduct their business.
It is just blatantly false to say that Russia is complying with its disarmament obligations under the NPT. Russia is doing no such thing. Russia has an arsenal of more than 14,000 nuclear weapons with an explosive yield equivalent to 200,000 Hiroshima sized weapons. The reduction in the number of weapons held by Russia is no comfort since, in Vladimir Putin’s words, Russia plans to make its arsenal ‘more compact but more effective’.
So reading about the Australian government’s belief that Russia is upholding its obligations under article 6 of the NPT would be funny if it were not so serious. The joint standing committee noted that there is no imperative for early ratification of the Howard-Putin agreement and advises reconsideration of the agreement after the 2010 NPT review conference. That is coming up in a matter of five weeks or so. A legal opinion from Professor Donald Rothwell, Professor of International Law at the Australian National University College of Law, states that Australia has an international obligation to pursue work in good faith towards the objective of nuclear disarmament consistent with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Professor Rothwell states quite correctly that this obligation is heightened in the case of Australia’s interaction with a nuclear state that is a party to the NPT such as Russia and in relationships where parties are mutually engaged in matters related to nuclear disarmament, including nuclear energy and proliferation.
Some quite reasonable and sensible suggestions were made during the course of the inquiry, including: to renegotiate the key terms of the treaty if it is to proceed and not just rubber-stamp and wave it through; to allow for higher monitoring, verification and safeguard standards than are currently envisaged under either the proposed treaty or the International Atomic Energy Agency additional protocol—measures that were introduced in 1997 to strengthen the inspection authority of the IAEA; and to insert conditionality clauses into the treaty on the rule of law, democracy and human rights and a termination clause on nuclear disarmament, allowing Australia to terminate the treaty, inter alia, in the event that Russia does not make progress towards its disarmament obligations, which it clearly has failed to do thus far.
This is a flawed treaty and it will weaken Australia’s policy and practice on nuclear safeguards. It will compromise our efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons and will make Australia complicit in serious failures of the Russian state, where the rule of law, democratic values and human rights are, quite simply, not being observed.
This government response is being taken by the Australian Greens as a dismissal of the findings of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and essentially paving the way to do what the mining industry has been demanding since Prime Minister Howard was in government—that we open the floodgates to sales of uranium to Russia. It is quite transparently preparing the ground for exactly that kind of move. While they might be popping champagne at the Minerals Council of Australia and in the offices of BHP and Rio Tinto tonight, we strongly believe that this is a move that the Australian public, the Australian government and probably the people of Russia will regret. This is an absolutely retrograde move. JSCOT very, very rarely tables a report on a treaty proposed by the Australian government with such strong language. It is extremely rare for the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to recommend that treaty action not proceed. I do not know of many times that that has occurred in the history of the committee. For the government to wait around for 12 or 18 months and then issue this trite, dismissive and factually incorrect statement in response is nothing more than what we might have read in a press release from BHP or Rio Tinto. JSCOT deserves more respect than that for the hard work that has been done on a cross-party basis. The people under the footprint of the mining industry where this material is excavated deserve better than that. Quite frankly, this is a move that the Australian people and the Australian government will regret.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,52,2
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the NBN Co. Ltd report for the period 9 April to 30 June 2009. Last week I was listening to this debate in the chamber and I have been listening to it today. What I have heard from the opposition is an argument of envy—envy like the green shamrock on St Patrick’s Day. Rather than coming up with reasonable, sustainable arguments on their issues associated with this magnificent policy that Labor have introduced, all those opposite can do is be envious, like they are of our ETS. If you look at their program, you can see that it was going to produce more carbon and cost more. That was their policy rather than—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—That is right, at one stage they did support our CPRS but then they backflipped into their normal role. Lately, we have heard the opposition’s position on paid parental leave—another example of their envious position on the government’s proposal in this area. And, lo and behold, the opposition’s proposal has been demonstrated as a big new tax. All this week, the opposition’s position has been one of running untruthful, envious arguments against the Rudd Labor government’s successes. We heard them once again today arguing over the Building the Education Revolution—and bear in mind that they voted against it. They also voted against the $42 billion stimulus package that kept people in employment and helped them to hold onto their homes.
There was also a need for the government to inject funds into a depleted school infrastructure program—$16.2 billion. We had to put the funding in to stimulate that part of the economy and also to assist schools. Let us disregard the fact that the opposition will be turning up on the day that the school halls and science programs will be launched. They will be there for their photo opportunity, with big smiles on their faces. They will want to get a photo with the duty senator or the member in the hope that it will be in their local newspaper.
I will now go back to the NBN policy. The government has announced that it will connect 90 per cent of homes, schools and workplaces with fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure that is capable of providing broadband services and speeds of 100 megabits per second. That is 100 times faster than what most people currently have. The remaining premises will be connected with next-generation wireless and satellite technologies, which will be able to deliver speeds of at least 12 megabits per second to people living in remote places in rural Australia who had been forgotten under the previous government for 12 years. That is our policy on the NBN.
If I reflect back to the situation where I had to purchase a desktop PC—it was about 17 years ago when my son was moving through his education—I can still recall the slow connections in those days. Downloading items was always a task. It was as slow as a great-grandmother’s search for an elusive button in the haberdashery store. That is how slow it was in those days. The opposition want to keep us at that pace. They want to keep us in the past. They do not want to accept the fact that we have technology. They will not embrace technology. They are frightened of technology. That is the issue of those opposite. They are frightened of the Matrix. They have been overdosed on the Matrix movie. They have been overdosed on the Robocop movies. They do not like technology. They believe in all those science fiction movies that they watched day in and day out.
Let us have a look at what they thought of NBN, or broadband, when they were in government. They wanted to exclude it to only five capital cities. They did not want to accept the fact that we were in the bottom half of OECD countries for broadband take-up—16th out of 30 countries. They were not prepared to accept the fact that we paid more for broadband—20th out of 29 countries. Australia is the fourth most expensive country for low-speed connections and the fifth most expensive for medium-speed connections in terms of average monthly subscription prices. Those opposite want to keep us in the dark, rather than go where we are heading as a government— (Time expired)

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2010-03-18,"—I rise to speak to the NBN document with regard to an urgency motion that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Mr Tanner, saw fit to move in the House this morning. The motion spoke about not putting the sites that have been chosen for the NBN to the Public Works Committee for scrutiny.
I have been a member of the Public Works Committee for five years, and I am now deputy chair. The Manual of procedures for departments and agencies, which the committee actually reviewed in this morning’s meeting, states that all Commonwealth expenditure on public works should be scrutinised by parliament—that is, referred to the committee. However, subsequent sections of the act provide that, under certain circumstances, a work may be exempted from scrutiny. One of the grounds for exemption is that of urgency. And I quote here section 1.44:
... agencies should write to the Committee at an early stage to inform it of the intention to seek an exemption.
Now, Mr Tanner or his office delivered the letter to the Public Works Committee this morning asking for an exemption after the committee’s meeting had finished. And he has form on this issue: in September last year, he again sought an exemption on the grounds of urgency. So, although he pays lip service to the work of the committee, he does nothing whatsoever to show that the government has faith in this committee to have proper scrutiny. As an added interesting point, paragraph 1.45 of the procedure manual states:
As action by the Minister for Finance … is necessary for all exemptions, Finance is responsible for coordinating necessary actions and must be informed at an early stage if an exemption to the Act is being sought.
Mr Tanner’s letter says: ‘Due to the late completion of the preparatory work for the first release sites, including the acquisition of network and geospatial tools, there has been insufficient time to refer the main works to your committee.’ The National Broadband Network has been on this government’s agenda since the government was elected in 2007, and yet the minister for finance cannot even find the time to deliver a letter to the committee in sufficient time for it to do its work.
But Minister Tanner is not the only minister at fault in this. Minister Conroy’s refusal to release the NBN implementation study highlights once again his determination to avoid scrutiny of Labor’s $43 billion National Broadband Network. The threshold at which government projects have to be presented to the Public Works Committee is $16 million. That is a drop in the ocean compared to $43 billion. Minister Conroy refuses to release key documents and he refuses to undertake any cost-benefit analysis. Twice in the last two days we have seen him refuse to comply with a Senate order to release the full report. He has refused to release a scientific study from the CSIRO that he publicly relied on. So the Australian Financial Review released it for him, after a protracted battle to obtain it under FOI, revealing that the document was only seven pages long. Now, even Minister Conroy, who has to read his question time answers from his computer so that he gets not one word wrong, will never, surely, be able to say to us that he did not have time to read a document that is seven pages long—not only that; it used Wikipedia as a key source. His demand that we not speak on his bill is also absolutely bizarre, given that sectors of our community want to know what is in the bill and how it is going to operate.
So last year Minister Tanner bypassed the Public Works Committee with a similar motion, but at least he informed us in writing. But today, and this is no stuff-up or coincidence, when it comes to the NBN, this government is using every trick in the book to avoid scrutiny, and as a member of the highly respected Public Works Committee I take great exception to that. I would like to ask all ministers of this government, keen though they are to avoid any degree of scrutiny whatsoever, to look to what they are expending, see if this is a good use of government money and then allow the Public Works Committee to undertake its use of scrutiny or exemption, as the case may be, and make a reasoned decision about what is the best way to do its work. We do not want ministers standing in the way of— (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I appreciate this opportunity to talk about the National Broadband Network and what it is going to mean to my home state. Those opposite, who keep knocking it all the time, do not want to look at the benefits that it is going to bring to Tasmanians in terms of opening up, for example, opportunities in education. They do not want to know what it is going to do in terms of benefits to the health system. But we know that, in their state election, Tasmanians are not prepared to risk Tony Abbott, with his history of ripping a billion dollars out of the health system. What we do need to put on the record is that the Tasmanian state Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hodgman, although he is the runt of that litter, is supportive of the National Broadband Network and its rollout. He can see the future benefits that it will bring to the state.
What is really interesting in terms of the benefits the NBN will bring is that people like those opposite, Senator Barnett and co., who come into this chamber and relentlessly rewrite history, knock the Labor government for the way we have handled the global financial crisis, for the decisive action that we took to ensure that Australians kept their jobs. We talk about funding and investing in infrastructure; they had 12 years of neglecting it. They ripped money out of the higher education system, they ripped money out of the health system and they did not invest in infrastructure in this country. They did not invest in training. They did not invest in education. They did not invest in the future of young Australians.
So what have we done? The Rudd Labor government, during the worst financial crisis in my lifetime, the worst in over 50 years, acted decisively. We did not take the advice of Helen Coonan; we did not put our heads in the sand and ‘wait and see’ what happened. We took action, and that action has paid off. Have there been problems? Yes, there have. But when I was out at the Kings Meadows High School in Launceston a couple of weeks ago, opening their new classrooms, I can recall seeing the former Bass MHR, Mr Michael Ferguson, looking very, very uncomfortable, because it was the opposition who neglected education—Senator Colbeck and Senator whatever-his-name-is who is walking out of the chamber and whom nobody in Tasmania actually knows. Michael Ferguson was squirming in his seat because he was embarrassed that we were there to open a facility that that school has been waiting for for a long, long time. I would like to see those opposite, Senator Barnett, for example, go to the Launceston Christian School and tell the principal and the students and the community that their funding will be taken away from them. I would like them to go to the Launceston Grammar School and tell them that their desperately needed classrooms and facilities will be taken away—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. We are discussing this document that I hold—I suspect that Senator Polley has never seen it. It is the NBN Co. Ltd annual report. I am looking through it and I cannot see anywhere a reference to the Launceston school or any other school, for that matter. So I ask, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you bring Senator Polley to order to talk about the document we are on and not about anything else that might come to her mind.
 (Senator Ryan)—Thank you, Senator Macdonald. The debate is very wide ranging. The senator has been referring to the report. I would remind her of the report to which she is addressing her comments.
—It is amazing—you hit a nerve when you talk about the lack of investment from those that are passed, those that are part of history. Senator Macdonald is part of history; just ask John Howard—he knows all about the ability of the good senator on that side. But I am not going to be dissuaded from talking about the real benefits that national broadband will bring to my home state—in fact, to the nation. Those on the other side have no foresight. They have no policy. They do not want to hear about the benefits. They do not want to talk about the investment in our schools and the investment in infrastructure, because they neglected those areas for 12 very long years.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—The Australian people were not fooled at the last election, and I do not think they are going to be fooled again by a leader that promised there will be no new taxes. But what has he promised since? A big new tax. Who would he tax? The business community—those that the other side claim to represent in this place. The Australian people will not trust Mr Abbott because the risk is too great—the risk to their jobs, to the health system and to their children’s educational opportunities. The National Broadband Network is part of that. I feel very sorry for the Liberal senators opposite—

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-03-18,"—I can barely speak—I am cut to the quick by Senator Polley’s personal attack on me, saying that Mr Howard did not like me as a minister! After appointing me a minister for nine years, I think Mr Howard had a good idea of my failings and my attributes. Mr Acting Deputy President, I can assure you that Senator Polley will not be a minister for nine months, nine weeks, nine days or even nine hours. Senator Polley, if you want to get into people’s records as minister, I will have you on any day, because you will never get there.
I also heard Senator Polley accuse the opposition leader and next Premier of Tasmania of being the runt of the litter. We did not take any notice of that. Coming from Senator Polley, who would take objection to that? Mr Hodgman, of course, is a member of a very distinguished Tasmanian family. Fancy Senator Polley, who comes from a family that seems to trade political posts and seats in Tasmania, having the guile and the gall to accuse someone else of being a runt of a political leader. Perhaps she should look in a mirror when she wants to make another comment like that.
I have been distracted from the NBN Co., and that is unfortunate, because I wanted to refer to Senator Conroy’s comments yesterday in giving his excuses for not tabling the implementation study. He said:
Putting the study together required a multidisciplinary approach and an enormous and sustained effort, together with extensive shareholder consultation …
This is Senator Conroy saying he has had a delay in dealing with this because he had to have ‘extensive shareholder consultation’. You know who are the shareholders of the NBN Co.? Mr Tanner and—wait for it—Senator Conroy. So he had this huge delay consulting with himself! I can understand that Senator Conroy trying to find a brain in the person he was consulting with may have been difficult, but fancy using that for an excuse for delaying the implementation study!
I also came across recently, thanks to Senator Coonan, a report from back in 2008. I think this is instructive in this NBN Co. discussion. I quote from this news report:
But Senator Conroy said the Government would not contribute more than $4.7 billion, no matter whether the proposal was for an FTTN network or FTTH network—
that is, a fibre-to-the-node or fibre-to-the-home network. The report continues:
“Fibre-to-the-home has some wonderful potential but it is more costly and people have got to build the business case; they can’t expect the Government’s going to give more than $4.7 billion,” he said.
That is Senator Conroy it is quoting. What are the facts? A couple of months later he is putting $43 billion into it—not the $4.7 billion that he said he would not go above. And he is saying there has to be the business case made. We have been saying to him for the last 12 months: ‘Where is your business case?’ He would say, ‘Oh, look, we didn’t do a business case but it’ll all be in the implementation study; you can see it all there.’ We would ask: ‘Where are you going to get the money from, Minister? Who’s going to invest in this? You said that private industry was going to have a 49 per cent share in it; they were going to invest in it.’ ‘It’s all in the implementation study,’ Senator Conroy would say. We would ask him, ‘How is it going to make a profit?’ He would say, ‘Oh, it’s all in the implementation study.’
Yet, here we are, on the verge of new legislation, with the company now up and running, and we have certainly not seen a business case for it. It looks like we are not going to see the implementation study. We will not see it because Senator Conroy has to consult with himself. He has to get Mr Kaiser, no doubt, the government relations officer dealing with the government who owns the company, to give him some advice. I know the sort of advice Mr Kaiser could give—ask the courts in Queensland when he was required to resign. This report highlights the farcical nature of the NBN Co. (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I also rise tonight to speak on the NBN report. NBN is a very positive story for Tasmania. The rollout of the NBN is on track and starting to deliver high-speed broadband to the first premises in Tasmania from this year. As a senator for Tasmania, I thank the Rudd government and the Bartlett government for their contribution to ensuring that Tasmania is moving ahead. To the retail providers that Senator Conroy announced this week on the Mornington proof of concept test centre—that is Primus, Internode and iiNet—I thank them too for their commitment to Tasmania, for their enthusiasm, for their contribution to the development of the technology and for their investment. For Tasmania, strong interest means competition, more choice and better and more innovative services for the people that live there. But of course we still have not heard the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania come out and say he will continue to support the NBN rollout in Tasmania. He has previously said he supports it, and I appreciate that he said that, but since Mr Abbott has said he is going to take money out of the NBN we have not heard Mr Hodgman come out and say that he will support it.
What we have heard this week, though, is a whole pile of scaremongering and allegations of corruption in regard to the Tasmanian government which are pretty rich coming from senators representing the party that gave us Robin Gray and Edmund Rouse. Let us face it, those failed attempts to use bribery and to corrupt the political process ended in jail sentences. We know that the Liberal government were unable to even find enough candidates to run in Franklin in Tasmania. They had to get a failed candidate from the Family First party to run. We know she has got the support of Senator Abetz, so she has had a bit of favouritism. They come in here and they talk on and on and ridicule the Tasmanian government, but the Tasmanian Bartlett government is a forward-moving, forward-thinking government and I hope the people of Tasmania acknowledge that on Saturday when they go to the polls.
Earlier this week Senator Bushby, and I am pleased he is here to hear this, did not mind attacking a previous member of the Legislative Council. To my mind, her only fault—if they are going to fault her, and I do not fault her for this—is that she was an extremely hardworking member and supported the people of Pembroke. But, no, Senator Bushby had to come in here the other night and, amongst other disgusting and scurrilous attacks he made on a previous minister, bring her personal life into the debate. It is an absolutely inappropriate way for them to behave. The comments made the other night in regard to Allison Ritchie are scandalous and completely lacking in moral fortitude. Across the political divide, in case Senator Bushby had not realised this, there are a number of politicians who employ family members on their staff. His concern about Allison Ritchie was that she employed members of her family on her staff. In fact, although government ministers cannot hire close relatives, there are no restrictions on MPs. But obviously it is okay if it is on their side! I could name a few but I do not think that there is any point in doing that. This is full of great hypocrisy: they can do what they like but when it comes to somebody in the Labor Party, no matter where, if they are not labelling them with some 1940s communist type label, which shows you how far in the Dark Ages they are still living, they have to have a go at them for something else.
Let me point out the facts about the staff in Allison Ritchie’s office. Allison was the member for Pembroke from 5 May 2001 until 20 June 2009, so she had a number of different staff members, as she was entitled to. She was looking after the people of Pembroke, as I said. During that time she had three people employed who were in some way related to her. Two of these people were actually employed by the Department of Premier and Cabinet and underwent separate processes. Senator Bushby forgot to mention that the other night.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-03-18,"—I stand to speak also on the NBN Co. Ltd report for the period 9 April to 30 June 2009. In so doing, in the first instance I wish to respond to a comment from Senator Polley, who was speaking on the same report. As far as I am aware, that comment was one of the lowest personal attacks on the Liberal leader in Tasmania that I am aware of. Calling Will Hodgman the runt of the litter was totally inappropriate. Coming from Senator Polley, coming from anybody, it was entirely inappropriate. I would ask Senator Polley to take the time, perhaps on the adjournment or at a time in the very near future, to stand in this place and apologise on the public record for that comment. If I have got that wrong, I stand to be corrected, but that is my understanding. As for calling Will Hodgman the runt of the litter, he is the Liberal leader, he is a man of credibility, he is a man of substance, and he is leading the Liberal Party. He is—yes, indeed—the son of Michael Hodgman QC, MP, with decades of experience in the federal and state parliaments. To say that he is the runt of the litter is an absolute disgrace.
Senator Polley is indeed from a well-established Labor family in Tasmania. I commend her for that and I commend her family for their contribution to the Tasmanian community. But I am absolutely astounded that she would use those words in this place, and the Tasmanian people would find that incomprehensible and most inappropriate and unfair. I put that on the record right upfront and I ask Senator Polley to correct the record and to apologise for that accusation, because it is totally inappropriate.
With respect to this particular report, I want to touch on the issue of the $100 million Senator Conroy announced on 1 March as having been injected, past tense, into the NBN Tasmania. I have the media release here in front of me. It says:
Media Release
Senator the Hon. Stephen Conroy
The headline says:
$100 million injected into NBN Tas as Stage 3 rollout is announced
The first sentence says:
The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy, today announced the Rudd Government would make an equity injection of $100 million into NBN Tasmania, to facilitate the further rollout of fibre-to-the-home broadband in the State.
I say right upfront that all Tasmanians, and all of us on this side, want better broadband services for Tasmania. We want it and we know that it is going to benefit Tasmanian families and communities. Senator Conroy made this statement where he said that he has injected the $100 million, but when I checked the company documents yesterday—
Government senators interjecting—
 (Senator Ryan)—Order! Could senators please cease conversations across the chamber. We are debating at the moment.
—I do not mind the interjections, and I am happy to have the debate any time either in here or outside, because when you check the company documents from as late as yesterday that $100 million was not there. I go back to the fact that the Tasmanian NBN Co. Ltd was established and its first board appointed on 13 August 2009 as a wholly owned subsidiary of NBN Co. The government get lots of publicity, they make these grand statements and they put out a press release saying ‘$100 million injected’—past tense—to make you think that it had already been injected into the company and the money spent, when initially the amount was estimated at $700 million.
I have asked in this place—and the minister will not respond—exactly how much the federal government is putting in and how much the state government is putting in. We do not know. The initial announcement made about this was on 8 April last year. We are nearly at the one-year anniversary, and we still do not know how much money has been put in. This is typical of the waste and mismanagement of this government not just on the NBN Co. and the Tasmanian NBN but also on a whole range of other things, whether it is the pink batts fiasco or Building the Education Revolution—I call it ‘the waste revolution’. We want to know. I would like the minister, Senator Conroy, to come clean and say where that $100 million is. It has not been invested. It has not been injected. He should retract his media release of 1 March and stand up, come clean and apologise if that statement is incorrect. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I want to speak to the Highway to health: better access for rural, regional and remote patients report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs in the general context of cigarette smoking. I was a little distressed this week when I came to the parliament to find a letter from Philip Morris, which is beginning a campaign to say no to the proposed tobacco tax increase. Senators may know that there has been a Preventative Health Taskforce recommendation that the price of cigarettes should go up. They have in fact decided that the best policy measure available to government at the federal level to reduce the unnecessary death and disease caused by smoking is a substantial increase in tobacco tax. Evidence collected by the government’s Preventative Health Taskforce shows that a 21 per cent increase in the price of tobacco products would prevent 35,500 Australian children from becoming smokers by making cigarettes unaffordable. I think that is in an excellent objective. Presently, about 140,000 Australian schoolchildren smoke. Based on the latest available data from 2005, and if we put it in the context of Victoria, which is the state I represent, 31,138 Victorian children started experimenting with tobacco and a further 7,033 went on to become regular smokers. Of those who become regular smokers, many will become lifetime smokers and about half of them will die prematurely from cigarette smoking.
When I got this campaign letter and read through it and read some of the material they attached to their campaign letter, Philip Morris would have us believe that they have concerns about the tax revenue base of reduced smoking. They said that if we put the price of cigarette packets up there will be a greater use of illegal cigarettes which avoid the excise and, therefore, the government will reduce its revenue. They also say that it will encourage criminal elements to provide illegal tobacco to people instead of excise tobacco.
One of the things Philip Morris forget to mention is that if we reduce the sale of cigarettes they will lose their income. Strangely enough, through the whole campaign, they do not suggest once what I suspect is their real concern—that an increase in the price of cigarette packets will drive down smoking or encourage people to give up smoking and, in particular, the price point will be reached where it is unviable for schoolchildren to start smoking and therefore reduce their profits. I suspect what Philip Morris is really on about is concern for their bottom line. That distresses me somewhat. This company produces tobacco and spends a lot of its marketing dollars pedalling this very unhealthy and addictive drug, to which there is no safe level of exposure, not deliberately to schoolchildren in the strict sense of the word but by making sure that it is available. The Preventative Health Taskforce suggests that what we really want to do is stop children taking up smoking in the first place.
In 2005, an estimated 140,000 boys and girls aged between 12 and 17 years smoked over 3,450,000 cigarettes between them in the week before the survey was conducted. That is a lot of cigarettes. I am not surprised that Philip Morris would engage in a campaign to stop the increase in excised tobacco recommended by the Preventative Health Taskforce because, if we stopped those children smoking nearly 3½ million cigarettes in a week, that would seriously affect their bottom line.
Smoking and the consequences of smoking place a huge burden on our economy, the health system and the public purse generally. The study of the burden from smoking related illnesses relates to the financial year of 2004-05, which is unfortunately the latest information available, and in that financial year the total social cost of tobacco use in Australia was estimated to be $31½ billion. This accounted for 56.2 per cent of the total social cost of all drugs, including alcohol and illicit drugs.
That figure includes some costs of involuntary smoking, passive smoking in the home and exposure of unborn children to the effects of their mothers’ smoking, and these costs are mostly imposed upon the young. Children under 15 years account for 25 per cent of deaths and 96 per cent of hospital bed days and 91 per cent of hospital costs attributable to involuntary smoking. Smoking costs the economy in lost productivity an estimated $5.7 billion in the workplace through workforce absenteeism and $9.8 billion in lost household labour through sickness and premature death. The estimated number of smoking-related deaths per annum is 15½ thousand deaths from smoking, and again the last figures were from 2003.
I just wanted to get some of those facts on the record because I do find it somewhat offensive that Philip Morris has mounted a public campaign with some nice printed leaflets saying no to any proposed increase in the excise and trying to explain to us that it is in our interest to keep the price of cigarettes low because we will get some extra excise, when that is nothing. It pales into insignificance against the cost that smoking inflicts upon our community. Even if we can stop one child taking up a lifetime of smoking, that would be a benefit. If we can seriously eat into children taking up smoking in the first instance, stop them becoming lifelong smokers, we will save half of those lives and, again, those figures are incredibly substantial.
Let me remind the chamber again: 140,000 Australian schoolchildren are estimated to smoke, and we, as legislators, should be doing all we can to reduce and discourage that. And for Philip Morris to run a campaign suggesting that it is in our best national interest to keep the price of cigarettes low just so we can protect some tax base, which pales into insignificance against the cost and the human tragedy of lifelong smoking, I think is very disingenuous. They ought to just ’fess up and admit to what they are—that is, people who peddle a drug to which there is no safe level of exposure—and they ought to acknowledge that is the business they are in. They ought to acknowledge there is no safe level of smoking, and they ought to assist the government and communities in ultimately wiping out their industry. There is no benefit to this economy, there is no individual benefit, and there is no safe level of smoking. It is something that, as a reformed smoker, I feel very strongly about.
I am concerned. I know how difficult it is to kick the habit and give up. I would be devastated if my children took up smoking given what we now know about the harmful effects of it. That is what Philip Morris ought to be spending their money on. They ought to be spending money on educating our children and adults; they ought to be spending their profits on ensuring people do not take up this terrible, addictive habit to which there is no safe level of exposure. There is no safe level for cigarette smoking. I was somewhat pleased that they started this campaign and drew it to my attention. I think it is disingenuous. They ought to be condemned for running this campaign.

I am not surprised that Philip Morris would engage in a campaign to stop the increase in excised tobacco recommended by the Preventative Health Taskforce because, if we stopped those children smoking nearly 3½ million cigarettes in a week, that would seriously affect their bottom line.
Smoking and the consequences of smoking place a huge burden on our economy, the health system and the public purse generally. The study of the burden from smoking related illnesses relates to the financial year of 2004-05, which is unfortunately the latest information available, and in that financial year the total social cost of tobacco use in Australia was estimated to be $31½ billion. This accounted for 56.2 per cent of the total social cost of all drugs, including alcohol and illicit drugs.
That figure includes some costs of involuntary smoking, passive smoking in the home and exposure of unborn children to the effects of their mothers’ smoking, and these costs are mostly imposed upon the young. Children under 15 years account for 25 per cent of deaths and 96 per cent of hospital bed days and 91 per cent of hospital costs attributable to involuntary smoking. Smoking costs the economy in lost productivity an estimated $5.7 billion in the workplace through workforce absenteeism and $9.8 billion in lost household labour through sickness and premature death. The estimated number of smoking-related deaths per annum is 15½ thousand deaths from smoking, and again the last figures were from 2003.
I just wanted to get some of those facts on the record because I do find it somewhat offensive that Philip Morris has mounted a public campaign with some nice printed leaflets saying no to any proposed increase in the excise and trying to explain to us that it is in our interest to keep the price of cigarettes low because we will get some extra excise, when that is nothing. It pales into insignificance against the cost that smoking inflicts upon our community. Even if we can stop one child taking up a lifetime of smoking, that would be a benefit. If we can seriously eat into children taking up smoking in the first instance, stop them becoming lifelong smokers, we will save half of those lives and, again, those figures are incredibly substantial.
Let me remind the chamber again: 140,000 Australian schoolchildren are estimated to smoke, and we, as legislators, should be doing all we can to reduce and discourage that. And for Philip Morris to run a campaign suggesting that it is in our best national interest to keep the price of cigarettes low just so we can protect some tax base, which pales into insignificance against the cost and the human tragedy of lifelong smoking, I think is very disingenuous. They ought to just ’fess up and admit to what they are—that is, people who peddle a drug to which there is no safe level of exposure—and they ought to acknowledge that is the business they are in. They ought to acknowledge there is no safe level of smoking, and they ought to assist the government and communities in ultimately wiping out their industry. There is no benefit to this economy, there is no individual benefit, and there is no safe level of smoking. It is something that, as a reformed smoker, I feel very strongly about.
I am concerned. I know how difficult it is to kick the habit and give up. I would be devastated if my children took up smoking given what we now know about the harmful effects of it. That is what Philip Morris ought to be spending their money on. They ought to be spending money on educating our children and adults; they ought to be spending their profits on ensuring people do not take up this terrible, addictive habit to which there is no safe level of exposure. There is no safe level for cigarette smoking. I was somewhat pleased that they started this campaign and drew it to my attention. I think it is disingenuous. They ought to be condemned for running this campaign. They ought to be assisting the community to kick the habit.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,57,2

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2010-03-18,"—I would like to take this opportunity to express my admiration for the work that is being done in one of Sydney’s best kept secrets, the Westmead Millennium Institute. Like many residents of Sydney I have often been to Westmead Hospital to visit friends receiving treatment from the dedicated staff of the hospital. On my visits to the hospital I have always been focused on the car park to the right of the main entrance and I have never noticed that to the left of the main entrance is the headquarters of the millennium institute. I do not think many people would give it a second glance, and yet within that building hugely talented and committed researchers and staff are working to improve the health of not only Western Sydney but also the nation.
In many areas of medical research, the institute is a world leader. The breadth and depth of medical research being conducted by the institute is amazing. We hear much about the need to improve the productivity of the nation. One of the key drivers of productivity is to ensure that we build the skills of the nation and, if we build the skills of the nation, then we need to make sure that the population is healthy, fit and well to carry out their work. Without the type of research work being done at the millennium institute many Australians who are making significant contributions to the productive performance of this nation would be unable to participate in the workforce due to ill-health.
The Westmead Millennium Institute is firmly ranked in Australia’s top 10 medical research institutes. It is performing world leading research by world leading researchers. The director of the institute, Professor Tony Cunningham, received an Order of Australia in this year’s Australia Day honours. He received his honour for his contribution to medical research in Australia and his groundbreaking work on viruses. I would like to congratulate Professor Cunningham on his award and I know that he believes the award is not simply recognition for himself but recognition of his highly-skilled team at the institute.
Professor Cunningham is rightly proud of the Millennium Institute and of his colleagues. Much of the work of the institute is directly linked to the critical health areas of diabetes, cancer, leukaemia and mental health. It was a privilege for me to meet Professor Cunningham and his researchers. My tour of the institute’s facilities began with an introduction to the researchers who lead the world in melanoma research and who discovered the first melanoma gene. Their work now includes genetic counselling for families who may have a predisposition to carry the gene that puts them at higher risk of melanoma. The researchers, Graham Mann and Helen Rizos, talked to me about their goals and ambitions, including their pursuit of a cure for melanoma.
The Millennium Institute has also led the world in its search for a cure for diabetes. The institute is home to a number of national centres, including the national pancreas transplant centre. Pancreatic islet cell transplantation is the only known cure for type 1 diabetes. Institute researchers have been focused on developing and improving islet cell transplantation techniques to enable type 1 diabetes patients to produce insulin for themselves.
Their research into different viruses, like SARS and other flues, chickenpox virus, shingles and HIV, has led to the development of vaccines, diagnostics and new approaches to therapies. The institute has until recently been home to five National Health and Medical Research Council centres for clinical research excellence. Work was undertaken in conditions like anxiety, renal medicine and chronic liver disease. The institute has invested heavily in technology needed to keep it at the top.
I spoke to a young doctor, Eddie Kinzana, a cardiologist who had just come from seeing his patients. He explained the high-tech equipment he was using and the molecular and gene therapy research work he is doing to find a solution to cardiac conditions that can result in sudden death. I was able to see a cell known as a dendritic cell, which was infected with the virus. The technology allows you to track this cell as it moves around searching for a cell to attack.
The Millennium Institute is also working in the area of mental health. Their brain researchers are currently working on several vital projects including depression and ADHD. That is the first time that Senator Bernardi has not interjected on me when people were talking about brains! They are the managers on a groundbreaking trial called ‘I spot’. The aim is to identify brain markers for depression so that treatment can be tailored to individual patients.
What is impressive and perhaps unique about the institute is that all of its scientific leaders conduct clinical research. Their research has always been entrenched in the motto ‘Bench to bedside’. This approach has allowed greater translation of research findings and discovery into the development of new prevention strategies, diagnostics and treatments that are more effective.
Part of my tour included a short time in the Cancer Day Care Centre, which is located in the body of Westmead Hospital. A clinical trials research unit is based in the centre. I met a pathologist, Ms Rosemary Balleine, who is a specialist in translational oncology. She is one of the leaders in this field in Australia. She works in a small, windowless room where she can see the patients receiving their chemotherapy. She said she wanted to be kept grounded and in touch with what she was actually trying to achieve—that is, finding a cure for breast and ovarian cancer.
The researchers are immensely talented and committed people. They are making contributions to the future health of this nation. They are also an integral part of Western Sydney and make a huge contribution to the economic development and health of Western Sydney. The institute is also part of the Westmead Research Hub. This is a hub which consists of 850 researchers coming from the Westmead adult and children’s hospitals, with others coming from the Nepean and Blacktown hospitals. Many of the researchers at the Millennium Institute are also professors and senior lecturers who are linked to the Westmead Clinical School of the University of Sydney. They also provide educational expertise to medical, dental science, nursing and postgraduate students. When we put these two elements together, we have a huge resource for teaching and research for Western Sydney.
The scale of the work and the growth and success of the institute has meant that they have quite literally run out of space for research and teaching. There is a need to build a new facility that will bring together 450 scientists and allow greater collaboration and sharing of expensive equipment among its researchers and nearby hub partners. The lack of space is an issue that I will raise with Minister Roxon and my fellow Western Sydney parliamentarians. The researchers deserve appropriate facilities and, given the government’s commitment to health, we should ensure that the research facilities that drive the effectiveness of health delivery throughout the nation can operate efficiently and effectively.
While I was in the Cancer Day Care Centre one of the patients recognized me and gave me a wave. I went over to see him and asked him how he was going. He indicated to me that his prognosis was not good as he had lung cancer but that he was in the best possible place. He said he was receiving great care and everything possible was being done to assist him. He said there was no cure for him but he was sure that one day the researchers of the Millennium Institute would find a cure for others. This demonstrates the importance of the work of the Westmead Millennium Institute and the comfort, care and hope that it brings to individuals and families facing life-threatening disease.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Westmead Millennium Institute</title>,Adjournment,58,1
