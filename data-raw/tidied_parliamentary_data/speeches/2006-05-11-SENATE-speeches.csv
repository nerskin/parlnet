Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill:

Transparent Advertising and Notification of Pregnancy Counselling Services Bill 2005

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:

Most pregnancy counselling services are not subject to the Trade Practices Act because they do not charge for the information they provide. This means they are not prohibited from engaging in misleading or deceptive advertising.
The Transparent Advertising and Notification of Pregnancy Counselling Services Bill 2005 would make pregnancy counselling organisations subject to similar misleading and deceptive advertising laws as those organisations engaged in trade or commerce.
We would like a committee to examine the adequacy of the legislation in improving regulation of pregnancy counselling, and ensure the counselling provided by Government-funded pregnancy counselling services is objective, non-directive, and includes information on all three pregnancy options.

Possible submissions or evidence from:

Reproductive Choice Australia; Sexual Health & Family Planning Australia; the Public Health Association of Australia; Children By Choice Association Inc; the Australian Women’s Health Network; Australian Reproductive Health Alliance; the Women’s Electoral Lobby; the Royal Women’s Hospital, Melbourne; EPA Health; the Fertility Control Clinic in East Melbourne; the Bessie Smyth Foundation; the Pregnancy Advisory Centre, Central Northern Adelaide Health Service; the Department of Health and Ageing.

Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration

Division 3 of the Bill should be considered by the Economics References Committee to determine wether the proposed arrangements for the payment of fuel tax and receipt of associated credits could potentially create excessive compliance and cash flow problems for small to medium sized businesses.
The proposed measures require that the fuel tax be paid up-front and the credit received after the BAS is lodged. This can involved considerable delays.
The Committee should also consider the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill to review the abolition of the Fuels Sales Grants Scheme. This scheme compensated motorists in rural and regional Australia for the impact of the GST. Any move to abolish this scheme may have significant effects on regional Australia. The Committee should inquire whether it is an appropriate time to abolish this scheme and whether the scheme operates effectively to support motorists in regional Australia.

Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Purpose of the bill

The bill provides for 2006 one-off payments to older Australians and carers. Recipients of certain carer income support on Budget night 2006 will be paid a $1,000 one-off payment. Recipients of carer allowance on that date will receive a $600 one-off payment for each of their eligible care receivers. Furthermore, a payment of $102.80 will be paid to people who are, on that night, of age pension age or veterans’ pension age and receiving certain types of income support, and self-funded retirees qualified for the seniors concession allowance.

Reasons for Urgency

The one-off payments are generally to be paid in June 2006.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-05-11,"—I move:
That this bill be now read a second time.
I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The measures in this bill are a further demonstration of the Government’s appreciation and acknowledgement of the contribution older Australians and carers have made, and continue to make, to our society.
As with past bonus payments, these new payments will be paid in the majority of cases before the end of the financial year and are possible because of the Government’s careful economic management, which has delivered this capacity to give extra support to these members of the Australian community.
The first bonus payment provided by this bill will go to older Australians. The 2006 one-off payment will be equal to the annual rate of utilities allowance, which is an existing entitlement to help older income support customers to pay regular household bills such as gas and electricity, and currently set at $102.80. This one-off payment will be made to people of age pension age, or veterans’ qualifying age, who are receiving on 9 May 2006 a social security or veterans’ entitlements income support payment. Recipients at that date of mature age allowance, partner allowance or widow allowance will also attract the one-off payment.
The one-off payment of $102.80 will be shared between two members of a couple living together, if they are both qualified for it. Otherwise, the whole payment will go to every qualified person in his or her own right. No household with at least one qualified person will get less than $102.80.
Older Australians not actually receiving the stipulated payment on Budget night will still get the bonus if they had claimed it by that date and subsequently have their payment backdated to cover that date.
Self-funded retirees will not miss out on the bonus payment—they will receive $102.80 per person if they are, on that same date, qualified or eligible for seniors concession allowance.
Carers are the second group targeted by this bill for bonus payments.
Carers receiving carer income support on 9 May 2006 in the form of a social security carer payment or carer service pension under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act will be paid a $1,000 one-off payment. Carers who receive the non-means tested social security income supplement known as carer allowance in addition to either wife pension or a partner service pension under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act will also be paid a $1,000 one-off payment. Any carer receiving carer allowance will be paid a separate $600 one-off payment for each eligible care receiver. Carers who have claimed the targeted payments on or shortly before 9 May 2006 and are subsequently granted with effect from 9 May 2006 or earlier will receive the payments.
Carers whose children qualify for a carer allowance health care card only will not be eligible for bonus payments of $600. Carers who claim carer allowance after 9 May 2006 and whose payment is backdated due to the application of the carer allowance backdating provisions will not be eligible for the bonus payment, even though the backdated period will have included payment for 9 May 2006.
Neither of the special one-off payments provided by this bill will be subject to income tax, nor will either count as income for social security, veterans’ entitlements or family assistance purposes.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-05-11,"—It is clear that the Labor Party does not agree with this motion. This motion seeks to remove the spillover days from budget estimates. That might be regarded as a technical term, but let me reduce it to what it in fact is. It is a diminution of the ability of this Senate to scrutinise budget estimates and this government during that time. This motion takes away the opportunity to have spillover days—that is, two Fridays in the fortnight—which we use to question this government and to keep this government accountable to its commitment to the budget and other matters more generally. This says to the opposition, to minor parties and to the Senate more generally, ‘We’re going to remove the ability for you to continue to use Fridays to scrutinise and keep this government to its promises and to keep it accountable for its actions.’
The argument that is going to be run by the government is that the spillover day is not used very much—but that is precisely the reason that the spillover day is necessary. Committees that have met through the week—say, on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday—and have not completed their task in that time can utilise the spillover day, the Friday, as a safety valve to keep this government accountable. In other words, these committees can use those spillover days to scrutinise the machinery of government. That ensures that the four days can be used effectively and, where necessary, the fifth day can be used by those committees. It allows the committees to use Friday not as an ordinary day as part of the budget estimates week but as a spillover. In other words, the Friday can be used as additional day if the work of the committee has not been completed and so any additional matters can be dealt with.
What is more astonishing is that this government is sending the message that it does not even trust its own committees. The committees are chaired by government senators and are in majority control by coalition senators. Therefore, this motion is a double whammy. It not only says, ‘We’re going to take away your ability to use the Friday as a spillover, as a safety valve, to allow scrutiny,’ but also says, ‘We don’t trust our own committee chairs, dominated by coalition senators, to be able to control the committee or to use the spillover, or the extra day, wisely.’ This motion is corralling its own coalition senators and saying, ‘We don’t think you are capable of making that decision so, rather, we will make that decision for you, as a government that dominates and uses its Senate numbers to whack the Senate.’ This motion says that we cannot have what we have had for many years now—that is, the safety valve of the spillover day.
If you go back through the records to 1995-96, the statistics show that the Fridays have not been abused. So the argument cannot be run by this government that there has been abuse of the Friday or that the Senate committees have run wild and need to be corralled or its own coalition senators need to be reined in. If you look at the statistics, you see that Fridays have been used for what they were intended to be used for—that is, as a safety valve to deal with matters that were not finalised during the week. They have not been used as a 9 am to 11 pm slot. They have generally been used for matters that were not completed in the estimates week. When you go through the list you see that the Fridays have been used by various committees through the years. For example, in 2001-02 the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee dealing with the maritime incident—more generally known as ‘kids overboard’—used the Friday because the committee’s work was not completed and they required the additional day, the Friday, to finalise their scrutiny of the budget week and to finalise the estimates process that was required.
The foreign affairs, defence and trade committee’s hearings spilled over on the Friday in 2004-05 to look at Abu Ghraib. It is another good example of where the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee required additional time to look at a particular issue. They used the Friday to allow the scrutiny of the committee to continue and for their work to be finalised. Put simply, a committee will sit during the week. It might deal with a very difficult issues such as Abu Ghraib through the week and not complete its scrutiny. Therefore the Friday is used to finalise its work—and not fully. Generally speaking, it is completed on the Friday when those matters have been dealt with and the committee is finalised. SIEVX, in 2001-2002, as I indicated earlier, occurred in the same fashion.
Again, if you look at the Rau matter—the immigration debacle—this government did not want to allow a spill-over day. The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in 2005-06 spilled over onto the Friday with the Cornelia Rau matter. Why? Because on the Cornelia Rau issue it took up a significant amount of time to get to the bottom of what had happened. As we know, the government had a lot to answer for. The Friday was again used to allow the ordinary work of the committee to be finalised, as well as to allow any return to that substantive issue. If that was not enough, the following year legal and constitutional had the Solon and Alvarez issue and the Friday was again used.
We have a government that says: ‘In terms of spill-overs, the committee will have time through the week to deal with issues as they may arise. But if it wants ordinary scrutiny, if it wants to continue looking at those matters which are important and need scrutiny’—and clearly they need scrutiny—‘then we won’t allow the spill-over day to be used at all because we’re going to remove it. We’re not going to have the additional day at all.’
The government’s clear message to not only this chamber but the Australian people is: ‘We want to continue to have a situation where we can control the Senate to such an extent that we can close down scrutiny, not allow scrutiny, because we’re going to remove the ability for that committee to do its ordinary work, to complete it and to use the spill-over days as needed.’ As needed—that is the point that the government seem to have missed in this whole debate. As I have said, the chair of the committee might decide that the work has not been finalised and to use the spill-over day.
We will have an additional problem that this government has avoided: the spill-over day has been an important mechanism not only to ensure that those issues are scrutinised but also to ensure that the debate about additional time for committees does not come back in here as a notice of motion to allow the committee to sit on a Thursday night, a Wednesday night or another night when parliament is sitting or another day through the year. That is what will happen. Where spill-over days are removed from this process, committees will then seek additional days and argue for that time, if it is not a matter that is arrived at or agreed to by the committee—and much of it is, quite frankly. So it is not only going to be confined to the committee arguing about it. If the committee says, ‘No, you have had your time,’ then there will be notices of motion moved in the Senate seeking additional time for committees to debate the issue that is at large because the spill-over day was not available to be used.
Another problem will be created by the government’s arrogance because the committees that have been unable to use the spill-over day to finalise a matter, to look into a matter, to complete a matter or to ensure that there has been proper scrutiny of a coalition or a government bungle will come in here and move a notice of motion. We will argue why a committee should not have additional time to deal with it. The government will be faced with the problem of arguing against it. Given that it has already said no to a spill-over day, it will be in a worse position trying to convince the Australian population, let alone the Senate, why it should not accede to further scrutiny of this issue because it has taken away the ability of a committee to look at matters.
The government is becoming so arrogant that it has ignored the real debate that will occur down the track. It will have to shut that debate down. It will have to say, ‘No, we don’t want you to look into that particular issue,’ and it will have to justify why it will not want the committee to look into a particular issue at another time, whereas the short answer is: the spill-over day could have been used for that. Again, all this government has done is highlight its arrogance by trying to shut down scrutiny and reduce the effectiveness of the committee process to do its ordinary work of scrutinising the government.
You will have committees unable to discharge their functions. You will have arguments about unreasonable or insufficient time being given for important issues. You will have committees asking for extensions of time. The committee chairs, I suspect, will be coming back to the government and saying: ‘We didn’t get the work completed. We want additional time. You’ll have to find time for that as well.’ You will have senators on those committees coming into this chamber and moving motions asking for additional time. Rather than sensibly allowing a process of spill-over days, the government has opened Pandora’s box, effectively, and will not be able to argue that there is the safety valve of a spill-over day to be used. It beggars belief that the government has fallen for this, but perhaps it thought that it could arrogantly deal with this by simply removing the spill-over day and saying, ‘We’re going to close down scrutiny.’ It really does beggar belief.
The wider issue, of course, is that that is what the government is in fact doing. This is another nail in the coffin for the ability of the Senate to scrutinise the government’s work. When former Senator Hill was the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, he recognised that the Senate plays a very important role in scrutinising the government. I looked for a statement from Senator Minchin, but perhaps he has not been the leader long enough to be able to echo those phrases here. It is completely unseemly that this government will not allow itself to be scrutinised by the Senate. It seems to be another nail in the coffin, as I have said, with this government wanting to abuse the Senate process and gain absolute power.
Let us examine the range of things that the government has already done. It has knocked back the ability to have a censure motion. It has curtailed question time. The Telstra bill, the Work Choices bill, the Welfare to Work bill and the voluntary student union bill are just some of the bills that the government exempted from the cut-off, meaning they were subject to less scrutiny. The government gagged the Telstra debate and guillotined it. That was the Howard government imposing the guillotine on a debate concerning about $30 billion of taxpayer assets in five bills. The gag was used three times in that debate. In the Telstra inquiry, the government allowed only one day of hearings. Because of the arrogance of this government, it sought to ensure that the speakers list for debate on the Telstra bill would be curtailed. It also denied committee references to allow scrutiny into more general areas. Back on 11 October, the debate on the variation of routine of business and sitting hours was gagged twice by Minister Ellison.
This issue of no spill-over days came up this year, and the government has moved the motion today. The government gagged the Work Choices inquiry. In that debate, if senators proposed amendments to the reference of the Work Choices inquiry, they were stopped. When you start to add up the abuses in this place, you see that the government has managed to accumulate many abuses in a very short space of time. This is simply one more we will catalogue of where the government has said: ‘This government does not want to be scrutinised. This government does not want or allow scrutiny into its affairs.’ The antiterrorism bill and the welfare bill were guillotined and the debate was gagged on 5 December last year. Senator Abetz’s attack on the Clerk was one step too far. Similarly, Senator McGauran’s finger was one step too far.
If this government thinks we are going to let those abuses slide, it should think very carefully about the abuses I have listed. I will be raising them, as I have said in the past, every time I come here to ensure that this government recognises its abuses in this place and what it has been doing to take away the ability of the opposition and the minor parties to scrutinise this legislation, these bills and, of course, the budget and our ability to keep this government accountable. This government has also ensured that there will be less time available to debate bills.
These outrages of this government continue, and not having the spill-over days is just one more example of the removal of the ability to scrutinise. This government should take this as a wake-up call and allow the spill-over days for the purpose for which they were intended—that is, as a safety valve for committees to do their work.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title>,Budget,16,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-05-11,"—The Democrats share the concern about the unprecedented attempt, through this motion, to further restrict the ability of Senate committees, and in this case Senate estimates committees, to do what is widely recognised as one of their most fundamental jobs—to scrutinise the actions of the government of the day and of government departments. It is another example of the quite calculated endeavour by this government to slowly strangle any semblance of accountability and genuine meaning behind the word ‘democracy’. It gives the lie once again of the Prime Minister’s pledge and promise that he would not misuse the Senate majority that the electorate gave him so narrowly at the last election.
Let us not forget that it is less than one year since this government has had control of the Senate. Senator Ludwig outlined quite a long litany—not a full litany, I might say—of examples where this government has clearly prevented scrutiny and acted quite arrogantly and dismissively in the most blase and contemptible manner imaginable in order to just do what it wants, to ignore any alternative view and to blithely sweep aside many attempts to scrutinise or even question the actions of the government, statements of the government, legislation from the government or activities of government departments.
We have seen a few examples of the sort of absolute mess, mayhem and chaos that can occur when a lack of accountability and a culture of contempt and arrogance for due process develop. We have seen it with the immigration department over a number of years, where things got so bad that eventually the government had to acknowledge that there was a massive culture problem within that department, whilst somehow or other managing to suggest that none of that culture problem was the responsibility of the government itself, that somehow or other it all developed completely independently of ministers, government policy or legislation.
Apart from the cost of that being an enormous injustice for a significant number of people—the personal cost and the individual cost—there is also the financial cost. For those who follow an approach that sadly seems to be a little more commonplace these days, which is, ‘What’s in it for me?’ or ‘What does it cost me? If it doesn’t affect me, well, that’s nothing to do with me,’ and if they want to make it all about them and all about money, the fact is that poor management costs enormous amounts of money. Bad administrative practice costs enormous amounts of money. We have seen that with the immigration department—not just with the flagrant waste on unnecessary aspects of the policy but also with the hundreds of millions of dollars that now have to be pumped into that department to try and fix up the intrinsic problems that the government now acknowledges exist.
Unfortunately, as has been quite clear in recent times, that problem does not exist in isolation in the immigration department. We have seen it fundamentally in departments like foreign affairs and we are seeing it writ large with the AWB scandal. The big problem with the AWB scandal, leaving aside the specifics of the outrageous breaches that have been involved, is what it represents about the culture across a wide range of departments. That really is the problem. It is not an isolated example. The specifics would be isolated, but the general commonplace culture and attitude that led to that are widespread; indeed, one would suggest endemic. We have seen people such as former secretaries of the Department of Defence write openly about the appalling administrative practices and the deliberately shoddy and misleading approach from government ministers that have been common practice for many years.
Somehow or other that does not seem to ring sufficient alarm bells with some that report about things in this place. Some who report on this place seem happy to say, ‘That doesn’t bother the average punter in the street.’ I do not know if it does or not, but it certainly should bother us because that is our job. The people put the Senate here in particular to examine what the government does. To simply take away two days out of the 10 that are normally available for the major scrutiny period of the budget, the budget measures and the budget estimates is clearly a flagrant and deliberate attempt to cut off scrutiny. It is also a reflection on the ability of the chairs of those committees, who are all government senators, to adequately manage the business before their committees and the process of questioning at the estimates committees.
As Senator Ludwig has pointed out, this is not a process that has been abused. Having spill-over days on Fridays has not been abused and taken up on every single possible occasion up to the last possible minute. It has clearly only been used where there has been a genuine necessity by specific committees. The suggestion that it is not necessary is clearly false because it has always been used. The suggestion that it has been abused or misused is also clearly false because the record shows that that is not the case.
The other aspect that has to be put alongside this is the growing practice on the part of the government to simply refuse to answer questions put at Senate estimates and in other areas. At the last estimate committee hearings we had the unprecedented and laughable excuse that questions regarding the AWB matter could not be answered in any way, shape or form—any type of question to any government body—because there was a royal commission under way. That was completely unprecedented and completely unjustifiable and untenable; nonetheless, the government insisted on it. These were the first estimates committees after the government had control of the Senate, so it was no surprise that they tried that stunt for the first time in such an extreme way. It is the sort of action that would never have been possible had the government not had that rigid control of the Senate. The Senate has had other mechanisms to require questions to be answered and to require information to be produced, but now we do not have those because of the government majority.
We have seen other smaller examples perhaps where particular officers have simply refused to answer a question and, despite Senate standing orders, refused to give any indication why they would not answer a question. We have seen refusal to provide documents to some Senate estimates committees where they have been requested or where questions have been on notice in regard to them. You have to wonder what areas will be quarantined from exploration at these upcoming estimates. I would be willing to bet a lot that there might be some sudden excuse given as to why there has to be a blanket ban on any questions regarding Private Kovco and what happened in that regard. I am sure that they will use some excuse that there is a coronial inquiry or some other inquiry under way and they cannot possibly answer anything about that because that would prejudice the inquiry. I have no doubt that we will have those sorts of things put forward. Basically, the fact that there is any inquiry under way anywhere will now be used as an excuse by this government to prevent any sort of accountability or scrutiny of the actions of ministers or their officials.
We are getting a larger and larger pile of these sorts of examples and the consequences are very serious. People should not wait until it is about an issue that specifically affects them personally. The deliberate, systematic dismantling of the fabric of democracy going on under this government, piece by piece, is a matter that concerns everybody personally. That is what is happening here. This is only one small part of that, but it is nonetheless a clear-cut part of it. We in this place all know the clear-cut change that has happened since the government has had that power to ignore all opposition.
Another impact of this is that, while it will curtail questions from Labor Party senators, Democrats senators and others, it also will give the government much more ability to curtail awkward questioning from their own side. There is the occasional time when government senators pursue lines of questioning that ministers in the government wish they would not. The removal of the safety valve of the spill-over days on Fridays will make it much easier for the government to say that there is not time to pursue a particular matter. They will be able to put that pressure on to silence awkward questioning in that area. So there is a wider impact than just the attempt to prevent scrutiny from opposition parties. It also is yet another mechanism for the control—a control that is already well past the strength of a straitjacket—of any government senators that are potentially going to do something that might displease or cause discomfort to the government.
We have also seen—and Senator Ludwig might have referred to this—a huge number of rejections of proposals for Senate references committee inquiries by this government. I am not suggesting every single one put forward had merit—I think I might have voted against one or two of them myself—but the simple fact is that, going by any statistical reading over recent years, there has been a massive leap in rejections of proposed references of matters to be examined by Senate committees. That is just the ones that have been put before the chamber. I can speak from personal experience that we have not bothered to move others because we know they would not be supported. So, in effect, the number of proposed inquiries that have been rejected is actually much higher. Undoubtedly, a number of them that would have got up in the past have been in areas which would have caused embarrassment for the government but nonetheless would have enabled needed information to get out in the public arena.
So we have less opportunity to pursue matters through the normal process of Senate references committees because they are being continually restricted and slowly reduced to the ridiculous situation where we have at least two, if not three, references committees at the moment which have no business before them at all and have had no business before them for some period of time, certainly for this year. That reflects particularly badly on the Senate as a whole. It might not be the fault of us on this side of the Senate that that situation has occurred, but the reality is that it does reflect badly on the whole institution of the Senate.
That probably does not concern the government. Generally I do not think that making the parliament come into disrepute bothers the government at all, because they do not see the parliament as having any value at all. Clearly, the way the government operates is to completely dismiss the parliament as having any significant relevance other than as some sort of ceremonial stage or as an opportunity for posturing now and then. But, in terms of the parliament’s proper constitutional role—its key role as the balance in the separation of powers—it is quite clear from the government’s actions that they just do not see the parliament as having a value.
Indeed, I have heard the Prime Minister talk a number of times about the great institutions that make up our democracy but he has not mentioned the parliament. He talks about the executive, or the government, the courts and the media, as though the media has the other role of scrutiny rather than the parliament. I have heard the media talk that way themselves, and perhaps there is some reality to it, but as far as I know they are not written into the Constitution as being one of the key arms of our system of governance, beyond the implied right to freedom of speech, which of course I strongly support.
So it is a serious problem. It is much wider than just the inability to hold a hearing on a few days. When you combine it with the reduction in the ability of Senate committees to examine specific areas through precise references, it means that, in more and more areas, the only place to pursue those matters is in Senate estimates, because other avenues are being blocked. On top of that, of course, we have had a record low number of sitting days in the Senate this year and last year. We have the absurd situation that today is just the 14th day the Senate has sat this year, even though we are into May. We have sat just 14 days this year and, after today, we will not sit again until the middle of June. By the time we get to the second week of August, we will have had 22 sitting days for the first seven months and one week of the year.
That is a disgrace. That again reflects badly on the Senate and the parliament and is another indication of a reduction in the number of opportunities that senators have to pursue particular issues. It means that, more and more, we are channelled into only being able to use estimates—and then what do we find? The number of days made available for estimates is being reduced. On top of that, the number of instances where specific areas and lines of questioning are being refused is also increasing. It is a very insidious pattern, but it is a very consistent and very dangerous pattern. I suggest that the public needs to wake up to it before it is too late.
People often talk about the price of liberty being eternal vigilance and about the fragility of democracy and the fact that, if you do not continue to fight to protect its institutions, then before you know it it can be gone and it is pretty hard work to get it back again. That might sound overly dramatic, but I do not believe it is, when you put together all the different things that are happening in this country. This is only one small part of it, but it is a part of it and it is a serious matter. It is a deliberate, calculated attempt to reduce the opportunities for the parliament, and through the parliament the public, to scrutinise the actions of the government and its departments at a time when the general level of competence, honesty and integrity in many of the activities of governments is being questioned to a greater degree than ever before.
It is a very serious matter and it reflects a very serious stage in the history of our democracy. I seriously suggest that, unless we can find a way to put a halt to this continual chipping away at these mechanisms for proper checks and balances and scrutiny of the activities of the government of the day, then we really will be starting to live in a democracy in name only. That is not only a great sadness but a serious danger.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title>,Budget,16,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-05-11,"—I think it is worth while putting this in context and getting a sense of reality about the scrutiny of the government in the Senate. Much has been said about it today. Senators Ludwig and Bartlett have said very strongly that this government is all about taking away that scrutiny, and that is totally incorrect. When you look at the Senate’s sitting days this year and you add to that the number of estimates days, you see that 25 per cent of the Senate’s time is devoted to scrutiny of the government through estimates hearings, where there are questions of the government from 9 in the morning until 11 at night. When you look at the total sittings of this Senate and you include the estimates, because estimates are a form of the Senate’s sitting, you see that 25 per cent of that total time is dedicated to scrutiny of the government and its actions. I think you would be battling to find a similar situation in any other parliament in the free world.
Estimates are a very important part of the political process in this country. They are essential for the scrutiny of the government and for a legitimate opposition to carry out its role. We have three estimates sessions a year. We have estimates after the budget in May, additional estimates in February and supplementary budget estimates in November. So the opposition has three opportunities throughout the year to question the government. Looking at the total number of days that are available, the largest estimates sitting is that which occurs after the budget, and that covers a period of two sitting weeks. We have eight committees and they have four days each. Effectively, there are 32 hearing days to question the government on the budget.
What we have said here is that, instead of having the four spillover days, 32 days is adequate for the scrutiny that should be carried out. The additional days in the past have not been entirely taken up in number and in time. As well as that, we agreed in 2003 to extend the time for estimates in November. I repeat that—we agreed to a request to extend the time of the November supplementary budget estimates. We previously had eight committees sitting for one day with the option of four of them being able to sit for another four days. That gave in total 12 days. We changed that. We now have a situation where eight committees can sit for two days, which equals 16 days. So in those November sittings we now have four extra days in addition to what we previously had.
If I were in opposition, I would certainly aim for a situation whereby I had the ability to question the government over a period of 12 months and to extend the period of time that I could question the government on each occasion, rather than having all that time being concentrated after the budget. We are approaching this in a more even manner by having the February, May and November estimates spread more evenly in time. That does not detract from the ability of the opposition to hold the government accountable. In fact, this is a much more efficient manner of conducting estimates.
The 32 days in total for the opposition to question the government on the budget provide more than adequate opportunity for scrutiny. Taking into account that we have allowed an extra four days in November, the total number of estimates days remains the same as it previously was. When you look at the total sitting time of this Senate combined with estimates, you see that 25 per cent—I repeat, 25 per cent—of its total sitting time is devoted to questioning the government. That does not take into account an hour’s question time each day. That system gives more than adequate opportunity to hold the government of the day accountable. It is a situation which is unequalled in the free world. I would suggest that there is no other country that has that level of scrutiny and accountability in its parliament.
We certainly believe the process is important. We have said that time and time again. When I was in opposition, I saw the importance of estimates hearings. We do not detract in any way from the role of estimates in the processes of the government and the parliament in this country. However, I would say that, strictly speaking, estimates are for questions on expenditure. Over time that has become a rule more honoured in the breach than in the observance. We now have wide-ranging questions on issues of the day which are of an entirely broad nature, the least of which is the relevance to the expenditure in the budget and additional estimates.
To say that we are cutting back or restricting accountability is totally wrong. It is incorrect. I think people should look at those statistics in the context of the whole and see just how much accountability and scrutiny there is in our system, and so there should be. For the opposition and the Democrats to say that this government is raping and pillaging our democracy is entirely over the top and a total distortion. This measure is a continuation of the process we have always had. With it, we will have the same total number of days that we had previously. So I reject the comments of the opposition.
Senator Ludwig talks about a restricted question time. I remind those listening that the previous government had a Prime Minister who did not even roll up for question time. He rolled up when he felt like it. We have a Prime Minister who is there at every question time for the total time. The previous Prime Minister did not attend every question time. He rolled up when he felt like it. That was the height of arrogance and a mark of total disrespect by that person in relation to the parliament. You could not get anything worse than that.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-05-11,"—I will be brief. I just want to make the point that I think this is the first time that the reference for a legislation committee has been confined in this way since this government has taken office. It is often the case that references to legislation committees are confined. They are usually confined by agreement. In this instance the opposition would have preferred a much wider inquiry into the legislation. I am happy to be corrected if I am not right about this but, as I understand it, if the opposition does not agree to this motion—and clearly we do not have the numbers in any event—then this is the only opportunity we are going to get for a legislation committee to examine these bills.
The government has acquiesced to Senator Murray’s amendment. As I understand it, there would not have been a legislation inquiry otherwise. If that is not right then the government can say that they will allow a legislation committee inquiry irrespectively. But the position, as I understand it, is that there would not have been a legislation committee inquiry at all if not for Senator Murray’s amendment which confines it to a certain area. So this government would not have permitted a legislation committee inquiry. Certainly this matter did not go through the Selection of Bills Committee in the ordinary way. It has had to come back into this parliament to be dealt with. I did not want to let the point go that the opposition does not agree that the Selection of Bills Committee should not have the ability to refer legislation for proper inquiry.
When a bill has already been to a legislation committee, it is acceptable if it comes back and is confined. Sometimes it is the case that there has been extensive examination through a reference or some other method. But in this instance there was a white paper, and this is the first time these bills have come into this parliament as legislation. Therefore, the government has only agreed to an inquiry on the basis of the confines put by Senator Murray’s amendment. It has not agreed to allow a wider range of debate on the legislation itself. What that means is that those issues that legislation committees sometimes pick up—poor drafting, inability to cover all the matters, obscure phrases which should have been picked up and the policy not being expressed correctly in the legislation or more broadly across all of the legislation—are now not going to be dealt with. Those issues will be confined by the amendment of Senator Murray.
I know that is not Senator Murray’s fault. I am not seeking to hold him to account for that. Without Senator Murray’s amendment there would not even be a legislation committee looking into those important issues he has mentioned. This government would have struck it out and said, ‘No, there won’t be a legislation committee inquiry,’ and that would have been the first time. I suspect the government is warming up to that. I suspect the government is warming up to saying that we will not have a legislation committee inquiry into a particular bill, but it has not gone that step thus far. I want to put on record that when that happens there will be a much longer debate.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-05-11,"—I rise to speak to the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand) Bill 2005 [2006]. Labor opposes this bill. This bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The committee received a number of submissions. One submission was from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of New Zealand. They had the audacity to tell the committee that mutual recognition would lead to harmonisation of safety standards. The Department of Transport and Regional Services submission totally repudiated the New Zealand regulator’s view.
This bill will undermine Australia’s proud aviation safety records and standards. I wish to refer to the flight attendant passenger ratios. Currently in Australia the ratio is one flight attendant for 36 actual passengers. The New Zealand standard is one flight attendant for 50 seats. For the life of me I do not understand how that could improve or harmonise Australia’s safety standards in aviation. I am totally baffled. I do not know what could have been going through the government senators’ minds when these submissions were being put to the committee. I do not know whether or not they plan on being around long enough to keep flying when this bill comes into force, but we will find out in the next round of preselections.
Having been a TWU organiser and an organiser in the aviation industry with Qantas, Skippers Aviation and the former airline Ansett, I know that you could not get a bunch of better trained people. There is no question of how well trained these flight attendants, pilots and so on are—not only in passenger safety but flight safety. It is a shame that this bill will undermine that.
The New Zealand regulator talks about harmonisation, and I want to home in on the word ‘harmonisation’. This harmonisation will see Australian standards lowered; there is no argument about that. It will, without any doubt, see Australian jobs disappear offshore. This harmonisation prohibits sky marshals on aircraft operating under a New Zealand air operators certificate. We know how the Howard government could not wait to seize every opportunity to espouse their professionalism in Australia’s security. That is a huge undermining of our safety.
I am afraid that some airlines may manipulate the new rules by servicing Australian domestic routes while operating under New Zealand regulations with lower cost burdens. Labor and Australian Democrats senators recommend that the bill be opposed in the absence of a comparative assessment of safety standards, a full regulatory analysis of the two systems, and a detailed analysis of the cost and the benefits of the proposed regime.
When you combine this bill with the Howard government’s Work Choices legislation, we have a recipe to gut the standards of Australia’s aviation industry. Australia’s air safety standards are not a commodity that is for sale—and should not be, under any circumstances. Labor opposes this bill. If any senator in this place has any concern about air safety and about maintaining our standards in this country, they should follow the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats and oppose this bill.",SENATE,<title>CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MUTUAL RECOGNITION WITH NEW ZEALAND) BILL 2005 [2006]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-05-11,"—The Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand) Bill 2005 [2006] amends the Civil Aviation Act 1988 in order to implement the mutual recognition of aviation related certification between Australia and New Zealand. This bill takes into account the 2004 recommendations of the majority report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.
Mutual recognition is restricted to air operators certificates issued by the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand. Through regulation, mutual recognition will be limited to aircraft of more than 30 seats or a maximum take-off weight of greater than 15,000 kilograms. Air operators certificates issued under the mutual recognition scheme will be known as AOCs with ANZA—Australian and New Zealand Aviation—privileges.
The mutual recognition initiative is a major step forward in the trans-Tasman aviation market. It marks a historic development in the aviation relationship and is consistent with commitments between the Australian and New Zealand governments. Mutual recognition will provide administrative savings to airlines, and these savings may be passed on to passengers. Most importantly, there will be no effect on the safety of aircraft operations in either Australia or New Zealand by its introduction.
Question agreed to.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-05-11,"—The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill 2005 [2006] relates to heritage protection. It seeks to amend the existing act to provide greater certainty to international cultural loan arrangements by ensuring that declarations made under the act cannot act to prevent the return of objects imported temporarily to Australia with a certificate of exemption under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986.
The second element goes to the issue of repeal of part IIA and other provisions in the act that apply only to places in Victoria to enable the Victorian government to administer Aboriginal heritage protection in Victoria directly through its own legislation. The third element brings the act into line with the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 by making amendments to clarify which class of instruments contained in the act are non-exempt legislative instruments for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.
Having said that, I think that this bill provides an opportunity to evaluate the government’s performance with regard to Indigenous heritage. I must say that Labor is extremely disappointed with this bill, not so much because of what it does but because of the failure of this government to respond to the opportunities that this legislation presents.
Labor supports moves to give greater certainty to international cultural loan arrangements and believes that the Victorian government should administer its own Aboriginal heritage protection regime. However, Labor is concerned that this bill reflects the broader problem of this government’s complacency on environmental and heritage protection issues: the Commonwealth government only takes an interest in matters where it sees there is political advantage to be gained. The development of the bill also reflects the government’s attitude to consultation with Indigenous Australians, which I think we can now say confidently has been neglected at every turn.
On 20 August 2003, former senator Robert Hill made a statement to the Senate which highlighted the government’s views on these questions. He said:
We gave undertakings a couple of days ago that the—
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill—
would be brought to the Senate as quickly as possible. The minister has since reaffirmed to me that negotiations and consultations are continuing to take place … We recognise the shortcomings in the existing system. Reform of that is long overdue … We are anxious to have a new and better piece of legislation put in place as quickly as possible.
Yet three years after that statement was made on a question of urgency, no ‘new and better piece of legislation’ has actually emerged. In fact, there is no evidence that there was any consultation taking place with Indigenous communities at the time Senator Hill made those statements, and we have seen no evidence that the government has consulted Indigenous communities on the broader program contained within this legislation.
Indeed, just over a year ago I was contacted by a constituent, a Yorta Yorta man, who had been very surprised to hear that Dr Sharman Stone MP, who is now of course Minister for Workforce Participation, indicated on ABC local radio that the government was planning to change this act once it had control of the Senate after 1 July last year. My constituent was surprised to hear this because, although he was a very active member of his community, especially with regard to heritage issues, he had not heard about the government’s proposed changes and his community had not been consulted. So in Victoria it is quite apparent that the community was not directly involved in the preparation of this legislation.
The point here is not what effect the bill will have. I have every faith that the Bracks Labor government will administer Indigenous heritage protection properly. I am, however, concerned that the Howard government appears to have developed this particular bill in secret, knowing full well that it will be able to use its Senate majority to pass this legislation, no matter how inadequate its proposals are. So, while we are not opposing this bill, I would like to indicate that I believe this bill to be grossly inadequate.
The minority report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee inquiry stated that the bill continues to ignore many of the substantive recommendations of the 1996 Evatt inquiry into this act, such as: respecting customary restrictions of information, including gender-restricted information; protection from disclosure contrary to customary law restrictions, including guidelines on the kind of information courts can seek and exemptions from freedom of information laws; guaranteed access rights to sites of recognised significance for those recognised as being allowed to do so under customary law; minimum standards for state and territory cultural heritage laws, including automatic blanket protection for sites clearly falling within these standards; the establishment of an Aboriginal cultural heritage agency and of Indigenous cultural heritage bodies controlled by Aboriginal members representative of Aboriginal communities with responsibility for site evaluation and administration; and, finally, protection of all aspects of Indigenous heritage, including intellectual property. None of these issues have been dealt with by this legislation.
So Labor calls on the government to fulfil its previous commitment to consult with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities on the broad range of amendments to the act, including addressing the recommendations that were contained in the 1996 Evatt report. It is clear that the Commonwealth has responsibility for these issues, but the Howard government has made its attitude to Indigenous heritage protection abundantly clear. That is, the government is essentially indifferent—it could not care less. The legislation committee minority report on this bill found:
… the Howard Government has failed to meet its obligations to protect and conserve Indigenous heritage and has drastically reduced its engagement in Indigenous heritage issues.
It said that the government has been reluctant to actually use the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act—under which only one declaration has been made since 1996—and has instead limited its involvement in Indigenous heritage issues to the administration of the heritage provisions in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. This is despite the fact that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act has a far greater capacity to protect Indigenous heritage than the EPBC Act.
Under the environment protection and biodiversity act places considered to be of national significance can be listed on the National Heritage List. However, the way the Howard government has administered these provisions means that a place of significance to a particular Indigenous community is not eligible to be listed unless it can be established that it is also a matter of significance to the broader Australian community. What that means is that there are many sites of extreme importance to Indigenous communities which are ineligible for listing on the National Heritage List. And, of course, we know that those sites that are eligible will be subject to the political whims of the minister and, as far as I can see—the overwhelming evidence suggests that this is the case—to the incompetent management of the National Heritage List.
Under this incompetent regime only one of Australia’s 16 magnificent World Heritage sites has actually made it onto the National Heritage List so far. The listing process, as I think was predicted by Labor, has become highly politicised. The minister, Senator Ian Campbell, has consistently been unwilling to list places that are politically contentious. This is a very, very important question when it comes to these matters of cultural heritage. If we are only going to list things that every single person agrees upon then very little will, in fact, be listed in this country. This was clearly demonstrated by the fiasco surrounding the use of Victoria’s Alpine National Park for cattle grazing.
Specifically in relation to Indigenous heritage sites, the sagas of Wave Hill and the Aboriginal tent embassy provide pertinent examples of the way in which the government has essentially neglected these questions and has made these issues subject to its own view of political advantage. In July 2004 Minister Campbell said that the Wave Hill walk-off site would be given priority consideration for listing on the National Heritage List. Since then the minister has not said another word about the listing of Wave Hill. This is despite the fact that we saw, I think it was just last year, the 30th anniversary of the famous hand-back of land to the Gurindji people by Gough Whitlam.
If you want a site of national significance in terms of land rights, surely Wave Hill would meet that criterion. In terms of political and cultural significance surely that site would meet all reasonable criteria. But what you have is a political decision made by the government to not act on this because it finds it to be symbolically embarrassing. It is a symbol it does not want to face up to because it goes to those fundamental questions about the rights of Indigenous people. There are some issues that this government wants to turn its back on. It does not want to address these matters because its version of the cultural wars is prosecuted to the exclusion of those who disagree with it, and this is one very good example.
Will the 40th anniversary of the actual walk-off itself, which is coming up on 22 August this year, come and go without any acknowledgment by the government? From what we have seen to date, I would have to suggest that that is exactly what will happen because there are some things in our history that this government does not want to engage with, does not want to talk about. Minister Campbell has recently refused to list the Aboriginal tent embassy on the Commonwealth Heritage List—which is designed to include places of cultural significance located on Commonwealth land—on the basis that the listing itself would be divisive. This decision was made despite the fact that the Australian Heritage Council has found that the embassy meets the listing criteria.
These are matters of national significance and the government ought to encourage public debate about what it is that we are doing as a country, what we have done and what we are as a people. Whatever you think of the tent embassy itself, there can be no doubt about its historical significance, not only in relation to Indigenous land rights but also to the development of Australian democracy and the capacity of Indigenous people to participate within the political culture. And, of course, the infamous case of the orange-bellied parrot debacle shows just how relaxed and comfortable the minister now is with making environmental and heritage protection decisions that are motivated by politics rather than based on any empirical evidence.
So what we have then is an issue in the context of the particular detail of the bill and those two recommendations of the legislation committee which just have not been covered. The first recommendation of the minority report was that enabling legislation to provide certainty for international loans for Indigenous Australian artefacts should be accompanied by a clear policy on the investigation and repatriation of objects of cultural significance that have been removed from Australia without the consent of their custodians.
This is an extremely important matter given our somewhat sorry history in regard to the expropriation of cultural artefacts by imperial policy and by a whole series of others that essentially stole the cultural artefacts of Indigenous people. I think it should be noted that Labor supports these moves to provide a greater lending certainty to overseas museums and collections which will enable artefacts to be brought to Australia for exhibition, and I do think there needs to be some security about these things given that these questions are so often controversial. However, we need to consider that the government should also take a stronger role in pursuing the return from overseas of artefacts of great cultural significance that were taken without consent. We are yet to see any clear policy from the government on those matters.
The second recommendation of the minority report relates to exempting heritage protection declarations from the 10-year sunset clause. I understand the Greens will be moving an amendment to give effect to this recommendation and Labor will be supporting that amendment.
In conclusion, Labor is extremely disappointed at the failure of this government to address these very important issues. It has missed yet again an opportunity, through this legislation, to face up to our national responsibilities on these questions. Some three years after the commitment made by Senator Hill that the government would bring forward a new and better piece of legislation, Indigenous Australians will be left waiting. They will be left waiting as a result of this government’s indifference to these matters. Three years after Senator Hill said that consultations were to take place, Indigenous communities, yet again, are still waiting.
Labor will support the bill, but it is grossly inadequate. We acknowledge—and this parliament ought to acknowledge—that the critical issues of Indigenous heritage have not been faced up to by this parliament under the control of this government. There needs to be some meaningful action to improve what is in international terms an appalling situation.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL 2005 [2006]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-05-11,"—The Democrats likewise support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill 2005 [2006] but recognise that it is grossly inadequate to meet what is required to ensure proper protection of Indigenous heritage throughout Australia. I associate myself with the minority report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. Although I am not a full member of that committee, I certainly concur with the comments contained in the minority report.
It is worth re-emphasising an aspect of what Senator Carr said, which is that it is nearly three years since Senator Hill, as the then environment and heritage minister, gave undertakings that the bill to improve the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island heritage protection legislation would be brought to the Senate as quickly as possible. The minister said that negotiations and consultations were continuing to take place, that the government recognised the shortcomings in the existing systems and that reform of that was long overdue. If it was long overdue in 2003, it is more than long overdue in 2006. It is hard to see the lack of action in this area as anything other than, at best, an inability to get this area out of the too-hard basket and, at worst, a clear indication of continuing contempt for the heritage of the Indigenous people of this nation.
There is a new politically correct sort of approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander matters in Australia, in which if you mention at all the history of what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people have gone through, you are immediately playing up to the guilt industry, adopting a black armband view or keeping Indigenous people mired in a victim mentality. We get all of those sorts of comments from the new politically correct culture warriors. I acknowledge that it can be unhelpful to do nothing other than continually point to past injustices without looking at what needs to be done in the here and now and into the future, but that simple and undeniable piece of commonsense should not be blown out into a blanket refusal to acknowledge the reality of the history and the damage of the consequences of that history.
There is no doubt that one of the aspects that continues to cause significant trauma to many Indigenous Australians is the destruction of their heritage: not just the dispossession but the destruction of and total lack of recognition and contempt shown towards areas of significance and areas that have great value to Indigenous Australians. The fact that we still have an inadequate process in place for protecting that even today just compounds those errors and those wounds of history. That is not to apportion blame, point fingers, smear the history of our nation or any of those things; it is simply to state the fact that everybody cannot deny that actions done to the Indigenous people of this country over the course of the last couple of hundred years have been mentally harmful and have created immense wounds for those Indigenous people, who have nonetheless survived the colonisation of this country.
As part of that we should also recognise that a failure to do anything now to at least ensure that further damage is not done maintains and continues to keep that harm alive. It is not completely unlinked from the comments and the policy approach of this government about practical outcomes for Indigenous people. I fully support any approach that will improve the practical day-to-day lives of Indigenous people. As I have said publicly a number of times, all parties in this place from across the political spectrum have failed the Indigenous peoples of this country, so none of us have a great deal to be proud about. It is not a matter of political positioning or point scoring. It is not a matter of trumpeting an ideology.
I am fully in favour of anything that will have practical, positive results, and I am quite prepared to park ideologies at the door to achieve that. But, as part of that, it has to be acknowledged that linked to practical, positive improvements for Indigenous people is clearly demonstrating that the harm from the past will not continue to be done. The harm that has been caused and is clearly there for anybody who engages with many Indigenous communities around Australia will continue the feeling of injustice and the sense of dispossession that link to some of the problems of despair that many people reflect on. Some of that—not all of it—links back to our refusal as a parliament and as a country to at least acknowledge, and at least take action to ensure that we will not continue to compound, the harms of the past. We have collectively failed to do that, and this government has clearly failed to do that.
The fact that the then minister, Senator Hill, acknowledged three years ago to this chamber that reform was long overdue and that the existing system has shortcomings yet there has been a failure to act on that is a disgrace. I recall some of those negotiations at the time, because there were ongoing negotiations regarding other environment legislation, and I recall the then minister speaking on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill. The attitude towards this issue was always: ‘We’ll get around to that one. We haven’t quite finished the consultations yet. Let’s put this one through and we will fix that one up later.’ I now feel frustrated for having enabled that at the time and for having accepted the minister’s word that action was being taken and something would be done, and we let that go through on the promise that something else would be done. In that sense, I have to accept some responsibility for not doing more to insist at the time that more concrete things be done.
With regard to this area of the legislation, it is clearly a monumental failure on the part of the federal government. Part of why this is needed is that there is not a guarantee of adequate protection at the state level for some of these areas. I point to the current push from the Western Australian government to deny heritage protection for the world’s biggest collection of rock carvings. According to today’s Australian, the Western Australian government has called for the carvings on the Burrup Peninsula and the Dampier Archipelago to be left off the national protection register. The Western Australian National Trust director likened this to England moving Stonehenge for a mine or Egypt selling its pyramids for oil. As Mr Perrigo from the National Trust says, we have something here in Australia older than both of those sites and we are planning to destroy them or damage them.
One of the comments the Prime Minister made a little while ago that I gave public support to, whilst being a bit dubious about what his underlying intent was, related to the fact that we in Australia do not have a good enough understanding of our history. We do not teach our history well enough in schools. We do not have the fabric of our nation’s history adequately represented through many of the other activities of our society. There is a lack of awareness and a lack of knowledge about many aspects of our nation’s history, which I admit to having myself. A clear and undeniable part of that ignorance and lack of knowledge is our nation’s Indigenous history. When we have something that is so rich, so ancient and so unique but our country—purely through lack of awareness or interest—refuses to become aware of it and make it part of the fabric of our nation into the future, that is horrendously inadequate for us, let alone what it says about our attitudes towards Indigenous people. The positive benefits for our nation of appreciating these sites—let alone what it means for Indigenous Australians—means we should be embracing and magnifying so many aspects of our nation’s Indigenous heritage and history. Of course it has some terrible aspects to it, and they have to be part of that narrative for it to be a genuine one, but the negative parts of that narrative are not the only parts of it; the enormous richness and the continuing survival of many aspects of Indigenous culture and heritage are a plus that our whole nation can share in. Sure, it is first and foremost for Indigenous Australians, but it is for our whole nation as we continue to develop and evolve as a nation into the future. It is just insane that we are not grasping this issue, putting maximum protection over these things and promoting them to the world.
Last year I was fortunate enough to visit Ireland as part of a parliamentary delegation. We went to a very old circle grave there called Newgrange. From memory, it is about 6,500 years old. I think it is the oldest continuing stone structure in the world. We have things in Australia—Indigenous sites—that are way older than that and put that in the shade, yet we have so little awareness of them. On top of that, we have inadequate protection of those sites. The Newgrange site is a World Heritage site. Can you imagine that being bulldozed for oil or being picked up or dug up and put somewhere else? Of course not! Yet we as a country, which in its modern form is so young, have this amazing ancient heritage that we do not acknowledge and, worse than that, do not protect. That is a failure at the state level as well as at the federal level. As I said before, it is a failure by all of us.
While this legislation does some small things to upgrade some aspects and bring Victoria into the same mix as other states, it clearly falls short of what is needed. To be left to one-off decisions on the part of the federal minister on the basis of his views is clearly not adequate. There is no doubt that the heritage aspects of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act give very significant powers to the federal minister. It does give powers to others to undertake court action, which they could not do before. The problem is that that is only if the minister chooses to exercise it. Of course, as Senator Carr said, he has famously exercised it with regard to the orange-bellied parrot. I hope the orange-bellied parrot survives as well, although I wonder why he has not done things about some of the other threats to the orange-bellied parrot, such as land clearing in its habitat. I do not know. Perhaps the Indigenous people, amongst all this rock art in Western Australia, have a painting of an orange-bellied parrot and maybe that will make the minister more keen to act to protect it, but it should not be up to the political currents and movements of the day—whether it is a Labor minister, a Liberal minister or a state Labor government in Western Australia making the decisions.
Part of what adds to people’s cynicism is that the Liberal opposition in Western Australia are saying that this is a magnificent site and that it would be a national shame if it were not protected but, when their former leader, Mr Barnett, was resources minister he did not realise the significance of this art, so he did not do enough to protect it either. But he now says, ‘I would have if I had known.’ It is no wonder people like us get cynical and it is certainly no wonder that Indigenous people get cynical when they have cast-iron promises from the minister of the day in this chamber saying, ‘This is long overdue; it’s urgent; we’re doing something about it,’ and nothing happens. Then you get the federal and state people pointing fingers at each other all the time and whenever they are in opposition saying, ‘This is outrageous’; however, when they are in government somehow or other nothing seems to happen.
It is a consistent story and it is obviously not just in this area. But particularly given some of the enormous continued barriers to ongoing advancement of Indigenous Australians that come as a direct result of many of the atrocities and offences committed against them and offensiveness towards them, this is a small part but a part in our continual refusal to do more. I might say that it not only continues the injustices of the past but also in a quite genuine way constitutes one of a number of barriers to the practical advancement that this government talks so much of.
Even from that purely pragmatic, purely economic point of view and to get value for money from the dollars that are being put into this area—such as some of the new programs in the last budget—action on these sorts of things plays a key part. A failure to act on these sorts of things actually makes it less likely that some of these other programs will succeed. It is in all of our interests—not only purely fiscal interests but also the broader, perhaps more intangible, things that we all recognise as part of why we need to protect the heritage aspects of our nation. When we can value heritage sites in Australia that are buildings that are 100 years old, it is beyond me how we can fail to protect structures, paintings or other areas that indicate the presence of the original peoples of this nation, going back thousands and thousands of years. This is an urgent matter, and I would really like to hear a commitment from the government and this current minister to say that they are going to make this priority No. 1. As I said, it was long overdue in 2003—as even the then minister said. It is well and truly past that now.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL 2005 [2006]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-05-11,"—While the Australian Greens have some concerns about the detail of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill 2005 [2006] and there have been amendments circulated in the chamber, there is a bigger issue of concern that I want to raise—and Senator Carr touched on this issue, as did Senator Bartlett—and that is what this bill does not seek to do and the issues it fails to address.
We are concerned that the government has failed to deliver on its promises to revisit the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act in order to better protect Indigenous heritage, as was stated in this chamber by Senator Carr. On 20 August 2003 during the debate on the environment and heritage protection legislation, Senator Hill told the Senate:
We gave undertakings a couple of days ago that the sites bill—
the ATSIHP bill—
would be brought to the Senate as quickly as possible. The minister has since reaffirmed to me that negotiations and consultations are continuing to take place. We recognise the shortcomings in the existing system. Reform of that is long overdue. We are anxious to have a new and better piece of legislation put in place as quickly as possible.
Three years down the track we still do not have those amendments, the new and better piece of legislation has never materialised and Indigenous groups have not been properly consulted.
These are some of the main reasons that the bill was referred to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. I am concerned and disappointed that the majority report that came out of that committee did not address the reasons for the referral. I remind the Senate about the reasons for the referral, which were stated in Hansard and are contained in the Selection of Bills Committee report. They were listed as:
The adequacy of amendments to protect Indigenous heritage.
Do the amendments address concerns of indigenous Australians?
Do the amendments reflect the changes recommended by the Evatt Report?
During the limited time available for community consultation on this issue, there were a number of concerns about the bill raised by Indigenous communities, particularly in Victoria. The majority report considered how it met its stated objectives but it failed to consider how it relates to the three criteria listed for the inquiry. It did not consider how the bill as a whole addressed these issues.
The bill does not address adequately the protection of Indigenous heritage. Since coming to power in 1996 the Howard government, I believe, has failed to meet its obligations to protect and conserve Indigenous heritage and has dramatically reduced its engagement on Indigenous heritage issues. This has been illustrated in both the government’s reluctance to use the ATSIHP Act and its administration of the heritage provisions in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.
In 1984 the ATSIHP Act was initially enacted as a temporary stop-gap measure while the government of the day developed more comprehensive national land rights legislation. When it became apparent in 1986 that such legislation would not be forthcoming, its sunset clause was repealed. The point is that it was not at the time considered to provide an appropriate national approach to the Commonwealth’s heritage obligations. The ATSIHP Act was described in the Evatt report as ‘an act of last resort, intended to fill the gaps in state and territory heritage protection’. It is fair to say that the ATSIHP Act has seen very little use. Of the 200 applications lodged since its commencement in 1984 only 22 declarations have been made. Since the coalition government came to power in 1996 only one declaration has been made. At the same time there has been an apparent reluctance to prosecute breaches of the act.
With the advent of the EPBC Act, it appears the intention of the government is to confine its statutory involvement on Indigenous issues to the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and ignore the ATSIHP Act. This has led critics of the ATSIHP Act to describe it as a dead parrot. For instance, Wilkinson and McIntosh in 2006 from the Australia Institute—and this paper is in press—said:
...in so far as practical implementation, the ATSIHP Act is ostensibly a piece of dead legislation, at least in terms of the life of the Howard Government.
This creates a problem, for two reasons. Firstly, the ATSIHP Act has a far greater capacity to protect Indigenous heritage than the EPBC Act. The EPBC Act confines the statutory role of the Commonwealth to matters of international significance—that is, World Heritage areas—or national significance such as the National Heritage places and places located on Commonwealth land; that is, Commonwealth heritage places.
The ATSIHP Act, however, contains no such limitations. In the intergovernmental agreement on the environment in 1992 and in the COAG agreement on Commonwealth and state roles and responsibilities for the environment in 1997, the Commonwealth expressed a desire to limit its involvement in environmental issues largely to Commonwealth areas and matters of international and national significance. The COAG agreement explicitly excludes heritage issues from this agreement. In relation to Indigenous heritage, the COAG agreement notes in clause 6 that ‘Indigenous heritage issues are being addressed in a separate process and are not covered by this Agreement’. To date, the cooperative national heritage places strategy has not been prepared and the Indigenous heritage process appears to have been terminated by the federal government in the late 1990s. Consequently, it appears the Commonwealth’s decision to confine its involvement in Indigenous heritage issues in the manner described is a unilateral decision made with little or no consultation with Indigenous communities or the states and territories.
When the heritage amendments to the EPBC Act were debated in 2003, Senator Robert Hill gave repeated assurances that the government was carrying out a consultation process with Indigenous communities on an amendment to the ATSIHP bill that would ensure that the Commonwealth continued to play an active role in the protection of Indigenous heritage sites that did not fall within the scope of the EPBC Act. Senator Hill also assured the Senate that this amendment bill would be debated in the parliament as soon as the consultation process was completed. From the information that is currently available, it appears there was no such consultation process at the time that statement was made and there has been no consultation on a broad ATSIHP amendment bill carried out with Indigenous communities since then. I believe this is outrageous.
The second reason why limiting the Commonwealth’s involvement in Indigenous heritage protection to the EPBC Act regime is problematic is the way in which the national and Commonwealth heritage lists are being administered. As far as the National Heritage List is concerned, it appears that a place of significance to a particular Indigenous community will not be eligible for inclusion on the Heritage List unless it can be established that the place is important to the broader Australian community—for example, because it is of archaeological, anthropological or scientific interest or because it marks a significant event in colonial or post-Federation history. By establishing these stringent criteria, the government has ensured that the vast majority of culturally significant Indigenous heritage places will not be and cannot be included on the National Heritage List, and those few that are will not be sites that are of the greatest value to Indigenous Australians.
Let me put it clearly and simply: sites that are of the greatest traditional cultural significance to Aboriginal people are by definition significant to local and regional groups—the people whose land it is and whose dreaming stories and trails are woven through these sites. Traditional cultural heritage is about a connection to the land and to the stories that give a sense of a place’s meaning. There is no way that a sacred site can be of national significance. It cannot be of significance to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples when there is clearly no way that the majority of them have ever visited a site on the other side of the continent or have a spiritual connection to it. It still means this site is important to the local group, however.
There may be a case for some few modern sites of cultural significance to arguably have significance to all Indigenous Australians nationwide because of their involvement in the national political struggle for citizenship, recognition and land rights—for example, the tent embassy in Canberra. But we have seen very clear signals from the government that they are not the least bit interested in recognising this type of cultural heritage—probably, I would say, because it underlines their ongoing failure to address these issues of recognition, representation rights and equality. This highlights a further problem that applies to both the national and the Commonwealth heritage lists, and that is the manner in which the Minister for the Environment and Heritage can exercise statutory discretion to stall or block the listing of Indigenous sites that meet the listing criteria.
As the Greens predicted in the debate concerning the heritage amendments to the EPBC Act, the listing processes have become highly politicised and the minister has demonstrated an unwillingness to list places that are politically contentious. The decision-making process under the EPBC Act in relation to Indigenous heritage protection in this way ultimately reflects another example of white people making decisions about black issues and values. The apparent priority that is being given to places that relate to colonial and post-Federation history suggests that the government is not concerned about Indigenous heritage or at the very least sees it as a low-order issue.
I am concerned that the timing of the ECITA committee inquiry into this bill was such that we were unable to obtain substantive Indigenous community submissions or to enable adequate community consultation to properly assess the level and substance of community concern about the bill. This issue has been particularly acute during this inquiry due to the reduced capacity within Indigenous communities in recent times to be able to participate in these processes, consultation fatigue and the requirement for submissions to be turned around quickly so late in the year last year. One of the fundamental principles of Indigenous community consultation is allowing sufficient time for discussion and decision making to take place. Unfortunately, due to the time constraints of this committee they were not able to have this level of consultation.
The Evatt report undertook a review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 10 years ago, in 1996. It is unfortunate that a decade has passed without significant action being taken. Elizabeth Evatt clearly indicated that the legislation was inadequate in the protection it provided for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage as well as in the extent to which it involved Aboriginal people in the decisions that are made under the act. I am concerned that what was a very comprehensive report that made some very sensible and extremely valuable recommendations relating directly to the title of this bill has not been addressed. It is clear this bill as a whole does not address the Evatt report’s recommendations in any real way, and there is no evidence that any other efforts on behalf of the government are being made to address these major recommendations.
The main recommendations of the Evatt report included: respecting customary restrictions on information, including gender; protection from disclosure contrary to customary law restrictions; guaranteed access rights to sites of significance; minimum standards for state and territory cultural heritage laws—which is particularly relevant to the bill that we are discussing now; protection of all aspects of Indigenous heritage, including intellectual property; and ensuring decisions on a site are determined by Indigenous people based on the intensity of their beliefs and feelings of significance. They are just some of the recommendations.
The federal government should fulfil its previous commitment to consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities on the recommendations of the Evatt report. It should fulfil its previous commitment to review the ATSIHP Act with a view to introducing a broader ATSIHP amendment bill within the current term of parliament.
While the Greens agree that this bill may deliver greater certainty for the exhibition of artefacts held in overseas collections, it is entirely understandable that many Indigenous communities would not consider the ability to view behind glass in a museum what they see as stolen items as any substitute for the loss of this heritage. It is important to note that there is increasing international activity around the return of cultural artefacts. Recently, we heard media reports about how the government of Italy is now suing what is arguably the wealthiest museum in the US. Within this changing international environment, it would be an opportune time for the government to revisit this issue. We believe more must be done to pursue the return of these precious and sacred artefacts from overseas.
Concerns were raised with me and with the committee inquiry by the Central Land Council regarding the impact of the sunset clause in this act. Senator Carr also alluded to that. This would effectively see heritage protection declarations made by the minister under sections 10 and 12 automatically cease after 10 years. While these concerns were raised in the majority report of the committee, it is our opinion that bringing them to the attention of the minister is not sufficient, as it will not guarantee in law an effective response and leaves the door open for future ministers to ignore or abuse this oversight. We do not believe the minister wants to be involved in this level of administrative trivia. I am proposing a simple amendment to this bill to exempt it from the sunset clause in the Legislative Instruments Act, which is in line with what has been done for many other pieces of legislation. This would ensure that existing declarations do not have to be remade.
I am also concerned about the enabling of state administration of Aboriginal heritage protection in Victoria. Serious concerns were raised by Indigenous communities in Victoria about the substance of the proposed state legislation and the impact that handing this legislative power back to the state will have on Aboriginal communities in Victoria. These concerns included the lack of appropriate and adequate consultation that was involved in the drafting of the Victorian legislation. It also included the manner in which it excludes some traditional owners and existing Aboriginal organisations from the decision-making processes, which seems likely to have the effect of overriding their ongoing role as traditional custodians of their heritage.
The Yorta Yorta submission raised serious concerns that the draft Victorian legislation imposes an Aboriginal heritage council which is appointed by the minister. It also imposes a system of registered Aboriginal parties that do not necessarily reflect existing community structures, decision-making processes or recognised traditional elders. This undermines existing community structures, agreements and decision-making processes and could create conflict between community leaders who are included in and those excluded from the council. The state heritage protection legislation effectively sidelines Indigenous involvement in decisions about cultural heritage to a purely advisory role and increases the ability for Indigenous people to be played off against each other.
Existing community-appointed Aboriginal heritage inspectors and cultural officers who have invaluable knowledge, experience and expertise in the threats confronting their cultural protection are losing their jobs. Concerns were raised at a community meeting I attended about the way in which the proposed structure of the Aboriginal heritage agreements and cultural heritage permits takes away any right of veto over development proposals and creates potential conflicts of interest for the state government on proposed developments.
I appreciate that I am discussing the impacts of proposed state legislation, and that is, prima facie, a case for uniformity for all states and territories having equal control over their heritage issues. However, I am concerned that handing over responsibility to Victoria effectively means that the Commonwealth is failing to meet its heritage obligations to the Indigenous peoples of Victoria. The Commonwealth has an obligation to ensure that Indigenous heritage will be adequately protected before it devolves responsibilities to Victoria. The Commonwealth has both legal and moral obligations to protect Indigenous heritage that arise from international agreements, the Australian Constitution and the future nature of the Australian political system.
The ATSIHP Act was intended to act as a fall-back statement for situations in which states and territories were not ensuring their protection. I am concerned that the ultimate effect of enacting this bill without ensuring that the proposed Victorian legislation meets Commonwealth and community expectations would be a diminution of the protection of Aboriginal heritage in Victoria. I have therefore proposed another amendment that will ensure a review of that legislation to ensure that the Victorian legislation is meeting its obligations and the Commonwealth’s expectations. I will be pursuing these two amendments in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL 2005 [2006]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-05-11,"—I rise to speak on the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Amendment Bill 2006 on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. This bill amends the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981 to ensure the Commonwealth can effectively respond to threats of serious marine pollution arising from maritime incidents.
Among other matters, this bill clarifies the status and scope of the Australian government’s power of intervention in Australia’s exclusive economic zone; aligns the scope of powers available to the Australian government in the exclusive economic zone with that in the coastal sea area; extends the application of the act to all ships in the coastal area which present a significant threat of pollution; and clarifies the extent and scope of intervention powers in relation to prevention of pollution by extending powers for direction in relation to tugs, places of refuge and persons other than shipowners, masters and salvors. In addition, the bill provides that intervention directions issued by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority prevail over other directions; revises penalties for noncompliance with direction given under that act; provides for responder immunity from liability for decisions made with due care; and provides for reimbursement on just terms for the use of requisitioned property, including compensation for damage or loss occurring while property is under requisition.
These are sensible measures and they enjoy Labor’s support. What Labor does not support is the Howard government’s anti-Australian shipping policies. This anti-Australian shipping posture has a number of consequences, not least of which is the threat that flag of convenience vessels present to our marine environment. We have been fortunate that a disaster involving a flag of convenience vessel has not caused an environmental catastrophe in Australian waters. With the increasing numbers of poorly maintained flag of convenience vessels plying the Australian coastline, Labor fears it is a matter of not if but when a major marine environmental catastrophe occurs on this government’s watch.
AMSA is tasked with managing ecological disasters arising from maritime incidents. We hope that with the passage of this bill AMSA will be better equipped to undertake this task, but we are more concerned that disasters are prevented in the first place. The goal of prevention, mitigation and elimination of risks to our marine environment is not facilitated by a flag of convenience dominated coastal trade. For 10 long years the Howard government has undermined Australia’s domestic shipping industry by encouraging foreign rust buckets to ply our coast. The former Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, took the view that Australia is a nation of shippers, not a shipping nation. That view informed the Howard government’s shipping policy during Mr Anderson’s tenure as minister and it continues to inform government policy under his successor.
The Howard government has used the continuous and single voyage permit provisions of the Navigation Act to open up the Australian coast to flag of convenience vessels. Many of these ships are held together by little more than the ingenuity of their underpaid crews. These vessels fall outside Australia’s control with respect to labour conditions, ship safety, crew training, security and environmental standards. The contrived unavailability of Australian tonnage to meet domestic shipping needs has removed certainty for the domestic shipping industry and largely killed off investment in this sector. This set of circumstances would not be tolerated in any other transport sector. We would not allow a German trucking company to bring in a vehicle registered in Panama, driven by a visa-less Guatemalan, who is paid a Filipino wage, and authorise it to carry goods on the Hume Highway. So why are similar arrangements acceptable with respect to ships plying their trade on the Australian coast and entering and exiting our ports on a daily basis? Two hundred thousand foreign seamen are entering our ports at the same time. The government, unfortunately, has no answer to this question.
There have been recent glimmers of hope for the Australian shipping sector, including the commencement of coastal trade by PAN Australia Shipping. But sadly, in its very first days, this venture was undermined by the incapacity or unwillingness of the Howard government to enforce the cabotage provisions of the Navigation Act. It appears that flag of convenience vessels have been permitted to carry cargo destined for the PAN vessel Boomerang I. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has not been prepared to enforce his own cabotage guidelines. I have asked a question on notice about failings in the government’s administration of cabotage with respect to Boomerang I, but the minister has refused to answer. The minister’s attempt to avoid my questioning about this matter does not diminish his culpability for undermining Australian shipping, and it will not dissuade Labor from continuing to put the Howard government’s anti-Australian shipping policies under the spotlight.
In the 2001 election the Howard government went to the people under the slogan ‘We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come’. What most of us missed was the asterisk at the end of that slogan which exempted flag of convenience vessels from any effective control, even when these foreign ships are taking jobs from Australians and sucking the lifeblood out of our domestic shipping industry.
I have referred to the undermining of PAN Australia Shipping’s operations. It is far from the only Australian operation to suffer at the hands of this government. Earlier this week the Howard government issued a single voyage permit to a Panamanian flag of convenience vessel, Golden Yuki, to carry Australian molasses down the Australian coastline in preference to an Australian vessel operated by Stolt NYK Australia, an Australian company. Despite the availability of an Australian vessel and crew, the government authorised this foreign ship to carry domestic cargo down the Australian coast. It effectively permitted this foreign ship, crewed by Chinese seafarers, to take Australian jobs.
My advice is that the Australian-registered vessel, crewed by Australian seafarers, was perfectly capable of carrying the cargo. But, rather than require the cargo to be carried by this licensed vessel, as mandated by the coastal trade provisions of the Navigation Act, the government deemed the Australian vessel inadequate and issued a single voyage permit to the Panamanian ship. This foreign vessel commenced loading its domestic cargo yesterday, and the Australian vessel was sent on its way. Stolt NYK Australia estimates the company has lost 11 shipments to foreign vessels since June 2005, representing a loss of business totalling $1.7 million.
Sadly, the government’s treatment of Stolt NYK Australia is not out of the ordinary. The Howard government has systematically corrupted the single and continuing voyage permit system. It has corrupted it to such an extent that the issuing of permits to flag of convenience vessels is now a matter of routine, regardless of the capacity and availability of licensed vessels. It is time for this government to stop its abuse of the single and continuing voyage permit regime and give Australian shipping and Australian maritime workers a fair go.
The bill before us concerns the Commonwealth’s capacity to respond to maritime incidents that pose a threat to our marine environment. This is an important objective. It is one we support. We hope that AMSA’s capacity will be strengthened with the passage of this bill, but at the same time we demand that the Howard government abandons its contempt for Australian shipping and strengthens its commitment to preventing maritime environmental disasters, not just responding to them more effectively. Sadly, this bill, while containing some worthy measures, does not signal a change of policy on the part of the government. For that reason, I now move the following amendment:
At the end of the motion, add: “but the Senate condemns the Government for administering anti-Australian shipping policies that favour foreign flag of convenience vessels and put the Australian marine environment at unnecessary risk”.",SENATE,<title>PROTECTION OF THE SEA (POWERS OF INTERVENTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-05-11,"—I thank Senator O’Brien for the supportive comments he made in relation to those aspects of the legislation that he supports. The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Amendment Bill 2006 demonstrates this government’s commitment to promoting environmentally sensitive safe shipping practices. The bill implements the regulatory elements of the national system for emergency response, updating existing legislation to align it with international maritime law and clarifying the provisions of the legislation to strengthen the regulatory framework for the national system, while ensuring compliance with the provisions of the International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties 1969.
The bill clarifies the Australian government’s powers of intervention when there is a threat of serious pollution. This is an important piece of legislation, which will contribute significantly to ensuring that our capability to protect our pristine environment from the consequences of unforeseen marine disasters remains adequate and relevant. The government has every confidence that these measures are of great benefit to the Australian public.
Senator O’Brien raised a matter in relation to the shipment of molasses. I am advised that part VI of the Navigation Act provides that a permit may be issued not only when no licensed ship is available but also when the service provided by licensed ships is not adequate. In this case the department carefully considered the information made available to it from both the permit applicant, CSR, and the licensed ship operator, Stolt NYK Australia, and reached a view that the Stolt service was inadequate for this molasses shipment within the terms of the Navigation Act. Consequently the department concluded that the issue of a permit for the carriage of this low-value by-product would be in the public interest, given its importance as a domestically sourced input to a variety of Victorian manufacturing industries. The shipment of molasses has been a point of contention between Stolt and CSR for a number of years and both sides in the dispute have made a number of representations to the department regarding the matter. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-05-11,"—The Defence Housing Authority Amendment Bill 2006 represents a significant stage in the evolution of the Defence Housing Authority. The only criticism that we have of substance is that it is a decade overdue. The provision of housing to the ADF and their families is a fundamental condition of service. Yet it is not that long ago—relatively—when housing for Defence people was absolutely appalling. It is not all that long since single men and women lived in World War II barracks—and there are still plenty of those to be seen around Australia. It is not all that long since one of the biggest topics of complaint from Defence personnel was their housing—either its lack of quality or the lack of maintenance. From leaking roofs to flyscreen doors, the attitudes of Defence management and the government of the time were locked into that of war time. ADF personnel had to put up with it and shut up.
Most affected were the wives and children, who were shunted from base to base and house to house. Everywhere they went, the problem was the same: poor-quality housing—except for some of the officers, with the best residences in the best positions in our capital cities reserved for a few. It is little wonder that there is so much resistance to moving our military bases out of those places. The reported resistance to the construction of the new joint headquarters at Bungendore in the bush outside Canberra is a case in point. The unfortunate nature of that lies in the idiocy of the decision, which is pure pork-barrelling without any justification whatsoever.
However, under better management—beginning in the early 1980s—more attention was paid to defence housing. The establishment of the DHA as a separate authority, ridding Defence of the cumbersome bureaucracy which preceded it, made the difference. It has taken time, though, for the organisation to mature. Over recent years, with sound management and the discipline which goes with properly managing a very large property portfolio, DHA, it must be said, has become a different organisation. And, as we know, it now also looks after removals—another long-running sore, and one which defence personnel endure far too often.
This is a big business, as anyone who looks at the balance sheet for DHA can see. DHA has moved from an organisation providing and maintaining its own property to a broader property management business. It no longer owns all its property but is active in the rental and leaseback fields. Instead of being an annual drain on the budget, DHA now performs commercially, and reports accordingly. The changes in this bill will assist that further.
A look at last year’s figures is instructive. Last year earnings before interest and tax were $82.3 million, up $8 million on the previous year. Net profit was $ 66.9 million, which was $26.5 million above target, with 451 houses built in the year and a further 520 purchased. The combined cost of this was some $396 million, so we are talking about a massive business. And it is one which has been largely unheralded in a period when it can be fairly said that the rest of Defence purchasing is a very dismal tale indeed. Our congratulations go to the management and staff of the DHA. I am sure, too, that members of the ADF also appreciate the new quality of housing they continue to enjoy. I know that those Australian investors in the property market know what a good deal rental to the DHA is. With guaranteed rental income 12 months of the year and total maintenance, it is a very good deal indeed. The number of houses rented now totals 16,128, and the number of removals each year stands at 30,809. The latter is another story for another time, but it can be said to be one of the greatest drawbacks of Defence service.
Let me return to the bill before us. This bill does a number of things, all of which we support, though not without criticism. Primarily, the bill converts DHA from a statutory authority, with functions serving the ADF exclusively, to a commercial organisation. As such, a number of changes need to be made. First, the name changes to Defence Housing Australia. That of course retains an exclusive Defence flavour which belies its broader responsibility beyond Defence. Perhaps that is the obvious next step. It is not a huge one—except for the Howard government, which has made incrementalism a fine art. By this bill, DHA will have responsibility for providing housing beyond Defence to other Commonwealth agencies. One might ask: why restrict it to Commonwealth agencies? Given the Howard government’s penchant for selling the family silver, the sale of DHA might already be on the agenda.
Along with the broadening of housing services, DHA will also be able to provide ancillary services. These ancillary services are undefined except that they must be related to housing services, the minister having the discretion to broaden this ambit. It is worth speculating on these ancillary services because in some instances it could lead, we presume, to other services such as social support being provided. That could take the shape of education services, including pre-schools. It could, we presume, lead to counselling and assistance during absences on deployment, and so lead to a more integrated form of family support within the Defence community. We would certainly support that development.
We would also support the bringing together of other services and support in the personnel area which are currently divided along bureaucratic lines. The provision of health services during and after service in the ADF is a very topical case in point. If this initiative makes the DHA a hub, then that is good and worth while. To the extent that this might lead to the better management of services in addition to removals in a more holistic way, we support that initiative. Interestingly, though, there is also—as usual—a dead hand in the bill. In case the DHA gets too adventurous and too commercial, the extent of any new business undertaken outside the core function of housing is to be limited. The dead hand dictates that the volume of any new business will be limited to 25 per cent of the total. That is a restriction that we find odd coming from a government that supports free enterprise and benefits for entrepreneurs. Perhaps it is a device to limit demand; maybe it is a device to limit supply.
But that is not the only dead hand. Consistent with this commercialisation process, the board of DHA will also be reduced. DHA, despite its name, will no longer be a purely defence organisation. The board will be reduced from 12 to nine, the loser being Defence. Defence representation will be reduced from five to two—those to be removed being representatives of the defence community, including, oddly enough, a spouse representative. Yet the Department of Finance and Administration gets a guernsey. The reason? The minister says it is ‘to enhance its commercial focus’. He has to be joking!
The simple truth is that the longstanding war between Finance and Defence has resulted in infiltration by the former. That will ensure at least that the maximum revenue will be sucked out to budget, and DHA will wither from a lack of capital funds like nearly all other government run enterprises. Consistent with that, this bill also provides that the new DHA will pay tax, from which it was previously exempt. Given the performance of DHA this is not a problem, but it is still, in essence, a milking of capital which we can be sure will not be provided. So Finance win again—they will strip a hefty dividend before tax and then get the right to impose tax as well. Capital, in that circumstance will, presumably, have to be borrowed—another cost. And just to make the point on how DHA will operate for the benefit of Commonwealth revenue, DHA operations will be exempt from all state taxes.
So this is the new Commonwealth business enterprise model—built, we suggest, for revenue. No doubt, ADF families will pay more rent or be subsidised further by Defence—that is obviously going to have to occur. Either way, Finance win and Defence lose. But, as Finance no doubt say, Defence waste so much it should not be a problem—it is all swings and roundabouts. The defence community also lose by the loss of their representation. In the place of their two lost board members they get an advisory committee. This committee is purely advisory, and in fact section 30 of the bill gives the board power to issue the committee with directions as to how it should operate. That is the bill in a nutshell.
Despite our cynicism about the obvious bureaucratic intrigue that is woven into the story, the amendments are still worthy of support. For Labor, there is only one position and that is that which looks after the welfare of ADF families. Life in the military, as we all know, is pretty tough. Absences and constant moves are enough to strain any relationship. They are certainly enough to make family life difficult. And it is enough, as we also know, to impact on recruitment. The ADF itself admits that, but the government dithers. Some of the announcements on Tuesday night, I suspect, are going to have a marginal impact at best.
We can only imagine how bad it might have been had it not been for the efforts of the board and the management and staff of DHA in recent years. Conditions of service are at the heart of military service, and when the labour market is tight and recruitment is hard the attraction of housing is very important. But, as is generally acknowledged, the housing must be good quality. It must be better than the housing trust fibro which was all that was once on offer. Housing must be of high standard and it must be close to all facilities, as is the case for other Australians. ADF families should not be denied the living standards available to everyone else, recognising the peculiarities of their service. Good housing is part of the deal and that is why the opposition support this bill.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE HOUSING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-05-11,"—I was interested in what the shadow spokesman had to say. The Australian government is committed to the provision of quality housing for all members of the Australian Defence Force. The Defence Housing Authority has become a considerable success story over recent years in both social and economic terms. This amendment bill will help to underpin the long-term viability of DHA as a government business enterprise.
The existing DHA Act is 19 years old and requires updating to better reflect the current governance arrangements that are to be applied to DHA after the Uhrig report. The proposed amendments are supported by both shareholder ministers, the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Minister for Defence, and, of course, DHA itself. The amendments reinforce the government’s commitment to provide quality housing and housing related services to defence personnel and to their families. They will also allow the DHA to expand its commercial base to include other government agencies while ensuring that the interests of Defence are safeguarded. The expansion of DHA’s client base and services will enable it to provide a more diverse range of services to Defence and will assist it to compete more effectively in the market for new accommodation projects.
The bill also proposes amendments that will expand the scope of the DHA and increase its operations beyond Defence. The DHA will be able to provide housing and housing related services to other Commonwealth agencies and ancillary services to both Defence and other Commonwealth agencies. The ability for the Commonwealth agencies to utilise the DHA’s expertise in the provision of housing or housing related services has the potential to benefit the whole of government.
The changes to the structure of the DHA board will provide a more commercial focus and will better reflect best practice as outlined in the Uhrig review. The bill proposes amendments that will improve the harmonisation of the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The DHA’s governance arrangements will be more closely aligned with those of other government business enterprises. The proposed amendments to the DHA Act will assist to ensure the long-term viability of DHA. I commend the bill to the Senate.

—I doubt it!
—Sorry—no-one except card-carrying members of trade unions who are in this Senate. I correct that. You were right to draw that to my attention, Senator Carr. The fact is that over the life of this government the Howard government has given a very high priority to assisting pensioners. In relation to the issue you raised, Senator Brown, we did give a pensioner bonus, and I think that has been welcomed. You of course wonder what else we have done. I would have thought a lot of pensioners would have been delighted with the announcement we made in relation to the assets test. I would have thought that the changed treatment of that assets test would be one of the issues which a lot of pensioners would be happy with. I am rather surprised that you did not mention that.
This is a very good day to ask such a question, because tonight Mr Beazley will be putting down the Labor Party policy. The interesting thing for the community to see, since the Labor Party is quibbling over matters in relation to the Howard government’s budget, which has been overwhelmingly welcomed, will be whether in the Beazley reply tonight he picks up Senator Brown’s suggestion. I for one will be looking very closely to see whether Senator Brown’s suggestion has been picked up and properly costed, showing what the effect on the surplus will be. But of course the Labor Party would not want any measure which affected the surplus, in light of the campaign that they are running on interest rates.
It is an interesting test for the Labor Party. Senator Lundy asked me some questions in relation to child care and I had some questions from Senator Evans. The issue is what the Labor Party will put up tonight—whether, having raised concerns about this budget, Mr Beazley will in the budget reply tonight show that he has taken the views of senators seriously or whether senators are going to be ignored. The government has announced its policy. We believe it is a policy which has been welcomed.

Council of Australian Governments’ Communiqué


6 December 2002

The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) held its 12th meeting today in Canberra. The Council, comprising the Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief Ministers and the President of the Australian Local Government Association, had detailed discussions on significant areas of national interest.
This Communiqué sets out the agreed outcomes of the discussions.

Handguns

COAG agreed on a national approach to restrict the availability and use of handguns, particularly concealable weapons. The agreement will result in a major reduction in the number of handguns in the community and will significantly strengthen controls over access to handguns.
COAG endorsed the 28 resolutions made by the Australasian Police Ministers Council (APMC) and agreed that legislative and administrative measures to implement the resolutions should be in place by 30 June 2003. The resolutions include:
a system of graduated access to handguns for legitimate sporting shooters, based on training, experience and event participation;
giving shooting clubs greater access to information by requiring a prospective member to produce a police clearance prior to acceptance as a member, information on other shooting clubs a person belongs to, and their current ownership of firearms;
more stringent requirements to prevent club shopping by potential members of gun clubs, including better access for clubs to information from licensing authorities; and
allowing the Commissioner of Police in each jurisdiction, subject to appropriate safeguards, to refuse and revoke firearms licences and applications on the basis of criminal intelligence and other relevant information.
COAG agreed to restrict the classes of legal handguns that can be imported or possessed for sporting purposes to those meeting recognised sporting shooter classifications in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games and other accredited events.
COAG noted the proposals of the APMC but agreed that handguns will be limited to a maximum of .38” calibre (except for specially accredited sporting events where handguns up to .45” calibre will be permitted—details will be considered by Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities as a matter of urgency, with final arrangements to be agreed by COAG).
COAG noted the importance of removing easily concealable handguns from the community. As a result, COAG agreed that semi-automatic handguns with a barrel length of less than 120mm and revolvers and single shot handguns with a barrel length of less than 100mm will be prohibited. Highly specialised target pistols, some of which will have a barrel length of less than 120mm will be allowed. These types of pistols are large, visually distinctive and not readily concealable due to their overall size.
COAG also agreed that reducing the number of handguns held legally in the community should be accompanied by a compensation scheme for licensees who are compelled to hand in handguns, operating from 1 July 2003 until 1 January 2004. The cost of funding the compensation scheme will be funded firstly from $15 million remaining from the 1996 firearms buy-back funds and then shared on a two-thirds: one-third basis between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, for the handguns prohibited and returned in each jurisdiction.
COAG agreed that an amnesty will be in force from 1 July 2003 until 1 January 2004, during which time owners of illegally held handguns can surrender those weapons to authorities without incurring a criminal penalty for possession of that weapon. Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities are to ensure that the buy-back arrangements are not able to be exploited.
COAG agreed that the States and Territories would introduce necessary legislation as a priority and there will be ongoing consultation between Police Ministers on arrangements for the buy-back and amnesty. COAG will agree the final arrangements for the national approach. Progress on both legislation and arrangements will be reported at the next meeting of COAG

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2006-05-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
In particular, I refer to the question asked by Senator George Campbell to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs representing the Minister for Education, Science and Training. I think it was a very lacklustre response to a very important issue in the budget about pensions and particularly about skills training in today’s question time. This has been a golden period for Australia. Our terms of trade are the best they have been for many decades and commodity prices are underpinning a booming economy. The commodities driving this are principally resources commodities, which are in great demand from the rising economies in China and India. Our agricultural commodities, however, are a bit patchier and are a useful reminder of the cyclical nature of commodities booms.
Australia has taken advantage of the good times, and this has been possible because of some far-sighted changes in the structure of the economy set up by the Hawke and Keating governments in the 1980s and 1990s. The Howard government that has followed has proved to be a good manager of the accounts but a disappointing leader of economic change. This period is opportune for us to set in place the economic conditions that will see us through the next cycle of downturn and upswing. This is where the 2006 budget has been a signal failure and part of a string of failures by the Howard government.
There is no doubt about it—this is the time to invest in people and in infrastructure. I think it is the biggest signal failure of this government that it is neglecting people in the areas of education, training and industrial relations. No doubt, the leader of the Labor Party, Mr Kim Beazley, will expand on this in his budget reply tonight. But I would like to talk about one example I encountered recently which illustrates, in the form of an anecdote, the way the government is failing to pay adequate attention to traineeships. The minister can reel off figures all she likes, but this is what is happening on the ground. I received a letter from a man who was concerned about a young man in the Gawler area who wanted to do an autoelectrical apprenticeship. He graduated from year 12 last year, contacted the Motor Trades Association about the autoelectrical apprenticeship and is very keen to start. He was told—and this was confirmed to me by the Motor Trades Association apprenticeship group—that 800 to 900 applications are received every year from people wishing to be apprentices, and only 230 positions are found for those people.
Here we have a country that is crying out for apprentices. Even assuming that some of those inquiries are not genuine, we have large numbers of young people wishing to take on apprenticeships, and yet there are not sufficient positions for them to take up. This is an appalling situation. The Motor Trades Association’s response to this was that this young man should just keep trying. He was told that there were about six to eight autoelectrical apprenticeships given every year, and that he should just sit there and wait until he was contacted. I did not think this was good enough and contacted a number of people who are in the business of assisting apprenticeships, including a union based organisation in the south of Adelaide that I visited with Kim Beazley, and they were most helpful. I then contacted the Service to Youth Council, and they also provided advice and encouragement about where he should go now.
This is the kind of thing that is happening as a result of the government’s neglect of training and skills based apprenticeships. People who want to take on these roles and want to be part of our booming economy are being blocked from doing so because insufficient attention has been paid to the pathways from schools through to appropriate skills training or other tertiary training, because the government has also neglected that area. But this is an appalling waste. (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-05-11,"—I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Kemp. I would like to speak about the Welfare to Work reforms and the effect of Welfare to Work on families and children. The Welfare to Work reforms are aimed at helping parents to enter the workforce and providing support services to encourage increased economic and social participation. The best form of welfare for families is a job, and the positive role models of working parents will always be good for children.
Changes to income support arrangements, participation requirements and employment services will support parents of school aged children to become less dependent on welfare and to participate in the workforce. There will be more practical support to parents to help them prepare for employment and to assist with child care, including 84,300 extra outside school hours care places, 2,500 extra family day care places and 1,000 extra in-home care places. Parents will not be required to accept a job offer if they have a good reason for declining, such as suitable child care not being available or if the cost of care would result in a very low or negative financial gain from working.
From 1 July 2006, all parents on income support whose youngest child is aged six or over will have an obligation based on their capacity to seek part-time work of at least 15 hours per week. Parents receiving parenting payment prior to July 2006 will be able to remain on parenting payment until their current entitlement expires—that is, until their youngest child turns 16. Existing recipients of parenting payment will have a 12-month grace period before new obligations commence, with their obligation commencing from the latter of 1 July 2007 or their youngest child’s seventh birthday. If these parents go off parenting payment for more than 12 weeks and need to reapply for income support after 1 July 2006, they will be treated as new applicants.
Parents applying for an income support payment on or after 1 July 2006 will receive parenting payment until their youngest child is six years old for partnered parents and eight years old for single parents. Single parents on Newstart or youth allowance will also be eligible for pharmaceutical allowance, pensioner concession cards and telephone allowance. Parents newly claiming income support whose youngest child is aged from six to 15 will be required to work part time, search for part-time work or undertake suitable activities to prepare them to return to work. Requirements will be tailored to the individual and family circumstances. Single parents receiving Newstart allowance who are suitably involved in providing and supervising home schooling or distance education, who have large families—four or more children between the ages of six and 15—or who are active and registered foster carers will receive Newstart allowance at an amount always equal to parenting payment single. This higher rate of payment recognises that some single parents are involved in significant ongoing tasks over and above the normal tasks associated with parenting and other caring responsibilities.
Parents, both partnered and single, who are involved in home schooling, distant education or foster caring will also receive automatic exemptions from participation requirements. Parents in these groups will still be able to access the full range of employment services on a voluntary basis, including the new service, Employment Preparation.
I would also like to speak about the claims that single mothers will not benefit from work and that changes announced in the budget are unlikely to encourage women to enter the workforce. Mothers moving from welfare to work benefit enormously from working. The budget provides even more incentives for mothers to re-enter the workforce. A mother in part-time work can get up to $365 per year extra due to the increase in the low-income tax offset. If she has three children, she will now be eligible for the large family supplement of an extra $248 per year. Mothers will also benefit by the increase in the lower income threshold level to $40,000 to receive full rate family tax benefit part A, up from $33,361. (Time expired)

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-05-11,"—I too would like to take note of the answers to questions today, particularly those answers to questions around the budget, and to reflect a little on the lack of any evidence or information about the impacts of this year’s budget on regional Australia. The question that was asked of Senator Vanstone about the Australian technical colleges was in fact a very interesting one, because, as Senator Hurley said earlier, the issue of regional skills development, regional training and regional opportunities for young people is something that is severely lacking in this budget.
Let me focus on a few of the things that were not in the budget. First of all, the Treasurer did not mention regional Australia once in his budget speech. It seems that regional Australians really are the losers from the budget speech the other night. Let us think about the increase in petrol taxes that are to be experienced by everyone in regional Australia when the Fuel Sales Grant Scheme is abolished on 1 July. Petrol prices in regional Australia will increase by an average of three per cent from 1 July. That is certainly not something that was factored into the budget the other evening. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer both say that the tax cuts will compensate for rising petrol prices, but of course that is not really going to be the case. In six weeks time, we are going to see a significant price hike for petrol in regional Australia.
We did not hear very much about regional universities in the budget. Even Senator Joyce is concerned about the meagre compensation for regional universities in this budget. Just think about the way student activities and student funding have been cut. Student services in regional universities across Australia get a meagre $10 million to try and compensate for the services that have disappeared under the VSU legislation.
They are two of the factors that are really bothering me, but the real issue for me in this budget is regional health services. When I looked very carefully at what is in the budget for regional Australia, I found that there is nothing to demonstrate a commitment to regional health. There is nothing for new doctors and nurses. The Southern Area Health Service where I live in regional New South Wales has experienced a shortage of nurses—of course, it is a global shortage—and that has required New South Wales Health to attract overseas nurses and pay them an extraordinary rate. They are all agency nurses. They have to be paid well above the award on a contract rate and the area health service has to pay additional costs to the agency. And, of course, when these nurses finish their short-term placements in the hospitals and with the area health services, the result is that we are seeing a huge turnover of staff. That really is not a very effective way of delivering health services.
We have seen that the government is planning to sell off Medibank Private. There will be fewer branches in regional towns, higher insurance premiums for people with private health insurance and no net gains for regional communities anywhere. Where is the investment anywhere in regional communities for a regional future? Where is the investment in regional infrastructure to provide a vision for the long term? Where is the investment in regional capacity? Absolutely nowhere. It is a disappointing budget all round.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2006-05-11,"—I also rise to take note of the answers in question time today, in particular the answers of Senator Kemp. Like the minister, I welcome the initiatives and the provisions for older Australians in this year’s budget. Prior to addressing my remarks to Senator Kemp’s answers, I would like to respond to the previous speaker. Senator Stephens indicated that regional Australia has been largely ignored. That is a furphy. It is totally incorrect. If I could quote from today’s edition of the Advocate newspaper from my home electorate of Braddon in north-west Tasmania. In that electorate, we have more than 12,000 pensioners who will benefit greatly from this budget, but from a very strong regional perspective. The editorial in the Advocate newspaper says:
Peter Costello’s rivers of gold have been flowing back into the taxpayer for some time and Tuesday night’s effort could be described as a flood. One of the good things about the budget was that most of the spending was sensibly targeted. One great result was eliminating tax on superannuation benefits for people 60 and over.
Without reading it all, the editorial concludes:
The local economy and the majority of the public will benefit from the budget.
This is from a regional newspaper in regional Australia in the electorate of Braddon.
Security for older Australians is a particular strong point of this budget. A fairer assets test has been added. It is proposed to reduce the pension assets test taper rate to $1.50 per fortnight for every $1,000 of assets above the free area. This will come in from 20 September 2007. Based upon the current age pension, a single retiree home owner could have around an additional $165,000 worth of assets before losing the age pension. I know that has been welcomed in wide areas of Australia. Also, a couple on a couple pension could have around $275,000 worth of additional assets. Further provisions provide for tax relief so that those who are eligible for the senior Australians tax offset will pay no tax on their annual income up to $24,867 for singles, and for couples that is increased to $41,360. These are tremendous provisions looking after older Australians, as we always do as a coalition government.
There will be further assistance to older Australians with the cost of utilities. In the electorate of Braddon, where my home base is, 12,000 pensioners will benefit from this utilities assistance. In 2005, we as a coalition introduced a utilities allowance for age pensioners, while a seniors concession allowance was introduced for certain self-funded retirees who do not get pensioner concessions. This year an additional one-off payment of $102.80 will be provided to each household with a person of age or service pension age eligible for that allowance. The $102 payment will also be provided to each self-funded retiree who is eligible for seniors concession allowance. The eligibility for the utilities allowance will be extended to recipients of mature age allowance, partner allowance and widow allowance. This payment will be made by 30 June 2006, so in a matter of weeks those older Australians will be receiving that one-off payment.
Supporting older Australians has certainly been a strong priority of the coalition. The strong budget provision makes allowance again for our older Australians, many of whom have supported us as we have come up through society, as we have been raised in our families and in our communities. It is only fitting and proper for a government of any nature to look after and support our mature Australians. I am proud to say that the budget this year, apart from taking care of older Australians, looks after every person within the community. There would be very few, in particular among the more mature members of our society, who could argue that this budget has not affected them positively in one way or another. People who require assistance in any way, shape or form in relation to interpreting the budget should feel free to contact any coalition senator or member in their home electorate or home state, and we will be most pleased to go over the provisions and the benefits of the budget.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2006-05-11,"—I rise to take note of the answers from government senators to questions about the budget—or should I say the lack of answers, which I am growing used to and I find quite disappointing. I would like to reiterate some comments that were made by my colleagues during the debate on motions to take note of answers yesterday. Labor has already stated that it will support the changes to tax and family payments that are contained within the budget. These are certainly long overdue and something that Labor has long supported. However, the government has forgotten many people in this budget. The government says that Labor is nitpicking and desperate because we draw attention to the areas that Mr Costello and Mr Howard have continued to ignore. If it is nitpicking to want to ensure that the truth is known about what is missing in this budget and who has been left out—and there are a great deal of them—then I guess we are.
Isn’t it funny that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, have spent the last few days selling the attributes of the budget, namely tax cuts? Mr Costello and Mr Howard are very quick to point out that they are handing out $39 billion in tax cuts. But the problem is that for the majority of people this will equate to less than $10 a week. Labor’s concern about this budget is the people that the government has forgotten—the people who will not benefit from the tax cuts, the people earning less than $10,000 a year, the people on disability support pensions and single parents.
The government has made much of the fact that it will create an extra 25,000 child-care places by 2009, bringing the total number in Australia to 700,000 by that year. But what about the affordability of child care? The government has also forgotten those people who are waiting to have their teeth fixed. There are more than 650,000 people in Australia currently waiting for dental care, and still the government has not reinstated the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. In this budget, the government has forgotten thousands of Australians, and the sad thing is that it is these forgotten people who need help most—which is in stark contrast to the comments of the previous speaker.
Furthermore, it is the poor, the people who are living on the poverty line, the single mothers, who have to make a choice between staying on benefits and surviving or going back to work, putting the kids in child care and working for absolutely nothing. In fact, women have almost been forgotten in this budget altogether. There are no incentives to improve pay equity. There are no solutions to better the quality of child care. There are no family-friendly work incentives such as those outlined in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission’s family provisions test case. There is no national plan to combat violence against women.
On top of that, there is no investment in skills or training. There is no plan for health care reform. There is no investment in the health care workforce to ensure that health care professionals are where they are needed most, such as in the regional areas of Tasmania. There is no plan to reform relationships between the Commonwealth and the states. But even for those whom the government would like us to believe they are helping—those people who will be fortunate enough to receive some kind of tax cut, no matter how small—daily life is still a struggle.
The government have made it no secret that they believe they are the reason for the low interest rates in this country. I would like the government to think about one point: why are Australians now so scared of interest rates? It is because they have stretched themselves so far to afford their mortgages, which are now at record highs. It is because the average person now has more personal debt than ever before. It is because the new IR laws threaten workers’ jobs, lower workers’ wages and terrorise their livelihoods. And it is because ever-increasing petrol prices and child-care costs and a rise in the cost of living keep everyone scared. All these factors combined mean that the average Australian is almost too scared to watch the news every morning for fear of the further hits they will receive at the hands of this government. The government remind us again and again of what a great deed they are doing by offering Australians tax cuts, but what use are these tax cuts to average Australians when it is a daily fight just to keep their heads above water?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,27,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-05-11,"—I would like to take note of the answer to the question I asked of the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage regarding the proposal by the Queensland government to build a dam on the Mary River just south of Gympie. The aspect that I particularly want to emphasise in regard to the answer is that there is a legal obligation on the federal environment minister to ensure that no proposal, particularly a major proposal or activity, will impact negatively on the species that are recognised as endangered or on World Heritage values. There are a number of other matters, but certainly those two are particularly relevant for this proposed dam.
I make the point of emphasising the responsibility of the federal environment minister here in part because the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, has made a number of statements indicating the determination of his government to go ahead with building this regardless of public opposition and concerns about it. He gives every indication to me of simply being absolutely determined to build this for political reasons, to show that his government is acting in regard to water issues. Water is certainly an important issue in south-east Queensland. I am well aware of that, as is virtually everybody that lives in that region. But the simple fact is that Queensland, economically, environmentally and socially, has been damaged in the past by dams and related big infrastructure projects being built predominantly for political purposes. It is very disappointing, disheartening and concerning to see the potential for this to happen again. Clearly a political need is very heavily influencing the attitude of the Queensland government.
The call I make to the federal environment minister and note in response to the commitment given by the person representing him today in the Senate, Senator Abetz, is to ensure that he lives up to his responsibilities under the federal environment act. It is not just a power that he has to use if he feels like it; it is actually a legal responsibility of his to determine that a particular action will not unduly affect endangered species or World Heritage values. Once this project, as it inevitably will be, is recognised as a project that triggers obligations under the federal environment act, he will need to ensure that there is a full and proper environmental impact assessment. Again, from the statements made, particularly by Premier Beattie, there is a real concern that the desire of the Queensland government is not to do that but to basically do a fast-track assessment to get on with starting construction as quickly as possible.
I focus on the environmental aspects here because that is the area where there is a clear federal responsibility to act. The federal environment minister has acted somewhat controversially in regard to a wind farm development in Victoria because of the endangered species the orange-bellied parrot. The lungfish and the cod in the Mary River do not have orange bellies as far as I know but they are certainly endangered, and this is one of their last remaining habitats. It is very important that that is not put at risk.
There are wider consequences. This will have downstream consequences that will significantly impact on recreational and commercial fishers in the region because of its impact on fish breeding grounds. It will certainly have economic impacts in the region because at least 900 rural properties covering about 7,600 hectares will be resumed. The Queensland dairy industry has indicated that around 10 per cent of the local dairy industry in the Gympie region will be removed from productivity, which will have a significant flow-on effect. There is also the impact on those that are removed from their homes and on the towns that are affected. There will be the cost of resumptions, which, there have been suggestions, may be as much as $1 billion, and the probable redirecting and rebuilding of the Bruce Highway, part of which will be inundated if the dam is put where it is suggested is most likely. Again, that would be enormously expensive. This is going to be a massive expenditure just to be seen to be doing something that, from everything that history can show us, is far from certain to fix the water problems in south-east Queensland anyway.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-05-11,"—I present the government’s response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on its inquiry into the provisions of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006, and seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—

Government response to recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee Report on the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005 (the bill)


Recommendation 1—The Committee recommends that there be a definition of ‘equal shared parental responsibility’ in the bill


Response

The Government does not accept this recommendation. The Government notes that parental responsibility is already defined in section 61B of the Family Law Act 1975 to mean, in relation to a child, all of the duties, powers, responsibilities and authorities, which by law, parents have in relation to children. 
This definition relies on the common law and statute law which are not static. In addition, the amount and type of parental responsibility depends on the age and needs of the child. Parental responsibility changes as the child develops their own capacity and views. Given the complexities, the Government feels that it is inappropriate to further define parental responsibility. The precise content will be dependent on the fact situation. To attempt to define the term would run the risk of missing some aspect and of setting in stone a concept that is dynamic and changes as the age and circumstances of the child changes.
New section 65DAC makes clear that where a parenting order provides for the sharing of parental responsibilities this means decisions about major long term issues in relation to a child must be made jointly by those persons. The provision requires each person to consult and make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue. There is also a definition of major long term issues included in the bill.
The term ‘equal’ reflects the Government’s view that the presumption should be that neither parent has a lesser or ‘token’ responsibility in respect of the child. The individual circumstances of particular cases will likely lead to different mechanisms by which parental responsibility will be shared. Accordingly, the Government considers that the legislative intent conveyed by the use of the term ‘equal’ should not be further codified.
The presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is a significant change from the current law which will mean that as a starting point courts will have to adopt a rebuttable presumption that parents will have an equal role in making major long term decisions about a child. The effect of the new provisions will be monitored on an ongoing basis.

Recommendation 2—The relationship between the considerations in proposed subsections 60CC(2) and (3) be clarified in the bill.


Response

The Government does not accept this recommendation. The Government notes that the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the bill already explains the relationship between the two tiers of factors that must be considered in determining the best interests of the child.
The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report on the exposure draft of the bill noted that the ‘primary factors do draw appropriate attention to the objects provisions in a positive way and will assist to focus the attention of the court to those objects particularly in relocation cases’.
The primary considerations of the right of children to know their parents and to be protected from harm mirrors the two new objects of Part VII of the Family Law Act 1975. These factors have been elevated as they deal with important rights of children and will encourage a child focussed approach to assessment of best interests. Both considerations are of equal weight. The safety of a child is not intended to be subordinate to the child’s meaningful relationship with both parents. Both factors are important and will be considered in light of the circumstances of the individual case. Where there is family violence then this factor will have particular relevance. In cases not involving issues of safety this factor will be less relevant and the benefit of a meaningful relationship will be more relevant.
There may be some instances where the court gives greater weight to the additional factors over the primary factors. While this is clear from the Explanatory Memorandum, the Government is concerned that any further steps to codify this point might undermine the legislative intent that, in general, the primary factors will be the most important.

Recommendation 3—Subsections 60CC(4) and (4A) should be amended to make it clear that a court should consider a parent’s pre and post separation conduct and circumstances. The revised provisions should use appropriate terminology for the pre-separation conduct and considerations, and avoid using post separation terminology such as ‘the parent’s obligation to maintain a child’. The revised provisions should also direct the court that while pre-separation considerations are important, the focus should be on determining the child’s best interests in relation to a parent’s present and future conduct and circumstances.


Response

The Government does not accept this recommendation. The Government amendment introduced in the House of Representatives makes it clear that the Government’s intention is that the focus of this provision is on post-separation rather than pre-separation parenting. However, the provision has been drafted not to preclude situations where ‘separation’ is an irrelevant concept (such as where the parents have never lived together). The drafting in terms of post-separation terminology is a deliberate means to ensure that the primary focus is on post-separation parenting.

Recommendation 4—That the Government undertake a review of the application of provisions which may operate to exclude the Court’s consideration in situations where consent orders are lodged by the parties.


Response

This recommendation is accepted. The Government agrees to review this issue as the reforms are implemented. The Government believes that with the significantly expanded support services that will be available to parents in the future, parents will be able to be much better informed on issues to consider when entering into consent orders.

Recommendation 5—The proposed definition of family violence should be redrafted to clarify that the test is the ‘reasonable person in the shoes of the individual and whether they would fear or have an apprehension of violence’.


Response

This recommendation is accepted. It is proposed that a note be inserted in the legislation to make clear that when determining what is a reasonable apprehension or fear of violence that the court takes account of the individual circumstances of the person who is said to have the reasonable apprehension or fear.
While the amendment does not alter the legal effect of the provision, the Government believes it may assist some self-represented litigants to understand the provision, particularly in light of the unfortunate attempts by some persons to misrepresent the effect of the change to the definition of family violence.

Recommendation 6—The Government should use the results of the Australian Institute of Family Studies research it has commissioned into family violence and, if necessary, review definitions of family violence in family law proceedings.


Response

This recommendation is accepted. The research commissioned by the Australian Institute of Family Studies into family violence is primarily focussed on examination of developing strategies to improve court processes rather than focussing on legislative definitions. However, as part of the Family Law Violence Strategy the Attorney-General has undertaken to meet with States and Territories to seek their support to work collaboratively to ensure better coordination between the Commonwealth family law system and State and Territory systems. As part of this process the impact of different definitions in different jurisdictions will be examined.

Recommendation 7—Proposed section 117AB should be removed from the bill pending any relevant results from the Australian Institute of Family Studies research into the prevalence of false allegations of family violence in family law proceedings.


Response

The Government does not accept this recommendation. The Government believes that, regardless of the frequency of false allegations and statements in family law proceedings, any occurrences should be penalised. The test is restricted to situations where the false statement has been ‘knowingly made’. In such circumstances it is appropriate that costs be incurred and courts already routinely make such orders in these circumstances.
The research being conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies into family violence is primarily focussed on developing strategies to improve court processes. It is true that the research will also attempt to quantify the frequency of false allegations. However, irrespective of the prevalence of false allegations or statements, the Government believes that in those cases which are shown to exist, this is an appropriate measure.

Recommendation 8—That the Government undertake the necessary consultation with service providers in rural, regional, remote and very remote areas to ensure that adequate funds are allocated for the provision of dispute resolution services in those areas. Further, where video-link or telecommunications are to be used to provide dispute resolution services, the Government is to ensure that adequate funds are provided so that parties are given the opportunity to have an initial face-to-face outreach service.


Response

This recommendation is accepted in relation to consultation with service providers. The Government has already undertaken consultation with service providers in rural, regional and remote areas in developing the final package of reforms and the service delivery models for Family Relationship Centres. This included teleconferences and face-to-face consultations with a wide range of service providers in rural and remote locations to discuss the particular difficulties and funding needs in providing family relationship services in these regions. Those consultations were the basis upon which resource levels for these services were estimated.
Additional consultations will be held in Alice Springs and Mt Isa in May 2006 to further identify service delivery issues in remote locations covered by the first 15 Centres.
In relation to funding for services, the package of reforms to the family law system announced by the Government recognised the needs of Australians in rural, regional and remote areas. All Family Relationship Centres with rural and regional communities in their catchment areas are required to provide outreach services to those areas. Around half of the 65 Centres fall within this category. Funding allocated to these Centres takes into account the need for face-to-face service delivery to regional areas. Centres may also use alternative means of communication, such as telephone, video or Internet to complement face-to-face services.
The Government is also introducing a range of other measures to assist rural, regional and remote communities including:
six new dispute resolution services to be established in 2006-07 to address gaps identified in high need regional areas in Australia
additional funding to enable Centres to engage advisers to work with Indigenous communities to help them access the Centres and other services, and
the Family Relationship Advice Line which will provide a free national 1800 number for people who cannot access a Family Relationship Centre or who prefer to use the telephone. The Advice Line services will comprise the assessment of a caller’s needs, provision of information and referral to appropriate services, advice on parenting arrangements after separation and simple legal advice on family law issues.

Recommendation 9—Where parties are in a location which prevents them from attending an FRC, the first three hours of dispute resolution is provided to those parties free of charge, regardless of who provides the dispute resolution service.


Response

The Government notes the Committee’s recommendation. The Government’s family law reform package provided additional funding for additional dispute resolution services in addition to the establishment of the 65 Family Relationship Centres (of which around half will be located in regional locations).
The Government will spend $13.4 million expanding dispute resolution services (such as mediation). Six new services will be established in 2006-07 in regional locations bringing the total number of dispute resolution services funded under the Government’s Family Relationship Services Program (FRSP) to 135 services. Almost half of these services are in rural or remote areas.
These services are required to provide access for people on low incomes. Any fees must take into account the ability of the client to pay which means that in many cases services are provided free of charge.
The Government will monitor the incidence of parties in remote locations needing to pay fees from providers other than Family Relationship Centres in the context of compulsory dispute resolution.

Recommendation 10—That the Department immediately undertake a comprehensive analysis of the cost implications on current litigants, future litigants and the courts on maintaining two regimes for a period of three years for the determination of Part VII applications.


Response

This recommendation is accepted. The bill will be amended to remove the need for there to be two regimes.
Government amendments 2 - 4 address concerns that the bill would not apply to court applications made prior to the commencement of the bill. These Government amendments provide that the key provisions in Schedule 1, which change the way courts approach parenting orders, will apply to all parenting orders made on or after commencement, regardless of whether the proceedings were initiated before commencement or not. They aim to reduce the length of time that there will two sets of laws applying to family law proceedings.
The Government considers that these amendments strike the appropriate balance between ensuring uniformity and not unduly disadvantaging existing litigants. The period between passage of the bill through the Senate at the end of March and commencement by proclamation expected to be 1 July 2006, will mean that existing litigants will have appropriate notice of the proposed changes to the legislation prior to commencement.

Recommendation 11—That the Attorney-General’s Department develop and implement a comprehensive public information campaign to inform people of the impact of the amendments in the bill on existing parenting orders.


Response

This recommendation is accepted. The family law reform package announced as part of the 2005-06 Budget includes joint funding of $5.7 million over two years to develop and implement a community education campaign to raise awareness of changes to the law and the reforms to the family law system.
This education campaign will include information on the impact of the legislative changes on existing parenting orders.

Recommendation 12—In the event of an increase of applications to the court to vary existing parenting orders once the amendments in the bill commence, that the Government provide the court with sufficient resources to adequately address the increase in applications.


Response

This recommendation is accepted. The Government will monitor the impact on court resources and make decisions about resourcing in the context of the overall Commonwealth budget and through the ongoing evaluation of the reforms. In addition the Government has injected nearly $400 million into additional services to provide an alternative to the court system to resolve post separation disputes.
Government amendment 5 clarifies the Government’s intention that Schedule 1 of the bill is not to operate so as to allow previously resolved parenting orders to be reconsidered purely on the basis of the changes to the legislation. This Schedule contains the provisions that change the way courts are to approach the making of parenting orders.
The Government amendment addresses concerns raised by the Family Court of Australia. The Court was concerned about the potential impact on judicial resources, and on hearing times, of increased litigation following commencement of the legislation, caused by people seeking to have previously resolved matters reconsidered purely on the basis of the changes to the law.
As indicated in relation to Recommendation 11, the community education campaign will include information on the impact of the legislative changes on existing parenting orders.
Recommendation 13—That the Attorney-General’s Department consult with the relevant State and Territory departments and agencies in relation to the operation of section 69ZW.
Response
This recommendation is accepted. This issue can be addressed in the implementation of the Family Law Violence Strategy. The Attorney-General has written to relevant State and Territory Ministers seeking to meet with them to discuss issues related to family violence and abuse.

Recommendation 14—That the Attorney-General’s Department consult with National Legal Aid to ensure that the necessary resources are made available to meet any increased demand for children’s lawyers.


Response

This recommendation is accepted in principle. The Department has recently written to National Legal Aid undertaking to monitor the impact on resources of any increased demand for independent children’s lawyers.

Recommendation 15—The section 68R be reviewed to ensure the considerations to be taken into account are clear to all readers, and similarly the weighting to be given to each consideration, by the Court when exercising its powers under the section must also be clear.


Response

This recommendation is accepted. At the Standing Committee of Attorney-General (SCAG) meeting on 11-12 April 2006, the Attorney-General raised issues relating to the changes in the bill to Division 11 of the Family Law Act 1975 and the Family Law Violence Strategy. The operation of section 68R was discussed. The issue can also be addressed in the implementation of the Family Law Violence Strategy. The Attorney-General has written to relevant State and Territory Ministers seeking to meet with them to discuss issues related to family violence and abuse. Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland have raised the issue directly in correspondence to the Attorney-General and the Attorney-General is responding to these States directly. Western Australia has had discussions at officer level about this provision.

Recommendation 16—The Committee recommends that subject to the preceding recommendations the bill proceed.


Response

This recommendation is accepted. It is important that the bill proceeds to ensure that the legislative provisions are in place by July 2006. These changes underpin the rest of the family law reforms and it is important that they are in place when the first 15 Family Relationship Centres open in July 2006. 
If the proposed amendments to the application provisions proceed, it is critical that parties who currently have applications in the system have appropriate notice that the new laws will apply to them.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,29,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-05-11,"—I present the government’s response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on its inquiry into the provisions of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2006, and seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—

Government response to recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee Report on the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005 (the bill)


Recommendation 1—The Committee recommends that there be a definition of ‘equal shared parental responsibility’ in the bill


Response

The Government does not accept this recommendation. The Government notes that parental responsibility is already defined in section 61B of the Family Law Act 1975 to mean, in relation to a child, all of the duties, powers, responsibilities and authorities, which by law, parents have in relation to children. 
This definition relies on the common law and statute law which are not static. In addition, the amount and type of parental responsibility depends on the age and needs of the child. Parental responsibility changes as the child develops their own capacity and views. Given the complexities, the Government feels that it is inappropriate to further define parental responsibility. The precise content will be dependent on the fact situation. To attempt to define the term would run the risk of missing some aspect and of setting in stone a concept that is dynamic and changes as the age and circumstances of the child changes.
New section 65DAC makes clear that where a parenting order provides for the sharing of parental responsibilities this means decisions about major long term issues in relation to a child must be made jointly by those persons. The provision requires each person to consult and make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue. There is also a definition of major long term issues included in the bill.
The term ‘equal’ reflects the Government’s view that the presumption should be that neither parent has a lesser or ‘token’ responsibility in respect of the child. The individual circumstances of particular cases will likely lead to different mechanisms by which parental responsibility will be shared. Accordingly, the Government considers that the legislative intent conveyed by the use of the term ‘equal’ should not be further codified.
The presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is a significant change from the current law which will mean that as a starting point courts will have to adopt a rebuttable presumption that parents will have an equal role in making major long term decisions about a child. The effect of the new provisions will be monitored on an ongoing basis.

Recommendation 2—The relationship between the considerations in proposed subsections 60CC(2) and (3) be clarified in the bill.


Response

The Government does not accept this recommendation. The Government notes that the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the bill already explains the relationship between the two tiers of factors that must be considered in determining the best interests of the child.
The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report on the exposure draft of the bill noted that the ‘primary factors do draw appropriate attention to the objects provisions in a positive way and will assist to focus the attention of the court to those objects particularly in relocation cases’.
The primary considerations of the right of children to know their parents and to be protected from harm mirrors the two new objects of Part VII of the Family Law Act 1975. These factors have been elevated as they deal with important rights of children and will encourage a child focussed approach to assessment of best interests. Both considerations are of equal weight. The safety of a child is not intended to be subordinate to the child’s meaningful relationship with both parents. Both factors are important and will be considered in light of the circumstances of the individual case. Where there is family violence then this factor will have particular relevance. In cases not involving issues of safety this factor will be less relevant and the benefit of a meaningful relationship will be more relevant.
There may be some instances where the court gives greater weight to the additional factors over the primary factors. While this is clear from the Explanatory Memorandum, the Government is concerned that any further steps to codify this point might undermine the legislative intent that, in general, the primary factors will be the most important.

Recommendation 3—Subsections 60CC(4) and (4A) should be amended to make it clear that a court should consider a parent’s pre and post separation conduct and circumstances. The revised provisions should use appropriate terminology for the pre-separation conduct and considerations, and avoid using post separation terminology such as ‘the parent’s obligation to maintain a child’. The revised provisions should also direct the court that while pre-separation considerations are important, the focus should be on determining the child’s best interests in relation to a parent’s present and future conduct and circumstances.


Response

The Government does not accept this recommendation. The Government amendment introduced in the House of Representatives makes it clear that the Government’s intention is that the focus of this provision is on post-separation rather than pre-separation parenting. However, the provision has been drafted not to preclude situations where ‘separation’ is an irrelevant concept (such as where the parents have never lived together). The drafting in terms of post-separation terminology is a deliberate means to ensure that the primary focus is on post-separation parenting.

Recommendation 4—That the Government undertake a review of the application of provisions which may operate to exclude the Court’s consideration in situations where consent orders are lodged by the parties.


Response

This recommendation is accepted. The Government agrees to review this issue as the reforms are implemented. The Government believes that with the significantly expanded support services that will be available to parents in the future, parents will be able to be much better informed on issues to consider when entering into consent orders.

Recommendation 5—The proposed definition of family violence should be redrafted to clarify that the test is the ‘reasonable person in the shoes of the individual and whether they would fear or have an apprehension of violence’.


Response

This recommendation is accepted. It is proposed that a note be inserted in the legislation to make clear that when determining what is a reasonable apprehension or fear of violence that the court takes account of the individual circumstances of the person who is said to have the reasonable apprehension or fear.
While the amendment does not alter the legal effect of the provision, the Government believes it may assist some self-represented litigants to understand the provision, particularly in light of the unfortunate attempts by some persons to misrepresent the effect of the change to the definition of family violence.

Recommendation 6—The Government should use the results of the Australian Institute of Family Studies research it has commissioned into family violence and, if necessary, review definitions of family violence in family law proceedings.

Leave granted.
The incorporated speech read as follows—
This Budget fails middle Australia and mortgages our kids’ future. That’s why tonight I want to speak to the families of Australia about our shared hopes and aspirations for the future.
I want to speak directly to the millions of middle Australians at home with their families. In the suburbs, the country towns, the cities and the bush. This is for them. Probably they’re just finishing dinner, washing the dishes, helping the kids with their homework. All the time trying to keep half an eye on the television.
Managing the competing demands that crowd each waking moment. Sitting at tables in kitchens where the magnets chase the bills around the fridge door until pay day.
Figuring out if there’s enough in the bank to cover this month’s mortgage. Or if there’s enough petrol in the car to get to the childcare centre, then school, then to work and then home.
Doing the mental arithmetic of family life. Tired at the end of another working day. Knowing it starts all over again tomorrow.
They’re the ones I really want to speak to. Not the politicians. Not the journalists.
The people who are important to me and crucial to our nation’s future—the families of middle Australia. The ones who’ve built our prosperity. Because after 10 long years of the Howard Government they’re the ones who need a break. Not an easy ride or a hand out—just a fair go.
Reward for all the effort they’ve put in to build our national wealth. Recognition that our future prosperity rests squarely on them.
I have one critical message for them: millions of middle Australian families will build the next generation of prosperity. And I will reward them for it, when they do.
Middle Australians need a government that makes their lives simpler not more complicated; that lightens the load not weighs them down.
A government that gives parents the time and flexibility they need to do the most important job there is—raising the next generation.
A government that looks at those kids and sees the prosperous future of an entire nation. That understands that investment in the hopes and aspirations of Australian families brings the dividend of a modern dynamic economy.
Mr Speaker, through you, I say this to the families of middle Australia.
Tonight I seek a binding agreement between us: between you and the government I’ll lead. Tonight I announce my Pact with Middle Australia.
Because, quite simply, it’s your hard work, the hard slog of middle Australia that has generated our economic good fortune.
And looking ahead, Australia is counting on you to do the next round of heavy lifting that will deliver future prosperity. We’re relying on you to drive a new wave of economic prosperity and it’s about time you got something back.
So, Mr Speaker, my Pact with Middle Australia has, at its core, one promise. Through you, Mr Speaker, it is this. Under a Beazley Labor Government: when you put in, you get back.
Here’s the deal. When you work hard I’ll make sure you get a tax system that rewards you. When you put in those long hours at work and at home, I’ll give you more time with the kids.
When you do your job properly you’ll have the certainty that job security provides. When you work overtime and on public holidays I will protect your penalty rates.
When you want to learn and train, I’ll ensure you get all the support you need.
I will ensure that when you put in, you get back. And I will correct a great wrong imposed on middle Australia. The people who built the good times but who’ve long been dudded by the Government and again this week by the Treasurer.
Five budgets without a decent tax break. Then $10. $10—already gone. Gone on the triple whammy. Wages slashed. Rising interest rates. Soaring petrol prices.
Fair dinkum. This Treasurer’s like a poker machine. You put in. You pull the arm. Nothing. You put in again. Another pull. Nothing. Time after time. Nothing.
But then….At last…The lights flash….The bells ring….Crowds gather round. “Jackpot!” he crows… 10 bucks. That’s the drop. 10 bucks.
Surely middle Australia deserves better than this.
Day in day out, they’re putting in and getting too little back. Giving so much. Working so hard. For so little in return.
No wonder they’re thinking “if the economy is so good why am I under so much pressure?” And why paying the bills and filling the car and servicing the mortgage gets tougher, not easier.
Why they’re forced to endure all the pain of extreme industrial relations changes without any economic gain for the country.
How can this Government be so pleased with itself? They’ve dudded middle Australian families and mortgaged our kids’ future.

MY PACT WITH MIDDLE AUSTRALIA

Mr Speaker, the Treasurer has a Budget for today—we have a pact for tomorrow.
He smirks at the future—I embrace it. I look ahead to a deal with the millions of Australians he’s neglected. A deal that will guarantee our future prosperity.
My Pact with Middle Australia has that one core promise.
When you put in, you get back. And, tonight, five key commitments to begin.

Childcare

First, new childcare centres at schools.
When you want to go back to work after having a child, you shouldn’t have to face the dreaded “double drop off”.
My plan for childcare centres at schools ends the dreaded “double drop-off” of kids—for the mums and dads who’ve got kids at childcare and kids at school.
For a family in Lonsdale it means more time at home together; less time in the car. For the economy it means increased workforce participation.
I want to meet the Australian economy’s pressing need for more skilled workers. My government will do its bit by giving parents the incentive to work without killing family life.
That’s why I announce tonight that a Federal Labor Government will provide $200 million to establish 260 new childcare centres on primary school grounds and other community land.
And we will ensure that these places go to the areas in our suburbs and towns where childcare shortages mean they’re needed most. So that parents can work knowing their kids are getting an educational experience that will set them up for life.
I will have more to say about childcare in the lead up to the next election. But I make this commitment tonight: When Australian families put in by working hard, I’ll put in. I’ll get rid of the “double drop off”.

Skills

Second, when Australians want to learn a traditional trade to become one of the skilled workers the country desperately needs, they shouldn’t have to pay.
My Government will get rid of TAFE fees for the traditional trades. If you do a traditional apprenticeship, you won’t pay TAFE fees.
I want to get more of the skilled workers our economy needs. So we need to get rid of TAFE fees for the 60,000 traditional apprentices who start training each year.
Labor’s priority is clear: train Australians first and train Australians now.
That’s why I announce tonight that a Federal Labor Government will set up what I call Skills Accounts to help Australian families save for training and skills. And we will make an initial deposit of $800 per year, for up to four years, in an apprentice’s Skills Account to get rid of up-front TAFE fees.
Eight hundred dollars a year for the kid in Blacktown who wants to be a plumber. Eight hundred dollars a year for kids in Wynnum and Townsville who want to train to be electricians, welders, motor mechanics, chefs and hairdressers.
To help solve Australia’s massive shortage of childcare workers, I will extend my Skills Account plan to get rid of TAFE fees for the thousands of Australian trainee child carers who start courses each year.
So I announce tonight that a Federal Labor Government will get rid of TAFE fees for eligible childcare courses by making an initial deposit of $1200 per year, for up to two years, in a trainee’s Skills Account.
Young people training to teach and care for our kids can use this to pay upfront fees at a TAFE or eligible provider. Or they can use it for materials and resources charges.
Mr Speaker, this country made a mistake when we turned our back on trades education in schools. So tonight I make these commitments.
Labor will give every Australian student the opportunity to study at specialised trades schools.
We will give younger students the chance to try their hand at a trade with the Trade Taster Program. For older students there’ll be more school-based apprenticeships.
I’ll invest in real apprenticeship schemes not the Government’s fake apprenticeships that use our kids as cheap labour and give them no skills.
And I’ll deliver a $2,000 Trade Completion bonus to encourage kids to finish their courses and produce an extra 10,000 tradespeople. The plumbers, the builders, the childcare workers that we need now.
Mr Speaker, my commitment tonight is this. When Australian kids want to learn a new trade my government will be there to help them. And when mums and dads need childcare to go back to work, I’ll make sure they can find the childcare they need.

Unfair dismissal

Third, no unfair dismissals. When you do the right thing at work, you won’t be unfairly dismissed.
I will tear up this Government’s extreme industrial relations laws and establish genuine protection for anyone who’s unfairly dismissed.
The Howard Government’s law gives supervisors and bosses the green light to sack a worker for any reason or no reason at all.
What we need are balanced laws to protect both employers and employees from rogue behaviour—not one-sided rules that give employers all power over their staff. A system that gets Australian values back into the way we work.
That’s why I announce tonight that a Federal Labor Government will put in place a new system to protect working Australians from the threat of unfair dismissal.
A simple process for resolving claims which gets the balance right. Protecting both sides. Plus we’ll let employers and employees negotiate over family friendly conditions and safety training.
This is my commitment to working Australians. When you put in every day to build our future prosperity, I’ll give you the job security you deserve.

Foreign apprentices

Fourth, no foreign apprentices. If you’re prepared to learn a trade, you won’t have to compete with foreign apprentices.
I want young Australians to get the training opportunities they deserve and which the Australian economy so badly needs.
As long as young Australians in Launceston and Gosford are being turned away from apprenticeships and TAFE, I won’t allow foreign apprentices to take away their chances in life.
We’ve already had 270,000 extra skilled workers enter this country over the last 10 years but 300,000 Australians have been turned away from TAFE. And we’re seeing Australians laid off while foreign workers take their places on conditions no one should have to put up with.
Now, the Prime Minister’s allowing foreign apprentices to come to Australia and take apprenticeship places here. He’s even giving businesses incentives to take them on.
These foreign apprentices are headed to regional areas where youth unemployment is already too high and wages too low. And to get their visas, foreign apprentices must accept whatever wages and conditions are on offer. And young Aussies have to compete with them.
Over time, this will ruin the job prospects of young Australians.
That’s why I announce tonight that a Federal Labor Government will abolish foreign apprenticeship visas.
No government I lead will import foreign apprentices from overseas while Aussie kids are turned away from training. It’s just plain wrong.
So this is my commitment: train our kids first, before you train anyone else’s.

Broadband

Fifth, real broadband for your kids and your business.
If you invest in a computer for your kids’ education, they’ll have real broadband to equip them for the learning of the future.
Australia needs a “fibre-to-the-node” broadband network across the country. To you and me, that means a broadband system twenty five times faster than the sort of speeds available in Australia today.
That’s why I announce tonight that a Federal Labor Government will invest in a joint venture with telecommunications companies to build this super fast computer network.
Labor would draw on the $757 million Broadband Connect program as well as provide an equity injection from the $2 billion earmarked for the Communications Fund to deliver the public funding of this partnership with the private sector.
This will deliver broadband that can instantly download documentaries, educational software and digital books.
Broadband which can host virtual classrooms where children could video conference around Australia. A digital School of the Air—for all. Plus we’ll offer a ‘clean feed’ to parents who want to make sure their kids are learning on the internet, not exposed to pornography and violence.
Half a century ago, Labor imagined an Australia where every child had a desk with a lamp to study on at night.
Tonight this is my commitment.
When you put a computer on that desk, I’ll give you a connection that plugs you into the world and brings every book ever written into your home.
This is an investment in national infrastructure that equips our kids for the future. Part of my plan to rebuild Australia’s crumbling road, rail, ports, electricity and communications networks.
We’ll take the politics out of infrastructure spending, with an independent expert body—Infrastructure Australia. We’ll make it easier for super funds to invest in infrastructure, and we’ll set up a Building Australia Fund to invest in the productive infrastructure of the future.
When Australians want to compete in the world I’ll make sure they’ve got the 21st century infrastructure to take on the world’s best, and win.

A PACT FOR FUTURE PROSPERITY

Mr Speaker, why a Pact like this for middle Australia? Because it’s middle Australia that’s driven 14 years of prosperity.
With proper rewards and the right incentives, middle Australia will have the capacity and the will to lead the next generation of economic growth too.
Right now our country has great opportunities.
And I have great hopes for our future—an unshakeable faith in the Australian people.
I know their talent, ingenuity, hard work and good humour is unmatched. The Beaconsfield miracle is proof enough of that. If only I could say the same of this Government.
If only I saw at the Cabinet table the same values I see at the kitchen tables of middle Australia.
World economic conditions have given this Government the best luck and the best opportunities. And a real chance to do something for the nation, not just for themselves.
Australia is part of the fastest growing region in a world economy growing at its fastest rate in thirty years. This on top of:
Mineral prices soaring to record levels.
Export prices at their best in half a century.
Globally, lower interest rates than anyone can remember.
The minerals boom is putting an extra $160 billion straight into this Government’s pockets. There’s never been anything like it. Yet where’s it gone?
What can we point to that lasts?
With the minerals boom, the Treasurer had a once-in-a-lifetime chance in this Budget to set Australia up for the 21st century and he blew it.
Just imagine what we could be achieving.
Just imagine if this Government was making real investments in our schools, TAFE colleges, universities and research labs, so that we led the world with the best trained workforce.
Instead Australia is the only advanced country that’s actually cut its public investment in training in professions and trades.
Imagine if they were building a communications network that gave all Australians access to world class internet infrastructure.
Instead we lag behind, with internet infrastructure that leaves us trailing the rest of the developed world and even Slovenia and the Slovak Republic.
Imagine if people could drive through cities like Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne without it taking half a day’s work to get to work.
Imagine if we had a Government with the foresight to deal with climate change now, so that great Australian icons like the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu are still there for our grandkids.
Imagine if we had a Government which thought enough of pensioners to give them a decent break.
Imagine if infrastructure decisions were taken in the national interest not just the interests of the Nationals.
Imagine if we had a government that governed for middle Australian families, instead of governing for themselves and their mates.
If this Government thought that any of these things was important—it would be doing more. Much more. More to lift workforce participation and productivity. More to build a better future for our kids. To fireproof our economy from future risks. Nation building.
Instead our kids’ inheritance from this Government is foreign debt reaching half a trillion dollars, and growing faster than ever before. One of the world’s highest foreign debts.
For our kids—this Government leaves a massive burden—already $500 million of interest payments every single week.
While Australia racks up even more debt with the worst run of trade deficits in our history. Even the Treasurer’s own Department has warned this year that Australia’s foreign liabilities “cannot continue to rise forever”.
Things are good right now, because of the years of hard slog by middle Australia. But according to the Treasurer he’s the one who’s created the good times.
You only have to look at his smug capering on the day interest rates went up, like Wile E Coyote in momentary triumph before the anvil falls, to see what he really thinks of middle Australia.
For 10 years he’s ignored the long hours they’ve put in, the sacrifices they’ve made to achieve our nation’s economic success. And still he refuses to acknowledge that, if we’re serious about building our future prosperity, middle Australia must start getting something back.
Mr Speaker, what has this Budget done?
When the Budget party’s over, when the back slapping’s done, when the tuxedo’s been dry cleaned and the champagne’s run out—what’s left in the morning? Nothing to help middle Australia.
Nothing to help middle Australia build the nation’s future prosperity. Because to build that future prosperity, middle Australia needs a lot more than just tax relief.
Mr Speaker, I support the modest, overdue tax relief middle Australian families received in the Budget. They’ll need every cent of it. Especially when they’re facing the triple whammy of higher interest rates, higher petrol prices, and extreme industrial relations changes.
So of course I welcome this tax break for the families of middle Australia. But I make this point:
No tax cut can make up for losing your penalty rates.
No tax cut can make up for being unfairly dismissed.
No tax cut can find you extra time to spend with your family.
And no tax cut will give the Ballarat apprentice welders back the jobs they lost to Chinese workers.
My point is this. Sure, the Government is offering tax cuts. I support those tax cuts. But I’ll also deliver job security, education and training, childcare and nation building.
That’s my Pact with Middle Australia.
Because, like me, middle Australia is asking: what else?
Where’s the down payment on the future?
Where’s the investment in skills, in kids, in families?
Where is the vision Australia needs?
The vision we need to build prosperity.
This Budget fails middle Australia and mortgages our future. It has no plan to take pressure off interest rates. If interest rates go up again, middle Australia knows who to blame—the Prime Minister.
Prime Minister, if your failure to fix the skills crisis forces interest rates up again—the buck stops with you.
If your failure to show national leadership on infrastructure forces interest rates up again—the buck stops with you.
And if your failure to turn around Australia’s current account deficit forces interest rates up again—the buck stops with you.
Mr Speaker there are dangerous holes in this Budget.
There’s no plan to free us from being hostage to Middle Eastern oil prices—no plan to develop new Australian fuels.
No plan to fix our crumbling infrastructure—clogged roads, slow internet connection, near-empty dams and over-burdened ports.
No plan to stop kids being turned away from TAFE colleges, or if they get into uni—ending up with a debt the size of a home mortgage.
No plan to tackle the growing crisis in kids’ health.
No plan for childcare.
I have these plans. I have these ambitions. And I can do these things because there are some things I won’t be spending money on.
Unlike the Howard Government I won’t splurge a billion dollars on advertising. I won’t spend a billion dollars on their war in Iraq. The wrong war. A war where Australian money bought Saddam’s bullets.
And I will never spend half a billion dollars with lawyers and consultants to impose a nasty, American dog-eat-dog industrial relations system on hardworking, decent Australians.
Mr Speaker, this Government’s legacy is this: a nation not equipped for the future. An economy vulnerable when the sun stops shining. A Government that doesn’t reward middle Australia.
Under their watch, the boom times aren’t building future prosperity. They’re building foreign debt.
This Government isn’t laying the solid foundation our kids need for a prosperous future. That’s what middle Australia needs—a government that will build a future for our kids and the country. One that builds prosperity.
A government with new economic policies, based on Australian values. One that will protect the Australian way of life. A Government with my Blueprints to tackle skills and infrastructure; climate change and children’s health; Australian fuels and national security.
A Government with my Pact with Middle Australia.
A Pact to end the “double drop-off”;
To get rid of TAFE fees in trades and childcare;
To end unfair dismissals;
To train Australians first; and
To give our kids a high tech future.
In short, a Pact with one crucial promise.
When you put in, you get back.
A promise at the heart of every policy I will take to the next election.
Mr Speaker, the Treasurer has always been arrogant. He hasn’t changed. But the Prime Minister has changed. Remember his annual family holidays at Hawks Nest? Not anymore. Now it’s Washington, Ottawa, Dublin.
When the Prime Minister leaves Australia tomorrow, I’ll stay and fight.
I’ll stay and fight for middle Australia. I won’t cut and run from a debate on our national future. Or from an election fought in middle Australia.
And when I’m Prime Minister expect three things.
Expect nation building.
Expect Australian values at work.
Most of all, expect me to reward the hard work of middle Australia.
Because under a Beazley Labor Government: when you put in, you get back.
My Pact with Middle Australia is the way forward.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,36,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-05-11,"—The Treasurer told the parliament on Tuesday night that tax breaks would carry Australia into the next decade. The Democrats are not convinced, and that is what I want to talk about tonight. In our view, the Treasurer’s budget comes from a vision of Australia seen through the eyes of political strategists who cannot and do not see beyond the next election. This budget is about votes and not about nation building. In fact, there is very little by way of planning in this budget for those who are not couples with one or two high incomes, with 2.5 children at school or those not 60 and over with a generous nest egg on which to retire. This budget has been prepared with little interest in fact in the social, economic and environmental mess that is being left behind for the next generation of Australians.
First, let us acknowledge that the coffers are full. The government will spend nearly $217 billion next year and still have $10 billion left over. Or will it? Treasury projected a surplus for 2005-06 of $11 billion, but it was $8.4 billion out and it still has not explained where it went wrong. The Treasurer tells us that he has $8 billion a year more to spend because he is no longer paying interest on the debt that was there before he sold Telstra and before funding to universities and the ABC was so savagely cut. The remainder of Telstra will net another $25 billion; Medibank and the Snowy Hydro will net a few billion more. Those moneys are destined for the Future Fund, where we hope it will earn as much as those entities once earned in profits.
Australia is the lucky country right now. Jobs are up, wages are up, China is buying our coal and income from the mining sector—from selling off our mineral wealth—is putting $30 billion more into Treasury than it did in 1996. We are riding the greatest commodities boom and the fastest global growth in our history. Sales of iron ore, zinc, aluminium and copper are the highest ever. The economy is slowing now, but after 15 years of sustained growth. Access Economics say revenue is $34 billion higher than it was projected to be just four years ago.
But there is another side of the story. Manufacturing cannot compete against cheap imports and its share of the value adding industry declined from 15 per cent to 12 per cent over the Howard decade. The annual trade deficit was $24.8 billion in March this year, and it is climbing. Altogether, Australia owes more than $450 billion in foreign debt, and that is a lot higher than the $193 billion in 1996 that the Treasurer relied upon so heavily to paint the opposition as economic mismanagers. Ordinary homeowners are juggling the mortgage and child care, and motorists—particularly those stuck with gas guzzlers—are paying 25c more a litre than they were only 12 months ago. The ABS says bankruptcies are at their highest level since 2001, and mortgage repayment levels are at an all time low. Household debt increased by a colossal 221 per cent to $927 billion over the last decade, and average household debts rose 174 per cent. Interest rates are now 5.75 per cent and about $11 in every $100 in income is now being used to pay back interest on debt. That is up from $7 in 1996.
Since 1996 the median price of established houses in capital cities has risen 144 per cent. These are figures to be reckoned with, but you will not read about them in this budget, and that is why Peter Costello is spending $6.9 billion a year on tax cuts and giving half a million more families family tax benefits. He knows now that it is a battle to keep your head above water and he needs to be seen to be doing something to help. Of course, if you are a family on an income of $20,000 or $30,000, the handouts probably will not even match your higher petrol costs.
There will be $248 million spent on large families of three children—an extra $5 a week as an incentive to have a third child. There is $1.5 billion a year extra on defence and security. There are business tax cuts and a massive $6.2 billion to make superannuation tax-free for over 60-year-olds. All in all, the government is spending $13.7 billion more next year than it did this year. As most householders know, the secret of long-term sustainability is not spending like a kid in a lolly shop when you get a windfall—in this case a $16 billion surplus—but spending the money carefully and in a planned fashion. That surplus should have been invested in the future beyond the current economic boom, a future in which our children will not have to fix the problems that we left behind, like foreign debt, the HECS debt, climate change and water and skills shortages.
The Treasurer uses the term ‘nation building’ very loosely. I suggest he is spending our future now and leaving little for up-and-coming generations. This is actually a budget about the future of the coalition—for buying votes; not for the long-term future of a nation. The Democrats said early childhood development, climate change, water, oil, mental health, education and training, Indigenous inequality, infrastructure, research and development and tax reform should be the priorities of government but few if any made it into this budget.
Child care turned out not to be the priority that the Treasurer suggested, despite hints that it might be and it remains inaccessible and too expensive for a lot of families. Costs rose by 60 per cent in the last four years, but the child-care benefit has barely changed. In the last budget the government tossed parents a 30 per cent child-care rebate. Of course, this rebate will take up to two years to come through, after families have paid out the cash. So why did the Treasurer, who bragged about this being such a family and women-friendly budget, not just fold the rebate into the benefit and pay it to families when they need it?
This government’s great obsession with the private sector and competition has allowed a duopoly of for-profit centres with their economies of scale and scrooge-like control over costs, particularly wages, to take over the delivery of most child care. Community based centres where parents have a say in the management and where quality is what matters are closing and the waiting lists are growing. But Mr Costello, this is not about child-care places. Parents want skilled, well qualified staff and they want quality—something this budget does not deliver.
More than one-quarter of a million children below the age of six attend long day care but not all of them are receiving formal preschool once they turn four, and many other families cannot afford the fees that need to be charged for preschool. Since the Keating government removed preschool funding, the Commonwealth has contributed nothing to that vitally important first year of transition into school. For around $400 million a year this budget could have provided free preschool in child-care centres and in stand-alone kinders, but it has not. The thousands of new family day care places are good, but there are as many out there that have not been taken up. Treasurer, we still need to see a complete overhaul of the early childhood system, not your ad hoc bandaids. Early childhood education and care are essential in reducing poverty, and progress here would have been a very good step in nation building.
The government has lost whatever environmental credentials it claimed over the last decade, ignoring its own powerful federal environment and heritage laws, undermining its renewable energy target, decimating the Australian Greenhouse Office, allowing the $400 million Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program to be dissipated over a decade, and letting the Natural Heritage Trust peter out after next year. The Democrats were proud to have been involved in improving, refining and indeed initiating many of these measures for the environment, and it is irksome to see them undermined, watered down or just ignored by a government arrogantly using its numbers in the Senate. The environment, I would suggest, was in far better hands when the Democrats held the balance of power.
Australia would have been well on the track of reducing its emissions through renewables had the promised greenhouse trigger been put into the environment laws. Instead we now have a minister for the environment who has become antagonistic to, rather than a champion of, renewable energy development. He tried to rob a three-turbine wind development in Western Australia of money under the remote power renewable energy program, another initiative of the Democrats. This tiny wind farm was proposed by members of the community in Denmark, but he stopped it as well as the Bald Hills proposal because of a handful of objectors.
Funding stops in this budget for CSIRO’s programs on improved water allocation and management, including irrigation, sustainable natural resource management, understanding and responding to climate change, sustainable marine fisheries, healthy coastal rivers, estuaries and coastal zones and the Australian wildlife hospitals. Funding stops after next year for the photovoltaic rebate, the Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program, protecting Australia’s biodiversity hotspots, the regional national heritage program, the Renewable Energy Equity Fund and the Alternative Fuel Conversion Program—all of them gone. This budget pays lip service to alternative and renewable transport fuel despite rocketing petrol prices. Nothing has been done to reduce our consumption of or reliance on oil and yet there were so many opportunities. The $4 billion Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme and the $52.5 million in this budget to prop up Ford’s new pickup trucks could have been used to leverage fuel efficiency and provide incentives to make hybrid vehicles in this country.
The government claims that public transport is a state responsibility but the Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke and Keating governments all provided public transport funds. You cannot have a national approach to transport, as AusLink claims, and ignore public transport. Our cities are congested with passenger cars and trucks, noise and pollution. Sitting back, funding more freeways, does not work, is not sustainable, uses up more oil and most definitely is not nation building.
So where is the plan to shift freight from road to rail along the east coast? This budget provides massive upgrades for the Hume and Bruce highways but where is the $3 billion recommended by the Neville committee back in 1998 to straighten and strengthen existing interstate main lines? The $270 million allocated in this budget is pitifully small and a fraction of what needs to be spent on rail.
The Democrats welcome the $500 million for the Murray-Darling Basin Commission but, again, it is not enough. It may improve water quality but it is unlikely to deliver water in anything like the quantity—1,500 gigalitres—that scientists say is so desperately needed to restore the system. There are two main ways to deliver more water to the Murray-Darling. The first is to purchase existing water entitlements or engage in entitlements buyback schemes, and the second is to reduce the huge losses in seepage and evaporation from irrigation channels. $500 million over five years will not go very far in doing either of those. The fact that the government is selling its $1 billion share of the Snowy Mountains Hydro Scheme and losing control of billions of litres of water flows makes a mockery of this gesture. Mr Costello, this is neither visionary nor generous. As droughts still rack much of New South Wales and south-west Queensland, it is astounding that the government has not set aside funds to help these states with effluent treatment and reuse, stormwater harvesting and, in the cities, household incentives to collect, reuse and save water.
Infrastructure investment underpins economic activity in telecommunications, transport, education, health, water and power generation. Australia needs adventurous, forward-looking infrastructure plans which are designed for sustainable communities, the environment and economies 15 years ahead. But there are no such plans in this budget.
Eight out of 10 Australian companies say that building the skills base is the key to international competitiveness. There is a pitiful $6 million for the National Skills Shortage Strategy, which says a lot about the government’s priorities or lack of them. Investing in people and their education, leaving aside all of those other benefits, increases productivity and economic wellbeing, but no budget in recent history has had less of a focus on the university and TAFE sectors. It makes no sense for a government to let our knowledge and applied skills sector fall into such a deplorable state. The ‘voluntary student unionism transition fund’—so-called—has not even been extended to student advocacy or health. The $10 million over four years for small businesses to set up shop on campuses is, frankly, laughable. Increases in the FEE HELP will mean more student debt. Australians now owe more than $11 billion in HECS, and we are burdening generations with personal debt that the majority will never be able to repay.
TAFE funding is still not indexed and the sector cannot seriously address the skills shortages, especially in our ailing manufacturing sector. Australia is the seventh lowest amongst the 25 richest OECD countries in VET funding. Three hundred thousand long-term unemployed cannot access the training and support needed to get them back into the workforce. Where is the concerted effort to improve the employment chances for mature aged workers, for the long-term unemployed and for upskilling existing workers? In fact the government actually cut the Basic Information Technology Enabling Skills for Older Workers program, the Career Planning program and the Women in Non-Traditional Occupations incentive. The Democrats again call on the government in this budget to increase funding to public schools to at least the average for the OECD nations. Schools also need extra funding for remoteness, students with disabilities, learning difficulties and challenging behaviours, and for Indigenous students and those from low-income families. I put it to the government that its failure to properly fund our education sectors is an act of vandalism which will eat at the productive heart of the nation.
I now turn to a core value of the coalition—income tax cuts. I understand that Australians will be grateful for tax relief in the budget but they will surely be disappointed that there is no strategic income tax reform plan. The Democrats and economics commentators say that structural tax reform is essential to a simpler, fairer and more transparent system. But Mr Costello is the ‘no plan tax man’. He has only adjusted rates and thresholds within the existing system—something a well-programmed computer could do with ease. The GST and the New Tax System took several years of hard work to develop, and so it is with income tax reform.
We say—and we have been saying this for many years—that a structural tax reform plan must include raising the tax free threshold so, at the very least, people with income below the poverty line do not pay tax. Indexing the rates to account for bracket creep is necessary, as are broadening the tax base by eliminating inequitable, inefficient and out-dated tax concessions, and reforming the tax welfare intersects to encourage people to move from welfare to work. If concessions were rationalised we could perhaps eliminate the need for tax returns—it is just an idea. Why do we need to do this? It is because effective marginal tax rates of up to 70 per cent apply to low-income earners right now when they move from welfare to work, and this is just unfair. No Australian should have to accept an effective marginal tax rate greater—much greater—than the new top rate of 45 per cent. The ‘no plan tax man’, in his largesse has just fiddled at the edges, rewarding those on the highest incomes the most.
The government’s bolt from the blue—to take tax off superannuation payouts—is perhaps the most blatant vote-buying measure that we have seen in this budget and it is most likely to advantage only the baby boomers due for retirement soon. Our guess is that this policy will become unsustainable and the claw-back will start sometime down the track and it will not be that far away. Removing tax is not simplification: it is a gift, benefiting those who least need it. We would like to make a suggestion on superannuation. Why not tax contributions going in progressively so that those on the 15 per cent tax rate would pay no super contribution tax at all; those on 30 per cent would pay 15 per cent; and those on 40 per cent would pay 25 per cent tax on contributions; and those on 45 per cent would pay 30 per cent tax on contributions?
We also think that lump sum payments should be very much discouraged. Retirement money is much safer in super funds than at the hands of investment shysters. These are just our thoughts and, like tax reform, they need more work to get them right—work to make sure that the tax system is sustainable, fair and equitable.
The $1.9 billion promised by the government in the wake of the Senate inquiry into mental health is indeed welcome and will go some way to alleviating the problem, but it is still about one-third of the increase that the committee was told was the minimum required to deliver mental health services to those who need them. We urge the government to take all the recommendations of this inquiry to the COAG meeting in June and to negotiate in good faith with the states to see that they are properly funded. There are no quick fixes in mental health, but we must work at alleviating the pain and the alienation of almost one million Australians affected by mental illness. The government must, together with the states, commit to funding well-staffed community based mental health centres and prevention and early intervention, to name just a few measures.
There is nothing in the health budget to drive down the rate of smoking—the addiction that still kills 19,000 people a year and is absolutely preventable. Minister Abbott’s school canteen guidelines will not solve the looming wave of obesity related disease. There is again nothing to bring down the dental waiting lists or to stop the onslaught of sexually transmitted infection. The Treasurer’s generosity has not been extended to the PBS, where there is enormous pressure right now to reduce costs, at the risk of making some medicines unavailable in this country.
It is clear that the Howard government is cynically failing Indigenous Australians. Here is an example: DEST’s Abstudy for the next four years has tied attendance to payments. They have revised their figures downwards by $1.8 million in the expectation that Indigenous people will not attend schools. Leaving aside the unlikelihood that the government can predict the future actions of people, this is a cynical and cold-hearted cost-cutting exercise. Fewer than one-fifth of Indigenous people over 15 go on to year 12. Not surprisingly, they have much lower rates of tertiary education, and unemployment for them is almost three times higher than for non-Indigenous people. They earn much less and are more likely to live in substandard conditions. The gross overcrowding in Indigenous communities would never be tolerated elsewhere.
Indigenous community housing organisations across Australia need at least a further $141 million a year for five years to fix the Indigenous housing shortfall. Indigenous people are more likely to have inadequate water and washing facilities and poor sanitation and sewerage. The AMA says that Indigenous health is underfunded by at least $452.5 million every year, and an additional $50 million is needed for the Indigenous workforce to be trained. But none of this is in the budget, and I doubt Indigenous Australians will welcome another 10 years of Mr Costello’s economic reforms. Mutual obligation has not worked for them so far, any more than practical reconciliation did.
Those on benefits will, like the rest of us, soon have to pay for the highly elaborate infrastructure being set up around an ID card, which will track their welfare payments, wiping out, we are told, welfare fraud to the tune of $3 billion. We think this is doubtful, judging by the harshness with which Centrelink already treats its clients.
The Treasurer argues that helping families is one of the government’s highest priorities and that this budget delivers through tax cuts and the family tax benefit. I am sure that families will welcome the additional income, but they will do so knowing they will also have less job security, greater casualisation and less job flexibility, thanks to the government’s Work Choices.
The Treasurer wants women to have more children, but they know, as I do, that it costs more than $5 extra a week to raise a child. They also know that they will need at least one good, stable income in a family before they take that step. Work Choices attacks secure family incomes. It delivers job insecurity and uncertain wages and conditions. Work Choices will likely drive down the minimum wage and reduce rights and benefits, especially for the vulnerable, the disadvantaged and women who are in and out of the workforce because of their caring responsibilities.
In this law, the government has failed families and failed Australia. We have not heard much about intergenerational equity in this budget because, frankly, there is none. The current generation of students and children—our next generation of workers and parents and custodians of the economy and the environment—are not considered much in this budget and the government is leaving them the most difficult problems to solve.
Mr Howard and Mr Costello’s political strategists have sacrificed the great tenets of liberalism—freedom, investment in people and investment in the future—for a good headline. The Democrats are committed to what we know to be the priorities for a sustainable future for all Australians, well beyond a Costello next decade and most definitely beyond the next election.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,36,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-05-11,"—The budget reflects the soul of a nation. It is the economic tool that gives effect to the vision and values that a government has for its people. On Tuesday night, Australians heard that the vision and values of the Howard government over 10 years in office had delivered rivers of gold and manna from heaven. They heard that the vision and values had turned Australia into a debt-free country, awash with cash—some $178 billion in extra revenue since 2002—and that the same vision and values, business as usual, would see the good times roll on into the future. It was a live-for-today package, a reaffirmation of the Howard government philosophy that the richer you are, the more you are valued and rewarded.
The budget message was that the Howard government had perfected the Midas touch, and people were prompted to rejoice and be glad to spend, spend, spend—for the vision and values of Prime Minister Howard and his Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello, would guarantee that the only direction for the Australian economy was up, and, on that assumption, the tax revenue base could be permanently narrowed. In the next four years, $45 billion will be forgone in tax cuts, as if there were no national imperatives to fund nor any global responsibilities, as if an ecological deficit did not exist, as if the nation’s health and education systems were already world class and as if the $2.6 billion required to address Indigenous health and housing were not a priority.
The nation got the message, and the partying and the backslapping began. The media was euphoric and most commentators gushed. Few political and economic analysts could find any fault with the formula or the outcome, so much so that the Treasurer felt sorry for the opposition for, seemingly, it had nowhere to go. And from the response of the opposition, I have to say, it appears to have felt sorry for itself, by repeating the refrain ‘we was robbed’. What were they robbed of? The opportunity to say and deliver the same things themselves, because the Beazley opposition supports the tax cuts.
The Howard government’s vision and values expressed through its budget have made me realise that we have actually become two nations in Australia: one that is fixated on the present and cannot see what the problem is and the other that can see the problem and the huge risks for our children, grandchildren and future generations. The Howard government’s budget is a budget for those who cannot see what the problem is. It is predicated on the assumption that it is the Howard government’s own policies and ‘business as usual’ economics that have delivered and will continue to deliver prosperities to Australians into the future. Its fundamental flaw is that in its supreme confidence that the surplus is of its own making, the Howard government has lost sight of the fact that the global economy and ongoing economic growth depend on the natural environment and its resources. The Howard government does not seem to understand that without the environment there is no economy.
What is different in 2006 is that the capacity of the earth and its ecosystems to sustain economic growth is in doubt if ‘business as usual’ use and exploitation of resources such as fossil fuels continues. Whereas previously individual civilisations or regions have collapsed because of unsustainable use of water, soils, forests or fisheries, the difference now is that the whole globe is at risk. As leading environmental thinker Lester Brown has said:
In our preoccupation with quarterly earnings reports and year-to-year economic growth, we have lost sight of how large the human enterprise has become relative to the earth’s resources—
Take China, for example—
China has overtaken the United States in the consumption of most basic resources. Among the leading commodities in the food sector (grain and meat), in the energy sector (oil and coal), and in the industrial sector (steel), China now leads the United States in the consumption of all except oil.
What if China reaches the U.S. resource consumption level per person? If China’s economy continues to expand at 8 percent per year, its income per person will reach the current U.S. level in 2031.
If we further assume that Chinese resource consumption per person in 2031 will be the same as that in the United States today, then the country’s projected population of 1.45 billion will consume an amount of grain equal to two thirds of the current world grain harvest ... and it would use 99 million barrels of oil per day—well above current world production of 84 million barrels.
The western economic model ... is not going to work for China.
... in an increasingly integrated world economy, where all countries are competing for the same oil, grain and steel and mineral resources, the existing economic model will not work for industrial countries either.
Lester Brown concludes:
The days of the fossil-fuel-based, automobile-centered, throwaway economy are numbered.
This has greater ramifications for Australia than it has for most other countries in the OECD because it is not the Howard government’s vision that has delivered metaphoric rivers of gold but, rather, real truckloads and shipholds of minerals powered by fossil fuels. Total mineral exports from Australia doubled in value between 2000 and 2006.
Australia is awash with cash because of a minerals boom which has delivered corporate profits to the Treasury. Between 2002 and 2007 company tax collections will have doubled to $57 billion. But instead of recognising that these profits are completely unsustainable and using the cash to invest in nation-building through the development of a highly educated nation and a more sophisticated low-carbon economy significantly less dependent on extraction of natural resources and fossil fuels, the Howard government has pursued policies that have narrowed and weakened the economy to the point where we have virtually no manufacturing industry and only a weak tertiary sector left. In 1990 manufacturing contributed 13.4 per cent of GDP and it now contributes 10.9 per cent. We have regressed under the Howard government to riding on the sheep’s back. As Doug Cameron, from the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, has said: ‘A farm, a quarry, and a nice place to visit.’
When the Howard government came to power, the current account deficit was three per cent of gross domestic product and now it is six per cent. Then, the Treasurer could not stop talking about it. Now, it is as unmentionable as climate change. Australia’s economy is on shaky ground and is vulnerable to a global loss of confidence in financing these deficits. If that happens there will be upward pressure on interest rates. This is hardly a situation in which Treasurer Costello should be boasting about being a good economic manager and throwing money around. The economy is structurally weak. The Howard government has exposed Australia to perilous economic risks.
What happens when the boom ends or when the rest of the world decides not to use our coal because of global warming or our uranium because nuclear power is shown to be too expensive, too dangerous and too slow? What happens when we need to import 70 per cent of our oil and we have already exported the bulk of our liquid natural gas? Will we feel so confident then of the decision to decrease the tax revenue base when oil imports alone add an extra $30 billion to the already shameful trade deficit and therefore to our current account deficit as well?
What happens when salinity continues to render farmland infertile and rivers too saline to use? What happens when climate change causes dislocation to traditional agriculture, and the benefits of the $500 million injection into the Murray-Darling river system are negated by reduced rainfall and higher evaporation rates? Who will pay for the damage from the increased frequency and intensity of the floods, fires and storms that climate change is bringing? Whilst the Howard government budget provides for $394 million in national security spending, it fails to recognise the greatest risk to Australia, to Australian people, to Australian families—and that is climate change.
In the budget papers one risk that is identified is the possible need for greater expenditure on drought relief, although the analysis concludes that this is unlikely to occur and that agricultural production forecasts are similar to previous years. Does no-one in the government listen to the CSIRO climate scientists—or have they now all been replaced by coal and petroleum industry spokespeople? In this budget 170 CSIRO jobs have been cut; so much for the clever or innovative country. Does the Prime Minister expect, when he dons the Akubra hat and visits drought affected and storm damaged areas, to be taken seriously when he expresses surprise that these events have occurred?
The Australian Greens believe that it is both prudent and equitable to develop a climate change disaster fund to provide certainty to individuals and communities. As the threat of climate change increases, so too should the amount allocated to this fund increase. The federal government does not publish an annual assessment of the costs of natural disasters, but government figures averaged over decades and adjusted for inflation put the average cost of natural disasters at around $13.7 billion per decade to date. The climate change disaster relief fund should be funded by taxes on activities that will increase the likelihood of climate change related disasters, as such an approach ensures that the incidence of the tax will have a double dividend of decreasing reliance on harmful activities. While a carbon tax would be the most effective mechanism for achieving such an objective, the reintroduction of fuel excise indexation or the introduction of the planned increase in the heavy vehicle road user charge would easily fund such a scheme.
It is hard to estimate just how far Australia has fallen behind the rest of the world. I doubt there is any other country in the OECD which does not identify climate change and oil depletion as high risks to their economy. I cannot imagine one of those OECD countries which has a budget and puts out budget papers which identify the risks to its economy not mentioning climate change. In fact, the Australian risk assessment is that there is a greater risk of space objects falling out of the sky; it does not mention climate change.
The Kyoto protocol must be ratified and Australia must join the world at the table for the post-2012 dialogue, with serious intent to invest in mitigation and adaptation by the adoption of a new post-Kyoto multilateral treaty. Voluntary approaches such as the Asia-Pacific Partnership do not work, and the failure of voluntary action is exactly why the Kyoto protocol was negotiated in the first place. It would therefore appear prudent for the Commonwealth government to invest around $1.5 billion per year in order to provide appropriate resources to mitigate the financial, if not the personal, costs of natural disasters.
Australia has no strategy to deal with oil depletion or to oil-proof the nation. The expectation is that, given enough tax breaks, the explorers will simply go out and find more oil. The assumption is that there is plentiful, cheap, easily accessible oil to be found, that the market will set the price and that, when it gets too high, alternatives will be found. But even the federal government’s experts, Geoscience Australia, say that by 2012 there is a 90 per cent chance Australia will be producing less than half of its oil requirement. In contrast, the Swedish government in its budget announced a strategy to make Sweden oil free by 2020. All over the world nations have introduced regulation for energy efficiency. The Greens want an energy efficiency target. Instead of providing accelerated depreciation across the board, the Greens believe that accelerated depreciation should be restricted to those companies which implement energy efficiency measures identified in the energy efficiency audit mandated by the government.
In Europe, governments have invested heavily in public transport, renewable energy and alternative fuels. They have moved freight off the roads and onto rail. They have recognised that oil-proofing a nation improves the resilience of its economy and its quality of life by reducing private vehicle use, improving air quality and reducing traffic congestion and greenhouse gases. As a first step, they have provided incentives for making car fleets fuel efficient. In this country Western Australia has taken the lead in a similar initiative to improve the fuel efficiency of its car fleet, and the Commonwealth would do well to do exactly the same with its own government fleet.
While Australia panders to the whim of the automobile industry by setting toothless voluntary fuel efficiency targets, California and nine other US states are fighting the Bush administration for the right to impose tighter mandatory vehicle emission limits. Even China has adopted a mandatory fuel efficiency target of 6.8 litres per 100 kilometres. It is a similar target to Australia’s, except that the Chinese are serious about actually achieving it. It is hard to believe that Treasurer Costello has granted a subsidy—that is, corporate welfare—to Ford of $52 million, without tying it to fuel efficient design. I cannot imagine any other OECD country that would give a handout to a motor vehicle company for design specifications and not tie it to fuel efficiency. The Howard government clearly does not recognise energy security as a risk to this country’s economic wellbeing.
Other nations have recognised that urbanisation requires national oversight. Whereas public transport is a state issue in Australia, oil depletion and choked and congested cities are a national concern because they impact on the productivity of cities and on the quality of life of those who live there. A government with vision for the future would have instigated a COAG process and a financial strategy for the oil proofing of Australian cities and would have invested heavily in public transport. In the 1970s, 12 per cent of Australia’s passenger kilometres were carried by public transport and today it is less than eight per cent. We need to exempt public transport and low-emission vehicles from the GST. But, no, nation building for the Howard government consists of road building, with the oil price approaching $100 a barrel. It is a brilliant strategy!
AusLink is set to receive $13 billion over five years, but new road funding in this week’s budget has been allocated at nearly 10 times the amount for rail. Until we invest more in rail than we do in road, we cannot hope to shift the freight task from our crumbling roads and on to fast tracks linking our major cities. The decision not to proceed with the planned increase in the heavy vehicle road user charge is a slap in the face for transport reform.
If Australians had been asked whether they would prefer to permanently reduce their energy and petrol costs by being assisted to upgrade to a more fuel efficient vehicle, to put a solar hot water system on their roof or to access faster and better public transport or, alternatively, to have tax cuts to enable them to pay higher petrol and energy costs, the government would have found that the community would prefer government intervention to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy to head off higher costs rather than just being assisted to meet them if future budgets allow for it. At the moment, Australia has the third cheapest petrol in the OECD and our electricity is 40 per cent cheaper than the OECD average cost, yet energy affordability is up there with housing affordability as a major issue in our community. How much worse will it become?
Whilst reducing fuel excise on alternative fuels is essential, cutting fuel excise on conventional fuels is not the answer, because in a world experiencing peak oil it is economically unsustainable and it lulls people into thinking that they do not need to make changes to their vehicle standards or use. Being strategic and proactive provides national energy security, whereas reacting to short-term market forces leaves the nation insecure and exposed to the vagaries of the global market.
The same applies to other fossil fuels. It is reckless and irresponsible not to plan for adaptation to climate change, because we know that the costs of acting now are far less than the costs will be if we do not. In that regard, how can we argue that we have a surplus when we have failed to assess the financial risks and costs of climate change? This is not just about the Great Barrier Reef. This is about the liveability of country towns. It is about health; it is estimated that 10,000 people will die from heat exhaustion because of increased temperatures. It is about dislocation in agriculture. It is about just about every aspect of our lives.
Whilst the Howard government is relying on coal and pinning our future on unproven carbon capture and storage technology, other nations are moving rapidly to invest in renewable energy technology and products. One day Australia will price carbon. The cost of disposing of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere has been subsidised by the community for too long. This subsidy must end. Whilst the switch towards taxing atmospheric pollution is a complex area of policy, what is simple is the need to send a signal to the market. The longer we delay sending the signal the longer plans for coal-fired power stations will continue to be advanced.
The Greens propose that the government introduce an emissions trading scheme and/or a carbon tax as a matter of urgency to send a clear signal to the market, to shift the financial risk from the government to the market, to minimise transition costs and to fund emerging renewable energy industries. This is good business. Australia is blessed with fantastic solar and wind energy. We could lead the world in photovoltaics, but to do so we need to invest in the commercialisation of existing technologies and R&D for improved technologies. We need to provide incentives for the roll-out of those technologies, including reform of electricity tariffs through guaranteed prices for renewable energy and, in the short term, an extension of the photovoltaic rebate scheme.
Germany has created 150,000 jobs by introducing legislation to drive the solar industry. Over 19 US states have introduced renewable energy targets to attract those industries, whilst in Australia the government has effectively strangled the renewable energy industry by refusing to extend the mandatory renewable energy targets. We have an Australian solar energy billionaire who made his money by investing in China. There is no capacity for him to do the same in Australia, and those jobs are being created in China. Just today, Roaring Forties announced that it will not proceed with its Heemskirk wind farm, blaming the government’s failure to expand MRET. Not dealing with climate change is costing Australia jobs and innovation.
As to uranium, a leadership role for Australia in global nonproliferation, global security and antiterrorism would be to see us decide to leave it in the ground. Apart from the danger of weapons and waste, the nuclear fuel cycle is dangerous, expensive and replete with uncosted externalities that the taxpayer will have to pay for. The budget papers themselves reveal that taxpayers already have to pay $7 million to clean up the Kakadu World Heritage area of abandoned uranium mines. Who will pay for the clean up if the current uranium mining speculation ever leads to new mines opening? As well, the budget statement of risks makes it clear that there is no way to cost the decommissioning of the Lucas Heights reactor. What does that say about the government’s assertion that nuclear power may become financially viable in Australia?
Rather than seeing Australia’s coal and uranium reserves as a competitive advantage, Australia needs to see them as a competitive disadvantage, because focusing on coal and uranium is blinding the government and the nation to risk and to the cause and consequences of climate change, and it is preventing investment in the innovative industries that will power this country. Dependence on natural resources will leave the nation vulnerable to resource depletion, new foreign sources and technological changes that reduce and eliminate resource needs. That is according to Michael Porter, a quite well-known economist.
Australia is being held back, jobs growth is being restricted and the nation’s ability to build a sophisticated economy, manufacturing base and tertiary sector is being constrained by the Howard government’s short-termism, intellectual laziness and indebtedness to the resource sector for its political support. To effectively capitalise on the opportunities inherent in the transition to a low-carbon economy which is knowledge, skills and service based, a massive injection of funds into education, research and training is needed.
Our children are our future, and if you had an eye to the future you would not reduce education spending as a proportion of government outlays, as has occurred in this budget. Would most Australians choose a tax cut if they realised that their children would have to borrow as much for their university fees as they had to borrow for their first home? The tax cuts could make tertiary education free again. In the Howard government’s values system, this is a lesser priority than increasing the ability to consume for people who are earning over $100,000.
In addition to putting further education beyond the reach of most Australians, the government has provided no extra funding for university research. We need that public interest research. We cannot rely on industry partnerships to deliver the science we need to address climate change and the public interest dimensions of the ethical dilemmas posed by the biotech and nanotech revolutions. The wealth of the country should be seen in its people and in its ability to capture creativity and innovation in adapting to changing global circumstances. In this context, we have to fund the arts.
Adaptation to changing global circumstances needs to be reflected in building a coherent society in which there is not a massive gap between the rich and the poor, in which women are given equal opportunity to participate and in which no child is kept behind razor wire. Conflict and antisocial behaviour occur when some in the community are left without hope, worthwhile work or provision for their old age while others benefit from tax cuts and superannuation advantages. What an opportunity we have missed to adequately fund primary health care from early childhood right through to old age! What an opportunity we have missed to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, and to provide support for people with disabilities and for carers!
The government may claim that the budget is in surplus, but what does that say about its values if the nation is deep in deficit, if its children are not properly cared for and if its Indigenous communities are forced to live in Third World conditions? If we cannot address Aboriginal disadvantage in an economic boom time, when can we address it?
Unlike the Howard government, the Greens’ vision for Australia and the values we hold mean we would not squander the surplus on a spending spree. We do not support the tax cuts or superannuation windfall for high-income earners. We would spend the $45 billion instead on fostering equity and high standards of education and public health and on accelerating the transition from a narrow resource based economy to a low-carbon economy with a strong innovative new industry and employment base. We would oil-proof the country and invest in energy security and adaptation to climate change. We would offer the leadership that Australia needs in the 21st century. Just as Tony Blair identified climate change and making poverty history as the themes of Britain’s leadership of the European Union and the G8 so, too, Australia should adopt climate change, renewable energy and energy efficiency as key themes for APEC in 2007. This would truly provide genuine leadership for the region.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,36,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-05-11,"—Ordinary Australian families will be grateful for whatever help they can get from this budget. At a time when they are battling with high petrol prices and an increase in interest rates, everything helps. But the fact is that ordinary Australian families have not got as much help out of this budget as they could have. For example, politicians have fared much better from the tax cuts than the average Australian. I will get a tax cut of about $66 a week. But somebody earning $50,000 or $60,000 will get a tax cut of just $10 a week. The government has also expanded access to the large family supplement. Parents with three children—and that includes my wife, Sue, and I—will now receive an extra $5 a week. But that does not do much to fill the car or pay the mortgage. And the Treasurer has to be kidding if he thinks $5 extra a week will encourage families to have more children.
The government claims this is a budget for families, but the big winners are the high-income earners. Can you believe that a single person earning $100,000 a year with no children gets twice as much as a two-income family on $100,000 with two children? I quote from an article in the Financial Review yesterday entitled ‘At last, it’s a win for the high income earners’. It said:
The changes mean the 2 per cent of taxpayers earning more than $150,000 next financial year and paying the top tax rate will save $6200 a year, or more than 12 times the $510 saving pocketed by average workers.
Another article in the Financial Review reveals:
Even a single person on $70,000 a year will receive $190 a year more in tax cuts than a dual-income family with two children on the same income which starts to lose family tax benefits once income reaches a certain level.
So much for putting families first.
Family First thinks there is a better way. For example, consider a two-income, two-child family. One wage earner is on $60,000 and the other is on $20,000. They have two cars—a Commodore and a Corolla—and they fill up the tanks with petrol once a week. If the government had adopted Family First’s plan to cut the petrol tax by 10c a litre, this family would have saved about $13 a week in its petrol bill alone. This petrol tax cut would have cost the government $3.8 billion. Instead, under the government’s plan, that family will get $16 a week in tax cuts. Yes, that is just $3 more out of the government’s package, but that will cost about $9 billion a year for the next four years. However, under Family First’s proposal, the family could have had the $13 extra a week, plus there would have been more than $5 billion left over for income tax cuts. Clearly, the average Australian family would have been better off under Family First’s plan.
Also, a cut in petrol taxes delivers three times the savings as a proportion of income to the poorest 20 per cent of households compared to the wealthiest 20 per cent. Taxing petrol is both regressive and inefficient. Whacking a tax on petrol penalises people in regional and rural areas in particular because it increases the cost of transport, encouraging people into metropolitan areas and increasing congestion. Some say petrol price rises are good for the environment. It is right to say that petrol prices should rise in response to demand to stimulate new investment in production of fuel alternatives, but petrol tax is not part of the price received by producers. Cutting tax does not affect the price petrol companies get. The petrol tax hits thousands of other prices and operates as an insidious tax on the basic living costs of ordinary families. And, perhaps more importantly, soaring petrol prices risk further interest rate rises.
The Prime Minister has admitted petrol prices are inflationary. But the Treasurer in his statement on tax reform still harks back to 2001—five years ago—which was the last time the government did anything to reduce petrol excise. Family First are disappointed the government still stubbornly refuses to cut petrol taxes, but we know the reason why. The budget confirms the government is drunk on petrol tax. Next financial year the government expects to reap $14 billion in tax from motorists, yet it continues to arrogantly ignore the petrol pain on families and small businesses. Perhaps politicians would be more understanding if they had to fork out for petrol themselves.
Turning to the big issue of child care, Family First is pleased that more families will receive family tax benefit A. But Family First wants the child-care rebate, which only goes to parents of children attending formal child care, to be replaced by an increased family tax benefit payment that goes to all parents with children under five. In other words, the government’s current policy is to only give the child-care rebate to those parents who can afford the high child-care fees and who want to put their children in professional child-care centres or other approved care. Instead, Family First’s proposal would mean that all parents are treated equally, regardless of whether they choose formal child care or have their children looked after by a relative, friend or neighbour. This is also an equity issue. For example, families on $60,000 a year receive $10,000 per child if they use formal child care but less than $2,000 if they use informal care or if they care for their children themselves. Clearly the government has a market-friendly policy, not a family-friendly policy. Parents are in the best position to decide who is best able to care for their children, and Family First’s policy would give them that choice. Families do benefit from this budget and will welcome it. But, for the average Australian family, this budget will not be the bonanza the government would like us all to believe it is.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-05-11,"—Today in the Mural Hall the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Julie Bishop MP, awarded the Australian Research Council’s Federation Fellowships to 25 world-class researchers. The Australian government will fund this program by $41.5 million over five years as part of its commitment to innovation, Backing Australia’s Ability. The research covers such matters as developing new drugs to combat mental illness; explosives detection; understanding Australian climate variability; developing polymers to improve quality of life for people with heart implants, neuromuscular disorders and spinal cord injuries; and identification of success and failure of peace building in the Pacific and Asia. This is not by any means a complete list, but it shows the sorts of research being undertaken in Australia.
The research of the 25 federation fellows consists of 24 per cent in the area of biological sciences and biochemistry and 24 per cent in the division of physics, chemistry and geoscience. The fellowships reflect the Australian government’s commitment to supporting excellence in research, attracting and retaining world-class Australian researchers in key positions and creating new rewards and incentives for the application of their talents in Australia.
I am told that unfortunately only eight per cent of applicants were women, a matter that I believe needs to be addressed. Maybe many professional women at that age are involved in child rearing, as 84 per cent of successful applicants were 40 years or older and many professional women delay having children until their late 30s.
Minister Julie Bishop in her address remarked that all of the fellows since 2003 were role models, as indeed they are. The challenge to me is to ensure that this role model status is conveyed to younger people. Perhaps one approach could be to make it mandatory for the lectures to be presented to undergraduates in the universities of these various fellows. An alternative could be for a booklet to be distributed to secondary school students to quicken their interest in research. This would require funding, perhaps through the Australian Research Council, which provides the federation fellowships, or the Department of Education, Science and Training.
The tax reforms announced this week will provide some encouragement for Australians with high skill levels and high incomes to stay in Australia and encourage others to return. Globalisation is very evident in the program, with much of the support staff for these researchers coming from distinguished universities around the world. Australia appears to be becoming increasingly attractive because of our university skills base. Perhaps cheaper airfares and phone charges are also factors in attracting the best of the world to our highly regarded Australian universities.
As a Tasmanian I welcomed the success of Professor Paul Haddad from the University of Tasmania in his research field of analytical chemistry. His project is: ‘Separation science based on nanoparticle-coated monolithic scaffold stationary phases’. His work will aim to generate new intellectual property with extremely high international commercial potential.
