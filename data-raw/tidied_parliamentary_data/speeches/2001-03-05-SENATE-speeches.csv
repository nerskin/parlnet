"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-03-05,"—In continuation, there are failings both of principle and practicality which should condemn this legislation. I think they deserve a quick revisit before the final vote on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies) Bill 2000. With respect to principle, the propensity for this government to intrude into judicial processes, particularly when the subject matter is industrial, has been well established, but for some years now the Senate has acted as a safety net against this propensity.
This proposal is a return to the worst tendencies of the coalition. It takes an issue that has been extensively and, by all perspectives, effectively dealt with by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The proposal interposes onto the determination of that commission a legislative determination. It is just bad legislative practice. It is not the job of the legislature to pick the winners and the losers in individual cases; it is its job to set up the rules, which apply to all equally. It is the job of the courts and the tribunals to determine the winners and losers in those individual cases. That is one of the central precepts of the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary.
Secondly, this bill establishes a very bad precedent in the context of this act. This government has a well-established desire to wreak havoc on unions in certain industries. The waterfront, construction and mining industries spring to mind immediately. It is a bad day in industrial relations in this country when the Australian Democrats give comfort and support to the government's desire, as they have done with this bill. For the first time we will determine in the legislation what can be included in an award that applies to a certain industry. Why not in the future, if we go to the award allowable matters? Let us, for instance, pick item 89A(2)(p): dispute settling procedures. Why not in the future have `dispute procedures other than in the maritime industry', as the government's view on how to deal with disputes in the maritime sector is clearly a matter of public record?
Alternatively, let us look at 89A(2)(l): penalty rates. Why not in the future have `allowable matters with respect to penalty rates other than in the pastoral sector', if we want to please the NFF? If we want to pick up issues that are being raised with respect to Victoria, and if there are concerns about how an industrial system can be introduced to protect the rights of Victorian workers, why not have a federal allowable award matter that could be called `penalty rates other than in the Victorian hospitality sector'? Why not have these things, if the Democrats are prepared to go down this path, with respect to the meat industry? If this is seen at some future time as the start of a practice of differentiating between the treatment of some industries, let there be no doubt who is responsible—this is a step that the Australian Democrats have taken with the government.
From a practical perspective, this is simply confusing and bad legislation. The primary cause of the problem in this legislation is that of definition. As was pointed out by Senator Cooney, Senator Ludwig and me in the committee stage debate, the Democrat amendments do not resolve the question of whether this provision will be limited to tallies in the meat industry. Indeed they invite the conclusion that the provision will have wider application. I challenged the minister representing the minister for industrial relations to confirm before the Senate that there were other industries that use tallies. On at least three occasions, I asked the minister to tell us that the department had discovered tallies in other awards and how it differentiates between those other than the meat industry, but these requests were ignored on each occasion.
The other major practical criticism is related to the meat industry. This provision will prevent them from using tallies, but even we cannot define exactly what we are preventing them from using. The definition of `tally' is unclear, and the minister could not indicate in the committee stage debate whether the notion of a tally in the meat industry was consistent across all meat industry awards. The definition of incentive based payments is also unclear. In a real sense, we do not know exactly what effect this provision will have on the future of that industry. This issue is most illustratively addressed in an exchange between Senator Murray and Senator Cooney that begins on page 22192 of the Hansard and continues onto the following page. 
I will not canvass the issue extensively here except to say this: Senator Cooney is a person whose opinions on matters of statutory interpretation should hold some sway in this place, given his expertise in this area. As Senator Cooney pointed out in his contribution during the second reading, there is a great deal of misplaced optimism in the Democrats' expectation of how this provision will be interpreted in the future. So, despite the assertions of Senator Murray, it is clear we are replacing the logical and effective process managed by the commission, which is informed on all these issues, with a legislative hotchpotch of unknown effect. The Labor Party will be opposing this bill in the third reading, and I urge rejection of it by the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TALLIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Third Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-03-05,"—I want to deal briefly with some remarks made by Senator Jacinta Collins in a media released dated Thursday, 1 March 2001. If the media release were part of the Senate record, it would have misrepresented a position. But, since it is not part of the Senate record and is part of the public record, I think I must deal with it. The media release is headed `Meg's still doin' the deals'. The coalition have every right to be extremely angry with Senator Meg Lees and Senator Andrew Murray, because we will not do deals with them. In the last five years, two bills in the area of industrial relations were passed in 1996 and 1997 by the government and the Australian Democrats. The first bill was a major reform of Labor's 1993 major reform and the second bill in 1997 was a technical bill. In both those instances the negotiations were led by Labor's Cheryl Kernot. The Labor Party are so cross with the member for Dickson, Cheryl Kernot, that they have rewarded her with a senior shadow portfolio and, if the Labor Party win the election, they are going to reward her with a senior ministerial post. I do not think Senator Collins is even going to get a look-in on the front bench, never mind a senior ministerial post. So the Labor Party are so upset about the 1996 act that they are going to reward Cheryl Kernot as a result. Those two bills were the first of four workplace relations bills passed in this place since 1996. 
Since Senator Meg Lees became Leader of the Australian Democrats this is the first bill which will actually pass. The other bill, with the passing of junior rates, was a disgraceful abrogation of Labor's responsibilities. That was a deal the Labor Party did with Minister Peter Reith. This bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies) Bill 2000, is the only IR bill that Senator Lees and the party room of the Democrats have let through—after major amendment. So `Meg's still doin' the deals' on IR is simply wrong and is a grotesque and dishonest attempt to capitalise on a public perception which has been deliberately whipped up by many in the media and by the Labor Party. In fact, for the record, neither Senator Lees nor I met with Minister Peter Reith or Minister Tony Abbott to discuss the amendments that we put before this chamber. I will repeat that: neither Senator Lees nor I met with Minister Peter Reith or Minister Tony Abbott or discussed on the telephone or in any other way the amendments that we put before the Senate.
However, we did discuss the amendments with Arch Bevis, the Labor Party's shadow minister in this area. In fact, of our five amendments, you will discover that Labor as well as the coalition supported four of them. Labor have their fingers all over this bill. What is more, we supported two out of three of their amendments. So, to use a common Labor phrase, it is a pretty grubby exercise, Senator Collins, and a very disappointing one. The press release of 1 March 2001 said:  
Senator Jacinta Collins, the Labor Party's spokesperson for Industrial Relations in the Senate, condemned the Democrat deal with the Government to pass the Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000. 
Senator Collins does not indicate that, in fact, it is no longer the Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000, because we have excised picnic days from it. I noticed we got no kiss for that on the way through. Senator Collins then goes on in the press release to describe the bill:
... as having implications that are much broader than just tallies in the meat industry. 
That is quite right. We have agreed in the Senate that incentive based payments replace tallies in the act and have considerably enlarged the ability of employees and employers to introduce workplace results based payments into agreements. They are much broader and much better as a result. We have been criticised for excluding the meat industry from the tallies process, and we have dealt with that at length in the debate. Anyone who reads only this section should look at that. But the fact is that meat industry workers will have access to incentive based payments under this regime. Senator Collins says that we have played footsy with the coalition on key industrial principles. Well, we have not. She then goes on to say:
 Both Democrat supporters—
I was not aware that Senator Collins was in close touch with them, but anyway—
and all Australian workers look forward to the Democrat's leadership ballot for a change in their direction.
What I really think this means is that Senator Collins hopes that Senator Lees loses the leadership ballot. I know the Labor Party to be a tough and very capable political party. Having strong Democrats is not remotely in their interests and never has been. If they could reduce our vote by whatever means, they would do so. What they are actually saying here is that they would like to see Senator Lees go because, if she goes, it will weaken our vote and our support. This is a very unwise thing to say, given that both your leader and your deputy leader have been very careful to stay out of that debate, because of the wrong approach it would indicate.
When you are pointing the finger without addressing the facts, Senator Collins, I will give you this word of caution: if you want to attack us on policy, do so; you are quite right to do so because, if you have a different view to us, that is fair enough and you should do so; it is your duty to do so. However, do not impute motives or circumstances to us which are untrue. I believe that many members of the Labor Party side of the Senate are very honourable people and I have affection for a number of them. But there are others who simply see themselves as representatives of their union. I am suggesting that they see themselves as representatives not of the ACTU but of their own union, and they take direct instructions from them.
Without embarrassing the senator concerned, I will say to you that I was once trusting enough to say to a Labor senator, a senior spokesperson in this field, who asked me what my position was going to be on a bill, `Well, it's going to be like this, and we'll see how it pans out'. Within five minutes as I sat at my chamber desk, a phone call came from my office upstairs. The little light shone and I picked up the phone and I was told that they had just had a phone call from the union about the matter. So a senator dealing with a bill from the Labor side on legislation could not wait to ring up their boss and say, `Hey, boss, this is what's going on.'
I have never ever had that situation from a coalition senator with their business connections. The coalition is often challenged for their business connections, but I have never had that experience, despite dealing with just about every business bill that comes through this place. But I have had that experience with a Labor senator. It is not true to say that all Labor senators are of that connection, but it is true to say that some are simply representatives of their union here, and that has been my experience and I recount that example to illustrate it.
Senator Collins, when you say, `Meg is still doing the deals,' when she is not, you should be very careful and cautious, because there are members of your party who are directly, indisputably, just the representatives of their union in these matters—not in all matters but in these matters—and who do their bidding, which I think is entirely wrong and against the spirit of what being a senator means. If from those remarks you can gather I am annoyed about your press release, you are right; and if my putting it on the record means that maybe I have corrected your press release, you are right. If you want to attack me for the amendments you oppose, do so; but do not impute to Senator Meg Lees that she did a deal on this issue—because the fact is that she did not.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-03-05,"—Mr Temporary Chairman—(Quorum formed). We were last week, and we are now, dealing with an amendment by Senator Lees to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000 [2001] to remove the absolutely necessary protections that are given to women and to the general public in Australia in respect of the importation of the abortion drug RU486. The history of the attempts by the abortion industry and others to get this drug into Australia required those protections, which Senator Lees, on behalf of the Democrats—or maybe she is not talking on behalf of the Democrats—is attempting to remove now.
It is important for us to understand the background of this matter. The backdoor importation and trialling of RU486 in Australia in 1994 brought to light the inadequacy of the system of ethical evaluation and trial monitoring in Australia—and, of course, recently we have had that situation brought to our attention in the media again. Abortion drugs have always been prohibited imports, unless exempted therefrom by the department of health. Governments of both sides, as far back as 1988, had given an undertaking to the parliament that they would not allow such an exemption without the involvement and consultation of the health minister. Yet the then minister, Senator Richardson, knew nothing at all of the backdoor importation and the trials that were approved by a nameless bureaucrat in the health department. That official approved importation of the drug for three trials to be conducted by Family Planning New South Wales and Family Planning Victoria. Senator Richardson was told some time later, and agreed in the Senate, that undertakings had been breached, and he expressed his intention to rectify matters. Soon after that, he resigned from parliament.
RU486 was trialled in Australia in 1994. The trials were part of a multicountry trial, sponsored by the Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction—that is, the HRP program—which is co-sponsored by the World Bank and the United Nations Population Fund, amongst others. There were many flaws in these trials. For example, the consent forms that were supposed to inform women of the risks made no mention at all of cardiovascular risks; no mention was given at all that, if the medical abortion did not work, gross birth defects were likely, with a surgical abortion being the outcome. The then health minister, Carmen Lawrence, who took over from Senator Graham Richardson, suspended the trials and ordered that the Family Planning Association come up with informed consent forms which were really that; and acting departmental secretary, Alan Bansemer, threatened to stop those trials, in the public interest.
A review was held also into the functions of the institutional ethics committees that had approved the trials. For example, Family Planning New South Wales Ethics Committee approved its own organisation's trial. In other words, those approving the trial were the ones actually running the trial. The lack of independent control over human drug experimentation, including experiments with RU486, was exposed in a series of articles by Margo Kingston in the Sydney Morning Herald. That journalist wrote: 
... private ethics committees attached to research bodies—with memberships that aren't even cleared by Government—simply sign off a promise that everything is fine.
I might interpose here that the history of CJD shows what can happen when governments take a hands-off approach to drug trials. It seems that, in this area of fertility and infertility, such does apply. I will be happy to expand on this later in the committee and tell you who was who in respect of that CJD matter. Madam Temporary Chairman Crowley, I see that you are in the chair. You will recall that the Allars report went to your committee, and you made certain very strong recommendations thereon.
The backdoor importation of the drug—that is, RU486—and the flawed consent process and incestuous way the trials were approved by Family Planning's own ethics committee highlighted the unacceptable way that hazardous drugs are allowed to be trialled in Australia. There is a false perception that the Therapeutic Goods Administration thoroughly assessed the quality, safety and efficiency of the drug prior to its trial. This was not, and in the future would not be, correct. The only role of the TGA was to issue a receipt after payment of the trial application fee.
In Senate estimates committee hearings at the time, health department officials admitted that the new clinical trial notification scheme, which came into effect in 1991, was a system that was just a `postbox receipt operation'—that was a statement by a department of health official to the Senate estimates committee. Ethical and legal evaluation and approval from the department were no longer required. The department knew nothing of the trials or how they were conducted. Shouldn't this be of concern to us here, and shouldn't these health issues be of concern to us here?
RU486 has serious, well-documented ill effects: heart attack, bleeding requiring transfusion, uterine rupture, vomiting and diarrhoea. It can even kill. Women considering using the drug are advised to live within close range of a fully equipped medical facility. The French minister for health instructed that the drug must be given `under strict medical supervision' and doctors must have ECG and resuscitation equipment available. Then there are the potential lasting effects on cervical and uterine tissue. RU486 has been found in the egg follicles of its recipients, raising questions about future fertility and the health of subsequent children. The prostaglandins used with RU486 to cause uterine contractions to expel the foetus can permanently damage the immune system.
While its advocates have promoted RU486 as a do-it-yourself demedicalised abortion, it requires up to five visits to a specialist centre and taking up to five drug combinations. Prominent women's health academic Dr—now Professor—Renate Klein, in a critical book written on RU486, stated:
There appears to be an unquestioning acceptance that RU486/PG de-medicalises abortion, whereas the reality ... is that it ... more thoroughly medicalises the abortion experience for women ... given the media hype and the lack of independent research on RU486/PG, most women taking the drug are not informed and consent is relatively meaningless.
On its own, RU486 has a 20 to 40 per cent failure rate, which is why it is most often used in conjunction with a prostaglandin. But even this combination fails to work in five per cent of the cases. This means one woman in 20 who uses the drug will also undergo a surgical abortion.
Because of the poor success rate of RU486 when used on its own, a second drug, misoprostol, a prostaglandin, is used with RU486 to expel the foetus. Drug company Serle was unable to prevent the use of its ulcer destroying drug misoprostol—which is contra-indicated in pregnancy—being combined with RU486 in the Family Planning Association Victoria trial. Recently Serle told the US Food and Drug Administration that misuse of the drug can cause adverse effects such as ruptured uterus, vaginal bleeding, uterine hyperstimulation, rupture or perforation, shock, foetal bradycardia—low heart rate and pulse—pelvic pain and maternal or foetal death. Serle said:
Cytotec (misoprostol) is not approved for the induction of labour or abortion. 
A first person account of the risks of misoprostol was given in an article titled `An insider's story: The abortion pill has a darker side' by Laurel Guymer in the Sunday Age of 5 November 2000.
There are many people in this chamber concerned about human rights violations in China. This country, the PRC, which demonstrates its respect for women's human rights issues through forced sterilisation, forced abortion, forced IUD insertion and a one-child policy that results in female foeticide and infanticide, is manufacturing the drug RU486 for the US market. May I remind the chamber that China is also known as a major exporter of impure drugs. Here we have the Democrats wanting to remove the sorts of regulations we have in place for dangerous abortifacient drugs like RU486.
The importation, trial, registration and marketing of abortifacients raise major public health and policy issues and should not be left in the hands of bureaucrats or multinational drug companies or medical technologists. The Senate agreed in 1996 that there should be ministerial responsibility, subject to effective parliamentary scrutiny, and I urge the Senate not to back down on its commitment to accountability and scrutiny today.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-03-05,"—Obviously, Senator Harradine's opposition to the rights of women to choose is well documented. I respect his very firmly held convictions. However, the issue is that in all states of Australia, with differing rules, women do have some right—and in some states the right—to choose to determine whether or not they are able to continue with a pregnancy.
I note from Senator Harradine's reading into Hansard of letters and comments, both last week and again today, that by and large these letters are four, five, eight and more years old. We have come a long way since Senator Richardson was with us and the debate of that time where there were some quite serious concerns about this drug and how it worked. There were concerns about the risks to women. Since then there have been trials internationally looking at all of these concerns. What has been found is that there still are some question marks and women obviously need the full information that is available as to what the specific risks are in relation to different conditions that they may need to keep aware of. However, if we look at the outcomes of various trials around the world we see that, while there are some risks with this drug, the risks are even greater if you move to surgical abortion—in fact, pregnancy itself carries a risk greater than it seems this drug does.
One of the other risks that people are not talking about is the fact that currently in Australia, when women go to their doctors with concerns about a pregnancy that is not wanted, a mix of other drugs are being used. A raft of different drugs, some of which have absolutely no relevance whatsoever to anything vaguely related to pregnancy, are being used. My office was contacted just today by a doctor who provides terminations and who is very concerned about what is happening and the mix of other drugs that is being used. She wanted us to know that women are resorting to using untested and less safe drugs because they cannot get hold of RU486 in this country. She knows of doctors around Australia who are already providing abortions using a drug that is supposed to be and directed to be used for arthritis, but these doctors are using it, in her term, `off label' to provide their patients with medical abortions. Her concerns are that the use of this mix of other drugs and specific drugs that are intended for other purposes is far riskier than any trials of RU486 have found. She basically wanted me to stress that, rather than the drug RU486 itself being a risk, women are actually exposing themselves to unnecessary risks because the drug is not available.
Since this original debate was had and concerns were expressed back in 1994, a raft of countries have determined that women are able to have that choice, and I will just list a few of them: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, China, Israel, Russia and the US, which is one of the latest ones. New Zealand is due and there are a raft of countries still looking at it. In other words, Australian women are being very much isolated when it comes to the availability of this alternative. 
I think it is quite wrong of Senator Harradine to link this in any way with CJD. All of us who were involved in that committee process found that there were major issues and concerns, some of which have been dealt with and some of which are still very much alive. This is a separate issue. It is a safety issue. It is an issue very much for Australian women. I will simply say to the women in this parliament that, even if on this occasion we lose yet again, this issue is not going to go away. Time and time again, we are going to have to face the fact that we are denying Australian women a drug that is widely available in the rest of the world, a drug with fewer side effects than the alternatives that are being used, far fewer side effects than the surgical option. So I say, particularly to the women in the Labor Party: where are you now? We need to get this resolved for the health of Australia's women.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harradine, Senator Brian",IND,2001-03-05,"—I do not appreciate and I do not think the chamber would appreciate Senator Lees's condescending remarks about my views, seeing she was obviously not listening to what I said and not heeding the history. She said that my arguments were all past history and that the letters I referred to from very well known people in the women's movement were six years old, four years old or whatever she said. I actually referred to a recent article in the Age newspaper about this very matter from one of those women.
One of the things that must cause concern to those who believe in regulation is the fact that, in this particular area, there always seems to be an action taken to achieve an objective without the proper scrutiny along the way. Yes, all right, CJD is a different matter, but not quite, is it? Because who was running the Victorian Family Planning trial of RU486? None other than the doctor who was implicated in the fertility treatment in which women were injected with the extract from the pituitary glands of a cadaver, resulting in CJD. We do have to be very, very careful in these matters, and there is a history of this matter. It is very interesting that, because of a fear of litigation and so forth, the American drug companies are not prepared to manufacture the drug but are getting a company in the PRC, China, to do the dirty work for them.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-05,"—I rise to speak on the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 2000 [2001]. This bill facilitates the establishment of a national DNA database system and introduces Commonwealth legislation for the taking of forensic materials in relation to a Commonwealth offence, which is complemented by legislation in each state for the taking of forensic material relating to state offences.
The existing forensic procedures provisions in part 1D of the Crimes Act provide powers and procedures for the taking and for the use of forensic material from anyone suspected of having committed a Commonwealth offence. It was always intended that part 1D be an initial step in establishing a national forensic material collection system and a national DNA database. This intention is realised in this bill—the bill that we are discussing today—which extends part 1D to include convicted offenders and volunteers and establishes the procedures for the operation of the national database.
This bill follows from and closely mirrors the February 2000 Model Criminal Code Officers Committee paper entitled `Model forensic procedures bill and the proposed national DNA database'. It was developed following a review of similar legislation in Canada, the UK, the USA, New Zealand and various European countries. It has been drafted in good faith and with wide consultation and contains a number of provisions which are intended to address civil liberties concerns arising from the sorts of operations we are talking about in this bill. It has also been widely accepted that a national DNA database will be an invaluable tool for law enforcement. 
Having said all that, the opposition are acutely aware that there are real concerns in the community relating to the concept of taking and storing forensic material, the uses to which a DNA database may be put and the adequacy of civil liberties protections. We have been very insistent that, in supporting the establishment of this database, we must also ensure that as much as possible is done to minimise the possibilities of misuse and to protect basic civil liberties. With these concerns in mind, this bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. This process allowed all concerned groups to raise their concerns with the committee and allowed for detailed scrutiny of the drafting of the bill. As a consequence of that committee's deliberations, we were presented with a unanimous report which made a number of recommendations relating to drafting amendments and to strengthening the oversight role of the federal Privacy Commissioner. With our support, the government will be moving amendments which address these recommendations.
The most significant concern identified by the committee was the lack of uniform legislation governing the collection, use, storage and destruction of forensic material in participating state jurisdictions. This was identified as having the potential to undermine the safeguards which will be put in place in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. At the present time, for instance, the only jurisdictions which have legislation which is not inconsistent with the Commonwealth legislation are Queensland and the Northern Territory. The government will be moving amendments which will increase the oversight role of the federal Privacy Commissioner to include the effectiveness of independent oversight and accountability mechanisms for the DNA database system. As far as we are concerned, there must be an independent review of the DNA database system one year after its establishment.
We anticipate and will require that this review will take into account the effect, if any, of the existence of state legislation which is not consistent with the Commonwealth legislation. We also believe that the review should cover the retention of material on the database, provisions for its destruction and the oversight and functioning of the DNA database within the laboratory. With the addition of these and further drafting amendments which we believe will be moved by the government, we anticipate that the bill will encompass adequately the concerns that we have about the safeguards and oversight mechanisms.
It must also be said that this bill contains a number of amendments which do not relate to the DNA database and which are supported by the opposition. The bill outlines rules applicable to the situation where a Commonwealth law relating to criminal matters confers on state and territory judges, magistrates or other court employed officers a function or power that is neither judicial nor incidental to a judicial function or power, and it clarifies that a foreign restraining order, once registered in an Australian court, will take effect as if it were an order in the form of a restraining order made under domestic law. These two further amendments go towards facilitating mutual assistance in criminal matters, and they are also supported by the opposition. At this stage, in anticipation of the amendments to be moved by the government, we indicate in principle support for the bill.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (FORENSIC PROCEDURES) BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-03-05,"—The Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 2000 [2001] establishes a national DNA database to assist in crime control. It also empowers authorities to take DNA samples from suspects, offenders and volunteers in various circumstances. DNA technology has a great deal to offer law enforcement agencies. Early evidence from various jurisdictions that have begun to routinely use DNA in police investigations indicates that this technology has the potential to make a terrific contribution to effective policing. The Democrats do not object in principle to the development of a national DNA database, nor do we oppose allowing authorities to compel certain people in certain circumstances to provide DNA samples. In broad terms, we support the use of new technologies to assist in crime control. However, we must recognise that there are dangers associated with the use of this technology in law enforcement, as is the case to varying degrees with all police powers. 
The Democrats are concerned that the government has not provided adequate safeguards in this legislation to protect the privacy and civil liberties of Australian citizens. Criminal activities should be investigated aggressively, but the methods employed by the state must comply with the basic standards of human rights and individual privacy. Crucially, the observance of these standards must be mandatory. This bill fails to meet this fundamental requirement, because it adopts a lowest common denominator approach to data sharing between jurisdictions. The effect of this, as expressed by the New South Wales Privacy Commissioner, is:
... to allow the Commonwealth or any State or Territory to avoid the restrictions on access or use if this is authorised by legislation in the jurisdiction placing the data on the National Database.
This would not be a problem if we had a uniform scheme with identical safeguards in each jurisdiction. Indeed, the model bill on which the bill currently before us today is based was premised upon the assumption that a uniform legislative approach would be taken throughout Australia relating to the collection and use of forensic material. What has happened instead has been worrying. Again, in the words of the New South Wales Privacy Commissioner:
... there has been something of a bidding war between some States and Territories, encouraged by their Police Commissioners and by a desire to appear “tough on crime”, to minimise and downgrade the recommended protective provisions. This is likely to create a political climate where governments will face renewed pressure to do away with the remaining safeguards, leaving police with virtually unrestricted access to the DNA database for matching and identification purposes.
The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee did foresee the possibility that national uniformity might not be achieved. It recommended that if this did occur material collected in one jurisdiction should be prohibited from being used in another jurisdiction where its collection would have been illegal. For example, a state or territory might have its own legislation which gives the police a very wide discretion to compel people, on whatever grounds they deem appropriate, to provide DNA samples. The police might then target certain groups, round them up and force them to give samples for entry onto the DNA database. No doubt the usual groups would be targeted in such a scenario. Even if this practice contravened the safeguards relating to DNA collection in every other jurisdiction in Australia, under this bill the information could still be entered onto the national database and could ultimately be used in criminal proceedings in a jurisdiction where its collection would have been illegal. This would seem to suggest that the government's priorities lie in areas other than ensuring compliance with the safeguards proposed by this bill.
The fundamental issue here is whether we are going to pass legislation that acquiesces in the taking and use of DNA material inconsistently with basic standards of privacy and human rights and allows that information to be used against a person. The provisions of this bill will allow data sharing between jurisdictions even if the information is obtained under draconian laws in violation of basic civil liberties. The minister asks us to trust that the government will continue to strive for better standards in those states and territories that have unsatisfactory laws. He asks us to allow the government blanket access to all DNA collected by the police in all jurisdictions regardless of the manner in which it is collected. The government  wants to then put that information on the national DNA database for use in all jurisdictions. The undertaking from the government is that if we grant it this power it will stand up to those states and territories on the privacy, human rights and civil liberties issues that need to be pursued. 
The question is: once we give the government the powers it desires, can we trust it to then stand up to the states on these issues? This government has shown a disturbing tendency to ignore human rights issues. It has slashed the funding to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It has recently attempted to dismantle the institutions of administrative review that protect the rights of thousands of Australians. Had the Democrats not blocked the government's legislation in the Senate last week, that dismantling would have gone ahead. This government's handling of the mandatory sentencing issue has led to condemnation within Australia and international condemnation of Australia. This government acquiesced in appalling practices in relation to juvenile offenders in the Northern Territory. It showed a total unwillingness to stand up to the recalcitrant states and territories on that particular human rights issue, and yet we are now told that once we give the government power to use DNA obtained in violation of basic privacy and human rights standards it can be trusted to vigorously pursue those violations by states and territories.
I am reluctant to accept that. I will be moving amendments to prevent the Commonwealth from retaining information that is obtained in violation of the safeguards in the proposed Commonwealth legislation. The Commonwealth should not be prepared to use this information for its own purposes, nor should it be prepared to put it on the national DNA database for use throughout Australia. Ultimately, we must insist that certain safeguards be observed in relation to the taking and use of forensic material. I would make the point that this prohibition does not apply to forensic material obtained by a state or territory authority that breaches the safeguards in a minor or technical way. We are talking here about substantive violations of the safeguards laid down in this bill. Such violations should not be permitted.
Furthermore, if the government can use only information properly obtained, there is an ongoing incentive for the government to put pressure on state and territory governments that do not meet the basic standards set by the Commonwealth. Frankly, the government's human rights record does not inspire confidence in the level of dedication they are now likely to show in pursuing these issues without these Democrats amendments.
I will also move an amendment to give defendants the right to have DNA evidence offered by the prosecution independently analysed. In a recent article, High Court Justice Michael Kirby stated:
Suspects should be granted supervised access to independent scientific scrutiny of DNA samples alleged to relate to them. It is important that the relevant experts should not be entirely employed by the state. Simply because a result is produced by an expert or a machine is no reason to accept it without further questioning the applicability, accuracy and reliability of the result.
The Democrats concur with this sentiment and will offer our amendment to give it a legislative foundation. We hope that the opportunity for independent analysis of DNA evidence would be extended by a court to any accused person. This amendment expressly provides for such an opportunity and thus guarantees that DNA evidence can be subject to proper independent scrutiny.
We are also concerned to ensure that there is sufficient ongoing scrutiny of the national database and activities related to it. We need to ensure that the processes relating to the retention and destruction of forensic material meet the standards expected of them. We must ensure that the administration of the DNA database is both open and accountable. I note the review arrangements that are now already in place under this legislation, and welcome the amendments moved by the government to enhance the expertise of the independent review committee. 
The Democrats offer a further amendment to require this review process to specifically address two things. Firstly, the review should address the disparities in practices relating to the collection and use of DNA information in various jurisdictions. In a national scheme, it is not enough to ensure that only the Commonwealth is conducting itself appropriately. We would be remiss if we did not insist that there be some analysis of the schemes operating in all of the participating jurisdictions. Secondly, I am moving an amendment to specifically require the statutory review to address any issues relating to privacy or civil liberties that may arise out of the new national DNA scheme. We consider that this amendment is necessary to focus the review in such a way as to ensure that the scheme is not only scrutinised from the standpoint of efficiency but also measured against standards of liberty and basic rights. 
In summary, while the Democrats support the use of new tools to assist in crime control, we are genuinely concerned to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to address the concerns that exist in the community over the possible misuse of DNA technology. The amendments we offer reflect these concerns, and contribute to a regime that better protects privacy and civil liberties, while still permitting the effective use of this technology in the fight against crime.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (FORENSIC PROCEDURES) BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-03-05,"—I rise to speak in support of the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 2000 [2001]. In the second reading speech, we were told that the bill is to ensure that police enforcing federal criminal offences can use the latest technology to solve crime. DNA technology has opened up a new era in criminal investigation. The two major developments that have occurred which revolve around this bill are CrimTrac—which is, perhaps, best described as a relational database with indices which allow multiple searching—and amendments to the Crimes Act 1914, to provide for comprehensive procedures in relation to taking forensic material from anyone suspected of having committed a Commonwealth offence.
Two developments will start to flow from the use of the database and the collection of DNA for matching purposes. Firstly, the ability to solve crime should be enhanced, and it will aid in reducing the suspects list. As an explanation for that, we were told in the inquiry of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that one of the benefits that might flow from the use of the DNA database and CrimTrac is that suspects can eliminate themselves from the process by volunteering for their DNA to be data matched to ensure that they were not at the scene of the crime or part of the area that the police are investigating. Secondly, the amendment will provide a framework for providing a system that will have appropriate safeguards. Senator Greig went to some of those issues, and I think his amendments will go some way in progressing those safeguards even a little bit further to ensure that the balance is struck. It is a fair balance between ensuring that there are appropriate safeguards and ensuring that the police enforcing powers are sufficiently tough to ensure that the system does work.
This bill is drawn from a draft model forensic procedures bill, which was—as I understand it—first developed after some five years of consultation. I am informed that the bill reflects the consideration that has been accorded to that wide group of persons and organisations who were consulted. The group includes the federal and New South Wales privacy commissioners, law enforcement agencies, forensic experts, academics, law societies, various non-government organisations and government departments. In these types of bills, there is always a tension—and I think Senator Greig also highlighted the tension that exists—between, on the one hand, ensuring that the appropriate safeguards are put in place for the citizen and, on the other hand, ensuring that fairness is also accorded to the people who will deal with the legislation and who might be convicted as a consequence of the legislation.
Where DNA technology is to be utilised, a regime must be put in place that will accomplish twin goals to ensure fairness overall to all parties who may be impacted upon: firstly, to ensure that the technology is used for its intended purpose; and, secondly, to ensure that individual freedoms are not unduly trammelled. Labor believes this bill endeavours to get that balance right. Where such technology is used, it is necessary to have adequate accountability requirements imposed on the administrators of the scheme.
The bill also establishes procedures in respect of convicted offenders and for volunteers. Those two areas are taken separately in the bill, as of course they should be. The bill aims to accomplish a couple of broad goals, and it tries to balance those broad goals. In drafting an amendment one finds sometimes that trying to distil those areas can be a little troublesome, and you have to rely in part on the procedures and practices developed by the administrators. I think that the independent review, which I think the committee recommended, will have a role to play in ensuring that, in balancing the various interests within the amending bill, the administrators get it right or at least have the facility to correct things if there is any skew to the left or to the right. The use of any forensic material that is taken and stored on a national database is an area that has created some controversy, because it will be created and kept for probably as long as my lifetime, if not longer, and the uses to which it can be put are varied and interesting in the extreme. During the hearings of another committee, I had an opportunity to have a look at the forensic laboratory. It was extremely interesting to see the rigorous testing undertaken and the processes in place to ensure that these things are done according to the appropriate procedures. 
As I understand it, this amendment to forensic procedures bill is designed to complement the existing provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 that are there to give due regard to the rights of suspects as balanced against the interests of the public in gathering evidence for criminal investigations. To put it in context, the amendment proposes to provide a legislative scheme that has a couple of elements: it provides for the conduct of forensic procedures on certain convicted offenders and on volunteers and non-suspects; and, as I said earlier, it provides for the national DNA database. Presently, federal forensic procedures are governed by the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Act 1998, which inserted part 1D into the Crimes Act, the principal act.
Presently, states and territories have forensic procedures in place. The best way to explain it is that the various states and territories have been looking at this for some time and they have developed their own procedures to deal with the collection and storage of forensic material, or DNA in this instance. Hopefully, they have also been following quite closely the 1995 draft of the bill. To use a particular case in point, in Queensland the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 enables forensic procedures to be carried out on certain persons, such as suspects, volunteers and serving prisoners. A DNA database has been established that enables information obtained as a result of the DNA analysis to be recorded on a national DNA database. So it effectively allows for the development and transfer of that collected material or information to a national DNA database.
Since that time, the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, the MCCOC—acronyms abound in this area—has provided a discussion paper entitled `Model forensic procedures'. In that paper, released in February 2000, the matter of how the proposed national DNA database would appear was visited. So what we have seen is a slow development—from around 1995—of the legislative scheme, with various states and territories picking up the procedures and working towards bringing together a national approach to a DNA database. The Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 2000 [2001] has drawn support in the latest discussion paper and from the earlier work preceding it—from as early as 1995—and, of course, it has drawn heavily from the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee itself. It will provide for a scheme that will move towards a model for allowing states and territories to ensure they have some uniformity in their approach. At the moment it seems states and territories have their own procedures, and the Commonwealth is implementing an amending bill to bring about a national DNA database. Once the ball starts rolling, the usage and usefulness of the information will, hopefully, drive towards uniformity. It should be understood that DNA profiling is an important tool in the investigation of crime; however, it is not infallible. Law enforcement bodies will have a new piece of kit but it will not replace police work, investigation and crime prevention. It will be useful in establishing innocence and eliminating suspects as well as in assisting the clearing up of unsolved crimes.
I want to turn now to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which considered the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 2000 [2001]. I was fortunate enough to be a participating member on that committee and was provided with some insight into this particular area. The committee examined similar legislation in October 1995; however, that bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued for the 1996 general election. The committee held a public hearing in Canberra on 10 November 2000 to deal with the new bill, and I wish to take this opportunity to thank the secretariat and others who assisted the committee. The recommendations flowing from that hearing were relatively few, but recommendation 4 is worth recording. It states: 
The Committee recommends an expansion of the role of the Federal Privacy Commissioner to include: oversight of the processes governing the retention of material on the DNA database; provisions for its destruction; oversight of the functioning of the new DNA database within the laboratory; and the operation of the database under the Bill.
As was highlighted during earlier speeches in this debate, including my own, there is a need to strike a balance between the need to ensure that people have adequate safeguards and the need to solve crimes. The summary and recommendations of the committee acknowledge the efforts made over a long period of time by law enforcement agencies, civil libertarian organisations, privacy bodies, and other interested individuals and organisations, to reach agreement in respect of this legislation. There has been a desire on the part of all the participants in the process to find a balance in the legislation between protecting the rights and privacy of individuals—particularly those who volunteer their DNA or who provide forensic samples to eliminate themselves from lines of inquiry—and ensuring that the police have at their disposal a powerful investigative tool and a national database. The bill, together with the amendments that have been put forward by the government, creates at least a good start to finding that balance. I refer particularly to the independent review that I spoke about earlier. 
In conclusion, the summary and recommendations of the committee sum up where the committee got to with respect to this bill. A great number of concerns were brought to the committee's attention relating to what witnesses perceived as inadequate safeguards for people, particularly volunteers who might be required to provide forensic samples, and inadequate procedures governing the disposal of forensic material. In the final analysis, the committee considered that, while some concerns were legitimate and have been sufficiently addressed in the legislation, further consideration was unlikely to achieve the consensus which five years of consideration and debate have failed to achieve. The committee recommended passage of most of the amendments in the bill without further change. However, it also recommended a number of what might be described as `procedural amendments' and a number of overarching amendments to ensure that the concerns of private individuals are met. Recommendation 3 states:
The Committee recommends that the Bill be passed and that other jurisdictions be encouraged to adopt requirements—
that is, to bring about uniformity. Recommendation 4, as I mentioned, dealt with the Federal Privacy Commission's role.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (FORENSIC PROCEDURES) BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-03-05,"—The commission or otherwise of a crime can be proved in a variety of ways, but often an accused person makes an admission or a confession. The other evidence that is used is what used to be called `real evidence'—I am not sure what it is called these days—which is evidence other than an admission or confession. In a murder case, for example, it could be the weapon or other evidence, such as blood-stained blankets or fingerprints. It is evidence distinct from the confession that a person might make. 
It is important to look at the sort of evidence that is addressed in Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 2000 [2001], because this legislation does not deal with confessional evidence or with evidence that arises through admissions. It deals with evidence that is objective—that cannot be changed or affected by the way a person might feel, the pressure that is put on them, or the anxiety they feel. It is immutable evidence, in the same sense that a blood test would be. Therefore, the approach that is taken to that sort of evidence is different from the approach that is taken to evidence which consists of a confession or an admission. 
With evidence that comes by way of an admission or a confession, there are three things we have to be concerned about. One is whether or not the person making the admission or confession has been fair to himself or herself. A person may be overwhelmed by being taken down to the police station, for example, or a person may be unable to do justice to himself or herself because of anxiety or fear that they may feel or because their memory may not be as good as it should be. With evidence that is to do with confessions or admissions, great care has to be taken. That issue does not arise in this case because what is looked at here is real evidence—DNA, blood samples or fingerprints have been looked at. The issue of how a person feels or whether a person is able to do justice to himself or herself or whether the memory is functioning as well as it should is irrelevant to the consideration here.
Secondly, even though you might want to obtain real evidence, you have to obtain that, at least in our society, in a reasonable way. Many years ago there used to be accusations made that the police would beat confessions out of people or would write confessions themselves. I am sure Mr McDonald would say that that had never occurred and he may well have been right, but those sorts of terrible accusations used to be made in those days. Whether the evidence has been obtained by way of admission or confession, by blood sample or DNA, there has to be a reasonable way that society goes about collecting that evidence. In other words, there are some things that authorities should never do. We do not want torture in this society. We eschew torture, particularly of a state sponsored kind—and fortunately in Australia we do not have that—but in any event we have to be careful that when we are collecting samples we do so according to what is reasonable in society.
Thirdly—and it is relevant in the present circumstances—what is done with the evidence once the matter has been dealt with by a person being either acquitted or convicted and then serving his or her sentence? Once those people have been either acquitted or convicted, should evidence that has been used against them be kept in existence for ever? Should people be no longer afflicted with the evidence of a mistake in the form of a crime that they may have committed in time gone by? And that is the third issue. It is the last two issues that this legislation deals with and therefore it is important to look at them in that situation. 
To some extent we have become less sensitive. If you look at the Crimes Act 1914, section 23XL concerns the taking of samples of hair. In the part dealing with forensic procedures it says that nothing authorises the taking of a sample of hair by removing the root of the hair. That has been repealed and now a person is authorised to take a sample of hair from a suspect by removing the root of the hair only if the person takes only so much of the hair as the person believes is necessary. That is not a very objective test. As long as a person believes it is necessary then that is sufficient—and perhaps we can talk about that when we come to the committee stage. 
The amendment 23XWO talks about a judge or magistrate's order for carrying out forensic procedure on an offender. It says that a constable may apply to any judge or magistrate for an order directing a serious offender to consent to an intimate forensic procedure. That is an interesting point. How can a judge order someone to consent because the person is doing it under compulsion of law? That is hardly consent. It is an interesting use of language.
Another point I would like to raise concerns section 23YQ where it says that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police may delegate all or any of his functions and powers under this part to a constable or staff member. It certainly gives very extensive powers to a wide range of people. I see that section 23XK of the 1914 act still operates. It says:
For the purpose of this Part, the carrying out of a forensic procedure is not of itself taken to be cruel, inhuman or degrading. However, nothing in this Part authorises the carrying out of a forensic procedure in a cruel, inhuman or degrading manner. 
That says, in effect, that the law must prescribe any procedure that is taken under these acts. 
Senator Greig has talked about the right to independent analysis. I would have thought that that would be elemental to this legislation—that is, if a sample has been taken from a person, that person should have a right to take a part of the sample to see that the analysis is correct. It is the sort of thing that is done in drink driving cases when a person has a blood test and it ought to be kept for now. I am overwhelmed by the number of people coming in here now. I think that they want to hear the repartee of question time across the chamber. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-03-05,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. How does the minister explain a massive jump in foreign debt from $190 billion five years ago to $301 billion in December 2000? Isn't this huge increase of 60 per cent in Australia's foreign debt just another broken promise from the Prime Minister?

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-03-05,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Does the Assistant Treasurer concede that a foreign debt at $301 billion is the highest level of indebtedness this country has seen since Federation, a record of 46.6 per cent of GDP? Can he confirm that, using Mr Costello's preferred measure of foreign debt, it now amounts to $15,696 for every man, woman and child in Australia—a massive increase of nearly 60 per cent since Mr Costello became Treasurer? ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Debt</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-03-05,"—I am rather intrigued that I have a question on foreign debt from the Labor Party, because the Labor Party were the world champions at building up foreign debt. Through you, Madam President, let me quote some figures. During the period from June 1983, which was just after the Labor Party came to office, to the March quarter 1996, around the time the Labor Party left office—thankfully—net foreign debt increased by 668 per cent. That is the figure that I have here, which was advised to me by the department
—What is it now?
—Order! It is totally inappropriate to be shouting out questions across the chamber in that fashion, Senator Sherry.
—So there was a huge rise in foreign debt under the Labor Party, which you would have to say is not surprising. The Labor Party ran up huge debts. We all recall that in some five or six years the collective deficit run up by the Labor Party totalled between $70 billion and $80 billion. That was during the period when a number of the former Keating ministers were very prominent in the cabinet. Importantly, Senator Hogg, this government, by returning the budget to surplus, has ensured that it is not contributing to any increase in net foreign debt.
Over the last five years of the former Labor government net debt increased by some $80 billion, the figure I referred to. By the end of 2000-2001, the government will have repaid over $50 billion in net debt and the ratio of net debt to GDP will have been reduced from the almost 20 per cent of GDP during the Labor term of government to around 6.4 per cent by the year 2001. This is reflected in the composition of net foreign debt. For the information of Senator Hogg and the Senate, the majority of net foreign debt—some 92 per cent—is owed by the private sector. Net foreign debt owed by the general government sector is some 6.5 per cent. The point I am making is that the increase in net foreign debt since March 1996 is solely due to the increase in private sector borrowing.
A very important point here is the debt servicing ratio. The amount of exports required to pay interest on net foreign debt was 9.8 per cent in the September quarter. Madam President, you will be interested to know, and so will Senator Hogg, that this is well below the peak of 20 per cent recorded in the September quarter of 1990. Let me make the point that, given the Labor Party's record on foreign debt and building up debt through government borrowing, it is a surprising question to get from Senator Hogg.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-03-05,"—Again I draw to the Senate's attention the irony of the Labor Party raising issues of foreign debt and net debt. Given the Labor Party's record, it is quite astonishing. I do not think Senator Hogg listened to the last part of my answer, which I think puts it into perspective. The debt servicing ratio, which as I said was the amount of exports required to pay the interest on net foreign debt, was 9.8 per cent in the September quarter, well below the peak of 20 per cent recorded in the September quarter of 1990. This, as we all recall, was the period of the Hawke and Keating governments—governments which borrowed big and spent big.

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRO-DUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2001 AUTUMN SITTINGS
FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEG-IS-L-ATION AMENDMENT (NEW ZEA-LAND CITIZENS) BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will amend the definition of “Australian resident” for the purposes of the social security law so that access to social security payments for New Zealand citizens taking up residence in Australia is restricted unless they either meet normal migration selection criteria or are covered by a social security international agreement. The Bill will also ensure that all child related payments under the social security law and the family assistance law are protected from the change and that access to concessions under the social security law and the Health Insurance Act 1973 is protected.
Reasons for urgency
The changes were announced by the Prime Minister on 26 February 2001 and will provide for a 3 month period of grace. The legislation must be in place by the end of that grace period, that is, the Bill must be enacted no later than 27 May 2001.

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRO-DUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2001 AUTUMN SITTINGS
AIRCRAFT NOISE LEVY COLLECTION AMEND-MENT BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Act 1995 and the Aircraft Noise Levy Act 1995 establish arrangements for funds expended on airport noise amelioration programmes to be recovered through the imposition of a levy on landings at the relevant airports by jet aircraft. The legislation provides for the Treasurer to declare a leviable airport and then to set the levy rate.
A levy has been collected at Sydney Airport since 1995 and has to date recovered approximately $194 million. Although Sydney Airport was declared a leviable airport in 1995 for the nine months to 30 June 1996, there has been no declaration of Sydney Airport from 1 July 1996. This situation has arisen as a result of an administrative oversight within Treasury.
Remedial action is being undertaken through the issuing of a declaration to allow the levy to apply prospectively. However, it is necessary to enact legislation to retrospectively deem a declaration to have been in force from 1 July 1996 to deal with levy collections from that date.
The Bill will simply provide for the existing legislation to operate as originally intended and will not impose any additional burden on aircraft operators at Sydney Airport.
Reasons for Urgency
To protect the past recovery of funds through the levy by obviating the possibility of claims of restitution by aircraft operators.

Title of Bill
LAKE EYRE BASIN INTERGOVERN-MENTAL AGREEMENT BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The purpose of this Bill is to give Commonwealth recognition of, and approval to, the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement between the Commonwealth, Queensland and South Australia.
The Agreement provides for the integrated catchment management of the water and related natural resources associated with major cross-border river systems in the Lake Eyre Basin.
Reasons for Urgency
The development of the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement has taken close to three years. There are increasing community expectations and concern that Commonwealth legislation approving the Agreement be finalised as soon as possible.
Timely passage of Commonwealth legislation will provide impetus to the process and persuade the relevant States to also expedite passage of their respective legislation.
Passage of the legislation will demonstrate the commitment of the Parliament of Australia to the future sustainable management of the Lake Eyre Basin.
The first meeting of the Ministerial Forum is planned to be held in April and it is important that the Commonwealth legislation is in place.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-03-05,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 834.
This is an important motion. We are all aware that in recent weeks, even in recent days and as we are sitting here, there has not only been no move towards the implementation of human rights in China but also a crackdown, in particular, against religious rights in China, as the Chinese regime in Beijing moves to inculcate schoolchildren and everybody else that religion is bad for them. The Chinese regime in Beijing is giving atheism a bad name. It is absolutely breaking its own public statements and its own constitution, I might add, on human rights.  
You will note that my motion calls on the Australian government to do something, not the Chinese government. It calls on the Australian government to seek China's ratification and implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and it does that in the wake of the European Parliament having called on member states in Europe to do this and to, furthermore, submit a resolution to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights—and you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the United States is doing the same—at a forthcoming meeting in Geneva, to condemn all violations of religious rights and, in particular, those directed against Tibetan and Mongolian monks, certain Christian churches and certain Muslim communities, and adherents of the Falun Gong movement throughout China and its military occupied countries like Tibet and East Turkistan. 
We know from reading the newspapers in this country in the last week that there are hundreds of people, including adherents to the Falun Gong movement, who are not only being brought before the courts for doing nothing more than expressing their religious beliefs but are being given savage, totally unacceptable, inhumane and cruel court sentences which involve hard labour, deportation and, effectively, removal into a gulag system in China—simply because the communist regime in Beijing does not agree that these people should be allowed to practise freedom of worship and feels threatened by that.
Senators may know that on Wednesday of last week the People's Assembly in Beijing did in fact ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights—though not the Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights—but that is far short of implementing that ratification. So, while China on the one hand is ratifying international agreements on baseline standards for the rights of people to practise their religion, the regime in effect is cracking down on that very right for millions of people who should have that right. My motion calls on the Australian government to seek China to implement its obligations under those rights. I know that the Labor Party has a standard practice in here, except for when it comes to its own motions, of blocking other people's motions—
—I was going to support your suspension motion.
—Senator O'Brien, the process here is that repeatedly I have been blocked by you on motions which call—
—Yes; and today I was going to support it.
—You should have flagged this to me.
—He did.
—He did not.
—Yes, he did. He said he was going to vote for your motion.
—Give the Liberals your preferences in Ryan!
—He was going to support you and move an amendment.
—Let's hear that, and let's hear the amendment.
 (Senator Hogg)—Senator Brown, continue. Ignore the interjections.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This new found accommodation by the Labor Party yet has to be tested, because repeatedly it has blocked any motion that I have put forward here on human rights in countries like Tibet, West Papua, East Timor and Burma. Therefore, I am calling on the Australian government for action. I am glad to see that this has opened a window of opportunity for the ALP to give some support, and I will be looking forward to hearing what the amendment is.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS: CHINA AND TIBET</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-03-05,"—This is a motion for suspension of standing orders, but it is necessary, I believe, for the chamber to consider some of the essence of the proposal in order to focus on whether or not the motion is of such importance that it ought to be debated at this present point of time. I happen to think that it ought to be debated. But there is one issue in there that needs to have clarification. 
The Senate will realise that the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade spent hours, days, on this issue of religious freedom. I was a member of that committee. The committee produced the document, Conviction with compassion. That document detailed, though not exhaustively, the violations of human rights and religious freedoms in the PRC. There are gross violations of human rights in the PRC, and these are enumerated. There is much material on the Internet about this. But it is very important for us to see what the goal is in all of this. The goal is to seek and search for the truth. A wonderful statement emanated from, I think, John Paul II:
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion is the cornerstone of the whole human rights structure and the foundation of a truly free society.
The fact of the matter is that the constitution of the PRC does in fact support the concept of freedom of religion. But the act of all of the apparatchiks in China is serving the opposite. If I can come to the issues involved here—and I raise them here in this debate on whether the motion should be formal—Senator Brown's motion asks, in part:
That the Senate—
	(a)	notes the resolution of the European Parliament on freedom of religion in the People's Republic of China that calls for the European Union and its member states to submit a resolution to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, at its meeting in Geneva, to condemn all violations of religious rights and, in particular, those directed against Tibetan and Mongolian monks, certain Christian churches and certain Muslim communities, and adherents of the Falun Gong movement;
I am not so sure that the Falun Gong movement would be thankful to this chamber if the principle of freedom of religion were to be the issue here because, as I understand it, the Falun Gong movement does not call itself a religion. There is a violation, certainly, of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly; and so, in technical terms—and in accordance with, as I understand it, its view that it is not a religion; and I stand to be corrected there—if you are attempting to pass through this chamber such a motion, it might well be advisable to utilise and refer to the aspects of freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2001-03-05,"—by leave—On behalf of Senator Crane, I present a report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Hungary and Poland, which took place from 15 to 26 October 2000.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-03-05,"—The Medicare Levy Amendment (CPI Indexation) Bill (No. 2) 2000 could be described as a technical bill which makes an adjustment to Medicare payments. This bill proposes, if I could put it in more precise terms, to amend the Medicare levy low income exemption thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents in line with the consumer price index, or CPI, movements. The shading-in thresholds, which ensure that taxpayers earning just over the low income threshold will not face the full levy, will also be adjusted in line with CPI movements. This has been done by the Howard government in each year that it has been in government, except for 1998-99. Indexation was suspended in 1998-99, with the support of Labor, because the relevant CPI figure was negative. The thresholds for individuals will increase from $13,550 to $13,807 for 2000-01. Individuals whose income is between $13,807 and $14,926 will be subject to the shading-in provisions, yielding a Medicare levy of 20 per cent of their income over $13,807. The family income exemption threshold is being increased from $22,865 to $23,299 for couples with no children, increasing by $2,140 for each dependent child in the family. Sole parents will enjoy the same exemption provisions. The low income threshold is also adjusted in the Medicare levy surcharge legislation, which imposes a tax penalty on taxpayers who do not have private health insurance. This bill is estimated to cost $1 million in 2000-01, $35 million in 2001-02 and $20 million in 2002-03.
This bill continues Labor's practice of annually indexing Medicare levy thresholds, and on that basis Labor will be supporting this legislation. However, we think the second reading motion that attaches to this bill should be amended. As a consequence—and I believe this has been circulated in the chamber; I note the nod from the Clerk, which is the most authoritative advice I can have on that point—I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate condemns the Government for its treatment of Medicare and the effective “Americanisation” of the health system, and its taxation policies generally given the impact these policies have had on the Australian economy”.
As I said, the bill is a mechanical or technical bill, but it does raise the broader question of the government's approach to Medicare. It also introduces the broader question of the government's attitude to taxation. It is on those matters that some remarks are appropriate. 
At the present time we are seeing under this government, the Howard government, an Americanisation of our health system, which is creating two health systems in Australia: one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us. We think that drift towards an American style system, which is being accelerated by the policies of this government, is something to be utterly resisted. If there is one thing that Australians stand united on in the field of health it is that Medicare provides the best system in order that all Australians can have access to proper and appropriate health care as they need it, and any dilution of that system—any watering down or shifting of entitlement—has to be viewed very carefully. 
The Howard government has opposed Medicare for more than a quarter of a century. In our view, Mr Howard has committed to dismantling Medicare as a universal health system and is starving our public hospitals for funds, causing Medicare to become a poor cousin to the private health system. The Howard government views public hospitals only as a safety net for poor families and pensioners. When he came to office, Mr Howard cut $800 million from our public health system in the infamous budget of 1996-97 and has since failed to index Commonwealth grants, as recommended by an independent inquiry. So the true value of the cuts has never been restored and the true value of the budget outlay on health has been eroding over those years due to movements in consumer prices. 
Our commitment on coming to government will be to revive Australia's public health system by investing in more beds and supporting the provision of more nurses and doctors and new medical technology. This will mean faster, affordable, quality treatment for all Australians. Compare that to the Howard government's plans where only the wealthy can be sure that they will get treatment when they need it. We are committed to revitalising Medicare and returning our health system to the world's best. I make those remarks in support of that part of my second reading amendment that deals with the Americanisation of our health system. But I will now turn to some more general remarks about the changes to the tax system that we have all witnessed in Australia in the last few weeks and the miraculously vanishing surplus that the Howard government boasted of as a benchmark of its so-called better economic management credentials.
The first and most significant thing is just what the tax burden is in Australia. We know that the Howard government has increased the total Commonwealth tax collections from 22.8 per cent of GDP in the year 1995-96—the year when Labor left office—to now, in the year 2000-01, 25 per cent of GDP. The amount of tax collected overall in this country has increased during the period of the Howard government.
We get lectured in this chamber day in, day out during question time with, in my view, quite sloppy economics, based around the mantra that the Howard government is a low taxing government and Labor is a high taxing government. Do not look at what they say; always look at what they do. What they have done on this occasion has increased the overall burden of taxation; it has gone up. That is what they do and that is what people should focus on. Under this government total tax revenue has grown, according to their own budget papers for each year, from $115.7 billion in the year 1995-96—that is the total amount raked in by tax—to an estimated $168.5 billion, which I include the GST in, for this current financial year, the year 2000-01.
That is an increase in the amount of money collected—and I am now talking not about percentages but gross figures—of $52.8 billion in extra taxes paid by Australians during the period of the Howard government being in office. A low taxing party? I do not think so. Now every Australian taxpayer, on average, is paying $5,443 per head extra in taxes, as a consequence of this government. You can put taxes up and then you can provide tax cuts and pretend that you have done something wonderful. What is far better is to keep a rein on the total level of taxes so that people themselves have that money in their pocket and can spend it in the economy.
Let us just look at a few of the backflips. The most notorious one was on the business activity statement, a backflip executed as a double somersault with pike by the Treasurer in the week before last, when he almost got it right: he almost took the whole of the Labor proposition on modifying the business activity statement and announced that just a week later as his own policy. But I do suspect those elements that he did not pick up from us will be elements that will come back to haunt him.
Something needed to be done about the business activity statement. It was killing business: it was tying up small business operators after their normal working hours for a long time, trying to make the sums reconcile; it was giving them an extra cost in consultancies with their accountants; it was giving them extra costs in purchasing the electronic accounting equipment needed; and it was an inefficient way of actually assessing what the business contribution was for the GST. But this government visited on the business community—one that it claims that it is concerned about—such a system. We always believed that it should be changed. The pity about it is that it took so long for the government to believe that. It only changed its mind, one can say, after it got massively defeated in Western Australia and Queensland and decided something had to happen at last: `We will pinch this policy off Labor.' 
Last week we had the issue of trusts. If I can cart the chamber back to July of last year—or prior to that, October of the year before, 1999, when the government put down its ANTS package. This was the package it tabled which justified the GST. People who remember will remember the big thick document that the government tabled with all of its commitments on ANTS. The subtitle of that document—something that I will come back to and will persist in reminding the government about—was Not a new tax, a new tax system. At the point of ANTS, when they introduced the GST, what did this government tell Australians? It told us all that this was a revolutionary change in the tax system.
I might say in parentheses that, in question time today we heard—as we heard last week, as well—the government spokesman for the Treasurer say, `But Labor introduced the indexation of petrol under the Hawke government.' All I remind the chamber of—and this is the point I simply want to make, and I do not want to unnecessarily dwell on it—is that the government changed the whole tax system in Australia on 1 July last year and it called its change `Not a new tax, a new tax system'. When it did so, it did so after a comprehensive report set out in the ANTS document saying what was in and what was out. It changed the business tax system at the same time. So it cannot reach back and say now that the indexation of excise for petroleum products is something that belongs to Labor; it is something that belongs to this government.
But the amazing irony and barefaced cynicism of Treasury spokesmen for this government is this: we debated in this chamber last Thursday afternoon—and the Thursday afternoon of the previous week's sitting as well—a private member's bill that had I introduced into this chamber to knock off the indexation of petroleum. What happened last Thursday was that the Prime Minister announced that he was going to do it. But what happened in this chamber last Thursday is that his party filibustered the private member's bill to prevent us voting on it. So they cannot claim—and this is a detour from my general remarks about taxation—the moral high ground on taxes on petrol. They are responsible for them. Whoever gave birth to them, they owned them. They owned them when they embraced them and when they operated from them and when they benefited from them—and they certainly owned them after they changed the entire tax system, as they claim to have done on 1 July.
But coming back to trusts, people who are generally classed as higher wealth individuals with income to spare—that is, in the technical phrase, `discretionary income'—can manipulate their income affairs to get a lower level of tax to benefit themselves through private trusts. When the government introduced the GST, they promised in their ANTS package, which was due to come into effect on 1 July 2000, that they would stamp out this practice by taxing those trusts not at 15 per cent but at the same rate as businesses. That is what the government promised they would do. When it came to the point on 1 July, the Treasurer then said, `We'll defer that part of the decision to 1 July 2000.'
What happened last week? The government deferred it again, indefinitely—and not just because on the public record it is a matter of plain fact a number of front benchers in the government are beneficiaries from these trusts, but because there is an election in Ryan in Queensland in two weeks time that they are running scared from, believing that they might lose. They know that, if they persisted with this issue, some of the people whom they want to vote for them would be absolutely offended. They deferred it indefinitely, beyond the next election, so that whoever is the next government of Australia will have to face this issue; and they did it cynically, knowing that in the polls the next government is most likely to be a government from the Labor Party, not from the Liberal Party.
That brings me to the petrol issue again. The fundamental question here on petroleum is: what is the windfall gain in taxation revenue that the government have obtained because of higher petrol prices? We have asked this question directly of the government; they have replied to our inquiries, but they have never answered them. We have examined officers of the Department of the Treasury, who, under government instruction, have declined to answer. We think it is the right of all Australians to know how much tax they pay and why. We know that Australians have paid more tax on petroleum because of higher prices, because the GST is a percentage. If you pay GST on unleaded fuel with a base price of 80c a litre, then you pay 8c GST. If you pay GST on petrol with a base price of one dollar, you pay 10c GST. It just follows that the higher the price of petrol, the more tax you pay. We have asked the question, `Well, how much more tax in aggregate have Australians paid as a consequence of this growth tax?'—and we have said that it is the right of Australians to know this figure—and what have the government said? The government have said, `We don't know,' and then they have said, `We will not tell you.' If we do not know this figure, how can we be sure that the Australian motorist is getting a fair deal from this government? Let me illustrate that point. 
The Prime Minister, earlier this year and late last year, said, `We have announced a $1.6 billion package on roads, and this package is handing back to Australian motorists the windfall gain in taxation from petrol.' But read the fine print. His package is $1.6 billion over four years on roads. `Over four years'—remember that part, it is the critical bit. The Australian Automobile Association, which represents motorists and is a voluntary organisation, has calculated that, according to it, the actual windfall gain to the government is $1.5 billion per year. When the Prime Minister says `$1.6 billion on roads, and I'm giving it back', that is over four years. But the Automobile Association, a non-political body with no axe to grind other than the interests of motorists, says that the windfall gain is $1.5 billion, and it is per year—and, even now, with the cut in the 1.5c of indexation to excise being costed at $550 million in the balance of this financial year, we still have not got the windfall back. By the government not saying how much the windfall is, the only respectable figure in public debate is that figure given to us by the Automobile Association. Because the government do not challenge that figure, we are entitled to believe it. And if we believe it, the government are still playing the thimble and pea trick and not returning the windfall gain.
We know that foreign debt is now a record $301 billion, or $15,000 per head. We know that net exports only contribute 0.2 per cent to economic growth, despite the very low value of the Australian dollar. We know that business investment for the December quarter is down by 5.2 per cent. We know that, according to today's ANZ job survey, the number of advertisements for new jobs is down by 10 per cent, presaging an increase in unemployment. We know that the consensus publication of economic opinion says the Australian economy is stagnating and that stated on the front page of many newspapers today and on the weekend is that we are teetering on the brink of recession—and the government say that the GST is still good for the economy!",SENATE,<title>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (CPI INDEXATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-03-05,"—The bill we are dealing with, the Medicare Levy Amendment (CPI Indexation) Bill (No. 2) 2000, relates to Medicare. I will just comment briefly on what it is doing: increasing the threshold for the Medicare levy in line with the CPI. It is quite a simple piece of legislation and one that the Democrats support, because we believe that those on low incomes should not pay the Medicare levy. If we do not index for inflation, then gradually more and more people will be caught up and will fall above the threshold, resulting in more and more people finding, despite being on very low incomes, that they have to pay this levy.
But I would like to comment also that, as far as payment by those on low incomes goes, one of the key issues facing many people who are struggling to make ends meet is the growing amount of co-payments. As long as this government underfunds Medicare, as long as in particular it keeps the amount paid to doctors for consultations at lower and lower levels when compared to the true value—looking at inflation, they have not even been indexed for inflation regularly—the pressure comes on doctors to no longer bulkbill, not even for those people who have a Healthcare card. 
The difficulty we hear back, through rafts of anecdotal evidence, is that this makes it extremely difficult for families on low incomes. If you have more than one child who is sick, some doctors will agree to only the extra $8 or $9 or maybe $12; but in some surgeries now they are asked to put the whole $35 or maybe $40 on the table before seeing the doctor—and, as you know, if you have several children who are ill, it is extremely difficult to work out who is actually the sickest. And it does not end there: pharmacists tell us that they then see the family who have managed to foot the bill and have paid the co-payment or perhaps the entire amount, which they will obviously claim back; but the problem in the short-term is cash flow. The family then fronts up to the chemist with a number of scripts and the chemist is then asked, `Well, I've really only got money for one or two of these; which ones should I fill?'
So I say very strongly to government that, while you are dealing with this issue—and making sure with the CPI that we exclude people on the original limit you define as a low income in line with inflation—people on low incomes are still at the wrong end as far as the amount of money they have to pay for services goes. What it means for some families is that they do not go to the GP. They end up queuing at a public hospital, and we know the pressures on the public hospital system. It is a very expensive option for families to feel that they cannot afford to go to the GP; they cannot find a doctor that bulk-bills. So they go and queue for three or four or more hours, clogging up emergency departments in our public hospitals.
We need to look at the actual structure of our Medicare system. The time has gone for us simply to say we need a bit more money here and need to tinker with something over on the side. I refer people who are interested in Australia's future health system to the recent report from the Senate Community Affairs Committee that looked at funding of public hospitals. I draw your attention to that and the recommendations that we trial a different system of delivering health services.
One of the most damning statistics as far as our current health system is concerned is that one's health status decreases with income—in other words, the poorer you are, the sicker you are; the wealthier you are, the generally healthier you are. Anyone looking through the details will see that groups in the community missing out on adequate services include people in rural and remote areas and the Aboriginal community. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with poorer health status actually have access to fewer Commonwealth resources than do non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We believe that the whole issue of equity and access, while helped a little by this bill, has to be now looked at afresh in a raft of other ways.
When I came into this chamber, I thought for a moment we were just dealing with something specifically on taxation with nothing to do with health. So I will just digress for a minute, as Senator Cook has, and look at tax reform. The reason we stayed in tax reform was to get money for these very services so the states could properly fund their end of the health system, particularly our hospital and community health sector. For the Commonwealth, the money will be there to adequately fund Medicare, to remove some of the pressure on doctors and to look at the values study that has gone on for several years looking at where Medicare benefits need to be changed. We stayed in tax reform—we make absolutely no apology for that—to get a revenue stream so that we could put money not just into our public health system but also particularly into public education.
As we are looking at indexing the lower threshold, the Democrats also want to deal with the higher threshold in exactly the same way—in other words, index it. While we have before us a bill that will make sure that more people do not fall into the Medicare levy threshold and trip over it, we also need to make sure at the top end that we do not have more people tripping over into the additional payment. The level the government did set, when we debated this back in 1997, was $50,000 for individuals and $100,000 for families. To keep that in line with the government's original intention and policy, we need to index that up as well. I will speak more on this as we get to the committee stage. I have circulated the amendments. Basically, if CPI indexation is good enough at the bottom, it should apply to the top as well, so we do not have families on middle incomes falling over into the area where they are paying the additional Medicare levy. ",SENATE,<title>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (CPI INDEXATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-05,"—We are addressing the second reading of the Medicare Levy Amendment (CPI Indexation) Bill (No. 2) 2000. The levy provisions provide for the increase in the low income exemption threshold for individuals, married couples and single parents. The bill also increases the shade-out threshold which applies for the purposes of the Medicare levy. The legislation we are considering amends both the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge Fringe Benefits) Act 1999. These amendments will apply to income tax assessments for the year 2000-01 and later years.
I think it is well known what theme in respect to government this legislation deals with. It deals with revenue raising. To that end, my colleague Senator Cook has moved on behalf of the Labor opposition that the Senate condemns the government for its treatment of Medicare and the effective Americanisation of the health system and its taxation policies generally, given the impact these policies have had on the Australian economy. This is a high taxing government. I intend to come to some detail shortly in outlining just how and why this is a high taxing government.
One of the subterfuges, one of the covers, it uses for its revenue raising measures is to call them surcharges—a tax when you are not having a tax. You call a revenue raising measure a surcharge in order to avoid the promise that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, gave to the Australian people in the lead-up to the 1996 election. That promise they gave, one of those never ever promises—as it has turned out—was that there would be no increase in existing taxes and no new taxes. That was the ironclad commitment given. We all know about the GST. I will come to that in terms of its revenue raising in a little while. The most prominent of the so-called surcharges was the superannuation surcharge. This was introduced in the 1996 budget. It was intended to collect up to an additional 15 per cent from this new tax on superannuation savings.
The theme of my contribution to this debate, consistent with the second reading amendment moved by my colleague Senator Cook, is that the Liberal-National Party government is a high taxing government, not just in total moneys collected but also as a percentage of gross domestic product, which is the relevant yardstick for measuring how much money governments collect. I want to look at the ways in which this is a high taxing Liberal-National Party government. We obviously have a clear example with the legislation before us, the Medicare Levy Amendment (CPI Indexation) Bill (No. 2) 2000, and the amendments we are considering. We had a surcharge which I think only lasted for about six months—the East Timor tax surcharge. That was probably Mr Howard's and Mr Costello's first major backflip when they dropped it. Apparently at that time revenue collection was very strong and the budget was in substantial surplus, so they dropped that tax. But that was a tax under another name, a surcharge. 
Just returning to the issue of superannuation tax, page 5.10 of the Budget Strategy and Outlook 2000-01, the official budget paper, details the taxes collected from superannuation funds. In the year 1999-2000, superannuation tax amounted to $3,893 million; in the year 2000-01, the current financial year, it is estimated that the tax from superannuation funds will be $5,175 million—an increase of 32.9 per cent. That is an increase in superannuation tax. That includes the superannuation surcharge tax that I referred to earlier, but what is interesting is that, if you try to find the detail of this new tax, this new surcharge that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer introduced in 1996, it does not give the detail of the revenue raised. They have hidden the collection of this new tax within general superannuation funds' taxation. They have done this because they are embarrassed about the new tax and the moneys it is raising. They have also done it for another reason, and at the moment I am putting on notice some questions to find out the new level of revenue collected by the so-called super surcharge following the change to reportable tax payments with the inclusion of the fringe benefits tax, because my information is that the new superannuation surcharge tax is collecting substantially more than the half a billion dollars budgeted for because of the inclusion of FBT. Be that as it may, the government has introduced a new tax and it has increased the base of that tax. We would like to know what revenue is being raised. We would like to know why it is being hidden in the general tax category of superannuation funds. 
That is the first area where there has been a substantial increase in taxation. The second area I want to refer to is company tax. In the financial year 1999-2000, revenue from company tax was budgeted to be $23,666 million; in the current financial year, 2000-01, it is budgeted to be $30,857 million—an increase of 30.4 per cent. I emphasise again: an increase of 30.4 per cent. Let us go to excise tax. Petrol excise has been in the news recently, and we all know why. I am not going to go into the considerable debate that has occurred about that. However, I would point out to the Senate that the revenue to be collected from indirect tax on petroleum products, specifically unleaded petrol, in 1999-2000 was just over $5,044 million; in the year 2000-01, it is budgeted to be $5,993 million—an increase of 18.8 per cent. Again, I emphasise: an increase of 18.8 per cent. The figure for the current financial year will obviously have to be reduced following the government's backflip, backdown, roll-back of the excise indexation. Notwithstanding that and the subtraction of whatever the figure may be, there will still be a substantial increase in excise duty from unleaded petrol. 
Let us look down the list. For leaded petrol, there is actually a slight reduction of 6.3 per cent in the excise collected. The reason for that is that leaded petrol is being phased out as motor vehicles are being replaced, so it is understandable that revenue would reduce. The next on the list is the diesel excise, the diesel tax. In the year 1999-2000, the government collected $4,614 million; the estimate for the year 2000-01 is $5,232 million—an increase of 13.4 per cent. That is another massive increase. Let us look at beer excise, and this is the real ripper. In the year 1999-2000, the excise on beer collected $892 million; in the year 2000-01, it is budgeted to collect $1,441 million—an increase in the tax on beer of 61.6 per cent. Let us look at potable spirits. In 1999-2000, the government collected $152 million; in the current financial year, it will collect $245 million—an increase of 61.7 per cent. That is another massive increase. These are not small increases in tax collection.
Let us go to income tax, and then I want to go to total revenue collected as a percentage of gross domestic product. Let us look at total income tax in terms of the amounts to be collected and as a percentage figure. According to page 5-20 of the budget papers, total income tax was $116,471 million in the year 1999-2000. In the year 2000-01, the current financial year, total income tax increases to $123,753 million—an increase of 3.3 per cent. In the out years of 2002-03 and 2003-04, there is a 6.3 per cent increase and an eight per cent increase respectively in total tax collected.
What does all this mean? This means the Liberal-National Party government is the highest taxing government in the last 10 years. We had a response from Senator Hill in today's question time that tax revenue is going up because the economy is growing and because there are more people employed. That in part is true. I accept the validity of that argument in part but not in full. The traditional and the accepted way of measuring the level of tax is as a percentage of gross domestic product. What is the proportion of the total economic production, the total economic cake, that is collected in tax in this country? It is a percentage of gross domestic product. Every economist, every accountant and every financial adviser will agree that percentage of gross domestic product is the critical yardstick and the critical measurement of tax levels in this country. It is the best way of comparing like with like, of comparing current tax revenues to the revenues collected in previous years by previous governments. 
We look at page 8-43 of the budget papers for Commonwealth general government sector cash taxation revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product, and we look at the real growth. It is interesting that in 1996-97, when the Liberal-National Party came to government, the taxation collected as a percentage of gross domestic product was 23.3 per cent. In 1997-98, it was 23.1 per cent. In 1998-99, it was 23.8 per cent. In 1999-2000, it was 23.6 per cent. According to this table, in the year 2000-01 it has dropped to 20.8 per cent. In 2001-02, it drops to 21 per cent, and it is 21 per cent again for the following two out years. If you look at the table, tax as a percentage of gross domestic product dropped, according to the budget papers. But—and there is a big `but'—there is a major exclusion in taxation as a percentage of gross domestic product. What is that exclusion? It is GST revenue. GST has been excluded from the tax collection revenue of the Commonwealth government.
We all know that we have been engaged in massive discussion, massive debate and thousands of pages of legislation in this parliament—and in particular in the Senate—on the GST. It is a tax collected under a Commonwealth head of power. It is a tax that comes into the Commonwealth Treasury. It is a tax collected by legislation we have dealt with in this chamber. What have we been talking about? What have the government been proudly boasting about over the last 18 months? They have been boasting about the GST and how necessary it is. I do not agree with that, but that is what they claim. Yet they do not have the pride to include it in taxation revenue.
What is the true figure, then, of the percentage of gross domestic product of tax revenue to the Commonwealth? You need to include GST revenues. If you go to the index at the back of the budget papers and you look up `revenue' on page 5, there are lots of different categories of revenue listed but—surprise, surprise—you cannot find GST revenue listed. You look under `GST' and you go over to page 3. You have `goods and services tax' and you have various pages listed there, but when you go to those pages you cannot find an estimate of the revenue to be collected from GST.
—It is like the wine at Kirribilli.
—That is right. I do not know what has happened to GST collection, but you cannot find it. If you do go through every page of the budget papers you will find it on page 4-20, but it is not included in the index. You have to look to find it.
—It is a hidden tax.
—It is a real hidden tax. The revenue is listed there with the budget estimates for GST collections: in the year 2000-01, it is $24 billion; in 2001-02, it is $28 billion; in 2002-03, it is $29 billion; and in 2003-04, it is $30.7 billion. If you add the GST revenue to all the other revenue that the Commonwealth government, the Liberal-National Party government, is collecting, you get some interesting figures. In the current financial year, tax as a percentage of gross domestic product is 24.336 per cent of GDP. In the next financial year, 2001-02, it rises to 24.9 per cent of gross domestic product. That is almost 25 per cent of the total economic cake, including the GST. In 2002-03 and 2003-04, it is 24.87 per cent and 24.85 per cent of gross domestic product respectively.
If we compare this total tax take by the Liberal-National Party government, the last time tax collection as a percentage of gross domestic product was over 24 per cent was in 1986-87 when it was 24.4 per cent and in 1987-88 when it was 24.2 per cent. In other words, the Liberal-National Party—and my colleague Senator Ray questioned Senator Hill on this, and he dodged the issue as much as he could today—this financial year and for the next three financial years, as measured by tax collected as a percentage of gross domestic product, is a high taxing government. It is the highest taxing government since 1969-70, according to the table on page 8-43, and I suspect—I will have to get the library to give me the figures prior to 1970—bar the wartime period, it would be the highest taxing government, as a percentage of gross domestic product, in Australian history. The highest taxing government, bar the wartime period, since Australian Federation! 
I think they are very important issues, and they are the reason why my colleague Senator Cook has moved the amendment. Not only for this reason, of course; the GST is the greatest problem facing the Australian economy. The GST has dealt a sledgehammer blow to the Australian economy. It may in fact have sent the economy into recession. We will see what the evidence adduces in that regard in the next couple of national account figures. It certainly has slowed the economy down in a number of areas. The evidence is very clear that that is what is causing the dip in economic activity. Whether it is a recession we will find out soon. Of course, this happened in Japan when a GST was introduced and subsequently increased. This government was warned. It proudly boasted the GST was going to solve Australia's economic problems.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-03-05,"—I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on this bill. It was, at the beginning, a debate on the Medicare Levy Amendment (CPI Indexation) Bill (No. 2) 2000 although I think only Senator Lees has directed her remarks to that legislation! It is of course appropriate to have wide-ranging debates in the second reading and get down to the details in the committee stage. Senator Sherry spoke on a range of issues, and he is to be credited with finally having run this line about high taxes, getting Senator Ray to ask a question about it today. I do not know why they did not ask Senator Sherry. It has been a campaign he has been running for quite a time. If you repeat these sorts of lines often enough, sooner or later you actually convince yourself that it is true. The best part of Senator Sherry's speech, which we will have to quote back to him now from here till when he retires, is that tax revenue is going down. He would like to think that a tax that we collect, in our benevolence, on behalf of the states is in fact a tax to the Commonwealth. Perhaps Senator Sherry could suggest to the premiers that they raise that tax on their own behalf.
Labor of course do not have policies on tax. Whatever policies they bring out are usually just at the last minute. I do not think they have repudiated the policy they had in the last election yet. Senator Sherry came in here a number of years ago and said, `It's okay. Just wait till we have our Hobart conference; we will release our tax policy.' We are still waiting. At the last election they brought out a humdinger of a tax policy. It had two major platforms. It did not take up much space in paper. It had a special new tax on four-wheel drives. That was the first item in their tax policy, and the second one was a retrospective capital gains tax.
—Don't forget the tax credits.
—Senator Sherry, you are welcome. You can get up and make speeches about your—
—It is important. I said it only had two parts of his tax policy. Senator Sherry has corrected me and said there was a third. There was the important tax on four-wheel drives. I do not think they have taken it out of their policy yet. So that is two points, and there is a third point—
—No, they've gone.
—They've gone! Sorry, but we are not sure about the tax credits. So they are back to a blank piece of paper. Senator Sherry also tried to fill in some detail on roll-back. I noticed he put a lot of thought into this: he talked about backflips, backdowns and roll-back all in the same breath. I do not know when Mr Beazley or whoever happens to be the leader when we get to the next election will define roll-back as backflip and backdown. We do not know what roll-back is yet. I think the small business community are waiting with bated breath to find out just what you are going to roll back. 
The important thing that Senator Sherry made clear was that in fact the government have significantly reduced income tax. We have significantly reduced taxes, particularly on those people earning less than $50,000 a year. Not only did we promise to deliver significant tax cuts to people, particularly those earning less than $50,000 a year; we legislated them. We made them l-a-w, we delivered them, and the people of Australia are getting those tax cuts in their pay packets now—$12 billion worth of tax cuts. Not only did we do that but we abolished an entire system of five different rates of indirect taxes, rates that had been put up indiscriminately by Labor year after year without any compensation to low income earners—no compensation whatsoever.  
None of us should ever forget that the Australian Labor Party, when it came to tax, used to put up tax year in, year out. They came up with new taxes like the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax and they never compensated low income earners. They come in here and prattle on about their concern about the low paid. What did they do in 1993? They increased the indirect, hidden taxes on a whole range of household goods that everyone uses every day—things like toilet paper, detergents and toothpaste. They whacked the taxes up indiscriminately and never delivered one cent of compensation, particularly to those who needed it most. They have the audacity to come in here and try to mislead people about compensation that this government paid.
We actually delivered on what—at least, with the honesty he had at the time—the then Treasurer Paul Keating sought to deliver in 1984. He told the Australian people that you needed to have a modern tax system, that you needed a small tax on spending.
—That is what I am talking about—what Paul Keating wanted to deliver. He said that you had to deliver compensation to low income earners and you had to deliver income tax cuts. To his credit, he had the guts to at least propose some big changes then.
These people opposite were not prepared to do what the then Treasurer sought to do: deliver a serious tax change. A government came along that had the honesty to put that change before an election and deliver it afterwards—unlike Labor when they were last taken to the people. They campaigned all during the 1993 election and said, `No more indirect tax increases.' They got re-elected, whacked up the excise on fuel, whacked up wholesale sales taxes, offered no compensation and in 1996 they bore the political price of that. 
You could argue, if you needed to, about whether or not one item should be included in tax revenue. When you collect a goods and services tax on behalf of the states and pay all of the revenue to the states—and all of that revenue goes towards hospitals, schools and roads—you can try and fire a cheap political shot and argue about levels of taxation, but you cannot do that and then say that the states should have all that spending. You should also, if you want to be honest about that—and Senator Sherry chooses not to be—look at the state taxes that have been replaced. Would he suggest that the state of New South Wales pay back their GST revenues and put a bed tax back on? Would Senator Sherry suggest that all of the taxes that have been removed by the states actually go back on? You cannot have it both ways, but he will argue that until the cows come home. 
He cannot get away from a comparison of expenditures of governments. This government has been very careful to keep expenditure under control and is able, therefore, to deliver the benefit of surpluses and the very important benefit for all householders—particularly those on low and middle incomes—of low interest rates. The people of Australia know, when they repay their mortgage payments, that they have the lowest interest rates in something like 30 years.
— I thought you were going to say high inflation.
—Delivered on the back of very low inflation as well. The Labor Party can never run away from their record in government, which was to have the highest real interest rates ever in the history of Australia. Very high inflation, very high interest rates and very high real interest rates, year after year.
—We killed inflation.
—They say they killed inflation. They killed thousands and thousands of small businesses who were unable to pay interest rates, in many cases in excess of 30 per cent. They destroyed a million jobs during the `recession that we had to have'. Furthermore, they gave no credit to a government that tried to control expenditure. It is not popular to control expenditure. Every time we came into this place to cut expenditure, the people opposite blocked those expenditure cuts. Whenever they come out with a new policy, it is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. So, firstly, they oppose all of our expenditure reductions; secondly, they oppose tax measures; and, thirdly, whenever they can release a policy, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars.  
Senator Cook said they are going to spend more on health, education and doctors, and they would have you believe that they could deliver a surplus as well. They only way you can do that—and back in 1985 Senator Cook at least had the honesty to say so—is to increase tax. On 1 May 1985—and he has not really moved a lot from there—Senator Cook said:
The Labor Party is a high taxing party. It needs to be to carry out its reforms.
The Labor Party have always been a high taxing party—the figures show it, the record shows it. Worse than that, they have been a big spending government. They put up spending to record Australian levels. In 1995-96, the last time that the Keating government brought down a budget, they had increased own purpose outlays to 25.9 per cent of GDP. Under this government, in this current fiscal year, spending as a proportion of GDP will be down to 22.8 per cent. 
You can run but you cannot hide, if you are the Labor Party trying to paint this picture. They had a terrible fiscal record. To go back to another Senator Peter Cook quote, on 23 November 1995, he said:
This current budget, the budget we brought down in May this year, put the budget into surplus—and not just a surplus this year but also a surplus next year—without there being a contribution to that surplus by asset sales. 
The record shows that that surplus Senator Cook was talking about was, in fact, a surplus of negative $10 billion. That was one of the most gross deceits in Australian political history, by the Keating cabinet and its members, who went around saying that there was a surplus. The Australian people know why they were paying high interest rates under Labor: because Labor was spending with both hands. They were spending and taxing, running up huge deficits. The people of Australia paid by way of high interest rates. The people of Australia will never forget that, and they will not forgive senators who come into this place and who seek to distort that record through chicanery and double counting.
Amendment not agreed to.
Original question resolved in the affirmative. 
Bill read a second time.
Ordered that consideration of the bill in committee of the whole be made an order of the day for a later hour.",SENATE,<title>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (CPI INDEXATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-03-05,"—I was speaking on the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 2000 [2001] prior to suspension of the debate for question time, and I will direct some further thoughts about it. I was talking, amongst other things, about the fact that people will now be able to take samples of hair. Whereas there is nothing in the present act that authorises the taking of hair by removing it with the root, now the proper authorities will be able to remove the hair with the root. This is to do with DNA sampling and it indicates how you can get legislative creep, particularly in the area of criminal law and particularly when the mood at the moment is to take on law and order as a popular program in the community. As I said, the point of taking the hair including the root is to allow DNA testing to be done.
DNA is a means of investigation that should have a high value placed on it. As I was saying when I was speaking previously in this debate, when contrasted with things like confessions and admissions DNA is immutable. It is clear evidence—I think the expression used to be `real evidence'—that cannot be affected by a person's feeling of disability in the face of questioning. It contrasts markedly in that respect with a bill that we will debate later in the year, as I understand it, which will give power to the National Crime Authority to question people, away and removed from the public, in a building that is at the discretion of the NCA rather than that of the person who is being questioned. In those circumstances, where a person must answer questions no matter what, you do get real problems as to whether or not the evidence you obtain by those questions is good, firm evidence. It is true that the evidence itself would not be available for use, but things that flow from that will be. It is interesting to contrast forensic evidence brought into being by blood tests, fingerprints or DNA with the other sort evidence that comes from people having to state answers to questions no matter what. I think the minister taking this bill through the chamber has experience as a great—if I may use that expression—criminal lawyer, and he would understand clearly what I mean about confessions and statements made under duress. 
If the papers are to be believed, DNA evidence has saved people on death row in the United States. People have been convicted, no doubt on confessions they have made, and they have been saved from death because of DNA testing. Where that is the situation, much reliance is to be placed on the DNA samples and much reliance is to be placed on evidence that is real evidence. So it comes down to the question of the way in which this evidence is to be obtained. As I said previously, we are not the sort of society that allows evidence to be obtained no matter what. We do not allow torture, and we do not allow people to go beyond what we think is reasonable. How do we know that people have not gone beyond what is reasonable? That is the question we have to ask in this context. No doubt this will come out during the committee stage of the debate, but the issue in this bill is whether or not this evidence, this real evidence, is obtained in a way that we as a civilised society feel it should be obtained.
Once that evidence has been obtained and is no longer of any use, the question arises of how it should be used. A lot of it will be used to build up a database, and it is said that that database should be used to build up information about people who are in the criminal world. I suppose the issue then becomes, particularly with legislative creep, that more and more people will be drawn into that pool where information, through their fingerprints and their DNA, is kept on them. The time might well come when everybody should have their DNA available for anybody else to use, including the law enforcement authorities. Perhaps we even ought to keep the DNA of the great people from the Attorney-General's Department to see whether or not their fingerprints are on certain legislation that comes into this chamber.
You can see the point I am making. Once we start keeping these databases—and this is a question that Senator Greig and others have dealt with—where does it all stop? I must confess that I am getting to the point now where I think that perhaps there should not be privacy anymore and that what we ought to do is bare our lives to everybody else. At my age, and with the zip and the zoom going out of things a bit, I would not really mind that, but people of a younger generation might be somewhat concerned. We do not want to get to the point where we have information about some people but not about other people, because that information can be used in very powerful ways and there has to be some balance in society between the citizens and the people who bear authority over the citizens. I think there is a bit of a danger in that the balance between those two groups—the authorities and the citizens—is starting to wander a bit in favour of the authorities.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (FORENSIC PROCEDURES) BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-03-05,"—I thank senators for their careful consideration of this bill and for their valuable contributions. I note Senator Cooney's comments in relation to the safeguards that are needed in legislation like this, and I note that Senator Coonan, in chairing the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, has really looked out for these sorts of things on behalf of the Senate for some time now.  
The Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 2000 [2001] builds on existing forensic procedures provisions in the Crimes Act and contains important measures to ensure police enforcing our federal criminal offences can use the latest technologies to solve crime. So we already have provisions dealing with matters of a forensic nature. This bill was introduced into the Senate on 30 August 2000 and was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. That committee reported on the bill on 5 December last year, and it recommended that the Senate pass the bill subject to four recommendations. The government has prepared some amendments to address the committee's recommendations. I might mention the amendments because they are perhaps the most important of the amendments proposed by the government. There are a good many amendments proposed by the government which are technical and deal with drafting and going some way to improving the bill, but the amendments I will mention deal with the recommendations of the legal and constitutional committee. 
Amendments (10) and (11) proposed by the government involve the adoption of the committee's recommendations 1 and 2, and the government accepts these recommendations. Government amendment (11) states that proposed subsection 23XWV(3) should be made consistent with proposed subsection 23XWV(2). Government amendment (11) achieves this by inserting the words `taken or information' in subsection (3). Government amendment (10) provides that constables must expressly inform volunteers that they have a choice as to which database index their DNA profile may be stored on. That accommodates the other recommendation proposed by the Senate committee. 
The committee's third recommendation concerns the lack of uniformity across the jurisdictions regarding forensic procedures legislation. The committee specifically noted that the Commonwealth parliament has limited scope to influence the legislative packages enacted in the states and territories. My predecessor, Senator Vanstone, made considerable efforts in her participation in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to ensure consistent legislation. The role of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee has also been important in this process. These efforts have resulted in much greater consistency than could ordinarily be expected. Anyone familiar with the divergence of laws in Australia's federal criminal justice system would recognise this. The government will not, however, rest on these achievements and remains committed to consistent legislation in this area.
I will continue to pursue consistent legislation at the level of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. This recommendation was not one which could be incorporated readily in a provision of this bill, but I make that statement to indicate that the government agrees fully with the sentiments of that recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I think the committee expected that this is as much as we could do, because one could not just insert a provision in the bill to deal with that.
In relation to the committee's fourth recommendation, I have engaged in discussions with the federal Privacy Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman in developing a response. Some serious issues have been raised in relation to the oversight of the national DNA database system. In addition to extending the legislation to include the Privacy Commission and the statutory review of Commonwealth forensic procedures, I have written to state and territory ministers with a view to getting agreement on cooperation between Commonwealth, state and territory bodies to ensure there is effective oversight of not only the operation of a DNA system within each jurisdiction but also the overall operation of the national system. This is best achieved by including formal independent monitoring mechanisms in the CrimTrac agreement with the states and territories so that the total scheme is properly audited and monitored. I am making these statements because I did undertake with the federal Privacy Commissioner that I would make these statements in reply in this debate. Of course, matters will no doubt be taken further during the committee stage. 
I might also mention that I expect to discuss oversight arrangements at the next meeting of the Australian Police Ministers Council in June. While recognising that CrimTrac is conscious of accountability issues and is constructive in the development of appropriate procedures, adequate and independent monitoring of a national DNA database system is critical if we are to have an effective system that ensures that any problems are quickly identified and remedied. The best way to do this is to ensure that there is adequate independent monitoring in each jurisdiction, and across the jurisdictions, which can, in turn, properly investigate complaints and pool information and better practices to safeguard information and ensure that DNA material is collected and matched in accordance with procedures. This is extremely important and must be addressed.
The procedures in this legislation and the legislation of the states and territories are to be put in place to prevent an undue impact on the lives of individuals who provide DNA for the system and to ensure that information obtained from it is used only for the purposes for which it is collected. It is therefore very important that we take steps to ensure that there is adequate independent oversight of compliance with agreed procedures. In view of the interjurisdictional nature of the scheme it is vital that we have arrangements that ensure that the oversight function is like the system itself: interconnected and properly coordinated. These arrangements must also ensure that complaints can be investigated easily without jurisdictional barriers becoming a problem. By encouraging compliance and avoiding problems later these measures will also play a role in improving the effectiveness and efficient use of the system by law enforcement agencies.
I consider these issues can be addressed within the 12-month period before the proposed review, but in order to ensure that there is adequate follow-up on this issue it is proposed that the legislation be amended to provide for a further review within two years of that date if the review report indicates there are still deficiencies. This will cover the situation if there has been less progress than expected. So we have the review in 12 months and, if that reveals that there has not been the progress that was desired, then a further review is possible within two years of that date. Let me make it clear: there is not just the one-off review; there is a facility for further review if matters have not progressed satisfactorily. Similar arrangements would also appear to be useful in relation to other elements of the CrimTrac system. I will also be taking up the broader application of the proposed monetary and accountability mechanisms with state and territory ministers.
I now come to recommendation No. 4. The legislative changes proposed in relation to this recommendation are: firstly, to include the Privacy Commissioner on the independent review team; secondly, to ensure the independent review considers the effectiveness of the independent oversight and accountability mechanisms for the DNA database system; thirdly, to defer the review until 12 months after the commencement of these new provisions—this will enable the review to assess the procedures in light of an operational DNA database; and to assess progress in developing the accountability mechanisms. With this deferral we will able to see how these provisions are operating in the meanwhile. There is a provision for a review due now but the government is of the view that this, perhaps, would not be worth while and wishes to defer it for 12 months and then have the review in the fashion mentioned.
The final response is to cause the minister to ensure a further review is undertaken if the initial written report tabled identifies any inadequacies with the matters considered in the initial review—that is the review within two years after that first review that I mentioned. Proposed government amendment No. 27 deals with these matters. Proposed government amendment No. 24 merely adds the Commonwealth Ombudsman and joins the Privacy Commissioner as a person to whom database information can be disclosed without that disclosure constituting an offence. This amendment recognises the own motion investigation powers of the Ombudsman and will improve independent oversight of the legislation. 
I mentioned that there were some other minor amendments put forward by the government. These are technical amendments contained in the proposals put forward by the government, all of which will improve the bill. I will not describe each of them individually. Suffice to say that they are government amendments Nos 1 to 9 inclusive, government amendments Nos 12 to 19 inclusive, and government amendments Nos 21 and 22. I direct those senators following the debate to those government amendments as being ones which are essentially technical in nature. 
These amendments are required to ensure a neat fit between the existing forensic procedure provisions and those contained in the bill. For example, incorrect cross-references are corrected, section headings altered, protections and safeguards accorded to suspects are extended to offenders and volunteers, and the database index definitions refined to ensure references to a corresponding law of a jurisdiction are not inadvertently qualified by the defined terms within a meaning unique to the Commonwealth. 
I have gone on at some length here because it was important that I place on record the reasons for these amendments and, also, the results of my discussions with the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the federal Privacy Commissioner. I know that the Democrats are proposing four amendments. The government will be agreeing to the Democrat amendment No. 1 on sheet 2143. However, we will be opposing the other three amendments. In all other respects I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

The bill that we have before us indexes the bottom rate. It raises the rate from $13,550 to $13,807, so people need to earn that before they pay the levy at all. However, the high income threshold remains fixed at $50,000. If we do not do something about indexing that, then gradually, with inflation, we will creep up to the point where we are catching those people who are really only on quite average incomes in the group who pay the additional Medicare levy. I argue it makes little sense: if we are going to index one, we should be indexing the other. Therefore these amendments are being moved. The gap between the two is obviously getting smaller and will continue to get smaller unless the higher one is also indexed.
In 1997, when we approved the high income earner surcharge, we approved it on the basis of its application to a fairly narrow range of the population. But, as wages increase, we see more and more people falling into this group. I think the longer term impact is not desirable; it will start cutting in at what are very average middle income levels. Therefore we argue very strongly that if one of the two lines is to be indexed, the other one should be as well.",SENATE,<title>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (CPI INDEXATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-05,—I wonder if we could have an indication from the government about whether they are supporting the amendments.,SENATE,<title>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (CPI INDEXATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-03-05,"—The government does not support the amendments. The Medicare levy surcharge is an added incentive for taxpayers to take out private health insurance so that people contribute more to the cost of their own health care. The government could not agree to index the thresholds for the surcharge levy because that would be counter to the policy that the surcharge should remain an effective incentive. As stated back in 1993 by former health minister Graeme Richardson: 
It must be remembered that Medicare was always intended to coexist with the private health system, not to replace it. Initial estimates of the cost of Medicare assumed that at least 40 per cent of Australians would maintain their private cover.
The effect of a reduction in the number of people who chose to take private cover saw, during a decade or so, that the reinsurance pool was gradually whittled away, the Medicare rebate for in-hospital services was reduced from 85 to 75 per cent and the 1993 Medicare agreements provided the states with increased patient throughput at the expense of private patients. This systematic cost shifting saw private health insurance premium rises of a massive 40 per cent.
The success of the surcharge and the health insurance rebate in encouraging Australians into private health insurance is intended to free up resources in the public system for public patients. Indeed, we have done more for the public hospital system than any other government. Over the five-year life of the health care agreement signed in1998, Commonwealth grants for public hospitals will increase by 28 per cent in real terms. We believe that a robust health system requires both a strong public system and a strong private sector, and that people should have the choice of whether to use the public or the private sector according to their own circumstances. The Medicare system ensures access to high quality health care for all. The majority of Australians support this system.
One minor technical point I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate is that amendments 1C and 2C would seem to us to be wrong because the figures appear to be inconsistent with the other amendments, although it has to be said that it is not clear to us on what basis the indexation factor was chosen. The Democrats have also argued that there is an issue of Senate accountability here. I am not sure about that. They seem to be saying that the parliament said that people who earnt more than $50,000 in real terms should be subject to the levy and that the Senate has a responsibility to ensure that the position in real terms does not change. I think that is all I need to say, but I am happy to answer further questions.",SENATE,<title>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (CPI INDEXATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-05,—I wonder if Senator Lees can explain—and I might have missed it—the basis of the indexation.,SENATE,<title>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (CPI INDEXATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-03-05,"—I will begin with the last point that Senator Campbell made. We are arguing that when the Senate set the figure at $50,000 it was intended that we get towards the upper end of the income scale. We are moving the bottom indexation up so that those who have to pay the Medicare levy pay it at a higher income, and therefore we argue that the level for those who have to pay the surcharge should also be indexed up so that it is paid at a higher level—in other words, we keep the relativity between the two. 
As for Senator Campbell's comments that what the government is trying to do is force more people into private health insurance, I am sorry but we simply do not support that. We should not be making a hurdle earlier and earlier over which people will trip and therefore be pushed into an insurance product. It is one thing to say that we need a strong private system next to the public system. What we are arguing strongly is that we do not need an insurance product to ensure a strong private system. If the government wants to support a health system it puts money into health, not into an insurance product. Therefore I argue very strongly that we should not let this stay at $50,000 and let inflation eat into it so that people who are at the lower end of the middle and upper income scale get caught up in this progressively as wages increase. We are simply keeping the relativity between the lower amount, at which you begin paying the ordinary Medicare levy, and the higher amount, at which you are liable for the surcharge if you do not take out private health insurance.",SENATE,<title>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (CPI INDEXATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-05,—I did look in the budget paper but I could not find the disaggregated tax expenditure record for the revenue raised by this `surcharge'.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-03-05,"—I was only given this bill to handle in the last couple of hours, but I believe these amendments were only circulated late today. I know for sure that we do not have estimates of the revenue implications of Senator Lees's amendments. As I recall reading earlier, we do have in the legislation estimates of the cost of indexing the lower threshold.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-03-05,"—The bill has only recently appeared on the Notice Paper; indeed, I understand that the minister's office was quite surprised that it was called on today. Therefore, we did not circulate our amendments ahead of time as we were expecting this some time later. However, these are quite simple and straightforward amendments. Senator Sherry, we also need to remember that, if we do leave it at $50,000 and people's wages are indexed and end up higher than that, if they are pushed into private health insurance the government is going to pay 30 per cent of the cost of it anyway. So it is not just a pure cost; we would also have to take off any amount that the government will also have to pay by way of the 30 per cent rebate for those who end up going into the insurance process.",SENATE,<title>MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (CPI INDEXATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-03-05,"—I was not being critical of the Democrats about the distribution of amendments. It is just that we have not done any costings on these amendments because we did not see them until today. But there are costings on the government measures in the bill, and it is a cost of some $56 million over this financial year and leading up to 2002-03.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-05,"—I will not thank Senator Campbell for the answer. What concerns me about that answer is that there is a trend in government budget papers to not disaggregate so-called surcharge revenue. I am pleased that you have taken on notice my question in respect of the Medicare levy surcharge. I note in passing, and you were here earlier to hear my contribution during the second reading debate, that in Budget Paper No. 1, statement 5, page 5-10, under `Company and other income tax', in `Superannuation funds' there is no disaggregation of the surcharge figure either.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-03-05,"—I noted during the second reading debate that the discussion had moved across a whole range of legislation and that that was not unusual during second reading debates. But it would be entirely inappropriate to take your question on behalf of the Assistant Treasurer on a bill that has nothing to do with that subject. If Senator Sherry wants that information, I am sure that he can seek it through a question on notice or during questions without notice at 2 p.m. tomorrow afternoon or any other afternoon.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-05,"—That is a disappointing response. As I have said, this does impinge on the theme of consistently hiding particular figures in the budget. The surcharge in respect of Medicare and the surcharge in respect of superannuation are two points that were raised during the second reading contributions. 
By way of general comment on Labor's attitude to the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats, there does appear to be some logic in the argument put forward by the Australian Democrats. Both during my second reading contribution and here I touched on the so-called superannuation surcharge, which is indexed at the bottom end and at the top end. However, we do have a basic problem. The amendments were circulated today, as I understand it. I accept Senator Lees's comment that the bill was brought on very late and, in fact, that she did not have knowledge of it until today. The basic problem in our supporting the Democrats amendments this evening is that we know so little about the Medicare levy surcharge and who is actually paying it. As I said earlier, the 2000 tax expenditure report records that the surcharge income has dropped from $140 million in 1999 to a projected $25 million in the current and future years. We would like some further information. Apparently, the great bulk of taxpayers have been forced to take up private health insurance by the combination of the levy and the Lifetime Health Cover rules, which make it more expensive to pay the tax than to pay health insurance.
When the surcharge was first introduced, the Labor opposition argued that the funds should be earmarked for public hospitals so that those who chose not to buy private health insurance would, in effect, be paying the equivalent as a contribution towards the cost of their treatment in the public system. The Liberal-National government did not accept that view and, since that time, has squeezed the public hospital system and refuses to fully index the payments to the states, despite the finding of an independent arbiter who was appointed to determine the rate at which Australian health care agreements should be indexed. What we do not know to date is who is still paying the tax and what the revenue impact of the proposed change would be. I think there is a strong case for the government to be required to table the facts about the levy, and I am pleased with the assurance given by the parliamentary secretary. I will reserve judgment on the details until we receive a response from the government, along with an assessment of what the impact of the Democrat amendments would be. 
As I said earlier, I do not reflect on Senator Lees and the Democrats regarding the arrival of the amendments today. The government has brought this legislation on today, so we have not had the time that we would have liked to deal with the information, as I outlined earlier. The opposition think that possible indexation is a valid issue and we will look at it further, but because of the timing of these amendments we will not be supporting them this evening.

For the record—and I certainly hope I am not getting too sensitive about these things—in relation to the scheduling of the Medicare Levy Amendment (CPI Indexation) Bill (No. 2) 2000 and the circulation of amendments, the bill was on the forward program for today, so it was general knowledge that that bill was coming on. For people who were aware of the program, I think it looked like a very doable program, unlike many Monday programs, and that bill was listed for today. We are slightly ahead of schedule, which is unusual for the Senate. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,20,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-03-05,"—We are debating the Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Bill 2000 and the Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill 2000, which seek to give legislative effect to the reserves measures announced by the government on 22 December 1999 in relation to call-out and on 24 August 2000 in relation to other issues.
The Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Bill 2000 seeks to widen the circumstances in which reserves can be called out for compulsory continuous full-time service. It begins a process of modernising the structure and organisation of the reserves of this country and empowers Defence to implement an employer support payment, or ESP, to compensate employers for the absence of an employee on extended reserve service. The Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill 2000 implements a graduated series of protections and benefits that will apply to various forms of service in the reserves. It includes a prohibition on discrimination and employment, rights to defer and to resume studies and, in the case of compulsory service following call-out, to postpone certain financial liabilities.
I indicate at the outset that the opposition will be supporting these bills, although we have reservations remaining about some aspects of the bills, including our continuing concern about the government's failure to properly address problems confronting the defence reserves. These will be detailed in a second reading amendment which I will move shortly. Much of the content of these two pieces of legislation is derived from opposition policy. Rather than the criticism we so often hear about the opposition being policy lazy, the government has taken the lazy way out itself in relation to this legislation. It has plagiarised the opposition's policies, including reinventing the concept of a Ready Reserve, which was abolished in the first couple of years of the Howard government.
The bills we are debating today are products of a particular political and policy context. The coalition, since gaining office, has stated time and again that the reserves would have to shoulder a growing proportion of our national defence effort. The government has slashed the number of full-time Defence Force positions by approximately 8,000 as part of its so-called Defence Reform Program, yet the more the coalition has made statements about reservists needing to play a larger part in the Defence Force, the more recruitment has plummeted. Thus, in the 12 months to June 2000, the number of active Army reservists actually shrunk by a massive 18 per cent, from fewer than 22,000 to a little under 18,000.
To appreciate the seriousness of the recruitment position of the Army reserves, I will refer to comparative data that has been compiled by the shadow minister for defence, science and personnel, my colleague Mr Laurie Ferguson. It covers the eight years commencing in July 1992. In the first six of those years, the Army reserve managed an average of 4,800 recruits each year. In contrast, over the last two years we have seen the worst recruiting outcome for reserves in living memory. In 1998-99, the number of recruits collapsed to 2,281, and last financial year it fell even further to 1,566. Amongst the reserve community, there was almost universal agreement that various coalition policies were directly contributing to this problem. 
On Anzac Day 1999, the then Minister for Defence, Mr Moore, announced he had commissioned a paper from the Chief of the Defence Force on the state of the reserves, to be finished by June 1999. In the event, apart from the announcement about call-out, it took cabinet until August 2000 to tick off measures to assist the reserves. In the intervening period, the problems of recruitment and plummeting morale got worse, and this is the real background to the bills that are before us today.
I turn now to the major changes that the government proposes. Under sections 50E and 50F of the Defence Act 1903, the reserve forces can at present be called out for continuous full-time service only in extremely limited circumstances. This limits significantly the ability of the reserves to contribute to the total range of functions that the modern defence force performs. Apart from a direct defence emergency, reservists can serve on a continuous full-time basis only as a result of an individual voluntary undertaking. Recently, East Timor and the Olympic Games have shown that many reservists will do this but at a real personal cost. The opposition have been open to reconsidering the current position regarding call-out because we recognise that there are some potential problems with the current situation. The modern defence force not only is involved in the protection of Australia's territorial integrity but also participates in peacekeeping missions and the provision of humanitarian assistance.
Under the current legislation, there is no real basis upon which reserve units can participate in these missions. Initially the government included circumstances such as war, a defence emergency, defence preparation, peacekeeping, peace enforcement, civil aid, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. After negotiations with the opposition, the government agreed to amend the bill to define all the circumstances in which such a call-out could occur. I stress that the call-out provisions we are talking about do not extend the established powers and functions of the Defence Force; they are concerned solely with the ability of Defence to require some or all of the reserves to contribute towards these existing functions. Nevertheless, the provisions do have obvious and possibly major implications for reservists, their families and their employers.
The bills also represent the first stage in a process of streamlining the structure and organisation of the reserves. Currently at least three separate acts deal with the basic structure of the Defence Force. They provide that each separate service shall consist of at least three components: permanent forces, emergency forces and the reserve forces. In fact, the Defence Act currently provides that the Army may consist of five separate components. The bills provide for the ADF to henceforth consist of a permanent force and a reserve force for each of the three services. This is a straightforward and sensible proposition. The bills also empower Defence to define training requirements for reservists. 
Together these provisions will enable Defence to implement by regulation a revised structure of defence service. We understand that the government proposes to establish five separate categories of reserve service, each with their own particular training and service requirements. Those five are likely to be high readiness active reserves, similar to Labor's now abolished ready reserves; high readiness special reserves, such as medical and information technology personnel; active reservists; stand-by reservists; and retired reservists. The opposition will reserve judgment on these proposals until we see the detail from the government.
The bills also empower the government to implement its announced employer support payment, or ESP. This compensates employers for disruption and additional expense caused by the absence of an employee on extended reserve service. The actual rules for ESP are not detailed in the bills and will be outlined in a subsequent regulation. The government has indicated that the ESP would be payable in respect of an employee's third and subsequent week of absence. It will be generally set at the rate of average weekly earnings, which is currently just under $800 per week, and will be payable to a range of employer classifications. In principle, the opposition is not opposed to the concept, but it reserves final comment on the ESP when the regulations are announced. The opposition also hopes that suitable monitoring and evaluation processes will accompany its introduction. 
Contrary to coalition claims, the ESP is not the first time that employers have been offered incentives to encourage their employees to serve in the reserves. Labor's Ready Reserve scheme, abolished by the coalition despite almost universal acclamation at its successes, incorporated a similar provision. The Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill implements a graduated series of protections and benefits that will apply to various forms of service and reserves. It includes a general prohibition on discrimination against an employee on the grounds that they are currently serving in the reserves, have served in the reserves or are considering serving in the reserves. In addition, it provides for additional but time limited employment protection for workers who are absent from the workplace on what is called protected defence service. This additional protection includes the right to have an absence treated as leave without pay that does not break an individual's contract of employment. Students who are serving in the reserves are also offered protection when they undertake certain forms of continuous full-time defence service. Finally, in the event of continuous full-time service that results from a call-out order, the bills provide reservists with certain protections in relation to their financial liabilities.
The opposition welcomes the thrust of these measures. Indeed, for some time we have been campaigning for just such legislation to be introduced along with organisations such as the Defence Reserves Association and the ACTU. I remind the Senate that back in October 1999 the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, introduced a detailed private member's bill on the matter. That bill was supported by the ACTU and by significant sections of the reserve community. At the time the government—in the form of Ministers Reith and Scott—insisted that there was no need for any new legislation and that the existing protections were adequate. I welcome the policy backflip and part appropriation of Labor's bill.
A variety of concerns have been raised with the opposition about the regime of protection that the government proposes. These concerns include the need to provide a means of mediation, a possible continuing role for the Industrial Relations Commission and an explicit power to order the reinstatement of someone who has been dismissed in contravention of the legislation. A central requirement is for a special mechanism to enforce the protections that the legislation supposedly provides. The government have indicated to the opposition that they will establish by regulation a special agency or office to perform this function. We welcome this decision which is consistent with Labor's own 1999 proposal to establish an office of reserve forces with broadly similar functions. This proposal was also incorporated into Mr Beazley's private member's bill.
The government has indicated that the key functions of its proposed agency would be to conduct mediation with employers and, in the event of this being unsuccessful, to seek redress in the courts on behalf of a reservist. It has also indicated that reinstatement orders could be sought under two separate clauses of the bill. It has also been suggested to the opposition that employers should reasonably expect to receive adequate written notice of the proposed absence of an employee on defence service. Defence has indicated to the opposition that it needs to do better in this regard and it has been suggested that a rejuvenated system of formal training notice to be given to the employer would best overcome this problem.
I turn now to the concerns that we have about the government's overall approach to the reserves. These concerns are summarised in our second reading amendment. First, we remain concerned that the government still appears unwilling or unable to articulate a coherent policy on the expected contribution of reservists and reserve units to our national defence effort. The Defence Reserves Association believes that reservists should not be committed for full-time service on a purely individual basis, filling gaps here and there in the Regular Army. While the changes to call-out proposed by the government could potentially assist in this regard, I can find no clear statement of the government's position on this matter. 
The government is also silent on the need to restore defence leave as an allowable award matter. I remind the Senate that the coalition's decision after the 1996 election to remove defence leave as an allowable award matter was taken despite strong advice to the contrary from the Defence Force. The opposition has a copy of the relevant official minute to the then junior minister, Mrs Bishop, which makes this advice perfectly clear. Minister Reith's foolish ideological reflex to strip back awards has absolutely undermined the ability of the reservists to serve. Since that initial decision, both the official Defence Reserves Support Committee and the Victorian Council of the Liberal Party have urged the government to reconsider—all to no avail. For our part, the opposition has introduced three separate private member's bills seeking to reintroduce the provision. On each occasion the government has gagged debate. I urge the government to reconsider this matter. 
But, of course, the government has been equally inclined to ignore sensible advice on the issue of common induction training in the Army. This system requires new recruits to attend a full-time induction course alongside those joining the Regular Army. According to the government's market research, this system is consistently raised as a key barrier to the recruitment of young people into the Army Reserve. Many were hopeful that cabinet would agree to replace common induction training when it considered the state of the reserves in August last year. While we hear constantly of change, the government is incapable of admitting that common induction training has had a negative impact on the Army Reserve. 
Our amendment also regrets the government's failure to implement employment and education protection measures before the deployment to East Timor. Our ability to properly rotate ADF units during our ongoing deployment in East Timor depended on the willingness of literally hundreds of reservists to plug the staffing gaps that were apparent in the Regular Army. Labor has nothing but admiration for those dedicated individual reservists who did so, and did so willing and selflessly. The employment, education and financial liability protections that are proposed in these bills are an admission that what happened on that occasion should not be allowed to recur. 
Our amendment also refers to the government's failure to reverse the dramatic decline in recruitment levels. The extent of that decline is on the public record, and I referred to it earlier in my contribution tonight. First we were told it was just a by-product of the state of the economy. Then the government proceeded to spend more on advertising, as if a few slick commercials—costing an awful lot of money—would solve the problem. Now it appears to believe that its proposed employer support payment will solve every problem we have. All the while the government has resisted indications that there were wider factors at work—like confusion about the role of the reserves, the lack of award and legislative protection, the obstacle of common induction training, poorly targeted recruitment efforts and the abolition of the Ready Reserves. There is also a degree of discontent about pay and conditions and access to equipment, and this is harming retention and recruitment efforts. Reservists feel they were short-changed by the coalition's new tax system—being slugged with the GST but receiving no compensation in the form of any increase to their training allowance. Being tax free, the latter did not benefit from the associated income tax changes.
In conclusion, I repeat that the opposition will be supporting these bills. They contain a number of positive measures—in fact a number of Labor measures, Labor initiatives—whose implementation we, of course, do not wish to delay. But, equally, we note that there is a lot more work for this government to do on these matters. The second reading amendment I am about to move on behalf of the opposition highlights many unresolved issues and signals to the government that the opposition intends to keep the pressure on with regard to the reserves, as we have done since the last election. I particularly commend the shadow minister for defence, science and personnel, Mr Laurie Ferguson, for his efforts in this regard. I think his efforts have been rewarded by the changes the opposition has seen forced upon the government in relation to this legislation. I commend the opposition's approach and move: 
At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate condemns the failure of the Government to introduce arrangements to optimise the successful operation of the Defence Force, including the Government's failure to:
	(a)	articulate a coherent policy on the expected contribution of reservists and Reserve Units to our national Defence effort;
	(b)	reintroduce defence leave for reservists as an allowable award matter;
	(c)	review its disastrous experiment with Common Induction Training in the Army;
	(d)	implement employment and education protection measures before the deployment of reservists to East Timor;
	(e)	reverse the dramatic decline in recruitment levels in recent years;
	(f)	address anomalies in pay and conditions for reservists;
	(g)	properly manage the provision of training opportunities and of necessary equipment;
	(h)	clarify ongoing levels of funding for its announced measures beyond the current financial year; and
	(i)	consult adequately with relevant stakeholder groups”.
—I rise to support the comments made in this debate by my leader, Senator Faulkner, but I also want to go a little bit further on some of the figures that will need to be explained later on in this debate. When I come to those, I will clearly flag them with the advisers, such that they might take note and answer some of the questions in relation to those figures. 
Interestingly, there is a fairly good description of the reserve system in the Bills Digest—Nos 70 and 71 of this year. It traces the background of the formation of the reserves and shows how from Federation the reserve concept came out of a militia concept which comprised conscripts. Those people were used internally but not in external affairs protecting the nation. Of interest in the background was the fact that since the Miller review in 1974 the reserves have struggled to find an appropriate role. The Bills Digest goes on to say that there have been some 14 inquiries or reorganisations that have impacted on the reserves. Bills Digest No. 70 indicates that the last inquiry was conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. That committee, commenting on the matter of reserves in its August 2000 report entitled From phantom to force: towards a more efficient and effective army, stated:
... despite all these reviews and inquiries, fundamental and sustainable reform to produce a useful reserve has not eventuated.
They characterised, out of those various reviews that are referred to, two major problems, the two major areas of concern being civilian employment pressures on reserves—and I will come to that later—and the call-out arrangements for reserves. So it is something that is well documented over time; it is not something that has just happened. But of course the current government have decidedly, as my colleague Senator Faulkner said, run down the reserves and the concept of the reserves. But now we are seeing a complete reversal.
In the figures that Senator Faulkner referred to on the shortfall in the targets in recruitment—and he actually referred to the number of people who were recruited—it is interesting to look at the percentage of the target that were recruited. In 1998-99 only 51 per cent of the target for reserves were recruited; in other words, it just was not the numerical number that was important; it was the target—and the target was missed abysmally. In 1999-2000, the number reached was only 31 per cent of the target number of reserve recruits required, and that is without any changes whatsoever—31 per cent of what the Army required. In 2000-01, at the recent estimates, I asked Defence personnel questions about how they were travelling at this stage. They were unable to tell me. They said they would take it on notice, and so I have no real indication at this stage. Nonetheless, it does seem that there has been a downward trend in recruiting within Defence. 
Also in the Bills Digest it was noted that there has been a substantial separation rate, and that came out of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry, where they said that in the year to December 1999, 23.45 per cent of reservists had left the Army. That was attributed to employment pressures and the nature of the reserve itself. In this year's budget, the 2000-01 budget, there was an allocation of $20 million for the reserve initiative. At estimates recently I asked how that $20 million was being spent, because it was something that was clearly identified as a one-off, special allocation within the budget.
It was interesting to hear the response that I got out of the people from the Department of Defence, the various officers and bureaucrats. I was told that the $20 million would not be spent this year; that only $10 million of that $20 million would be spent in this financial year. I was given a break-up of how that $20 million would be spent. I was told that $2 million to $3 million would be spent on the implementation of the employer support payment. That is interesting. Then I was told that $3 million would be spent on the acceleration of reserves of civil accreditation. That is for training programs, and that is out of a total of $4.8 million, which means that there is still $1.8 million hanging over for next year.
An amount of $0.35 million was to be spent on enhancement of the Defence Reserves Support Council, and that leaves another $0.35 million for next year; $1.5 million to be spent on a survey of reservists, money which would be totally spent this year; and $1.8 million to be spent on the development of the communications and public awareness strategy for reserves, leaving a small amount of $0.1 million for next year; and nil to be spent on swipe card technologies. And that money would all be spent next year.
But in the interesting category of the implementation of the employer support payment, there would be an outstanding amount—by my calculations—of between $6¾ million and $7 million in this financial year. One cannot blame that lack of spending on the opposition. It shows the inertia of the government. The government have had the opportunity to introduce this legislation and to get the legislation to work. However, what one finds is that the government have been tardy—once again. One finds that, whilst they are only anticipating spending $10 million this year, they are saying that $2 million to $3 million will be spent on the employer support payment and $6¾ million to $7 million will be deferred until next year.
That is predicated on two things. Firstly, there is the passage of this legislation, which we are quite prepared to support: bipartisan support is there. Secondly, it will depend on regulations. I understand that there are regulations to be brought down in relation to this legislation. That raises the question: what regulations? What regulations will be required? When will those regulations be ready? What will be the starting date of those regulations?
That further raises the question: how much of the money that has been allocated in this important area of the implementation of the employer support payment really will be spent this year, given that we are at March now? If there were a miracle drafting session implemented immediately for the regulations and the promulgation of those regulations, one would think that there would be very little by way of employer support payments in this financial year. It also raises the question: will the outstanding amount of the $10 million that is said to be spent this year be put over into next year's budget? So some reassurance on those matters is important indeed.
There is no doubt that the government have been slow to respond, and our involvement in East Timor in particular, as my colleague Senator Faulkner said, has shown the weakness in our defence forces in terms of the hollowness there, in terms of finding the appropriate people to fill the gaps that have shown up. As I said, almost $7 million by my calculations—and I do not think they are too far wrong—out of the proposed budget figure is dependent upon the passage of this legislation and will now be deferred in total until next year. Given the result of the reserve recruiting for the last three years, one wonders why the government have been so slow to respond on an issue that has bipartisan support—and that is an important point that should not be lost sight of in this particular case. 
I turn briefly to the problems that have been attributed to causing the difficulties in recruitment and also in securing the people necessary for training in the common induction programs. Senator Faulkner touched on the first issue, which is the withdrawal or removal of leave as an allowable matter for awards from the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996. Of course, that obviously had an impact on the people who were prepared to join and/or stay in the reserve forces. But it is interesting to note in Bills Digest No. 71 the comment on the Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill 2000. Under state awards and legislation, in reference to this particular piece of legislation, the comment is made:
There is a certain irony in the Government's defence of its policy to simplify federal awards (removing military leave). It has argued that the award system did not work and individual workplaces should determine their own arrangements for military leave. Yet the combined affect of the two Bills will serve to act as a clout against employers who will not co-operate by releasing (and reinstating) employees.
It describes that as `a clout'. So where it was seen as being anathema to an employee-employer relationship and removed from the Workplace Relations Bill and other legislation, here it is now being described as a clout against employers. Quite clearly, it is something that is highly worth while in the defence of our nation—and that is why it has the bipartisan support that it has. When one goes to the very start of the legislation and looks at the terms of that legislation, one finds why it is absolutely necessary to have that protection for those people who are prepared to put their lives on the line, to put themselves out, by joining the reserves, by joining the defence forces of this nation to protect our nation. That is the industrial relations side of it.
But then one turns to the training requirements. I did a little bit of research on this and I have not dug out every piece of mine that I could quote from estimates, but I am sure that those who follow me at estimates would like to do so and read them back to me at some stage. But I go back to the estimates held on 22 October 1996. It was Senator Chris Evans, who was heavily involved in the committee at that stage, who asked a question of Major General Hartley about the proposals then to introduce common induction training for the reserves. In response to a question from Senator Chris Evans, Major General Hartley said:
Clearly, we have to go through a process of determining how best we can use these reserve days. One of the options that we face, for instance, is having a longer period of initial training, which, presently, is two weeks. We might raise that to six weeks. 
That was the start of the change. Then we move to the estimates of 20 August 1997 and Senator West. I have not come to Senator Hogg yet, so I will not bore you completely. But Senator West, in discussion with Major General Dunn, said:
... my understanding was that the training program for reservists had changed, that it was moving from the two-week to the six-week. Certainly I have got a recollection of that from last estimates, but I have also got a recollection of seeing it in a television news bulletin.
Brigadier Boyle:
That is correct, Senator. What is actually happening is that as part of the revitalisation of the reserves—
I do not know whether Brigadier Boyle will ever regret those words `revitalisation of the reserves'—
particularly in 4 Brigade—
and 4 Brigade was the brigade where this trial was happening—
they are trialling a range of options for common induction training for both regulars and reserves. What that means for reservists is that we have had one large group, 550, over the Christmas period, trialled for a six-week, full-time training period, initial training, of that induction ... 
and so on. We pursued that over a number of estimates, never really sure whether the six-week training period was working but having a fair gut feeling that that was not the case. So we get to the last estimates on 21 February this year. On that occasion, I was having a discussion with Major General Willis. I said:
What is happening with induction training for the reserves?
Colonel Stedman responded:
That falls mainly within the purview of Army. Army have a policy of common induction training and their preferred solution for reservist recruits is that they go down and do a continuous 45-day period of training. However, Army have been looking at alternative solutions to that training based on modules and have developed an alternate approach with a three-week module followed by I believe a period of about a week back in the reservist's unit and another three-week module at some point in the future, I am not entirely sure whether it is within 12 or 24 months, to complete the equivalent of a common induction training single 45-day period over two periods of training.
So, if you think I was confused, you are right. I then went on and asked:
Has that been implemented yet?
Colonel Stedman:
I am not sure. I would have to take that on notice.
Then Major General Willis intervenes—and I quote:
I think it has. I think it might have started this year.
No wonder our reserves are in trouble: the people at the top do not know what is going on. What we have here today are important legislative changes, hopefully, that will bring some stability, some certainty and some surety for the reserves so that they have a reasonable and a sure idea as to the commitments that they need to take in terms of their training; and, secondly, that their employers have an understanding of the training that those persons will undergo.
One would hope that any trialling and any experimentation in this area will now be drawn to an end. One would further hope that there is a clear undertaking on the part of the government to ensure that this legislation works, that any sense of discrimination that exists currently is completely wiped out of the minds of employers and that employees have the confidence to enlist in the reserve, a very worthwhile and laudable task indeed.
I want to raise, once again, the issue of the regulations. As I understand, there are regulations to be brought down in terms of the employer support payment. I also understand that there are regulations to be brought down in terms of the agency which will be brought into existence to help people with complaints of discrimination. I also understand that there will be regulations in respect of the five proposed categories of reserve service and the training obligations attached to each category. There may well be other regulations that need to brought down as a consequence of this piece of legislation. Without holding the legislation up, if in the minister's reply we could have some indication of what the other areas where there will be a need for regulation are, when it is anticipated that those regulations will be drafted and when they will come into force, it would be very helpful indeed.
I believe that the second reading amendment moved by my colleague Senator Faulkner clearly sums up the position of the opposition—that we are supportive of the legislation that the government have been tardy in raising. It was introduced into the House of Representatives on 2 November and is being considered here only today. I commend the opposition's second reading amendment.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ENHANCEMENT OF THE RESERVES AND MODERNISATION) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-03-05,"—It gives me pleasure to follow my colleagues Senators Faulkner and Hogg in this important bit of—
—Are you supporting this?
—I am supporting it.
—That is two of us.
—We go to the same caucus, though. It does give me pleasure to rise and speak about this important piece of legislation, the Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Bill 2000, in relation to Australia's national security. If you read the digest of this bill, you will see that is was only two years after Australia became a Commonwealth, one nation, that the issue of militia volunteers, or reserve forces, was addressed. In one form or another, it remained that way until 1909 and was changed again in 1951. 
As Senator Hogg mentioned, in 1974 under a Labor government Dr T.B. Millar carried out a comprehensive study of the Army. He made certain recommendations in relation to reserve units and the Army in general. A number of Dr Millar's recommendations and reforms were pursued by various governments. However, despite the intentions of the report, the reserves never became the total force that was expected of them. Their structure and operations have been under constant review. In fact, the reason they never became the total force that was expected was budget and training constraints. Between 1987 and last year, a number of reviews and restructures occurred in the reserve forces. In fact, it led to the report From Phantom to Force: Towards a More Efficient and Effective Army—which you, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, may have been actively involved in. As you may recall from the hearings in relation to that report, a number of restructurings occurred in the reserves from 1981 right up until 1994. I quote from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade report of August 2000:
Despite all these reviews and inquiries, fundamental and sustainable reform to produce a useful reserve has not eventuated.
The committee found that the principal difficulties to reform were civilian employment pressures on reservists and the call-out arrangements for the reserves. This is the response of the government to that joint committee's report, From Phantom to Force.
As has been highlighted by both Senators Faulkner and Hogg, we do not believe the bill goes sufficiently far to ensure the issues that were raised in that very significant report by that joint committee are at all addressed. One of the things that is not addressed, as has been outlined by Senators Faulkner and Hogg, has been the issue of reserve forces pay. That is the case because the government has some ideological bent on wages and conditions based on the ability of an independent tribunal to determine what they should be and, in particular, because of the ideological decision of the government to take away certain items from determination by the commission. We will have to recognise in this debate—and I think it needs to be bipartisan—that, if we want a ready reserve and we want them capable of doing the things that are required of them as they sign up, then we are going to have to confront the situation, pay them better and give them better conditions. To a degree, that is addressed in this bill in terms of employees and employers.
Last year I had the fortune to be invited to the Lancer Barracks in Parramatta, the suburb that my offices are in. Despite Senator Tierney alleging last Thursday that my offices are in Phillip Street, Sydney, on I think the 11th floor—you may be able to correct me on that, Mr Acting Deputy President Campbell—my offices are in Parramatta in the heartland of the western suburbs. You have indicated the 12th floor, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Lancer Barracks are not far from my offices.
I went to the Lancer Barracks last year to see one of the servicemens parades at the invitation of the commanding officers, and I stuck around and had a talk and a drink with a number of the enlisted men and the reservists. They were very angry with this government. They felt they had been penalised because they were prepared to put away time and effort and possibly career opportunities to serve this country in a reserve capacity. They were equally angry with the government because a number of the financial fringe benefits had been taken from them, even though a number were still in place. These soldiers gave me the impression in no uncertain terms that, when their term in the reserves was up, they were no longer going to make themselves available. The reasons for that were, firstly, we are not prepared to give them the conditions and the protection they are entitled to, even though this bill does go down this path, and, secondly, by some ideological position of the government, the terms and conditions of the money that we want to pay them will not be determined by some sort of independent tribunal. 
I raise this because I think as a nation we are going into a four-year period of instability in our part of the world, and I will come to why I specify the four years in a second. In August 2000, 13 officers and 200 other ranks of the total Australian contingent of 1,550 in East Timor were reserves; 48 reservists were deployed in Bougainville; a rifle company of 55 reservists was located at Butterworth in Malaysia; and 200 other reservists were on full-time service around locations in Australia. 
We have all seen the newspaper and television reports of the harrowing tales about what has been happening in our region over the last 24 months. We only have to look at our own engagement in East Timor to see the massacres and religious and cultural fighting in Aceh. We have seen what has been happening in Borneo in the last few weeks. We wait to see what will happen in Fiji as a result of the High Court decision last week. We have a growing independence movement in west Papua New Guinea. We have the situations that occurred in the Solomons and in Ambon. And God knows what is going to happen in New Caledonia over the next few years. We have as our nearest neighbour New Zealand, a country which we have been to war with as allies. They appear to me to be not spending as much on their defence forces as should be expected. In fact, it would appear to me that their defence readiness is declining. So that leaves us here in Australia to look after this region and this region's interests. I am not sure that we go far enough in this bill to make sure of that.
As I mentioned earlier, the dissolution of Indonesia is before us, with all the difficulties that are besetting it. The former Suharto regime is being investigated for corruption. There is continued military involvement in political affairs. We have these ethnic clashes in Borneo, which, as I understand it, are related to forced migration of Madurese Muslims to that area from the 1950s. So all over our region we have this difficulty which we may be called upon to respond to. Maybe it will be a situation where we are on our own, we may be triple O, because the comments that are being made by the new Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell—and that is why I say four years—are disturbing for us. I think it is a serious situation for us and our national security in the future.
A very interesting article written by Mr Lawrence F. Kaplan was published in The New Republic of January this year entitled, `Yesterday's Man: Colin Powell's Out-of-date Foreign Policy'. Mr Kaplan is very critical of Mr Powell and quotes him significantly in his four-page article. I have a number of considerable concerns with what Mr Powell has said, and they will need to be pursued by our government, whoever is in power. One of the most overriding concerns is what Mr Powell sees as America's national interests as opposed to what I think has been America's leadership role and their interests in making sure that our globe is stable and secure. Mr Kaplan says: 
... as Powell put it in his autobiography, “Many of my generation [of Vietnam-era officers] vowed that when our turn came to call the shots, we would not quietly acquiesce in halfhearted warfare for half-baked reasons that the American people could not understand.” 
That one sentence contains the three central ingredients of Powell's worldview. The first, now canonical in the officer corps, is that military leaders should not “quietly acquiesce” to judgments by their civilian superiors about the use of force. The second, which has been enshrined in a doctrine named after Powell, is the refusal to wage “halfhearted warfare,” the insistence that every potential military engagement requires either overwhelming force or none at all. But the Powell Doctrine addresses more than just how to fight wars; it also addresses when to fight them—namely, for “vital interests,” not for “half-baked reasons” like “nation-building” and “humanitarianism.” Powell summarizes his doctrine this way: “[I]s the national interest at stake? If the answer is yes, go in, and go in to win. Otherwise, stay out.” Sounds reasonable enough. Just not for the world the Bushies are about to inherit. 
That is what General Powell's overriding policy might be in relation to the engagement of the United States in our world. In fact, in the Sydney Morning Herald of 19 January this year Mr Powell said that, in relation to Australia's number one regional concern, Indonesia, Washington and Canberra would `coordinate' their policies. He stated:
But let our ally, Australia, take the lead, as they have done so well in that troubled country. 
In the Canberra Times a day later, Mr Sulaiman Abdulmanan warned Australia:
I don't think it's a kind of mandate for Australia to intervene in what's happening in Indonesia.
Nor do I, and I am not sure exactly what the intent of Mr Powell's statement was. But it does leave me uneasy as to the future of our country and the obviously increasing instability in Indonesia. 
We have a situation where our forces could be seen to act alone as in East Timor. We may have to engage ourselves in other parts of the Pacific or South-East Asia on our own as a result of what appear to be Mr Powell's isolationist policies. I will quote again from the Lawrence Kaplan article. This is, once again, Mr Kaplan's view:
But, even in cold strategic terms, Powell's brand of foreign policy restraint is out of place in today's world. His definition of vital interests as consisting merely of sea-lanes, oil wells and canals would, if enshrined in official policy, translate into the abdication of American leadership. “In the aftermath of the cold war,” says Andrew Bacevich, a professor of international relations at Boston University and a retired Army colonel, “we have shouldered global responsibilities, including enforcing international norms, which Powell's vital interest criteria fail to address.” When America refused to act in Bosnia, for instance, the humanitarian crisis quickly began to threaten a vital American interest—the stability of the Atlantic alliance. Powell may not like it, but the United States remains the hinge of the international system. And when it sits idly by in the face of threats to that system, international order erodes. Quickly.
That is why I say that, in terms of this bill, the ideology that the government has adopted, particularly in looking after the wages and conditions of these men and women, is going to get in the way of our national interests and our national security. Already, as has been highlighted by Senators Faulkner and Hogg, we have a rapidly decreasing ready Defence Force. In August 2000, there were only 27,300 people, including reservists, in our defence forces. This figure is 3,200 short of the target of 30,500. This has partly occurred due to the failure to recruit sufficient numbers of reservists, as their numbers have drastically fallen by over 25 per cent—from 23,000 to 17,000. I do not think that either of the bills will reinstate defence leave as an allowable award item.
With all that I have spoken about in terms of my concern for our national security and what might appear to be the abdication of America in taking the leading role—something that she has done so well for so long, particularly in our part of the world—it behoves us to make sure that not only this government but any future governments take into account the fact that we need a skilled and ready reserve to ensure that our national interests and the interests that we determine as national, whether they are in our own country or overseas, are addressed immediately. One significant way to do that is to make sure employees and employers are adequately looked after and to make sure that we look after people who put themselves out to look after our interests by putting on the khaki, blue or grey. I hope that, when we have an opportunity to look at Senator Faulkner's amendments in the debate in the next period, we will make sure that these difficulties are addressed.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ENHANCEMENT OF THE RESERVES AND MODERNISATION) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2001-03-05,"—I do not want to let the opportunity to speak on this legislation pass, because it is important to Australia's defence. I listened with interest to Senator Hutchins. I wish I had listened to more of what he had to say. These two pieces of legislation, the Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Bill 2000 and the Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill 2000, are important bills and have, I believe, general community support. They will make for a more effective reserve component of the ADF to meet the changing demands posed by: firstly, Australia's strategic environment, of which we are all aware; secondly, the changing nature of modern civilian employment, because in the world in which we live many people have part-time jobs and other employment arrangements which make it difficult to operate solely on the basis of nine to five from Monday to Friday; and, thirdly, the increasing requirement to make employed reservists who have specialist skills that are essential for a modern and balanced military force available to our defence effort, whenever and whatever that might be. There is an increasing range of specialist skills that are not necessarily provided by the permanent ADF that the reserve is ideally placed to provide. 
This is about a user-friendly workplace for the reserve, and I think it is important to recognise that. Today's reserves comprise about 40 per cent of the total ADF. Over the next 10 years, reserves will become a more important element, given the likelihood of frequent and concurrent operations, and the reserves will increasingly become the only way to provide an essential surge capacity both in numbers and, as I mentioned, in specialist skills.
It is important to recognise that reserves are no longer simply a mobilisation base. In the last two years the ADF have utilised more reservists on full-time service than at any time since the end of World War II. They have done so in the humanitarian role that was played in PNG in the important job in Bougainville, where reservists I think have been able to serve during the whole period of the deployment; in East Timor, of course; and in the Pacific involvements we presently have. These bills are the result of policy initiatives to provide the flexibility that is necessary. The changes will enable the government to call out reserves as a whole or in part for a wide range of operations including combat, defence emergency, peace enforcement, peacekeeping, civil and humanitarian aid, and disaster relief. The legislation clearly shows the government is conscious of the responsibility to use the increased powers wisely. 
Importantly, the changes will provide the framework to introduce new categories of reserve service—again, a user-friendly workplace—to allow for some units and individual reservists to be held at higher levels of readiness. Also included in these changes are amendments that will protect the jobs of reservists and support their families and employers. Employer support for the reserve is obviously essential. This legislation will allow the payment of financial incentives to assist employers and self-employed reservists at the rate of average weekly earnings, presently around $800 a week. These initiatives are estimated to cost around $20 million per annum, and in my opinion this is money that is very well spent. It especially gives self-employed reservists a great deal of flexibility and encourages them to be involved in their training, and it also gives them a full-time commitment, if that is the way that they choose to go for perhaps a short time.
The government is determined to address the issues of reserve recruitment by redirecting the focus back to the communities from which reservists are drawn. Throughout regional New South Wales, these reserve units play a vital part in their local communities. Where I live in the New England north-west area, we have a very famous Army Reserve unit, the 12th/16th Hunter River Lancers. They have their regimental headquarters in Tamworth but in addition they have squadrons in both Armidale and Muswellbrook. There are others of which senators who come from New South Wales would be aware, like the 41 Battalion on the North Coast and many other units like the 1st/15th Armoured Regiment. These Army Reserve units comprise some 5,000 reservists in New South Wales. They will be very pleased that these bills will help the ADF to adopt more flexible recruiting and management strategies. This bills will also help in the retention of military experience by offering incentives to full-time members of the ADF to continue their service in the reserves rather than leave the ADF completely. Permanent force members will be able to transfer to the reserves and reservists to a lower level of readiness. This will help retain trained people in the ADF generally.
I want to finish by commending the role of the reserve in Australia's superb performance at the Olympic Games, in which I understand about 3,000 reservists took part, and for long periods of time—many months for some. I also want to commend them in their role in INTERFET and now in UNTAET in East Timor. All reservists should be proud of their efforts, and every opportunity must be given to reservists to do the exciting jobs that they give up their own time to train for, currently in East Timor and in Bougainville.  
I would like to make special note of some serving members of the 12th/16th Hunter River Lancers. Last week their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Phil Harris, welcomed back six members of his regiment who had been serving with the Australian contingents in East Timor, in Bougainville and in Butterworth, Malaysia. Two members of the regiment, Major Garry Stone of Armidale and Sergeant Rick Colefax of Tamworth, returned from four-month tours of duty in Bougainville. Corporal Grant Prendergast of Kingstown, Corporal Ian Hodgson of Armidale and Trooper John Bender of Armidale returned from East Timor, where they had served as armoured vehicle crewmen. Corporal John Keating of Tamworth returned from three months in Malaysia, where he was part of the security company for the RAAF base. I commend these bills to the Senate.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2001-03-05,"—I would like to conclude tonight a series of speeches I have been making on the federal government's Backing Australia's Ability initiative. This is a massive $2.9 billion investment in Australia's future which has benefits for the country's research and development industry, education, science and technology. Tonight I want to talk about the benefits this package will have in regional Australia. Coming from the Hunter Valley, I am pleased with the initiative and the funding that will be received under this program. Backing Australia's Ability is all about generating new ideas, bringing those ideas to life and turning them into success through either products or new services. This $2.9 billion is a major commitment to the talent of this country and the potential for local ideas to have a future. It is also a major commitment to the skilled work force in the growing areas of biotechnology, research, science and technology. 
I would like to briefly discuss the initiatives within Backing Australia's Ability that will benefit country Australia. Firstly, impediments to companies getting started will be removed, with businesses getting greater access to start-up capital funding. For small businesses this is a major boon. Small businesses play a major part in regional economies and are generally the largest employers of the work force in those areas. The initiative also ties into the $21.7 million new industry development program, which specifically targets agribusiness and technology in country Australia and is one of the key components of the innovation program. It will mean that agribusinesses will gain the skills and resources required to successfully commercialise their businesses, product technologies and services.
I have seen this sort of thing happen very well in the past in areas like Southern Cross University with their Cellular Valley: they take agribusiness and put together research, product development and major companies working in the pharmaceutical areas and create in a rural area a major new part of the economy. That has happened successfully and has become a major economic driver for the Lismore area via Southern Cross University. Similar things have happened in many other universities around New South Wales. I see it, for example, at the University of New England whereby its involvement with a number of research centres, such as Chiswick and the beef CRC, helps to drive that local economy. It has occurred also in the Hunter Valley, in my own area of Newcastle. The University of Newcastle is the largest regional university in Australia and it has become a major driver of the Hunter economy. Part of that is the research and development of the university, which is then turned into new product and services and helps create a new economy in regional Australia.
Within Backing Australia's Ability these regional universities will now be able to gain increased access to grant funding through the Australian Research Council. Those funds under Backing Australia's Ability have actually doubled. In a major Senate inquiry about five years ago I saw that ARC grants were delivering only about 17 per cent of the projects that were put up. Our estimate is that the figure is about double that, about 30 per cent—really first-class research that should be backed. Under this new initiative, Backing Australia's Ability, we are actually delivering a doubling in the ARC grants. That will then spread across projects in all universities and there will be a major boost to the regional universities because the total pool of money available up to the year 2006 will be $550 million each year—half a billion dollars into this world-class research pool. There will also be increased levels of infrastructure funding for regional universities. The pool of that money over the next five years has grown to $337 million, bringing in a much-needed improvement in the research facility base in all universities, including rural and regional universities. 
Also in keeping with the information age there will be a new $34 million online curriculum content program over five years providing very wide access to education. There is a new generation of Internet coming and it will provide a much wider and deeper technology that can be accessed and will enhance education right across rural and regional Australia. This is good news for many people out in country areas, particularly in my area of the Hunter Valley—towns like Dungog, Gloucester and Pacific Palms. People in these areas have had to travel many miles to universities and TAFEs and with this new technology they will be able to gain greater access. With innovations like the online curriculum content program that has been funded under Backing Australia's Ability those small towns will gain greater access to that type of education. People will also benefit from the government's plans to spend $155 million over the next five years creating 21,000 new undergraduate places with priority given to maths, science and IT.
In the Hunter Valley we are also seeing great ideas and examples of research and development moving out into the marketplace. In September last year the minister for industry, Nick Minchin, announced that a local company, Sensational Foods Pty Ltd, had been given a grant of $1.3 million for its seafood packaging business. This was the largest R&D funding for one particular company that has ever come to the Hunter Valley. The project will extend the shelf life of seafood. It is a very simple and effective idea. It is Australian technology, and not only will it improve our place in the Australian marketplace but it is also a type of technology which will have benefits right around the world. Research will benefit Australia's growing aquaculture industry and will profit from the value added market opportunity that extends shelf life. Sensational Foods is one of the Hunter's fastest growing companies, employing about 30 staff. That is just an example of what one company can do with a little bit of research and development—developed within the company but assisted by federal government funding. 
Under the innovation program companies who undertake research and development will be supported by the federal government in a number of ways. To provide an incentive for businesses to increase their R&D investment the government has enhanced the tax concession arrangements. This is very different from the way in which the Labor Party did it, which was widely scammed by some unscrupulous businesses. We did not really get much benefit from that. This government has more carefully targeted the concession up to a premium rate of 175 per cent, but it must have a labour related component of the R&D expenditure, thereby guaranteeing more employment in research and development.
Then to continue and enhance the spin-off opportunities from industry research collaboration the government will boost the cooperative research program by 80 per cent over the next five years at a cost of $227 million. More flexibility will also be incorporated so that larger CRCs can be established and small and medium-sized enterprises are provided with greater access to the program. One example of a CRC in a country area that is doing particularly well is the Reef Research Centre. This is carrying out research into how to minimise the spread of exotic organisms via ships' ballast water through the ports of the world. This research is being undertaken by two rural universities, the University of New England and the James Cook University. There are many other examples of successful investment in rural and regional Australia—investment that has come through R&D and through the support of this government. We have had a major boost in Backing Australia's Ability to this program and the outcome will be an expansion of the rural economy through this initiative.

Where staff transfers were involved, these occurred after discussions between agencies in relation to numbers, timing and conditions of employment.  Although the general approach of staff following functions was appropriately followed in most cases, in some instances the movement of functions did not result in staff movements but in subsequent financial adjustments.
The administrative arrangement changes, while not as extensive as some in the past, nonetheless were afforded careful management and in some cases staged implementation by agency heads.  As the changes were made alongside routine administrative and management decisions involving staffing levels and the performance of functions, it is not possible to attribute in the detail sought the precise implications of the changes.  Significant financial, staffing and management impacts were reported in agencies' annual reports.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Administrative Arrangements Orders</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,25,1,answer
