Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (09:03):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


In December 2010, the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Devel­opment and Youth Affairs (MCEECDYA) endorsed the Foundation to Year 10 Australian Curriculum in the initial four learning areas of English, maths, science and history. Ministers agreed that from 2011, states and territories will commence staged implementation of the agreed Australian Curriculum with substantial implementation to be completed by the end of 2013. The implementation date defined in the act needs to be replaced to reflect this decision.


The single implementation date currently prescribed by the act does not accommodate the different implementation time frames that will accompany each new phase of the Australian Curriculum endorsed by edu­cation ministers.


Nor does it provide a means of dealing efficiently with future additions or revisions to the national curriculum, which are an accepted part of curriculum development processes.


The proposed amendment to the act will overcome these deficiencies by introducing a standing regulation that prescribes both the national curriculum and associated implem­entation time frames as those authorised by education ministers via the Council of Australian Governments' Standing Council for School Education and Early Childhood, formerly known as MCEECDYA.


The new standing regulation will provide a mechanism to efficiently accommodate phased implementation of the Australian Curriculum, as well as any future additions or revisions to the curriculum endorsed by the standing council.


Debate adjourned.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (13:45):  I rise in the House this afternoon to pay tribute to a very great lady of the eastern suburbs of Adelaide, Jan Boyd-Turner, who passed away about 2½ weeks ago. Jan Boyd-Turner was a quintessential eastern suburbs Liberal supp­orter. She was a lifelong Liberal but in no way was she a one-eyed Liberal who always believed that the party was right. She spent her entire adult life as a member of the Liberal Party, as president of the local Leabrook branch, as president of the Bragg state electorate committee, as a very active member of my campaigns, and Ian Wilson's before me, and as an active member of the Liberal Women's Council. But she was not a person who simply accepted the party's positions. In the latter years of her life and also in the latter years of the Howard government she gave me a very hard time about asylum seekers and the government's approach to them. I very much welcomed her contributions to my federal electorate council and also to the local branch. She was a marvellous fundraiser. She welded together a wonderful group of women in the eastern suburbs. She was the mother of nine children, six from her husband's first marriage and three of her own, all of whom she has raised to be terrific adults and a marvellous family.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:01):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her claim last year in answer to a question about her achievements that she had delivered national occupational health and safety laws. 'Some public servants actually had tears in their eyes,' she said. 'It wasn't easy,' she boasted, 'but I got it done.' Can the Prime Minister confirm that national OH&S laws have not been delivered and that the year of decision and delivery has become instead a year of backflips and broken promises?

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:01):  I am afraid from his question that the Leader of the Opposition is betraying how little he knows about this important area of economic reform. What I was required to do in my capacity as the relevant minister was to work with state and territory colleagues around the country to enter an agreement which would enable parliaments around the country to enact model laws and then enable those model laws to be followed up with the required codes and regulations, which would mean that wherever you were in the country, wherever you worked, as a working person you would have the benefits of the same protections and standards and that, as an employer, you would not have to engage with different regimes in different parts of the country. 


The quote that the Leader of the Opposition is referring to is my quote about what happened at the ministerial council the day that we struck this historic agreement. That was a very important moment of microeconomic reform, 30 years in the seeking, which was then delivered through that agreement between ministers, and that agreement is being actioned. The only problem, of course, with actioning that agreement has been the issues of the Liberal government in Western Australia, which wanted in part to stand outside the system. I say to the Leader of the Opposition—



Opposition members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! A question has been asked, and the Prime Minister is responding to it. The Prime Minister should be heard in silence.




Ms GILLARD:
  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. We continue to work through with the government of Western Australia, and I was very pleased to see their cooperative attitude.


In coming to this parliament and playing politics with this matter, what the Leader of the Opposition is really betraying is that he does not care anything about the future of our country and the strength of our economy. First and foremost, I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he really thinks these major microeconomic reforms are so easy, why wasn't it achieved under the Howard government? In 11 long years, this microeconomic reform was never achieved under the Howard government. COAG after COAG, then Prime Minister John Howard would go and sit down with his counterparts and enter agreements saying that he was going to get it done, and it never got done. It took this Labor government to strike this agreement after more than a decade of neglect by those opposite.


If those opposite are in any doubt about the power of this agenda—this agenda we continue to pursue for a seamless national economy—then I suggest they put down their politics of protest for two or three minutes and actually go and talk to some of Australia's leading businesspeople who have been here in the parliament for the Business Council of Australia meeting. What they will find is not underestimation of the signifi­cance of this reform; they will find deep understanding of the significance of this reform. They will also, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to ask them, wonder with him why this reform was not progressed under the Howard government. So to the Leader of the Opposition I would say: when you have a track record of no achievement, it seems a little bit odd to be criticising those who have achieved.




Mr Abbott:
  Mr Speaker, on a point of order—




The SPEAKER:
  The Prime Minister has concluded.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (15:21):  I seek leave to add to an answer.


Leave granted.




Ms GILLARD:
  At the commencement of question time today the Leader of the Opposition asked me about occupational health and safety laws. For the further information of the House, the agreement that I struck required states and territories to have their new model laws in place by 1 January 2012. I can advise the House that New South Wales has passed its laws, Queensland has passed its laws, South Australia introduced its laws for passage on 19 May, the ACT will be introducing its laws for passage tomorrow, Western Australia will harm­onise—they have said they will do that and they have the balance of the year to do it and be on time—and Victoria has the balance of the year to do it and be on time. As for the Commonwealth government, we released an exposure draft for consultation on 26 May and the bill will be legislated in the Spring sittings this year. That means this is exactly on time, exactly as promised and occup­ational health and safety reform being delivered by this government. That eluded the Howard government for 11 long years. If you want success on streamlining our economy, look to a Labor government, not to the conservatives.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (15:24):  I move:


That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Kennedy from moving the following motion:


That this House:


(1) notes that the Cowboys Queensland and Australian halfback Jonathan Thurston will front the NRL Tribunal tonight to face a contrary conduct charge following contact with a referee in a match with the Warriors on Saturday night;


(2) notes that, if found guilty, Jonathon Thurston will miss two NRL games and also be ineligible for selection for the decider State of Origin match on 6 July;


(3) notes that the citing by the Match Review Committee stemmed from an incident in which both the halfback and referee were looking in a different direction from that in which they were moving. Neither party could be regarded as culpable, responsible or even as initiating the incident;


(4) notes that the Courier Mail has labelled this citing by the Match Review Committee as arrogant and hypocritical, and as a 'pathetic act of desperation'.


(5) notes that, in light of the facts of this case, this citing by the Sydney based Match Review Committee could be regarded as irresponsible or, even possibly, mischievous.


(6) notes that this most trivial of citing, if endorsed, will deprive tens of millions of Australians of the great excitement enjoyed by a State of the Origin decider and NSW of their right to winning fairly.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The member for Kennedy will resume his place.

(3) calls on the Government to continue to support parents in their right to chose a school which they believe best reflects their values and beliefs, by not penalising parents who wish to make private contributions towards their child's education, nor discouraging schools in their efforts to fundraise or encourage private investment;


(4) notes the many submissions made to the Review of Funding for Schooling by non government sector authorities requesting that changes to school funding arrangements not leave schools or students worse off in real terms;


(5) acknowledges that any reduction in government funding for non-government schools would need to be addressed by increasing the level of private income required to be raised by the school community (such as school fees), or through a reduction in the quality of the educational provision in affected schools; and


(6) calls on the Government to make a clear commitment to the continuation of current funding levels to all non-government schools, plus indexation, and for this to be the basic starting point of any new funding model resulting from the Review of Funding for Schooling process.

That this House:


(1) acknowledges the importance of the role that non-government schools play in reflecting the diversity of Australian society and serving a broad range of students, including those from a variety of religions, social backgrounds, regions, and socio-economic circumstances;


(2) supports the continuation of a funding model into the future that distributes funds according to socio economic need and which recognises that every non-government school student is entitled to a basic level of government funding;


(3) calls on the Government to continue to support parents in their right to chose a school which they believe best reflects their values and beliefs, by not penalising parents who wish to make private contributions towards their child's education, nor discouraging schools in their efforts to fundraise or encourage private investment;


(4) notes the many submissions made to the Review of Funding for Schooling by non government sector authorities requesting that changes to school funding arrangements not leave schools or students worse off in real terms;


(5) acknowledges that any reduction in government funding for non-government schools would need to be addressed by increasing the level of private income required to be raised by the school community (such as school fees), or through a reduction in the quality of the educational provision in affected schools; and


(6) calls on the Government to make a clear commitment to the continuation of current funding levels to all non-government schools, plus indexation, and for this to be the basic starting point of any new funding model resulting from the Review of Funding for Schooling process.

That this House:


(1) expresses: 


(a) its greatest concern at the SA Government's decision to slash support for its Remote Areas Energy Scheme which subsidises off-grid generation for isolated communities; and 


(b) great concern that the reduction in subsidy will lead to escalating power prices for businesses of up to 100 per cent, recognising users will pay as much as $0.60 per kilowatt hour; and

The SPEAKER
 (15:29):  I have received a letter from the honourable member for Cook proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: 


The unfolding failure of the Government’s border protection policy and the urgent need for it to be transparent with the Australian people on how they are dealing with this matter.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2011-06-22,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (15:29):  It is almost eight weeks since 7 May, when the Prime Minister made the announcement of her proposed people swap deal with Malaysia. In fact it will be eight weeks this Saturday. Late on a Saturday afternoon, just after 2.30—the usual time for ministers to make very important announcements of government policy—she gathered the media together to announce this proposed agree­ment. She was so excited about this agreement that on 7 May she twittered: 'Have reached agreement with the Prime Minister of Malaysia to tackle people smuggling in the region.' She was so excited about it that, on 8 May, she twittered again: 'We're a generous country. We'll do what we can to stop the evil of people smuggling.' And then again on 8 May—she was not finished—she twittered again and sent a message for people smugglers.


Every since then there has been absolute and complete twitter silence from the Prime Minister when it comes to updating the Australian people on where the government is up to with this agreement. I did go and check the other tweets as to what she might have been talking about since then, and she was happy to talk about a whole range of matters. I noticed in particular that the Prime Minister retwittered the Treasurer, 'Swanny DPM'. She was happy to retweet the Deputy Prime Minister, but when I went through all of those 30-odd tweets since her first one, there was one member of the government that she had not retwittered. I wonder who that was. I wonder who it was that the Prime Minister did not want to retweet. There is one minister in the government that the Prime Minister did not want to retweet, and that was the Minister for Foreign Affairs. There was no retweet for the Minister for Foreign Affairs that talked about the progress that they were making and the efforts that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been making to get this historic agreement with Malaysia over the line. We could not find it because the foreign minister had not been doing it and, even if he had, the last person on earth that this Prime Minister would retweet would be the Minister for Foreign Affairs.


So, after the celebrated announcement on that day, the Prime Minister said: 'We will be working to finalise the agreement over the coming weeks.' That is almost eight weeks ago. And then on 2 June the minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in response to this question from Tony Jones, 'Are we talking weeks or months?' said, 'We're not talking months, Tony.' Jones: 'Weeks?' The minister: 'Yes, we're talking weeks.' That was about 20 days ago. So we will see whether it is weeks or months, but we will see. At least the minister at the table—and here I give him credit—was prepared to talk about time frames for the completion of this significant agreement.


On 9 June, just a few days after this, Fran Kelly was interviewing the Prime Minister. She asked the Prime Minister: 'Prime Minister, when will Australians see this deal? Has the UNHCR signed off on the Malaysia deal and when will it be finalised?' Prime Minister: 'Well, we're working with Malaysia to get all the details of the agreement right, the discussion et cetera, et cetera.' Fran Kelly: 'Days, the weekend?' Prime Minister: 'Fran, I'm not here to announce time frames. We are working very well with our Malaysian counterparts.' Some weeks before she was very happy to talk about time frames. She was very happy to talk about imminent announcements, but some eight weeks later this deal has still not been done and this government is not being upfront or transparent with the Australian people about what is involved in this agreement. 


This is a significant agreement because it will have real implications for people's lives, as I know the minister across the table understands. This is a difficult area of policy and the decisions you make in this area of policy have significant implications for individual human beings. All of us, I expect, understand this and understand it only too well. But what is a problem here and what concerns me is that when this agreement was entered into and rushed out the door late on a Saturday afternoon before the budget, critical issues had not been addressed, and critical issues had not been resolved. These fundamental issues included the question: 'Will people be caned?' The minister made all sorts of comments about what he may have said—weeks and weeks and weeks after the event. But, at that time, there was no indication at all that the issue of caning had been resolved.


There are still a multitude of questions to be answered. Those questions have been put in this parliament, as they should be—they have been put in the Main Committee and in here, the main chamber. The Australian people want answers about this arrangement. Among those questions are the following: would children who were sent by this minister to Malaysia under this agreement go to public schools in Malaysia? It is a pretty basic question. I put that question to him only last week and there was no response. With the 800 who are sent to Malaysia, where will they receive their hospital treatment? Where will they go to hospital? How long will they stay in Malaysia? The minister at the table is all too quick to talk about how long people spend in detention, even though under this government's administration the average time spent in detention has increased threefold. No wonder we average three critical incidents every single day in our detention network. The time in detention has tripled. This minister is all too happy to talk about time spent in detention, but I have a simple question for the minister: how long will people stay in Malaysia under this agreement? Also, how long will the funds provided for under this agreement last to support those people while they are in Malaysia? Is the answer six weeks? Is it six months? Is it six years? Is it 20 years? The minister well knows that it is an actual consequence that could take place as a result of the agreement that he has brought into this place, and that is something which the minister needs to be upfront with the Australian people about. He needs to be transparent with the Australian people about the real implications for individual human beings from his decision to enter into this agreement. 


There is another area he needs to answer questions on, and the member for Macquarie raised this in question time today. The member for Macquarie asked the Prime Minister about the activities of what is known as the RELA Corps. According to research undertaken by the Refugee Review Tribunal, the RELA Corps is a volunteer paramilitary force whose members now number in excess of half a million. RELA members have the right to carry arms and arrest anyone reasonably believed to be an undesirable person, an illegal immigrant or an occupier. The regulations authorise RELA members to question suspects and enter premises, either public or private, without obtaining a search warrant, where there is reason to believe suspects are housed. Should a suspect refuse to answer questions, produce requested identification or comply with reasonable requests or should they make a statement or produce a document that the RELA member believes may be false—so it is up to the RELA member to determine whether documentation or tags are true—then RELA personnel may arrest them. No warrant is necessary. The same amendment referred to here in this document gives effective legal immunity to RELA members so that they cannot be prosecuted for any act or omission done in good faith in their capacity as RELA officials.


They are very significant powers. It is half a million of these volunteer officers that the minister at the table—the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship—is relying on to ensure that, in any arrangement he puts in place, people who are sent to Malaysia will not be subject to any human rights abuses. He is relying on 500,000 people. I refer the minister at the table to a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council, in which it was found that most RELA personnel had not been trained and that those trained had followed only a one-day orientation course. I asked the minister in the Main Committee just the other day how much of the funds that he is putting into this agreement are actually going to go to support the training of these people to ensure that any procedures he puts in place will be carried through and that he can have confidence about those arrangements.


I also draw the attention of the minister at the table to comments by Amnesty International's refugee spokesman, Mr Graham Thom. He is well known to both of us, and he is a very good man. He says this about the situation in Malaysia:


Refugees are copping it every day. Once they are arrested, their documents are often disregarded or destroyed, and they are charged with being illegal and are caned …


This is the report from Amnesty Interna­tional. This is the desk evidence that is there and available to us, and these are the questions that I still cannot get an answer to from this minister. Frankly, if the minister is not prepared to answer these questions in this place for the Australian people, then I am prepared to try to go and get those answers for myself. I am prepared to go to Malaysia and find out from my own on-the-ground research and to see the circumstances into which people will be sent under this government.


The response of the minister at the table and the government's response to my intention to visit Malaysia has been nothing less than hysterical. Never has a government been so obsessed with an opposition as this government has. We have a Prime Minister obsessed with the Leader of the Opposition. We have a minister for immigration obsessed with the shadow minister for immigration, constantly craving my praise for his initiatives as he walks in here saying, 'Why won't he praise me?' I will tell you why I will not praise him. I will tell you why this opposition will not praise this minister. It is because he is overseeing an absolute farce. In his rush to this deal, in his anything-but-Nauru strategy, the minister at the table knows that he is embracing the unthinkable in Malaysia. So we will go to Malaysia and we will seek to understand the circumstances for those who will be sent there and those who will live there.


This is a government that is so obsessed with the opposition, that is so keen on telling the opposition how to do its job. The Australian people would love to give this government a chance to see if it can do opposition better than this opposition can, to see if this government can do in opposition what it thinks it can do in government, because this government is obsessed with the opposition. I am quite happy for this side of the chamber to give the government a chance to be the opposition it truly wants to be. That is what the Australian people want, and if the minister wants to have a chat with the Prime Minister then I am sure that can be arranged at an election at some time soon.


So I will go there, but it is not just me who has these questions. Here is Lawyers for Liberty adviser Eric Paulsen talking about this deal in the Malaysian press:


""We don't know much about it,"" he said. ""Will asylum seekers be allowed employment? Can their children attend public schools? Will this information trickle down to law enforcement officers on the ground? Will a future group also receive the same exemption?""


Then we have the refugee advocate Irene Fernandez, the executive director of the local human rights group in Malaysia:


Diplomatic assurances from Australia would not protect them, she said. And no one could find out anything about the swap deal because all such matters come under the Official Secrets Act, ""sparking a lot of rumours"". Her organisation had obtained a meeting on the issue with the Australian High Commission a week ago, she said. ""But they were unable to tell us anything.""


The Australian people are in the same shape. They do not know what is in this deal, but the more they know about this deal, the more they do not like it. The more they see about this deal, the more they see how desperate this government is. They understand that there is better alternative than what this government has put forward.


When I go to Malaysia, my argument will not be with the Malaysian government. The Malaysian government have a right to act within their borders to address the challenges that they have, according to their laws and according to the international obligations that they have signed up to. That is for the Malaysian government. My problem is with this government. My problem is with a government that has decided to send 800 people into that situation. In that situation we need to understand what it will mean if we are going to take that decision. I encourage the minister to undertake exactly the same visit I will undertake this weekend. I will go there to understand, and I will take the advice that Mr Thom gave to the Prime Minister when he said:


Prime Minister Julia Gillard should educate herself on the type of harassment faced by refugee women in Malaysia.


The minister might think it is a stunt to go and understand the situation faced by refugee women in Malaysia. Graham Thom, the head of Amnesty International on these issues, does not think it is a stunt when it comes to understanding the conditions faced by women in Malaysia, and neither do I. This government has a better alternative available to it, but it simply refuses to take it up, for no other reason than political pride. Nauru and temporary protection visas are more cost effective and more humane and, as the government and the Australian people all know, it is the proven alternative. Pick up the phone.

Mr BOWEN

 (
McMahon
—
Minister for Immigration and Citizenship
) (
15:45
):  I have to break a few things to the shadow minister. Firstly, I break it to him that I am not obsessed with him. I know he might be disappointed about that. I have many interests and I do not think the honourable member for Cook is a bad man, but I am not obsessed with him. He might be disappointed to hear it. But we do know, with all due respect, that he has some obsessions. I think what we are seeing here is that he is concerned that some of those obsessions might be adversely affected by this government's progress in developing a regional framework, reaching bilateral agreements under that regional framework—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The honourable member for Wannon does not appear to be in his seat.




Mr BOWEN:
  and breaking the people smugglers' business model while improving protection outcomes across our region. What the opposition is really concerned about is that when you pull the rug out from under the people smugglers' business model you pull the rug out from under the business model of cheap slogans. You pull the rug out from under the business model of one-liners. You pull the rug out from under the business model of no substance and all slogan. That is what this shadow minister is really concerned about.




The SPEAKER:
  The honourable member for Wannon is warned.




Mr BOWEN:
  He knows that this policy could break the people smugglers' business model. He knows that this policy says, 'If you get on a boat in Malaysia, take a boat to Indonesia, get another boat to Australia'—as the majority of asylum seekers who arrive by boat do on that journey from the Middle East—'then you will be taken back to Malaysia where you started the boat journey.' The question that asylum seekers and people smugglers would have to ask themselves is, 'Why would I pay the money and risk my life to be returned to where I began that boat journey?' That is why this proposal from the government breaks the people smugglers' business model in a way that no action taken by the Liberal Party ever did when they were in office. Nothing the Liberal Party did when they were in office could remove the guarantee of being resettled in Australia.


If you ask the Liberal Party about a problem, they will say the answer is Nauru. But the opposition had the chance—again, 15 minutes—to answer some fundamental questions on Nauru. We will come back to that. Again, we saw those questions unanswered. The opposition have said for years that Nauru is the answer, but they have not provided any details or substance to that. What we saw is more hypocrisy from the shadow minister for immigration.


Let us go through the hypocrisy, because there are several elements to it. Firstly, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister say: 'It is outrageous that we would take 4,000 people out of Malaysia. It is unfair. Why would we take so many refugees from Malaysia?' The Leader of the Opposition said in this House at the dispatch box last week:


The problem with the Prime Minister's people swap with Malaysia is that it is unfair to our country. Why should we take five times the number from Malaysia that they are taking from us? It is unfair and it is costly.


That is the view of the opposition—we are taking too many refugees from Malaysia. They think it is bad; they think it is unfair. We would say that it is unfair not to. We are proud of the fact that we are taking 4,000 refugees from Malaysia who have been mandated by the UNHCR and who have been waiting patiently for resettlement, in many cases, over many years. Asylum seekers in Malaysia do face difficult situations. So why are the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition so opposed to taking 4,000 genuine refugees from Malaysia?


Let us get to the second element of my honourable friend's hypocrisy. The honourable member for Cook has the policy—I think this is still the policy—that they would turn back the boats.




Mr Perrett:
  The boat phone!




Mr BOWEN:
 They would have the boat phone at Kirribilli House. 'Turn back that boat,' Prime Minister Abbott would say. 'Turn it around. Send it back to Indonesia.' Turning back the boats means that they would be sent to Indonesia when Indonesia have said they will not accept them. The Indonesian government said, 'We will not accept boats that are returned from Australia,' when the opposition made that policy. The shadow minister said, 'No, that was in response to your policy announce­ment.' When the opposition announced in the election campaign that they would turn back the boats, the foreign minister of Indonesia said, 'We won't take them.' That was not in response to anything the government said. It was in response to a policy announcement from the Leader of the Opposition that he would have a phone on which he would take control of the Navy and personally order the return of the boats. That is their policy—turn back the boats to Indonesia.


Here is a question for the shadow minister for immigration. If you are going to turn back the boats to Indonesia, what protections are you going to have in place for the people returned to Indonesia? When you drop them off at the jetty in Indonesia are the kids going to be able to go to school? If they need to go to hospital, where are they going to go? What protections are going to be in place? How long will they be there? All the questions that the shadow minister asked about Malaysia he cannot answer about Indonesia, which is where they would return the boats to—putting aside the fact that Indonesia have said they will not take the boats and that it would risk the lives of asylum seekers and our naval personnel.


The position of the opposition is that it is not okay to take people to Malaysia under an agreement which ensures that their status is protected, which ensures that they can have their claims for protection considered by the UNHCR, which ensures that they will not be returned to a country from which they are fleeing danger, which ensures that they have those protections in place and which also increases our humanitarian intake to its highest level since this side of the parliament was last in office in 1996. That is not okay and it is unfair, according to the opposition, but it is okay on the high seas to turn the boats around, risk the lives of sailors and asylum seekers and drop them off at a jetty in Jakarta and say, 'See you later,' with no protections in place whatsoever. That is the hypocrisy of the opposition.


Then we have what is, I must confess, my personal favourite from the member for Cook—the old Iran solution. We saw the member for Cook last night again on Lateline. He said that Iran are a signatory to the refugee convention. Oh, the government of Iran are a great human rights champion! They are champions of human rights over in Iran! We love them. The member for Cook loves them more. Last night we saw him with his shovel out on Lateline, digging away, digging himself out of the hole. He said:


It wouldn't be a bilateral deal involving Australia or even one that Australia would advance.


I thought that was interesting. Then the member for Cook said, 'Read the speech.' I will do better. I will read it to the House. This is what the member for Cook said in November:


In my view, Australia’s participation in a regional solution for Afghanistan should seek to trade off Australia taking more refugees out of the camps in countries of first asylum in that region in return for the ability to return those who have sought to advantage their asylum claims through illegal entry to Australia, to those same camps or other safe places established for that purpose, as part of the regional solution.


Sounds like something which involves Australia to me. The member for Cook's solution was proposed last November. He said, 'I've got this great idea: a real international solution that will involve Australia returning people to Iran,' because they are strong on human rights in Iran! Perhaps the member for Cook is about to announce a fact-finding mission to Tehran where he can outline the protections that are in place under his agreement. I would be interested to see it. I am not going to Iran because I have no interest in doing a transfer agreement with Iran. You do, and you can go to Iran.


Then we have the member for Cook saying he is off to Malaysia on the weekend to satisfy himself about the conditions there. He has appointed himself ombudsman for asylum seekers in the region. Our old friend the ombudsman, as the member for Chifley likes to call him, has appointed himself ombudsman to ensure their conditions are protected because he cares so much about asylum seekers. This is a man and a party who would send people to Nauru, a country that would not grant visas to people who wanted to monitor the situation when we had over 1,000 asylum seekers, who were Australia's responsibility, in Nauru. If a journalist wanted a visa—denied. If a lawyer wanted a visa—denied. Nobody else could go to Nauru but, while the member for Cook thinks it is so important that he goes to Malaysia, he was willing to send people to a country which would not issue visas to people interested in pursuing and monitoring the situation in Nauru. That is the hypocrisy of the opposition.


Then we hear them say that it is more humane to send people to Nauru than to Malaysia. That is something which really takes the cake. The opposition go around taking any opportunity to criticise the support and care that is given to people who are asylum seekers in Australia. They take any opportunity to say they are getting too much—their pillows are too fluffy, they get Foxtel, they get telephones so they can ring their family members. How outrageous that this happens! 


Then we see the opposition crying crocodile tears about the human rights of asylum seekers. They say that Nauru would be more humane. The only way the Nauru option provides any disincentives to come to Australia is the fact it left people on Nauru for an inordinately long period of time. We saw the effects of that. People were assessed by psychiatrists appointed by the previous government as suffering great psychological harm.



Mr Morrison interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The honourable member for Cook has had his opportunity to make a contribution.




Mr BOWEN:
  He gets a bit obsessed, Mr Deputy Speaker, so we give him a bit of leeway. And this is what they said about people who had been left in Nauru: 


The nature of symptoms shown maintains their depression will produce an inevitable cycle of further deterioration. The most important symptoms in this regard are hopelessness, worthlessness and self-blame, cognitive impairment, withdrawal and sleep dependence. Instead, frustration and anger have turned inwards against themselves, contributing to the risk of self-harm and suicide. While the group considers the level of risk with regard to mental health, it is clear that the current environment and circumstances are dominant contributors to their condition.


The shadow minister says, 'They will not be in detention; it will be an open centre.' The report states: 


The fact that the centre operates as an open centre makes little difference to the mental health of the residents. 


It goes on and on. For the opposition to say that Nauru was a humane solution, that Nauru was a solution which was good for asylum seekers, is the height of hypocrisy. 


Then they say that it would be a good solution because it would break the people smugglers' business model. I invite the shadow minister to take any opportunity that he chooses to tell the House or the Australian people where people transferred to Nauru under the opposition's proposal who are regarded as genuine refugees will be resettled. Which country? Name the country. Will you go to the UNHCR, which did not cooperate with Nauru last time and which said that it will not cooperate with Nauru this time, despite the claims of the opposition? Where would they be sent? The answer is that they would be sent to Australia—unlike the Malaysian agreement which means that people transferred to Malaysia would not be resettled in Australia in the terms of the agreement. It breaks the people smugglers' business model in a way the previous government could never do. 


There are some members opposite who recognise that. We know that the member for Cook moved a motion in parliament last year supporting the so-called Nauru solution. We know that there were two members of the opposition who were paired from that vote, and they still lost that motion. They say that the parliament is sovereign. They still lost the motion on Nauru, but apparently that is a different standard. We saw the members for Pearce and McMillan not vote in that division, and the shadow minister says: 'There is nothing in that. They are okay. It is not because they did not support the Nauru option.' The member for McMillan is a good man and I like the member for McMillan a lot. He is a decent man and he is an honest man. We saw on 17 June—




Mr Morrison:
  Be careful.




Mr BOWEN:
  The member for Cook says, 'Be careful.' The member for Cook might disagree with me, but I think he is a good man. He said, 'I don't think the parliament would support the Nauru solution for many reasons.' He also said this: 


Temporary protection visas didn't work before and I don't believe they'll work again. We will only end up with a whole other people that are held here with no future. 


That is what your own backbench things about your policy—the member for McMillan belling the cat and saying what he thinks about your policy. 


What we have is a situation where this government has entered into an agreement with Malaysia under our regional framework negotiated in Bali—something the previous government could never have achieved—in consultation with the UNHCR, which ensur­es that people transferred from Australia to Malaysia will be treated with dignity and respect. I have said this before and let me make it clear again to the House and the member for Cook: people transferred from Australia to Malaysia will not be illegal immigrants. There is a regime in place for Malaysia which deals with illegal immigrants, and it is fair to say it is a hard regime. But people transferred from Australia to Malaysia are not illegal immigrants; they are people transferred with the agreement of the Malaysian government. 


The honourable member for Cook can visit detention centres, but these people will not be held in detention centres. He can make all the allegations he likes. They will not be caned. They will be treated with dignity and respect, and they will have protections in place. What we are doing is pulling the rug out from under the people smugglers' business model because—and I agree with the member for Cook and I think he agrees with me—people smugglers should not make the decision about who comes to this country. People who come to this country for resettlement should not have to risk their lives on a dangerous boat journey to come to Australia. If I am obsessed about anything, it is breaking the people smugglers' business model to ensure that we do not have people risking their lives on people-smugglers' boats. It is about time the shadow minister for immigration had the same obsession. (Time expired)

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-06-22,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (16:00):  The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has just had 15 minutes to outline to the parliament some of the arrangements that he believes need to be put in place for the people who are sent to Malaysia and to answer all of the questions that the opposition and many others in the community have asked—legitimate quest­ions about what the fate of people who are transferred from Australia to Malaysia is going to be if this deal is actually ever concluded by this government. He was not able to touch on or answer how people who are sent to Malaysia will sustain themselves. He was not able to answer whether the children who are sent there will go to school. He was not able to answer any of the basic questions about the protection of their human rights. He came in and he gave his usual rant. He professed that he was not obsessed with the opposition spokesman for immigration, the member for Cook, and then proceeded for 15 minutes to talk exclusively about the member for Cook. There is probably a therapist he could call for that, but perhaps he would be best off concentrating on his portfolio and explaining to the Australian people what is going to happen if this Malaysia deal ever does come to pass.


Amongst Labor's extensive failures in their four years in government, border protection is surely one of the most disastrous. On coming to office, they found themselves with a situation where the people-smuggling trade had been destroyed, there were four people within our detention network who had come here illegally by boat, and the administration of that detention network was costing the Australian public millions and not billions. But, within the space of four years, they have managed to push the people smugglers back into business, they have cost taxpayers literally billions of extra dollars, they have trashed any semblance of a coherent regional foreign policy and they are currently presiding over the essential collapse of our immigration detention network. Things have been so bad in border protection that Julia Gillard was forced to knife Kevin Rudd—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The Prime Minister, I think you are referring to.




Mr KEENAN:
  and she cited Labor's border protection catastrophe as one of the reasons why she was required to do that.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Stirling will refer to the Prime Minister by her title.




Mr KEENAN:
  I will do in future, Mr Deputy Speaker. But, as with two of the areas that she nominated as reasons that the government had lost its way—the carbon tax and the mining tax—she has managed to take a bad situation and make it worse. One of the first things she did when she came to office was to axe the border protection committee of cabinet. This Prime Minister was so concerned about border protection, so concerned that the government had lost its way on border protection, that she abolished the highest level decision-making body that they had for dealing with the problem. That body was not even a year old. It had been announced by the former Prime Minister as a central part of Labor's response to people smuggling, and they had shelled out $2.8 million of taxpayers' money on it. When the Prime Minister was asked about that in the parliament today, she said: 'I prefer to just send these things to the National Security Committee of Cabinet.' I think her record of attending that National Security Committee of Cabinet speaks for itself. Clearly that shows how she prioritises border protection. 


Secondly, she came up with the so-called East Timor solution. This is probably right up there with the people's assembly on climate change as one of the silliest ideas that has ever been floated by an Australian Prime Minister. It was announced in the heat of an election campaign without anyone within the government of East Timor having been consulted, and they rightly killed the policy from day one. Whilst Australian foreign policy professionals had to trawl around the region exposing themselves to extreme ridicule, the government pretended that there were still ongoing negotiations with the East Timorese, when everybody with even a vague familiarity with this problem knew that that just was not true.


Then came the PNG solution. The Labor Party were going to reopen Manus Island, something that the Papua New Guinean government was apparently well disposed towards, but they still managed to bungle that by sending up such a low-level member of the government—because we know the Minister for Foreign Affairs would not deign to touch these issues. They sent up the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs. The fact that he was such a low-level emissary from the Australian government so offended the Papua New Guineans that they refused to make any progress on the arrangement, even though both sides of politics there were apparently well disposed towards it. 


Then the Labor Party came up with the Malaysian people-swap deal. In a deal that highlights what savvy negotiators the Labor Party are, they have managed to get the Malaysians to take 800 of ours for 4,000 of theirs and we will get to pay the total cost. According to the Prime Minister and her hapless minister, this was a done deal with only minor details to be sorted out. It was announced on a Saturday eight weeks ago. Since that time, the immigration minister has been out there briefing journalists that it is about to be signed. They briefed journalists that the Malaysian Minister of Home Affairs would be on his way down within the next few days. That was a few weeks ago.


Why Labor announced an arrangement before they concluded it is a great mystery. It was an incredibly silly thing to do because it completely undermined the very little leverage they had with the Malaysian government. They made a desperate negotiating position even worse. They had a position that was so weak they could only arrange a five-for-one people-swap. Then the government went further and they undermined any possible leverage that they could use through a panicked public announcement of these half-baked arrangements. 


They have spent the eight weeks since then—and the minister has done it again today—congratulating themselves on 'breaking the people smugglers' business model'. I have news for the minister and for Labor: they are the people smugglers' business model. If they want to destroy the people smugglers' business model, the best thing they could do is resign. People smuggling had been destroyed when they came to office, and they took a defibrillator and reinvigorated it—they zapped it back into life. The people-smuggling community are probably about the only ones left supporting this Prime Minister. The people smugglers have this government's measure. They understand that the Labor Party are all spin and no substance on tackling their evil trade. That is why, since this announcement was made eight weeks ago, they have actually sent more people illegally to Australia than arrived in the last six years of the Howard government. The people smugglers have seen how these guys opposite operate. They do not take them seriously, which is something they share with most of the Australian people.


The worse things have become, the more Labor has resorted to spin and misinformation in trying to hide the true state of affairs from the Australian people. After 15 minutes the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship was completely and utterly unable to provide this House with even the most basic details of the ongoing negotiations with the Malaysians. What exactly has been going on for the past two months? Why has this minister been briefing journalists, saying that an agreement is imminent? What is actually going to happen and how is this deal going to operate? Labor cannot even tell the Australian people what is going to happen to the people who have arrived since this deal was announced and who are currently detained on Christmas Island. The government insists they are going to be transferred to a third country, but it cannot say if Malaysia is going to accept these people or if Malaysia will have the right of refusal over people who arrive here. It cannot say if Malaysia will accept people who arrive in Australia without documentation, which is a pretty important point considering that about 80 per cent of people who arrive here illegally do not have any documentation.


The minister has been briefing the media, saying that the people who are sent to Malaysia are going to be tagged somehow. He is seriously telling people that he believes that is going to protect their human rights. The government has absolutely no idea what fate is going to befall the people it sends to Malaysia. It does not know how they will be fed or how they will sustain themselves. People there do not have work rights. Imagine if you were sent there and had a family—what would you do if you could not work? What would you be required to do to support them? You know that your children will not be educated. The government certainly cannot guarantee that people will not be subject to corporal punishment. These are legitimate questions, which the Australian people are right to ask, and the government should be providing answers to them.


We do not even know basic details about how people will be transferred to Malaysia. In the wake of the Oceanic Viking debacle, when asylum seekers were able essentially to hijack an Australian government vessel, we must wonder what would happen if that were repeated on a charter flight or an Australian Air Force flight that was flying people from Christmas Island to Kuala Lumpur. The government has not provided the Australian people with any details about the security that will be provided on flights. Will it be provided by the Australian Federal Police? If so, what powers will they have, particularly once that plane lands in Malaysia? Will the Malaysian authorities be responsible for taking people off if they refuse to get off the flight? I asked the Minister for Home Affairs exactly that series of questions last week in the House. His response was so vague as to be worthless. Quite frankly, he should just have stood up, shrugged his shoulders and stopped wasting everybody's time.


It was once possible to give these guys the benefit of the doubt about some of these policy questions. But when they have such an astonishing record of failure and incompetence, the time to provide the benefit of the doubt has well and truly passed. The eight weeks of silence since the Malaysian deal was announced show that it has gone completely off the rails. There is certainly a better way, and I ask the government to— (Time expired)

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-06-22,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (16:10):  A few weeks ago I visited Christmas Island with two members who are in the chamber now: the member for Moreton and the member for Stirling. I had never been to Christmas Island and I found that it does take a considerable amount of time to get there. I went there as part of the Joint Select Committee on the Christmas Island Tragedy. While obviously I am limited in what I can discuss in reference to the deliberations of the committee in relation to those terrible events of 15 December, I can say that the trip was revealing to me in many respects and helped to form new approaches and perspectives on this issue.


As all members do, from time to time I receive emails from people who feel strongly about either side of this debate. During the course of the last two weeks I was prompted to respond to someone who felt strongly about the whole issue and—speaking candidly to the House—about the issue of Malaysia. I reflected on my experiences on Christmas Island and, in particular, talked about the visit we undertook to the place where those 30 people who had attempted to come to Australia perished on the rocks. I talked about the 20 people presumed dead and about the video that we had seen as part of the committee hearing. That video was taken from the perspective of the Royal Australian Navy and detailed the efforts being undertaken by the RAN to save those people. I talked about the responses the RAN personnel gave about the film of diesel that covered the water off Christmas Island that day, and about the fact that whenever a member of the RAN was trying to lift somebody out of the water and into the boat, the forearms of the people who were trapped would slip through the fingers of the RAN personnel because of the diesel that covered the ocean and those people.


I remember the trauma that was still evident in the faces of the first responders, who appeared before the committee, who were forced to witness what happened that day and were helpless to assist people who were only a couple of hundred metres from shore and trying in all desperation to get ashore. Some of those first responders, including residents, said that they had thrown ropes to people in the ocean but that just as people were about to scramble over the top of the jagged rocks the swell would take them back out and then crash them back into the rocks. That would trigger a response from the people climbing up, who would let go of the rope and fall into the water. It was not just a case of those people coming back up over the rocks. As was put to us, any person who had a life jacket survived; anyone who did not have a life jacket did not survive. Forty-two people survived, 30 did not and 20 are missing, presumed dead. If you fell into the water without a life jacket, you were gone.


I do not think, as the minister said at the dispatch box, that anyone should make that journey. In some quarters there is a view that idealises people smugglers and tries in some respects to portray them as heroes. These people are profiting from the misery of others. They are profiting from misery and desperation. They do not adhere to the traditional view of people who are supposed to be in command of vessels—masters of vessels—that they should transport people only when they know full well that their vessel is safe and secure and that they can vouch for the welfare of the passengers on that vessel. They cannot do that. From my own perspective, I appreciate that there will be people that are moved by a concern that is, I would say, founded on an improper belief—that is, that sending people to Malaysia under this arrangement would put them in harm's way. We have heard what the minister has said—what clearly many of us regard as sacrosanct—which is that, with the benefit of guidance and input from the UNHCR, people being sent to Malaysia will be treated with dignity and respect.


But, most importantly, can I just say: it is a far better situation than having people in desperate circumstances make that trip across the ocean at their peril. Admittedly, the events of 15 December were highly unusual, as people told us on that day—in particular, some said that in living memory they could not recall the conditions being as bad as on that day. But no-one should be put in the position where they take that trip—two days across the ocean, 500 kilometres out from Jakarta, and take a risk that they will just land and they will find sanctuary—when in actual fact the people smugglers will not vouch for their safety. The people smugglers will not guarantee that safety and they are simply profiting from, as I said previously, the desperate plight of others. That is why I think it is important to place on the record that I do support the solution being advanced by the government. I believe it is a necessary one to deter people from making that decision to put their lives, the lives of their children and the lives of their loved ones in a terrible position where they risk all to come here.


The other reason I support what the government has put forward is that we are doing something qualitatively different, which is to significantly increase the number of people who are able to come to this country via Malaysia as refugees. They are denied the false and misguided belief that, if they hop on the boat, it is a quicker path here. We liberate and, for a group of people who believed they would not have hope, give hope for a second chance at establishing themselves in a new country and improving their lot. Those 4,000 refugees who will be admitted to our country, and the people I have spoken of warmly in this place who have set themselves up as model citizens, because they have been given the benefit of a second chance, will be able to benefit from the arrangements the government is putting forward.


I know there will be people, even those who support me, who will fundamentally disagree with the position I am advancing. But all I can say to them is that I wholeheartedly, and deep within me, believe that the solution we are putting forward is in the best interests of those who would contemplate making this trip and those who currently are stuck in another country, chiefly Malaysia, who seek a better life, who have sought refuge and who we can provide that refuge to.


In terms of the opposition putting forward this notion of transparency, it beggars belief that this could be advocated through this MPI. If you review the history of when they sat on this side of the House, when they were urged to be transparent, when they were urged to correct their approach, the only time they took action was when people within their own government refused any longer to tolerate the litany of mistakes and errors and the fractured nature of the system as it was under the former government, and they tried to force change. As I have previously recounted, we only need to go through, for example, the circumstances of Vivian Solon, who was unlawfully removed to the Philippines in July 2001. Four years later it emerged she had been deported and the government had known of the mistake at least two years earlier. It was never transparent in this House on that fact. Then there was Cornelia Rau, who was an Australian permanent resident unlawfully detained for a period of 10 months in 2004-05. Peter Kazim was held in detention for seven years. There was also the mother and daughter Virginia and Naomi Leong. Virginia Leong, a Malaysian citizen, was arrested and placed under mandatory detention in 2001 for attempting to leave Australia without the correct papers.



All these people suffered under the previous arrangements administered by the former government—no skerrick of transparency or openness. The other side, not willing to abide by the notion of transparency, now advocates that others should be transparent. We have provided the detail on 1,200 questions submitted by the opposition through the Senate estimates process. We have opened ourselves up to transparency. We are prepared to do the right thing by people who would tempt fate and travel over the seas to get here. We have done a far better deal for those people than what those opposite ever imagined they could do. (Time expired)

Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (16:20):  It gives me great pleasure to rise on this matter of public importance today because I think we might have found another recruit for this side of the House in the member for Chifley. He indeed strikes me as a fine, upstanding moral citizen. I am a little worried that some of his strategies to achieve a given outcome are odd, perhaps even way out. But his intent of stopping people getting onto leaky boats at high monetary cost and at potentially the cost of their lives and the lives of their families is exactly the intention we have on this side of the House. The proof of our ability to achieve that, of course, is now recent history. When the Rudd government took over in this place there were four detainees in Australia—just four detainees. Years prior to that there was a great influx of illegal people-smuggling vessels. And we, through effective policy, stopped those boats arriving. Through the member's own admission, that is exactly what he wishes to achieve as an individual, he says. For goodness sake, why does he not say to his current leader, 'Simply put in place policies that will reverse those policies put in place in August 2008 and go back to a working system as introduced by the Howard government that stopped people declaring themselves as refugees, paying people smugglers to engage in their horrendous, often treacherous trade resulting in death at sea'? It is so simple. 


Over a number of years the Howard government put in place policies that stopped the boats. Those policies, of course, included offshore processing of refugees and they included the issuing of temporary protection visas. Temporary protection visas, to the satisfaction of the UNHCR, gave refuge to those persons who were persecuted in other countries until such time as those conflicts had been put to rest. Those policies—very simple, humane, effective and sympathetic policies—put an end to the flood of boats arriving on our shores with people seeking refugee status. These people had put their lives and the lives of their families at risk to get onto those boats. Families paid their hard-earned dollars to a people smuggler. It stopped. The member for Chifley ought to come across and join us, because our endeavours are exactly the same. 


The point that we make, however, is that the processes that are being proposed presently have very, very little chance of success. We believe they will have no more success than the policies that have been put in place since the Rudd government came to power. Of course, all those policies did was effectively to say to the potential arrivals on our shore that would pay people smugglers: 'Come on down; the gates are open. The welcoming committee is here for you.' No-one, no rational person in the government today, can stand up, hand on heart and say to the Australian people, 'We have policies that secure our borders and are effective in stopping the flood of illegal persons to these shores.' You cannot do it and therefore your credibility is shot—shot as in so many other areas. The Prime Minister herself, Ms Julia Gillard, back on 27 June last year was explaining to Laurie Oakes why she had knifed Kevin Rudd for the leadership. She said: 


… I took control to get the government back on track. 


It is interesting to reflect on that statement, given today's polls. She said also:


I'm obviously concerned about asylum seekers, about boats. I've indicated that concern, and I think the Australian community feels it. 


Well, I can assure her on that point she was dead right. The Australian community feel it, all right. They want the flow of boats stopped and I believe they want a government that will do just that, and they have no faith in the current Gillard government to stop that flow of boats. She said also: 


I believe in doing the effective things to manage our borders. 


By that the people of Australia thought she would manage the borders to make them secure, to make them non-porous, to create a barrier between those that would come to this country illegally, unannounced and often unwelcome and those that would come instead as refugees through the formal process. What the Prime Minister in fact meant was: 'I will manage our borders in a way where I will conduct the traffic, I will regulate the traffic and I will direct the traffic. I will not slow the traffic. I will direct the expenditure of Australian taxpayers' dollars. I will do it in a way to increase the budget from $1 million to $1 billion of Australian taxpayers' money per annum to look after refugees that come here through a process that risks their lives.' It ought to be through a process which is condoned by the UNHCR and which is done in a regulated manner so those persons are checked, have their credentials verified and come to our shores in a regulated manner. Why on earth would somebody be on that side of the House as part of a government with failed policies when they express a point of view in this place that they sincerely desire a satisfactory outcome where people smuggling stops and people are not tempted to take to the sea in leaky boats? It is frankly beyond me. 


We call for transparency of process. More importantly, of course, we would like the cessation of the arrival of the boats. But we have asked today for you to explain why there is transparency lacking in your process, specifically in relation to the deal you are trying to cook up with Malaysia. That is a very interesting thing. I understand that the Malaysian proposition has been formulated on the basis that the easy approach to this problem—accommodating refugees and processing them in Nauru—was unacceptable to the Prime Minister because Nauru was not a signatory to the UN convention. It may be of interest to anyone that ever hears or reads my comments to find out that Malaysia is not a signatory to that convention either. Is it not interesting that Nauru was unacceptable, even though readily available and almost instantaneous, but Malaysia—in the same category of not agreeing with the UN convention—is acceptable? It beggars belief. I recall the member for Chifley mentioned something about our MPI surprising him. I suggest that it is beyond belief that the Prime Minister can find cooking a deal with Malaysia to be satisfactory, Malaysia not being a signatory, but doing an easy, instant deal with Nauru is not considered because they are not signatories. As a matter of interest, in regard to signing that convention, the Nauruan government has signed an instrument of accession to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, formally beginning the process of its ratification of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. If the past is any indication of the time it will take in the future, by the time the Prime Minister is in a position to actually announce a signed deal with Malaysia, I suggest that Nauru would possibly be a signatory. She ought to phone Nauru now and get the deal going that will make them part of the process that will stop those boats coming here, which after all is what the Australian people expect of a government.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-06-22,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (16:30):  With great pride, I rise to speak on this matter of public importance and thank the member for Durack for what I guess we would call a contribution. Firstly, I want to point out how complex this problem is. Border protection is a very complicated issue. We know that we are a large continent. We know that our borders are quite significant. The member for Durack has a large electorate, and the previous one was an even larger electorate, and he would know how difficult it is cover a large area. In terms of border protection, Australia has to patrol an area equivalent to 11 per cent of the world's oceans. Australia does not have 11 per cent of the world's population, but we have to patrol 11 per cent of the world's oceans to make our borders safe—1.54 million square nautical miles.


I would like to commend Rear Admiral Tim Barrett and all the ADF personnel, the Customs personnel, the Federal Police and all the people involved in the Border Protection Command. They do a fantastic job. As the member for Chifley stated the other day, we have been involved in the inquiry into the Christmas Island boat tragedy. Not only have members of the Border Protection Command appeared before the inquiry; they assisted the committee when we visited Christmas Island, where we met high-ranking officers as well as those doing the work on the ground and out on the ocean. They are all incredibly professional. I want to commend them for what they do, and I want to take issue with the suggestion in the MPI that somehow they are falling down. The reality is that, since the Gillard and Rudd governments have been in office, approx­imately one per cent of illegal vessels are arriving, whereas previously approximately 10 per cent arrived. We have gone up to 99 per cent protection, you could say. With the reality of patrolling 11 per cent of the world's oceans, we will never get it perfect. The radars in Hollywood movies just do not exist. The reality is that small, wooden boats are almost impossible to detect with radar from any great distances, even if the ocean is flat and calm. When there are hurricanes, cyclones and the like, it is even more difficult. Unfortunately, we saw that outcome with the boat tragedy.


Once upon a time, there was a season when people smugglers put people into boats. Before we made the Malaysia announcement, there was a rush of people coming down here in all types of weather and we saw the tragedies that unfolded there. As I said, I commend Rear Admiral Tim Barrett and all the ADF personnel for what they are doing. Also, I read in the paper the other day about the endeavours of some other Australian agencies that operate beyond our borders that have had success in intercepting people before they pay the people smugglers and get onto boats and make those dangerous journeys. The efforts of those agencies are great to see.


I am proud to be part of a government that has more assets patrolling our borders than any other governments in our history. Now up to 99 per cent of boats are being stopped, whereas previously it was about 10 per cent. The Gillard government invested $1.2 billion in the 2010-11 budget to bolster our border security. This is building on the $654 million border protection and anti-people-smuggling package announced in the previous budget. We have eight new Bay class patrol vessels. We met some of the Navy personnel working with those. We have 18 vessels and 17 aircraft, which operate out of South Australia and Darwin, doing some great patrol work. It is boring and monotonous work but work that keeps us safe in our beds at night.


We also gave extra resources to our regional partners. We are going beyond our borders to wreck the people smugglers' business model. We announced $24.8 million in extra funding to law enforcement agencies in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for funding extra patrol boats, surveillance aircraft and communications equipment, helping the Indonesian National Police detect and disrupt people—as we saw the other day—and new land based policing surveillance and investigative equipment for partner law enforcement agencies in the region. We are working with our neighbours, understanding that we are connected to the rest of Asia and this part of the world. We gave $5 million to develop new computer forensic capabilities with the Indonesian National Police. These are great initiatives that are good for our nation as a whole and obviously making our borders more secure. In November last year, Minister O'Connor announced a $2 million package for the new maritime radio communication system to help Indonesia combat maritime threats. These are the practical solutions and practical realities that show that the Gillard Labor government are working to protect our borders. We are being transparent about this. All of these announcements are in media releases and in the budget packages. There is nothing secretive at all about this.


The reality is that those opposite are taking a punt on a stunt. We saw that in Nauru, which was a total waste of money. We see that in the foreshadowed visit to Malaysia. Nauru never did break the people smugglers' business model. Where did 90 per cent of the people who ended up in Nauru finally put down their roots? They are either in Australia or New Zealand. There is something there that people smugglers can sell. Obviously we need to break that business model. As the member for Chifley stated—he is on the same inquiry—we should do so not only because it is good common sense for Australia but also, and more importantly, because it will save lives.


We saw a few months back a big story in the Age and Daily Telegraph about a missing boat with perhaps up to 100 people gone. That is horrible, but what is even more horrible is watching people drown, which is what the Australian Navy personnel have had to do, as well as the people on the parliamentary inquiry looking into the SIEV221 and the 50 deaths that are associated with it. The reality is that we need to do whatever we can to save lives.


I will be the first to admit—or the second to admit, because I think Minister Bowen said the same thing—that Malaysia is tough. It does not have the same justice system as Australia. It has the same roots but it has evolved slightly differently. It has provinces that have sharia law. Malaysia is a country of contrasts; we know that. It has a proud history. Some say that, if the Macassans had had flags, maybe they would have claimed Australia when they came here in the 1500s and 1600s to trade with Aborigines. It has a proud history, but it is a country of contrasts. I would suggest that the Petronas Towers are the most beautiful buildings in the world. I know that is a big call for people who have been to Paris and New York and other places, but for me they are the most beautiful buildings in the world. Then you can go to other provinces in Malaysia where there is strict, harsh sharia law embedded in the justice system. So Malaysia is a country of contrasts and it will be hard to protect every single person who goes there. I hope the member for Cook gets out of there safely; I am sure he will. The reality is that Malaysia does have a slightly different system to Australia, but I go back to the member for Chifley's point: if we can save lives with this exchange of 4,000 for 800 and also give those people who have been sitting patiently in the Malaysian refugee camps a chance to have a another life, that will be a good thing. When you weigh it up, if we can save lives and stop those horrific tragedies occurring again, that will be a good thing.


We have got maybe 800 days left until the election day. No doubt every day for the next 800 days will have the Leader of the Opposition coming in here and doing a stunt or going out in the media doing a stunt. Every day for the next 800 days he will trot something out. Maybe he will look to the past, especially today when we are looking at events of a year ago, but we will look at the future.




Mrs Griggs:
  You keep going back to Work Choices.




Mr PERRETT:
  No, we are not going to back to Work Choices. That is your embryonic policy. I will take that interjection. The reality is that we are not interested in Work Choices. The first things we did were to ratify Kyoto and get rid of Work Choices because we believe in working for the future.


I will go back to the past a little bit and look at the member for Cook's suggestion of having a Malaysian solution, except it was not in Malaysia; it was in Iran. I do not know the President of Iran as well as the member for Cook— (Time expired)

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2011-06-22,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (16:41):  by leave—The Gillard government believes Australians should achieve a more comfortable and secure life when they retire. There is little benefit in working hard, but retiring poor. In mid 2011, two decades after compulsory supera­nnuation was introduced, superan­nuation stands as one of Australian Labor’s most enduring and far-sighted reforms. Superannuation works—it is already deliver­ing retirement security to millions of Australians—and increasing the compulsory contribution to 12 per cent will only make the story better.


The Gillard government has a vision for Australians to live long lives full of comfort and meaning. We are living longer than ever before, but without better superannuation savings many Australians may have insuff­icient income security in retirement. But if we invest we will make the nation’s future stronger, creating a massive national wealth pool.


The story of superannuation is a strong story. Between July 1992 and June 2003 when the superannuation guarantee was lifted to nine per cent:


the Australian economy grew robustly—GDP growth averaged 3.9 per cent per annum;


unemployment fell from 11 per cent to 6.1 per cent;


labour productivity grew very strongly, well above its 30-year average, at 2.2 per cent per year;


real unit labour costs fell over the period by 4.4 per cent;


real wages grew; and


Australian business profitability grew by 6.1 per cent a year and profits rose as a percentage of GDP.


I do not attribute all these outcomes to superannuation solely, but the numbers demonstrate increasing compulsory superannuation works with economic progress.


I would not be exaggerating, however, if I said that the introduction of the superannuation guarantee back in 1992 generated fearmongering amongst those opposed to compulsory retirement savings. The then member for Bradfield, the opposition’s spokesperson on superannuation in 1992, described the Labor government policy as 'absolutely abhorrent'. He claimed that 'hundreds of thousands of workers are going to lose their jobs' and predicted the reforms 'would cause even higher unemployment, reduce real wages, add to inflation and do nothing to provide genuine retirement income for the majority of Australians'. The then member for O’Connor described superannuation as 'stupid and dishonest'. Senator Alston told the other place that 'imposing compulsory superan­nuation on individuals does not increase total savings'. The then member for Curtin said that 'the superannuation guarantee levy will have a disastrous impact on business'. I remind the House today of these 1992 statements to simply remind all of us how wrong it would be to let prejudice, vagrant opinion unsupported by visible facts, distract us from the important task of building domestic savings to support economic growth. It should be noted that the economic arguments advanced against the superann­uation guarantee in the early 1990s—whether it was that business could not afford it; that it would be better in workers’ pay; or that it will increase unemployment—were subsequently disproved and discredited. Yet these are exactly the same arguments being trotted out by the naysayers today.


In 2011 it is time for the Gillard government to continue improving the retire­ment savings of working Australian people. Personal security is a priority—nine per cent superannuation is not enough to maintain the lifestyle most of us take for granted, especially women who have breaks in their career.


With the Gillard government's commitment to take the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, we are strengthening superannuation. And we are strengthening the chances of Australians who have worked hard and paid taxes being able to retire with a measure of decent comfort.


With our commitment to increase the concessional caps for over-50-year-olds from $25,000 to $50,000 when balances are below $500,000, we are strengthening superan­nuation.


With our commitment to make the system fairer by giving people the ability to have first time breaches of excess contributions up to $10,000 assessed at their marginal rate of tax, rather than incurring a potentially higher rate of excess contributions tax, we are strengthening superannuation.


With our commitment to make superannuation concessions fairer for 3.5 million low-income workers who currently get little or no concession on their super savings, we are strengthening superan­nuation. And we are ensuring that superannuation is not just for the well off.


With our commitment to raise the superannuation guarantee age limit from 70 to 75 from 1 July 2013, coinciding with the increase in the rate of the superannuation guarantee, we are strengthening superannu­ation.


These legislative commitments deserve the full support of this House and this parliament.


As the responsible minister I believe the inadequacy of the current nine per cent superannuation warrants greater attention in the broader national economic debate. Financial experts generally believe the average worker will need at least 60 to 65 per cent of pre-retirement income to live comfortably. The OECD recommends 70 per cent. At present only 35 in every 100 Australians are likely to achieve their desired standard of living in retirement. Despite having the fourth largest pool of funds under management in the world, in terms of adequacy, our retirement savings system ranks only seventh on the global comparison.


And with mortality improvements, the average 65-year-old man will now live beyond the age of 85. And the chance of one member of a couple reaching 100 is astonishingly high. So an increasing number of Australian retirees are going to outlive even substantial sums sets aside for retirement. Adequate retirement is even a bigger problem for women, given that women on average earn 34.8 per cent less than men.


Today, the average retirement lump sum of someone aged between 60 and 65 is $245,000 for men and $170,000 for women. By 2036, those numbers will lift to $485,000 for men and $345,000 for women, and members will note that this means women’s superannuation actually doubles between now and then. But a significant part of this forecast growth in retirement balances is attributed to the Gillard government’s proposed reforms of the minimum mand­atory 12 per cent superannuation guarantee and SuperStream’s efficiencies.


This is why the minerals resource rent tax is so important to our nation’s future. It will pay for the tax concessional treatment of the additional three per cent superannuation guarantee—because workers' retirement contributions are taxed at 15 per cent instead of their higher marginal personal income tax rate.


Private sector research demonstrates that a couple in life after work need about $54,000 per year to live comfortably. I am not satisfied the status quo of nine per cent will deliver a sufficient reward for decades in the workforce. For an individual it is around $23,000 a year including the aged pension entitlement. The average current retirement balance from AustralianSuper, I am advised, is about $43,000. If retirees try to live at the aforementioned adequacy standard their superannuation will be exhausted in just three or four years. If a couple stick to a modest lifestyle they have an 80 per cent chance of it lasting their lifetime as an allocated pension. For those who have bigger balances or those with more time in the workforce contributing nine per cent who may ultimately achieve balances of $150,000 or $300,000 the outlook is still not greatly better.


Retiring at 65 the retiree with $150,000 can only expect to be able to live comfortably until they are 71 and the retiree with $300,000 until they are 80 years old. That is still well short of a retiree's life expectancy. Because the undeniable fact is that we are living longer. The number of Australians over 65 years of age is projected to grow from three million in 2010 to 8.1 million by 2050. During the same period, the ratio of working-age Australians to those aged over 65 will decrease from 50 people for every 10 today, to just 27 working people for every 10 by 2020.


It used to be the case that we would leave school in our teens, work for 40 to 50 years and then live in retirement for about 10 years. Now we might be in education until 20 to 25 years of age, work for about 35 years, and then we have a post-work life of say 20 or even 30 years.


What it means to retire has been fundamentally redefined with the gift of longer, healthier life. Longer life is the great gift from 20th century Australia to 21st century Australia. The legacy of health and medical science discoveries combined with living in the lucky country. This longer life after work is why the Gillard government’s superannuation reforms are so very important to addressing the retirement savings adequacy gap that so many Australians are facing today.


Whilst women live longer than men, their super balances are in fact on average 30 per cent lower than men’s. This is a serious challenge to their financial independence. Currently, around 2.1 million Australian women get no tax benefit from contributing to superannuation, due to the 15 per cent superannuation contribution tax being at or below their income tax rate.


The Gillard government is therefore acting on the recommendation of the Australia's Future Tax System (AFTS) report which said that superannuation tax concessions be distributed more equitably. From 1 July 2012, the government will make the system fairer by ensuring no tax is paid on the nine per cent superannuation guarantee contributions for Australians earning up to $37,000 and that the money is instead directed into their superannuation. Sixty per cent of the beneficiaries of this policy are women. The superannuation savings of 2.1 million women earning less than $37,000 will be boosted by $550 million in 2012-13 alone. The combined impact of our reforms means the superannuation savings of 3½ million low-income earners, both men or women, will be boosted by a total of $830 million per annum in 2012-13. So a 30-year-old woman on average wages (around $60,000) will have an extra $108,000 in retirement savings, providing her with an extra $2,900 to spend each year of her retirement. If that 30-year-old women undertakes some part-time work and spends time out of the workforce, she will still have an extra $78,000 in retirement savings, amounting to an extra $1,800 to spend in each year of her retirement.


Data today does show that around 30 per cent of the workforce receives more than nine per cent superannuation already. This includes workers and employees at companies as diverse as Linfox and National Australia Bank. In fact, National Australia Bank has been paying its staff over nine per cent for about a decade.


All members of this parliament will receive either the very generous defined benefit if they were fortunate enough to be elected before 2004 or receive 15 per cent superannuation if elected after 2004. So how can it possibly be reasonable or consistent for this parliament to say that one thing is acceptable for the members of this parliament but vote against better conditions for the rest of Australia’s workforce?


The benefits of increased superannuation are not only to the individual, but to the whole of the nation that we love. As of March 2011 Australia enjoys well over $1.36 trillion invested in superannuation. This figure is estimated to grow to $6.2 trillion by 2036, including $550 billion directly from the government's superannuation reforms which I have outlined. This massive, rapidly-growing pool of funds means that more money is available to be invested in the broader economy. A proportion of this growing pool of funds will be allocated to the domestic economy, and will continue to be a great enabler of Australian enterprise.


Our multitrillion dollar savings pool is a terrific business enabler because it means that Australian companies have access to a large domestic savings pool. It should not be overlooked that during the global financial crisis approximately 15 per cent of the globe's capital raisings was undertaken here in Australia—largely due to our trillion-dollar nest egg.


Our already strong degree of financial self-reliance is one of the reasons why Australia weathered the global financial crisis so well. And the post global financial crisis growth of funds under management continues to drive a significant and sophisticated wealth management industry in Australia.


Our superannuation reforms will deliver a great good to Australians upon their retirement and the Australian economy more generally. The great good of a comfortable postwork life. The great good of seeing Australia become even better at financial services. The great good of more capital becoming available for nation-building infrastructure. The great good of low inflation, high savings and a more secure future.


The Gillard government understands the forces of economic transition that we must manage shrewdly to secure the next wave of national prosperity. That the ageing of our population is one of these forces is undeniable and the need for greater retirement savings is therefore irresistible. The Gillard government is acting for the long term and we are strategically positioning the nation for the challenges and opportunities of the future—be it climate change, the National Broadband Network or stronger superannuation. Australians need not fear the future—we should be optimistic.


The goal of lifetime income security for Australians is a worthy mission for all those of the parliament. I urge the House to consider these matters carefully over the coming winter recess, for when the parliament returns in the second half of this year there is important work for us to do to secure and strengthen Australia’s future.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for North Sydney to speak for 15 minutes.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (16:57):  Despite the chief executive of a significant financial institution describing me as Hugo Chavez, I will speak for only 15 minutes.


The Assistant Treasurer has sought to portray the coalition as antisuperannuation and antisavings. I assure him that we are not. The coalition believes there is a pressing need to increase national savings. As a nation we need to save more to meet our burgeoning requirements for more infrastructure. We need to save more to provide for the longer retirements that we can all now expect to enjoy, as the Assistant Treasurer referred to. But we also need to save more to become less reliant on international capital markets.


The coalition supports Australia's three-pillar retirement system comprising an aged pension, a compulsory system of retirement savings through superannuation and incentives for voluntary saving. The coalition wants to encourage as many Australians as possible to plan and save for their retirement and to take full advantage of the benefits the superannuation system offers. We want to see a superannuation system which is as efficient, as transparent and as competitive as possible so as to maximise retirement incomes for all superannuants.


That is why the coalition will continue to support any changes making our superannuation system more efficient, transparent and competitive and which deliver better value to superannuants across Australia. In particular, sensible changes to streamline super fund operations and to strengthen corporate governance arrange­ments should be progressed by government as a matter of priority.


Where we differ from the government is in the way that increased national saving can be achieved. The very first step should be for the government to lead by example and get its fiscal house in order. This year the government is dissaving to the tune of $49.4 billion and next year—a heroic assumption, but nevertheless reported in the budget papers—$22.6 billion. Net debt will continue to rise and will peak at an estimated $107 billion next year, the highest peacetime debt in dollars in our history. This is a disturbing outcome at a time when Australia is enjoying the strongest terms of trade in around 150 years. Now is the time when the government should be putting money aside, paying down debt and preparing for a rainy day.


The coalition is opposed to some, but not all, of the government's proposals on superannuation. This is not because we do not believe in superannuation. Rather, many of the government's measures are funded from the proceeds of the mining tax. The coalition does not believe that saddling our most productive business sector with another tax is in the best interests of the country. It does not help our country to compete on a global scale by putting lead in the saddlebags of our fastest horse.


The Assistant Treasurer has outlined various elements of the government's policy on superannuation. The government has committed to increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. What they have not been upfront about is who is going to pay. The additional superannuation which workers will accrue is not intended to be a wage rise. The total remuneration received by workers will not increase. Rather, the intention is that workers should accept lower wages growth in return for increased superannuation. Workers will have less spending power today in return for greater spending power in the future. Now is not the time to be eroding the growth in workers' take-home pay. Australians are already under considerable financial stress from the rising cost of living, rising interest rates and additional government taxes.


The Melbourne Institute survey shows that household financial conditions fell by nearly one quarter in June to the lowest level since the survey began in March 2001. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index shows consumer confidence has fallen to the lowest level since the global financial crisis. It is no wonder that Aust­ralians are cocooning—reducing spending and increasing savings. The household savings ratio for the March 2011 quarter rose to 11.5 per cent—again, a level not seen since the global financial crisis. The 11.5 per cent ratio means that households are now saving more than a tenth of their disposable income. Australians cannot afford another hit to their take-home pay.


The Henry tax review argued against an increase in the superannuation guarantee. Remember, this was chaired by the man who was then the Secretary of the Treasury and is now, rather extraordinarily, the private adviser to the Prime Minister. The review's Report on strategic issues for the retirement income system specifically recommended not increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent but that the superannuation guarantee rate should remain at nine per cent. It states:


This strikes an appropriate balance for most individuals between their consumption opportunities during their working life and compulsory saving for retirement.


The review suggested there were better ways to support retirement savings:


The Panel considers that more can be done through preservation and other rules to ensure that the 9 per cent contribution rate produces an adequate retirement income for greater numbers of people, and its other recommendations are made partly for this purpose.


The Henry review also made the point that Labor's plan to increase compulsory super beyond nine per cent would most heavily impact on low- and middle-income earners. These are, of course, Labor's forgotten families, already doing it tough and dealing with increasing cost-of-living pressures. There is Labor's flood tax and obviously the carbon tax, if it comes through this place, and they will probably be indirectly affected by the mining tax.


There is another problem with Labor's approach. The government is creating a structural hole in the budget. The spending—that is, the tax forgone—from the increase in the superannuation guarantee will rise through time. However, the revenue from the mining tax is highly variable. The government's forecasts of revenue over the forward estimates are based on commodity prices and the terms of trade remaining at historically high levels. Inevitably, over the longer term, commodity prices will fall and revenues will decline. This combination of volatile revenues and rising commitments will add to the fragility of the budget. It will add to the cyclic movements in the budget bottom line. It is another example of the poor fiscal practice and inexperience of this government.


The government has announced that it will raise the superannuation guarantee age limit from 70 to 75, with effect from 1 July 2013. The coalition welcomes this change. We wish the government had gone further. The coalition's shadow minister for seniors, Bronwyn Bishop, the member for Mackellar, introduced a bill to parliament on 28 February 2011 which sought to amend the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act to abolish the age limit on the payment of the superannuation guarantee charge. This would provide for all employees to receive superannuation guarantee contributions, no matter what their age. The coalition's current position is that it does not see it necessary to have any age limit at all. The current age limit set at 70 unfairly discriminates against older workers and, in effect, means they take a pay cut at age 70 through the loss of compulsory superannuation. At this point, some may be discouraged and leave the workforce. We should be encouraging mature Australians to work for as long as they want. We cannot afford to prematurely lose their hard won wisdom and skills.


The Assistant Treasurer wants the government to be given credit for doubling the concessional contribution cap from $25,000 to $50,000 for over-50-year-olds with superannuation balances below $500,000. However, what the Assistant Treasurer fails to mention is that this policy is simply unwinding in part the government's earlier decision in the 2009-10 budget to halve the contribution cap. That was ill-considered policy—in keeping with a number of other initiatives from the government. It was done at a time when many working Australians approaching retirement age had been dealt a hard blow by the global financial crisis. Their accumulated retirement savings had fallen sharply in value as stock markets crashed in Australia and around the world. What Australians needed was the capacity to rebuild their savings. Instead, this government chose to make it harder for them to contribute to superannuation.


Labor has changed the rules regarding concessional and non-concessional caps in each of the last three budgets. These changes have, overall, been designed to raise additional revenue to pay for this government's wasteful ways. In effect, the government has been reducing the saving capacity of ordinary Australians so that it does not have to cut its own bloated spending. It is not good policy. The frequent changes have created great uncertainty and impacted confidence in the superannuation system as a retirement savings vehicle.


These frequent changes and uncertainty have been a factor in many more Australians being caught by excess contributions tax. The Assistant Treasurer has noted a concession on the excess contributions tax, allowing people with first-time breaches of excess contributions up to $10,000 to be assessed at their marginal rate of tax rather than incurring a potentially higher rate of excess tax. This is welcome. Treasury estimates that more than 65,000 Australians are likely to breach their concessional superannuation contribution cap during the 2009-10 financial year, up from 28,000 the previous year. The government is taxing those excess contributions at 46.5 per cent and will collect around $140 million in additional tax revenue from these accidental breaches.


There are a lot of annoyed hardworking Australians who have been doing the right thing by providing for their own retirement but who have now been stung by the frequent and confusing changes this government has made to concessional contribution caps. Excess contributions tax on superannuation contributions has been a particularly hot issue in my electorate of North Sydney. I have been advised that some superannuants who have unintentionally breached the non-concessional contribution cap rules by between just $125 and $5,000 each are now facing tax bills of around $70,000 each. This hardly seems equitable in the light of a government that has continuously shifted the goalposts for the past three financial years. It has made compliance and monitoring difficult if not impossible for working Australians, and all these hardworking Australians will not be assisted by the government's latest changes.


In conclusion, the coalition is fully supportive of the superannuation system as one element of retirement savings. When last in government, the coalition introduced reforms to enable Australians to choose their own superannuation fund. We oversaw payments and incentives that encouraged Australians, especially Australians on lower to middle incomes, to make additional contributions to their retirement nest egg. The coalition will continue to support measures that encourage Australians to provide for their future.

Mr CRAIG THOMSON
 (Dobell) (17:33):  On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the Competition and Consumer (Price Signalling) Amendment Bill 2010 and the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011, incorporating a dissenting report, together with the minutes of the proceedings.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr CRAIG THOMSON:
  by leave—In this inquiry, the committee conducted the rare task of comparing two bills that have the same purpose, in this case to control price signalling in Australian markets.


In November 2010, the member for Dunkley introduced a bill to this effect and the Treasurer introduced a government bill in March 2011. The government bill followed a consultation process, including an exposure draft in December 2010.


Although the bills have similar aims, they take different approaches. The member for Dunkley's bill only applies to the communication of price related information to a competitor, for the purpose of encouraging the competitor to vary their price, and where the communication has the effect of substantially lessening competition. This bill applies to the economy generally.


The Treasurer's bill creates two prohibitions. The first is where a firm privately communicates price related inform­ation to a competitor. This is described as a per se offence because the conduct of itself is so unredeeming that no further elements are required for liability. The second prohibition is where a firm generally communicates information relating to price, business strategy, or its capacity, and does so with the purpose of substantially lessening competition.


The Treasurer's bill applies to sectors of the economy stipulated in regulations. The Treasurer has committed to applying the bill initially to the banking sector and conducting a review before extending it further.


It is immediately apparent that the Treasurer's bill would have a stronger effect and this is the reason why the majority of the committee is supporting it over the member for Dunkley's bill. The committee's concl­usion is consistent with evidence provided by the competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. It stated that elements of the member for Dunkley's bill would mean that it would be of little practical use to the commission in controlling price signalling.


I would like to thank those organisations and individuals that assisted the committee during the inquiry through submissions or participating in the hearing in Canberra. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to the report, including the member for Dunkley, who joined the committee as a supplementary member for the inquiry. I would also like to again place on record my thanks to the secretariat, who, under an increased workload, have again been of magnificent assistance in producing this report. Again I would like to place on record the need to make sure that these committees are adequately resourced. There is a different workload that we have in this parliament from the one before, and they are operating under very trying circumstances. That does need to be recognised; otherwise the work of these committees will not be able to go on.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (17:37):  by leave—The report of the Standing Committee on Economics, which has just been presented, does in fact include recommendations from the majority of the committee members, as the chairman indicated. It is important to note that the majority was on the casting vote of the chairman, so it was a bit of a closely run thing as two bills, differently crafted but seeking to achieve the same objectives, were being considered by the committee.


It is important to recognise that the truncated consultation and examination of the government bill, the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011, caused great concern for the non-government members. The member for Dobell has described the process that gave rise to the two bills being before the committee and, with some enthusiasm, how the government and the committee sought to examine the private member's bill that I produced. If only that same vigour and enthusiasm, and period of examination and scrutiny, had been available to be applied to the government's bill—alas, it was not. It was an incredibly truncated and, I think, somewhat unsatisfactory process for looking at the government's bill.


There is a dissenting report, and on behalf of my non-government colleagues I will speak to it very briefly. It has a different recommendation, as you would imagine, from the government members' report. The government members' report recommends that the Treasurer's bill be adopted and the private member's bill I prepared be rejected. It is quite remarkable, though, that the body of the report shows that there was really very little independent evidence and considered justification presented to the committee, or relied upon in the committee's report, to enable it to arrive at an unequivocal recommendation such as has been outlined in the report by government members.


What is clear is that best practice regulation has not been engaged in in the development of the government's bill. The regulatory impact statement exercise was characterised by some competition law experts as an exercise in self-justification. In my view, that was subsequently reinforced by the appearance of Treasury at our one-day hearing—a one-day hearing at a time when only my private member's bill was available. At that stage, when that hearing was being conducted, we had only an exposure draft of the government's bill. Even yesterday, we received from Treasury some answers that were not terribly illuminating.


This process has not really seen the government bathe itself in glory, when it comes to the addressing the price signalling gap in Australia's competition law. For some years the government ignored calls by the ACCC to address this deficiency and the ACCC's inability to investigate concerns about potentially anticompetitive practices. The existence of this competition law gap has featured in a number of ACCC reports over the years of the Rudd and Gillard government, including reports dealing with petrol retailing. The absence of that power influenced merger and acquisition approvals by the ACCC. It emerged as a concern in relation to banking competition and even attracted the urgings of the OECD to get on with it, without that organisation bringing forward anything practical to help in that task.


So this has had a long history, as Brent Fisse, a leading Sydney based competition lawyer, characterised in an opinion piece. He was quite right and accurate in saying:


There are no simple solutions. Distinguishing between oligopolistic interdependence and unjustified coordination of market activity by competitors is the toughest challenge in competition law.


I think that assessment is absolutely right, and may explain why it took the coalition's private member's bill to lead the way and prompt the government to bring forward its own bill. But that complexity is exactly the reason why careful examination of these bills is justified. The bills need to be guided by sound economic policy and competition principles, as I think the coalition's bill was. We need to be mindful that price signalling can have both a positive and a negative effect on competition and on consumers or may have no effect at all. That needs to shape the way in which the law is crafted, and then that law needs to be embedded in known and understood Australian competition law concepts. You have to be careful not to overreach or to invite unintended consequences that might well be detrimental to the economic wellbeing of Australia and its citizens.


We have seen through this truncated inquiry, and captured in the report that was tabled today, a very divergent view of the action we should take. What worries me, though, is that we started at a point of shared purpose. There was a genuine shared purpose about the need to tackle anticompetitive price signalling. The government and the coalition then took divergent paths, and I am concerned to reflect that the process through which the committee operated has only made that divergent pathway even more divisive. I think it has produced defective legislation from the Treasurer. The government has not availed itself of the considerable technical expertise that was available to the committee through its submissions and has not had a genuine opportunity to examine the recommendations for amendments or even some conceptual changes that came forward in what were very high quality submissions. This has damaged the quality of the bill that the parliament will be asked to consider and in fact diminished the committee process. This is not a satisfactory way in which the committee should examine these bills of such moment.


I am concerned at the result of this process. The Law Council of Australia trade practices committee chairman, Stephen Ridgeway, captured this in a comment attributed to him. The Australian Financial Review of 23 May states:


… it was the shortest consultation period he had ever seen and the time permitted for feedback was ""manifestly inadequate"".


That captures what I feel is a disrespectful disposition to the quality of the submissions that were provided, a disinterest in the expertise that they made available and, frankly, a dishonourable use of the committee process, when so much more could have been achieved in a cooperative and collaborative way.


I understand that the bills will be brought on with some haste, perhaps even tomorrow. Even though the committee recommendation is simply to pass the bill, I understand that the government will be bringing forward some amendments, in my view underlining the point that there is ample opportunity for improvement. All this remarkable truncated period and poor process has done is prove the point that this is too important an area of policy to have the government adopt a 'mine's bigger and tougher than yours' attitude, purely because the coalition's bill led the way in this area. This is not an area where the Treasurer should exercise what he thinks is his political heavyweight credentials while everyone looks at this outcome and thinks, 'This is economic policy lightweight work.' I think we can do better; I wish we had had the opportunity to do so and I hope the parliament carefully considers the report before it, including a shopping list of areas of deficiencies and flaws in the government's bill, which I fear the government will try and jackboot through this parliament after kicking to the kerb a process that could have offered so much more.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-06-22,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (17:46):  I urge all members in the chamber to stay, because this will be a fantastic speech about my support for the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011! This bill ensures that Australia's military justice system remains in operation while the government works to establish the Military Court of Australia. The appointments of the Chief Judge Advocate and the two full-time judge advocates are due to expire in September 2011. This bill extends those appointments to ensure Australia's military discipline system remains in place.


As I am sure the chamber knows, our military discipline system covers a range of issues that might impact on our soldiers, sailors and air men and women. Because of the parliamentary placement program and our job as parliamentarians, we do know that those who don the green, the white or the blue are definitely a special breed of people. I note the member for Ryan, who is in the chamber tonight, has family who have done just that. For people who do don the green, the white or the blue, words like 'honour', 'courage' and 'service' are not words that are just trotted out in speeches on Anzac Day; they are not esoteric concepts. These are actually ways that they use to live their lives every single day.


Obviously, surrounding that are the laws of war and the laws for preparing for war. The primary aim of the law of conflict, also known as international humanitarian law, is to protect the victims of armed conflict and to regulate the conduct of hostilities based on a balance between military necessity and humanity. At the heart of the law of armed conflict lies the principle of distinction between the armed forces who conduct the hostilities on our behalf, or on behalf of the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians, who are presumed not to directly participate in hostilities and must be protected against the dangers arising from military operations. Under these international humanitarian laws the concept of direct participation in hostilities, which refers to conduct which is carried out by civilians, suspends their protection against the dangers arising from military operations. Most notably, for the duration of their direct participation in hostilities, civilians may be directly attacked, unfortunately, as if they were combatants in those particular circumstances.


Throughout history humankind has, unfortunately, continually resorted to force to resolve its conflicts. Although there has been a rise in diplomacy over the last 200 or so years, unfortunately we still have conflicts—not as much conflict in the last 20 or 30 years as in the horrific 40 years before, but nevertheless there are still trouble spots around the world. International humanitarian law developed within the limitations on the use of force in an attempt to minimise the horror, particularly in response to the conflict of World War II, where we saw so many civilians die—particularly the Russians, but throughout the world. The doctrine of proportionality requires a response of force to be proportionate to the aggression that precipitated such force. This doctrine accepts wartime civilian casualties as unfortunately inevitable, but the doctrine of proportionality requires that civilian casualties inflicted by military strikes not be excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage gained by the strike. The rules of engagement are specific to the conditions of a particular area of operations, and the actual text of any set of rules of engagement is classified and therefore not publicly available. For instance, if members or senators are overseas on a parliamentary placement program, unfort­unately, unless you have the right military classification, you are not able to see the rules of engagement. Soldiers often keep these on a card inside their jackets, because obviously it could be a problem if those they were fighting against knew the rules of engagement. We do not want the force we are up against to know what the ADF personnel can and cannot do. So the rules of engagement are always classified. Consequ­ently, I was quite surprised to see late last year much commentary in the media about the rules of engagement for our Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. According to the commentary I heard about and read, Alan Jones must have somehow been privy to the military rules of engagement for our soldiers in Afghanistan. 


The role of the independent Director of Military Prosecutions came about through recommendations arising from a series of committee inquiries in this particular building, many of which were gravely concerned that military justice was not delivering impartial, rigorous and fair outcomes for members of the ADF. We ask much of our ADF personnel, but the High Court said that we cannot ask them to forgo access to justice. That is obviously a call that this House respects. That is why last year I was very shocked to hear an exchange between the shock jock Mr Alan Jones and the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, where they cast aspersions over the Director of Military Prosecutions and her role in the case against the soldiers who were facing manslaughter charges as a result of an operation that unfortunately killed six civilians in Oruzgan province in Afghanistan. 


Just to be clear, at Senate estimates hearings Air Chief Marshal Houston, a man who is very well respected by both sides of this House, said that the soldiers were fully entitled to the presumption of innocence and that the Army had gone to unprecedented lengths to support the soldiers and to make sure that they were properly treated in the system. But what did the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, and Mr Alan Jones have to say about this arrangement and the support being provided to the soldiers? The Leader of the Opposition told his favourite shock jock, Alan Jones: 


… I'm not sure whether we—


that is, if the Liberal Party were the government—


can overturn the decision of an independent prosecutor. 


'I am not sure.' That is his statement. 'I am not sure that we can do that.' Thankfully I think there are still people on the opposite side of the chamber who do believe in the separation of powers. Any lawyer worth their salt knows that the separation of powers is a fundamental tenet of the Westminster system. Yet he who would be king, he who would be Prime Minister, then went on to say: 


Well, as I said, Alan, I suspect there has been a deep failure by this Government to provide these soldiers with the defence that they are entitled to. 


Those are ill-informed comments, baseless comments, dangerous comments on talkback radio. It is cheap populist commentary more befitting a boofhead out in the back bar than the political leader of the Liberal Party. The Hon. Mr Abbott went on to say to his talkback doppelganger:


… because the last thing that people would want to see is soldiers being stabbed in the back by their own Government and I know a lot of people think that’s what’s happening.


Amazing statements, but I am quoting directly. I previously called this statement erroneous in the House. It was then and it remains so now. Yet still—and I do not read the papers religiously every day—I have not seen an apology from the Hon. Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, about those statements made to the shock jock Alan Jones. In the same radio interview with Mr Jones, who should have known better—I think he was dux of Toowoomba Grammar back in the day, so he is a very smart man; he was a teacher who went on to other things— Mr Abbott then went on to say that he was 'the standard bearer for values and ideals which matter and which are important'. Some standard! Some bearer! 


As a standard bearer, the Hon. Tony Abbott might wish to revisit this interview, because it was a particularly galling moment for many people—for many lawyers and for many people involved with the military justice system. I say this as the case against two of the Army reservists charged with manslaughter in Afghanistan will not go to a court martial after a judge advocate actually dismissed the charges. We should all be aware that this outcome was not because of the inappropriate musings of the Leader of the Opposition on the Alan Jones program. This was the result of the military justice system doing its job, and justice was done, as it will be done for the other soldier who is still experiencing the appropriate scrutiny of our Australian military justice system, and the legislation before the House supports that process. I commend the bill to the House.

 (Ryan) (17:57):  We often speak in this chamber about the value we place on our service men and women and the risks they take on our behalf every day of their service. It is therefore of utmost importance that we support our troops in any way that we can. This was apparent in 2007, when both sides of this House supported the establishment of the Australian Military Court. However, as an outcome of the case of Lane v Morrison, it became necessary to change the legislative framework for the court. This occurred back in 2009. At the time, the Minister for Defence said that establishing a correctly constituted military court was of the highest priority for the government. However, two years on, we are no closer to seeing this statement become a reality. 


In fact, in May this year, the current Minister for Defence advised that the legislation is still in formulation stage and is unlikely to be resolved by September this year—the original time line put forward by the government. And this is why we are here today, moving an amendment to effectively allow an extension of the time line for the government to implement legislation for which they had set their own timing—legislation they once stated was of the highest priority. If it takes two years to get to formulation stage of legislation for an issue of highest priority, it raises serious questions as to the capacity of this government. This failure to meet their own standards is yet another example of a broken Labor promise, of letting down the very people they should be supporting. We have seen it with home insulation, GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch, the cash-for-clunkers scheme and the green loans program. I am concerned that when an issue is labelled 'high priority' by this government those words may very well be its kiss of death. Who could forget the former Prime Minister's words that an ETS would address 'the greatest moral issue of our time'? We now have no ETS legislation and just another tax to deal with the problem. Of course, it is important that the legislation to establish the court be properly and effectively drafted, but surely the minister could explain to the House why it is that we have this delay.


Failure in the area of the Australian Military Court is simply not good enough. We must support our troops. They must know what is in store for them, and what avenues they have—we cannot continue to leave them in limbo. The uncertainty surrounding this legislation and the uncertainty surrounding an area that affects our servicemen's and servicewomen's lives do not provide them the support that they deserve. This amendment does allow the existing interim arrangements to continue, but the point is that both the government and the coalition acknowledge the need for change. Equally, our servicemen and servicewomen would be well served by the Australian Military Court. This was established after a series of Senate committee reports over a number of years that recommended extensive changes to the military justice system. Those who handle military discipline require a critical understanding of the nature of service—in fact, there are offences, such as going absent without leave, that apply only in a military sense. It is particularly important that the Australian Defence Force be able to deal with discipline and criminal conduct under a military code of conduct, and this is especially necessary during overseas deployment. This is something with which a regular court would struggle.


Perhaps most importantly, however, is that the nature of military service is unique. The fundamental basis of this legislation is that a military court is about discipline of the defence forces, and that is what the entire Defence Force Discipline Act is designed to ensure. We recognise the unique nature of service—and with that comes a need for unique disciplinary measures. We must aim for world's best practice in all areas within our Defence Force, including that disciplinary system. An Australian military court, operating under world's best practice administration, is a necessary step toward this.


Military discipline is a tough issue. It is sensitive, can be emotional and is difficult for non-military personnel to understand, but it is vitally important to provide certainty and stability to those who serve our country. More than just putting out press releases stating an intention to re-establish the court, as we saw last year, the government must now actually make this happen, genuinely make writing the full legislation for an Australian military court their highest priority. For once this government must actually match the words 'highest priority' with real action, not more excuses for their failure.

Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (18:03):  I rise to speak in support of the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011. I understand that it has bipartisan support, but it is a shame that when we have something for which there is bipartisan support we get straight back into the blame game, because if I were to go back to the history of this bill I would be able to talk about the advice that was in a Senate committee report in 2006 whereby that foreign affairs, defence and trade committee concluded with the following comment. I note this was when the court was in the establishment phase under the previous government when it was decided that they would set up a military court and that there was advice at the time that it was at a serious and strong risk of constitutional challenge and would be struck down—and that is what happened. I will quote from that Senate committee report at the time:


Overall, the committee believes that the government settled for the barest minimum reforms required to its service tribunals to escape a constitutional challenge.  In so doing, the committee takes the view that, in striving for the minimum, the government has not removed the risk that at some stage the High Court may find that the AMC—


the Australian Military Court—


is constitutionally invalid.


That was pretty clear and there was other advice around at the time and, in fact, the now Attorney-General, in another role at that time in opposition, had also put forward that advice. So I make those comments by way of providing a context for where we find ourselves: inheriting a system that has been struck down as constitutionally invalid, and so we have had to go back and validate the previous system so that actions taken whilst the Australian Military Court set up will be legalised.


As for what this bill is about, it is quite specific to particular areas. It is to provide tenure of up to two years for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocates. It was some time back when I looked at the explanatory memorandum and other documents and there was another trigger. It was up to two years or subject to a determination, whichever one came first. In the material I now have I see it is for two years or until the Minister for Defence declares, by legislative instrument, a specified day to be a termination day, which is sooner. The appointments are due to expire in September this year; hence we need this bill. I understand that the redrafting of the bill for the Australian Military Court is very close and what this bill also does is make sure that the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocates continue. I also understand that when the AMC legislation comes before us we will have a permanent, effective and constitutionally sound system of military justice for Australia's defence forces. That is a good thing because that is what is needed. There is a lot that could be said about this, but I have spoken on this matter once before in this place and outlined my thinking on it and there is no need for me to go through that again. It is really clear that we do need certainty. Once we have the Australian Military Court justice system in place it will be a good thing for all as well as for our soldiers who serve and operate under it. It applies not only in a theatre of war or in a conflict but in a whole range of areas of their service life, and they need to have that certainty. There are a whole lot of things that happen in terms of discipline and disciplinary actions within the Australian defence forces, and a lot of that will continue as well. It was deemed necessary by the defence forces— (Quorum formed) A key provision of this bill is that it amends schedule 3 to the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009, which contains application and transitional provisions. Importantly, it refers to the commencement day of the application provisions as being the day that the No. 1 act commenced, which was 22 September 2009.


The bill introduces, as I briefly mentioned before, the termination day which is imported into it. Also, clause 2 of schedule 3 deems a person who held office as a chief military judge immediately before the decision in Lane v Morrison to be the Chief Judge Advocate. It is a bill that provides certainty in case it is needed for the tenure and remuneration of the Chief Judge Advocate until we have the final bill before the House. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (18:12):  I rise in support of the government's Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011, which will provide for the appointment, remuneration and other entitlements of statutory office holders, namely the Chief Judge Advocate and two judge advocates, each of whom are full-time members of the Australian Defence Force. This bill will ensure that these appointments continue beyond two years, as in schedule 3 of the act, as the current fixed tenure is due to expire in September. These are interim measures for the establishment of a new Australian Military Court. The Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General have directed that further policy work is to be undertaken into the proposed interface between the Military Court of Australia and the residual court martial system.


The amendment will extend the appointments until the Military Court of Australia is introduced and the new model is implemented. The new court will replace the interim measures put in place last year following the High Court's decision in Lane v Morrison, which invalidated the Australian Military Court. In the Lane v Morrison case the High Court determined that Colonel Peter Morrison, a military judge, could not proceed with trying charges against Mr Brian Lane, a former member of the Royal Australian Navy, because the legislation that established the Australian Military Court in which the charges were to be heard was constitutionally invalid.


The High Court found unanimously that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because the Military Court purported to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth but did not meet the requirements of a chapter III court under the Constitution. Chapter III of the Constitution ensures judicial independence from the executive and the legislature by providing that federal judges have tenure until they reach a fixed age of no more than 70, and that they can only be removed for proved misbehaviour or incapacity following a request from both houses of parliament to the Governor-General.


Following this case, this government has announced it will take the measures necessary to establish and strengthen the Military Court of Australia. It has in the meantime put in place interim arrangements to ensure that our military justice system continues. The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 has been introduced to sustain the military justice system. The Military Justice (Interim Measures Amendment) Bill 2011 has been developed to continue these appointments, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and the two full-time judge advocates, each of whom are full-time members of the Australian Defence Force. This legislation will establish a permanent, effective and constitutionally sound system of military justice for Australia's defence forces. Unfortunately, when the coalition set up the Australian Military Court without implementing legisl­ation that aligns with chapter III of the Constitution, it resulted in a ruling in a case in 2009 that the court was unconstitutional. The Labor government has since introduced legislation to establish a fully independent court, the Military Court of Australia. 


I want to congratulate the Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith, and the Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, for the hard work they are doing to ensure that our military justice system is strengthened through the establishment of a new bill that will create a military court that is constitutionally fitting. The Gillard Labor government is continuing to keep Australia safe and to strengthen our military and Defence Force systems, in turn countering threats at home and keeping our defence and security forces strong. There can be no greater responsibility for government than the defence of Australia and Australia's interests. The Labor government has ended the decade-long gap in strategic analysis and defence reform to create a smarter, stronger and more adaptable system and an organisation that can defend Australia, our people and our interests. This bill is further proof of the commitment to the ongoing reforms.


In my electorate, I am fortunate to have many of Australia's Defence Force personnel based at Puckapunyal and the Monegeetta Proving Ground Complex, which is why I am so passionate about continuing the support for our defence and military justice system and will wholeheartedly support this bill. A couple of weeks ago at the Puckapunyal Army barracks I attended the dedication of the Australian Defence Force's Puckapunyal memorial chapel. The chapel was completed on 31 January this year and provides a nondenominational facility cond­ucting services and community activities for the soldiers and families within the Puckapunyal community. Sadly, however, it has been used as the venue for a number of memorial services for fallen soldiers. It is an important part of the Tobruk Barracks in Puckapunyal.


I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this bill so I can talk about the importance of strengthening our military justice system and supporting our Defence Force community, such as that in the heart of my community of Puckapunyal. Our Puckapunyal units play a big role in enhancing Australia's Army capability. The Puckapunyal Military Area is one of the largest training areas for soldiers in Australia and it is a world-class facility that plays a vital role in preparing soldiers for combat, including our troops in Afghanistan. It covers some 44,000 hectares of undulating box ironbark forest and grassland and is one of the Defence Force's most heavily used training facilities. It has had new facilities built and others upgraded.


The Macedon Ranges is the home to the Monegeetta Proving Ground Complex in my electorate and it is renowned for its vehicle proving and test capabilities. In November last year I was joined by the Minister for Defence Materiel, Jason Clare, to open the $35 million expansion of the complex. We were given the opportunity to tour and inspect the latest equipment to be used by Australian troops in battle that is put to the test at these new facilities. It is all about making sure that our troops have the right equipment to do their job. As we all know, our troops rely on this equipment in battle. The equipment needs to be battle ready and safe, which is why it is crucial that we test it thoroughly before we put it in their hands.


The Monegeetta Proving Ground Com­plex tests equipment before it is manuf­actured to ensure it does the job it is supposed to do in the conditions faced by our troops; ensures electrical equipment and power generators and batteries will work in any weather; tests vehicles to measure handling and stability on any terrain; and uses thermal imagery testing to measure how equipment performs at night and in other low-light conditions. Equipment is subjected here to the same kinds of conditions our troops face on operations, including rugged terrain, extreme weather and night operations.


The complex consolidates the two existing test facilities, one at Maribyrnong and the existing facilities at Monegeetta, into the state-of-the-art precinct. The $35 million expansion of the Monegeetta complex includes all-weather testing chambers, a new enclosed weapons facility and a bigger heavy vibration testing facility. This site was also a fantastic investment for the local economy, with the Gillard government's funding and commitment translating to more than 50 full-time jobs in the Macedon Ranges.


In May 2009, the government released the most comprehensive Defence white paper ever produced by an Australian government. This blueprint will create one of the most flexible and versatile defence forces in the world and deliver around 100 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, 12 new submarines, eight maritime patrol aircraft, up to seven unman­ned maritime surveillance aircraft and eight new Future Frigates. We have also delivered the first Defence capability plan since 2006, which set out over $60 billion of investment in defence equipment


The government is providing more funding for defence than ever before. We have given a commitment to grow the Defence budget by about three per cent average in real annual growth until 2018, providing long-term planning and certainty for defence. We have provided additional funding for health care, including $83 million for mental health reforms and $62 million for an ADF family healthcare trial. The government has significantly upgraded our cybersecurity capabilities in defence, with the opening of the Cyber Security Operations Centre in the Defence Signals Directorate.


Australia's military justice system underpins discipline and command structures, and it is crucial to operational effectiveness, maintaining command and retaining our people and reputation. It is critically important for the men and women of the ADF that they have access to an effective military justice system. An efficient and fair military justice system is a key foundation for the excellent service discipline that places the ADF amongst the world's best militaries. While we move to a permanent solution for the military justice system that is in line with chapter III of the Constitution, I support this bill and wish it a speedy passage.

Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (18:21):  I thank the members for Fadden, Moreton, Ryan, Page and McEwen for their contribution to the debate. The background and context to this much needed Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011 is that the High Court, in August 2009, found unanimously that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because those provisions did not meet the requirements of chapter III of the Constitution. Parliament then enacted the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009, which reinstated the pre-2007 military justice arrangements. The reinstate­ment of the pre-2007 military justice system was required to allow time for the consideration and development of options for a new military justice system which would meet the requirements of chapter III of the Constitution.


Regrettably we have not been in a position to progress such legislation in a timely enough manner to avoid the following danger—the danger that the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No.1) 2009, which provides for a tenure of up to two years for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocates, is due to expire in September this year. We cannot guarantee that necessary legislation will be enacted before September this year. As a consequence, this bill seeks to continue the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocates for a further two-year period or until such time as the Minister for Defence declares, by legislative instrument, a specified day to be a termination day, whichever first occurs.


The Attorney-General and I and our respective departments, the Department of Defence and the Attorney-General's Department, are currently working to finalise the details of a Military Court of Australia bill and associated consequential and transitional provisions. It is not expected that the bill will be introduced into parliament in the course of this session; rather, it is expected to be introduced in the next session. 


As you would appreciate, I have not had the opportunity to listen in full to the contributions of the members who have contributed to this debate. I think that the substance of their contributions has been firstly to impress upon the parliament and the government the importance of introducing general military justice legislation and, secondly, support for this interim measure, which will continue to keep in place the pre-2007 military justice arrangements. I will inspect Hansard in the usual way. If there are any matters which require response from me, I will correspond with the members directly. I thank members and I thank the House.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (17:46):  I urge all members in the chamber to stay, because this will be a fantastic speech about my support for the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011! This bill ensures that Australia's military justice system remains in operation while the government works to establish the Military Court of Australia. The appointments of the Chief Judge Advocate and the two full-time judge advocates are due to expire in September 2011. This bill extends those appointments to ensure Australia's military discipline system remains in place.


As I am sure the chamber knows, our military discipline system covers a range of issues that might impact on our soldiers, sailors and air men and women. Because of the parliamentary placement program and our job as parliamentarians, we do know that those who don the green, the white or the blue are definitely a special breed of people. I note the member for Ryan, who is in the chamber tonight, has family who have done just that. For people who do don the green, the white or the blue, words like 'honour', 'courage' and 'service' are not words that are just trotted out in speeches on Anzac Day; they are not esoteric concepts. These are actually ways that they use to live their lives every single day.


Obviously, surrounding that are the laws of war and the laws for preparing for war. The primary aim of the law of conflict, also known as international humanitarian law, is to protect the victims of armed conflict and to regulate the conduct of hostilities based on a balance between military necessity and humanity. At the heart of the law of armed conflict lies the principle of distinction between the armed forces who conduct the hostilities on our behalf, or on behalf of the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians, who are presumed not to directly participate in hostilities and must be protected against the dangers arising from military operations. Under these international humanitarian laws the concept of direct participation in hostilities, which refers to conduct which is carried out by civilians, suspends their protection against the dangers arising from military operations. Most notably, for the duration of their direct participation in hostilities, civilians may be directly attacked, unfortunately, as if they were combatants in those particular circumstances.


Throughout history humankind has, unfortunately, continually resorted to force to resolve its conflicts. Although there has been a rise in diplomacy over the last 200 or so years, unfortunately we still have conflicts—not as much conflict in the last 20 or 30 years as in the horrific 40 years before, but nevertheless there are still trouble spots around the world. International humanitarian law developed within the limitations on the use of force in an attempt to minimise the horror, particularly in response to the conflict of World War II, where we saw so many civilians die—particularly the Russians, but throughout the world. The doctrine of proportionality requires a response of force to be proportionate to the aggression that precipitated such force. This doctrine accepts wartime civilian casualties as unfortunately inevitable, but the doctrine of proportionality requires that civilian casualties inflicted by military strikes not be excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage gained by the strike. The rules of engagement are specific to the conditions of a particular area of operations, and the actual text of any set of rules of engagement is classified and therefore not publicly available. For instance, if members or senators are overseas on a parliamentary placement program, unfort­unately, unless you have the right military classification, you are not able to see the rules of engagement. Soldiers often keep these on a card inside their jackets, because obviously it could be a problem if those they were fighting against knew the rules of engagement. We do not want the force we are up against to know what the ADF personnel can and cannot do. So the rules of engagement are always classified. Consequ­ently, I was quite surprised to see late last year much commentary in the media about the rules of engagement for our Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. According to the commentary I heard about and read, Alan Jones must have somehow been privy to the military rules of engagement for our soldiers in Afghanistan. 


The role of the independent Director of Military Prosecutions came about through recommendations arising from a series of committee inquiries in this particular building, many of which were gravely concerned that military justice was not delivering impartial, rigorous and fair outcomes for members of the ADF. We ask much of our ADF personnel, but the High Court said that we cannot ask them to forgo access to justice. That is obviously a call that this House respects. That is why last year I was very shocked to hear an exchange between the shock jock Mr Alan Jones and the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, where they cast aspersions over the Director of Military Prosecutions and her role in the case against the soldiers who were facing manslaughter charges as a result of an operation that unfortunately killed six civilians in Oruzgan province in Afghanistan. 


Just to be clear, at Senate estimates hearings Air Chief Marshal Houston, a man who is very well respected by both sides of this House, said that the soldiers were fully entitled to the presumption of innocence and that the Army had gone to unprecedented lengths to support the soldiers and to make sure that they were properly treated in the system. But what did the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, and Mr Alan Jones have to say about this arrangement and the support being provided to the soldiers? The Leader of the Opposition told his favourite shock jock, Alan Jones: 


… I'm not sure whether we—


that is, if the Liberal Party were the government—


can overturn the decision of an independent prosecutor. 


'I am not sure.' That is his statement. 'I am not sure that we can do that.' Thankfully I think there are still people on the opposite side of the chamber who do believe in the separation of powers. Any lawyer worth their salt knows that the separation of powers is a fundamental tenet of the Westminster system. Yet he who would be king, he who would be Prime Minister, then went on to say: 


Well, as I said, Alan, I suspect there has been a deep failure by this Government to provide these soldiers with the defence that they are entitled to. 


Those are ill-informed comments, baseless comments, dangerous comments on talkback radio. It is cheap populist commentary more befitting a boofhead out in the back bar than the political leader of the Liberal Party. The Hon. Mr Abbott went on to say to his talkback doppelganger:


… because the last thing that people would want to see is soldiers being stabbed in the back by their own Government and I know a lot of people think that’s what’s happening.


Amazing statements, but I am quoting directly. I previously called this statement erroneous in the House. It was then and it remains so now. Yet still—and I do not read the papers religiously every day—I have not seen an apology from the Hon. Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, about those statements made to the shock jock Alan Jones. In the same radio interview with Mr Jones, who should have known better—I think he was dux of Toowoomba Grammar back in the day, so he is a very smart man; he was a teacher who went on to other things— Mr Abbott then went on to say that he was 'the standard bearer for values and ideals which matter and which are important'. Some standard! Some bearer! 


As a standard bearer, the Hon. Tony Abbott might wish to revisit this interview, because it was a particularly galling moment for many people—for many lawyers and for many people involved with the military justice system. I say this as the case against two of the Army reservists charged with manslaughter in Afghanistan will not go to a court martial after a judge advocate actually dismissed the charges. We should all be aware that this outcome was not because of the inappropriate musings of the Leader of the Opposition on the Alan Jones program. This was the result of the military justice system doing its job, and justice was done, as it will be done for the other soldier who is still experiencing the appropriate scrutiny of our Australian military justice system, and the legislation before the House supports that process. I commend the bill to the House.

The appointments are due to expire in September this year; hence we need this bill. I understand that the redrafting of the bill for the Australian Military Court is very close and what this bill also does is make sure that the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocates continue. I also understand that when the AMC legislation comes before us we will have a permanent, effective and constitutionally sound system of military justice for Australia's defence forces. That is a good thing because that is what is needed. There is a lot that could be said about this, but I have spoken on this matter once before in this place and outlined my thinking on it and there is no need for me to go through that again. It is really clear that we do need certainty. Once we have the Australian Military Court justice system in place it will be a good thing for all as well as for our soldiers who serve and operate under it. It applies not only in a theatre of war or in a conflict but in a whole range of areas of their service life, and they need to have that certainty. There are a whole lot of things that happen in terms of discipline and disciplinary actions within the Australian defence forces, and a lot of that will continue as well. It was deemed necessary by the defence forces— (Quorum formed) A key provision of this bill is that it amends schedule 3 to the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009, which contains application and transitional provisions. Importantly, it refers to the commencement day of the application provisions as being the day that the No. 1 act commenced, which was 22 September 2009.


The bill introduces, as I briefly mentioned before, the termination day which is imported into it. Also, clause 2 of schedule 3 deems a person who held office as a chief military judge immediately before the decision in Lane v Morrison to be the Chief Judge Advocate. It is a bill that provides certainty in case it is needed for the tenure and remuneration of the Chief Judge Advocate until we have the final bill before the House. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (18:12):  I rise in support of the government's Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011, which will provide for the appointment, remuneration and other entitlements of statutory office holders, namely the Chief Judge Advocate and two judge advocates, each of whom are full-time members of the Australian Defence Force. This bill will ensure that these appointments continue beyond two years, as in schedule 3 of the act, as the current fixed tenure is due to expire in September. These are interim measures for the establishment of a new Australian Military Court. The Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General have directed that further policy work is to be undertaken into the proposed interface between the Military Court of Australia and the residual court martial system.


The amendment will extend the appointments until the Military Court of Australia is introduced and the new model is implemented. The new court will replace the interim measures put in place last year following the High Court's decision in Lane v Morrison, which invalidated the Australian Military Court. In the Lane v Morrison case the High Court determined that Colonel Peter Morrison, a military judge, could not proceed with trying charges against Mr Brian Lane, a former member of the Royal Australian Navy, because the legislation that established the Australian Military Court in which the charges were to be heard was constitutionally invalid.


The High Court found unanimously that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because the Military Court purported to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth but did not meet the requirements of a chapter III court under the Constitution. Chapter III of the Constitution ensures judicial independence from the executive and the legislature by providing that federal judges have tenure until they reach a fixed age of no more than 70, and that they can only be removed for proved misbehaviour or incapacity following a request from both houses of parliament to the Governor-General.


Following this case, this government has announced it will take the measures necessary to establish and strengthen the Military Court of Australia. It has in the meantime put in place interim arrangements to ensure that our military justice system continues. The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 has been introduced to sustain the military justice system. The Military Justice (Interim Measures Amendment) Bill 2011 has been developed to continue these appointments, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and the two full-time judge advocates, each of whom are full-time members of the Australian Defence Force. This legislation will establish a permanent, effective and constitutionally sound system of military justice for Australia's defence forces. Unfortunately, when the coalition set up the Australian Military Court without implementing legisl­ation that aligns with chapter III of the Constitution, it resulted in a ruling in a case in 2009 that the court was unconstitutional. The Labor government has since introduced legislation to establish a fully independent court, the Military Court of Australia. 


I want to congratulate the Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith, and the Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, for the hard work they are doing to ensure that our military justice system is strengthened through the establishment of a new bill that will create a military court that is constitutionally fitting. The Gillard Labor government is continuing to keep Australia safe and to strengthen our military and Defence Force systems, in turn countering threats at home and keeping our defence and security forces strong. There can be no greater responsibility for government than the defence of Australia and Australia's interests. The Labor government has ended the decade-long gap in strategic analysis and defence reform to create a smarter, stronger and more adaptable system and an organisation that can defend Australia, our people and our interests. This bill is further proof of the commitment to the ongoing reforms.


In my electorate, I am fortunate to have many of Australia's Defence Force personnel based at Puckapunyal and the Monegeetta Proving Ground Complex, which is why I am so passionate about continuing the support for our defence and military justice system and will wholeheartedly support this bill. A couple of weeks ago at the Puckapunyal Army barracks I attended the dedication of the Australian Defence Force's Puckapunyal memorial chapel. The chapel was completed on 31 January this year and provides a nondenominational facility cond­ucting services and community activities for the soldiers and families within the Puckapunyal community. Sadly, however, it has been used as the venue for a number of memorial services for fallen soldiers. It is an important part of the Tobruk Barracks in Puckapunyal.


I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this bill so I can talk about the importance of strengthening our military justice system and supporting our Defence Force community, such as that in the heart of my community of Puckapunyal. Our Puckapunyal units play a big role in enhancing Australia's Army capability. The Puckapunyal Military Area is one of the largest training areas for soldiers in Australia and it is a world-class facility that plays a vital role in preparing soldiers for combat, including our troops in Afghanistan. It covers some 44,000 hectares of undulating box ironbark forest and grassland and is one of the Defence Force's most heavily used training facilities. It has had new facilities built and others upgraded.


The Macedon Ranges is the home to the Monegeetta Proving Ground Complex in my electorate and it is renowned for its vehicle proving and test capabilities. In November last year I was joined by the Minister for Defence Materiel, Jason Clare, to open the $35 million expansion of the complex. We were given the opportunity to tour and inspect the latest equipment to be used by Australian troops in battle that is put to the test at these new facilities. It is all about making sure that our troops have the right equipment to do their job. As we all know, our troops rely on this equipment in battle. The equipment needs to be battle ready and safe, which is why it is crucial that we test it thoroughly before we put it in their hands.


The Monegeetta Proving Ground Com­plex tests equipment before it is manuf­actured to ensure it does the job it is supposed to do in the conditions faced by our troops; ensures electrical equipment and power generators and batteries will work in any weather; tests vehicles to measure handling and stability on any terrain; and uses thermal imagery testing to measure how equipment performs at night and in other low-light conditions. Equipment is subjected here to the same kinds of conditions our troops face on operations, including rugged terrain, extreme weather and night operations.


The complex consolidates the two existing test facilities, one at Maribyrnong and the existing facilities at Monegeetta, into the state-of-the-art precinct. The $35 million expansion of the Monegeetta complex includes all-weather testing chambers, a new enclosed weapons facility and a bigger heavy vibration testing facility. This site was also a fantastic investment for the local economy, with the Gillard government's funding and commitment translating to more than 50 full-time jobs in the Macedon Ranges.


In May 2009, the government released the most comprehensive Defence white paper ever produced by an Australian government. This blueprint will create one of the most flexible and versatile defence forces in the world and deliver around 100 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, 12 new submarines, eight maritime patrol aircraft, up to seven unman­ned maritime surveillance aircraft and eight new Future Frigates. We have also delivered the first Defence capability plan since 2006, which set out over $60 billion of investment in defence equipment


The government is providing more funding for defence than ever before. We have given a commitment to grow the Defence budget by about three per cent average in real annual growth until 2018, providing long-term planning and certainty for defence. We have provided additional funding for health care, including $83 million for mental health reforms and $62 million for an ADF family healthcare trial. The government has significantly upgraded our cybersecurity capabilities in defence, with the opening of the Cyber Security Operations Centre in the Defence Signals Directorate.


Australia's military justice system underpins discipline and command structures, and it is crucial to operational effectiveness, maintaining command and retaining our people and reputation. It is critically important for the men and women of the ADF that they have access to an effective military justice system. An efficient and fair military justice system is a key foundation for the excellent service discipline that places the ADF amongst the world's best militaries. While we move to a permanent solution for the military justice system that is in line with chapter III of the Constitution, I support this bill and wish it a speedy passage.

Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (18:21):  I thank the members for Fadden, Moreton, Ryan, Page and McEwen for their contribution to the debate. The background and context to this much needed Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011 is that the High Court, in August 2009, found unanimously that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because those provisions did not meet the requirements of chapter III of the Constitution. Parliament then enacted the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009, which reinstated the pre-2007 military justice arrangements. The reinstate­ment of the pre-2007 military justice system was required to allow time for the consideration and development of options for a new military justice system which would meet the requirements of chapter III of the Constitution.


Regrettably we have not been in a position to progress such legislation in a timely enough manner to avoid the following danger—the danger that the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No.1) 2009, which provides for a tenure of up to two years for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocates, is due to expire in September this year. We cannot guarantee that necessary legislation will be enacted before September this year. As a consequence, this bill seeks to continue the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocates for a further two-year period or until such time as the Minister for Defence declares, by legislative instrument, a specified day to be a termination day, whichever first occurs.


The Attorney-General and I and our respective departments, the Department of Defence and the Attorney-General's Department, are currently working to finalise the details of a Military Court of Australia bill and associated consequential and transitional provisions. It is not expected that the bill will be introduced into parliament in the course of this session; rather, it is expected to be introduced in the next session. 


As you would appreciate, I have not had the opportunity to listen in full to the contributions of the members who have contributed to this debate. I think that the substance of their contributions has been firstly to impress upon the parliament and the government the importance of introducing general military justice legislation and, secondly, support for this interim measure, which will continue to keep in place the pre-2007 military justice arrangements. I will inspect Hansard in the usual way. If there are any matters which require response from me, I will correspond with the members directly. I thank members and I thank the House.

Mr SCHULTZ
 (Hume) (19:00):  I am a proud rural Australian. I am proud that the majority of mainstream Australians still hold dear all that previous generations have fought and died to protect; such as our national sovereignty, freedom of speech, and a healthy respect for the rule of law.


Recent events in this country have made me question whether this Labor government is capable of protecting the values we hold dear. In fact, considering that the socialist tendencies of our Prime Minister and her willing submission to the Greens Trotskyite agenda are matters of public record, it is hardly surprising that an increasing number of people are reaching this conclusion.


Australians consider any attempt to dilute our inalienable sovereignty as a betrayal. Who or what controls our precious land resources is a matter of national sovereignty and one that this government has blatantly ignored. The failure of this government to generate a comprehensive response to the avalanche of foreign ownership requests to acquire vast slices of our agricultural sector is a national disgrace.


All Australians have a right to be concerned about our nation's food security. The output of our agricultural industry equated to $24.5 billion dollars in 2009-10, of which 60 per cent was generated in the export of produce.


I wish to echo and support the remarks made by the member for Kooyong, who spoke on the matter of food security in a grievance debate on 21 June this year. The member spoke about concern in international circles that a global food shortage was on the horizon. Exacerbating this concern is the predicted explosion in global population from the current 6.9 billion people to nine billion by 2050. It is estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations that 925 million people are already struggling for food.


The link between concern about global food shortages and the increase in sovereign wealth funds of foreign countries gobbling up our agriculture sector is undoubtable. If there was a coordinated and reasoned approach to the current rules regarding foreign investment approvals, I would not be so concerned. But the government is simply not standing up for our national interests.


The abandoning of our agriculture sector to foreign interests is only one example of the litany of policy disappointments this government has subjected rural and regional Australia to. We have honey bees exposed to foreign diseases and the apple industry preparing for the worst as apples with fire blight are given the green light to enter Australian borders. Each and every time this government has been faced with making the tough decisions in agriculture, it has taken the easy option or no option at all.


The member for Kooyong referred to the alarming report that Hassad Food, which is owned by the Qatar government, has bought more than 8,000 hectares in Victoria's Western District, on top of a purchase of 2,500 hectares of farming land in Victoria the year before. The member rightly questions the rules around foreign investment, particularly the ill-defined national interest test. It is outrageous that Patrick Colmer, the Executive Member of the Foreign Investment Review Board and senior Treasury official, stated:


The way that the legislation is set up is that the default position is that the investment is allowed to proceed.


This legislation is woefully inadequate in protecting our national interest in food security. The lack of standards is particularly galling when the threshold level for being considered to be a foreign investor in Australia is $231 million, compared with New Zealand, where government consent before a foreign investment can proceed is required if the property exceeds five hectares.


I am greatly encouraged by the efforts of the young, highly intelligent Liberal member for Kooyong to raise the profile of this very important issue in the national debate on behalf of urban, rural and regional Australia. I thank him on behalf of my constituents for bringing this very serious issue to the fore, and I encourage him to do more as he is an inspiration to his fellow Australians because of his dedication and his commitment to his country.

Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (09:30):  I rise to draw the attention of the House to the impact of the recent floods on the North Coast of New South Wales. The floods have impacted communities in the local government areas of Kempsey, Nambucca, Bellingen, Coffs Harbour and Clarence Valley. As with all natural disasters, the impacts of these floods varied from community to community. In places such as Woolgoolga there were falls of up to 400 millimetres, with 250 millimetres of rain falling within a 24-hour period. In other areas such as Red Rock, the community was shaken by a minitornado which ripped the roof off the local bowling club and damaged surrounding houses. In the south of my electorate some residents were evacuated from the Smithtown, Jerseyville and Kinchella communities, and the local newspaper, the Macleay Argus, reported that around 10,000 people were isolated as the Macleay River peaked. Thankfully the levies at Kempsey held and thousands of people were spared the impact of having the town inundated by the rising waters.


In my electorate there has been no loss of life as a result of these floods, but that does not mean that the week's events have not had an impact. Roads have been damaged, crops have been lost and, in some cases, homes have been severely damaged. Sewerage infrastructure has also been at risk of malfunctioning. Many residents in low-lying caravan parks have been particularly impacted. The Pacific Highway was also closed for a number of days and it opened again on Sunday evening. The state government has declared the five local government areas a natural disaster area. This will provide some level of assistance to councillors and primary producers affected. I have written to the Attorney-General offering my assistance to obtain any information which the minister feels is necessary to ensure that all appropriate Australian government assistance is provided to my constituents.


The people of the North Coast are resilient. The community's capacity to recover relies not just on the toughness of the local people who live in the area. The response has been significantly enhanced by the great work of our local emergency services workers. As in the case of every natural disaster that has occurred on the North Coast, our local emergency services volunteers have been fantastic and do a great job to assist those in need. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the work done by our emergency services personnel and their skill, professionalism and dedication to the people they protect. I commend their work to the House.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-06-22,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10:05):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Product Stewardship Bill 2011 implements a cornerstone commitment of the National Waste Policy, which heralded a new, coherent, efficient and environmentally responsible approach to waste management in Australia. The policy, which was endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in 2010, committed to establishing a national framework, underpinned by Commonwealth legislation, to support voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship schemes. Product stewardship involves shared responsibility for reducing the environmental, health and safety impacts of manufactured goods and materials across the life of a product.


Waste in Australia is growing. In the four years to 2007, the amount of waste generated grew by nearly a third, to around 44 million tonnes, which is the equivalent of over 2,000 kilograms for each Australian each year. Over the same period, the amount of hazardous waste has doubled. Even if the current recycling level of about 52 per cent is maintained, this trend could result in an almost threefold increase in the waste generated over the coming decade.


The nature of waste is also changing. The waste stream today is markedly different from 50 years ago when motor vehicles, refrigerators and televisions were less common, and home computers, mobile phones and compact fluorescent lamps did not exist. Today's goods are increasingly complex, and not only contain materials that can be re-used but also contain hazardous substances. As a result of their increasingly short product life, these goods now comprise a significant and growing component of the waste stream. At end of life, these products are placing a disproportionate burden on the general community rather than on those who use them or benefit from their use. Sharing responsibility is central to product stewardship.


Australia—as a responsible global citizen—is party to a number of international conventions, including the Basel convention and the Stockholm convention, which seek to reduce and manage waste and hazardous substances, including those substances that are persistent in the environment, toxic and accumulate along the food chain. Product stewardship can play a part as one of the means by which to achieve these goals.


These international obligations do not remain static. Under the Stockholm convention, some flame retardant chemicals present in many products are to be restricted or banned. There is also emerging global agreement on directions to reduce mercury emissions.


Mercury is present in many products. It is also harmful in minute amounts, and long-term, daily exposure above 25 millionths of a gram per cubic metre is considered unsafe. To place in context the importance of responsible end-of-life management of products—over 50 million lamps containing mercury, in particular street lights and commercial lighting, were imported into Australia in 2008 and these contained approximately 600 kilograms of mercury. The Commonwealth is responsible for ensuring that Australia's international obligations are met and the states and territories have the primary role in the management of waste under the Australian Constitution. This has led to a long history of collaboration by all Australian governments, anchored in the 1992 National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development. This was the first comprehensive domestic approach to waste and committed all Australian governments to improving the use of resources, reducing the impact of waste on the environment and improving the management of hazardous wastes.


The waste sector has also evolved to cover re-use, recovery, treatment and disposal of waste, and increasingly manages waste as a resource. This creates opportunities. Today the waste and recycling sector is valued at between $7 billion and $11 billion and employs a direct labour force of around 30,000.


The regulation impact statement for the National Waste Policy estimated the savings from a national product stewardship approach to be $147 million over 20 years. The regulation impact statement also identified the additional costs of jurisdictions implementing up to five separate product stewardship programs could be up to $212 million.


Product stewardship schemes are in place in many other parts of the world, including in North America, Europe and Asia. Electrical equipment, tyres, mercury lamps, batteries, packaging, chemical products and even cars are covered by such arrangements.


Australia has adopted many individual approaches to product stewardship. The Commonwealth's Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000 covers lubricating oils and its Ozone and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 covers the management of ozone-depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases. South Australia introduced a mandatory deposit refund scheme on drink containers in 1977 and the Northern Territory has recently passed similar legislation. New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia also have legislation that can require product stewardship schemes. Used packaging stewardship is covered by a national environment protection measure that has been enacted differently in each jurisdiction since 1998.


A complex mix of rules and regulations applies to products and materials that are sold nationally by companies operating Australia wide. A single piece of legislation that allows for the consistent regulation of products and materials provides a more effective mechanism than an array of individual product legislation at both Commonwealth and state levels.


There is no doubt that many companies wish to do the right thing and are already involved in voluntary product stewardship schemes. Some of these schemes are familiar. DrumMuster recycles used agricultural and veterinary chemical containers and has reformulated products to reduce packaging and waste. Planet Ark takes back printer cartridges, MobileMuster deals with mobile phones, and more recently Fluorocycle started recycling mercury from commercial lighting.


The states and territories, local government, industry, business associations, the retail sector, environmental groups and the community actively support the National Waste Policy, and a national approach to product stewardship. Extensive consultation has been undertaken over the past two years, with strong levels of participation. To date over 1,000 people have attended some 80 public and bilateral meetings, and there have been around 320 public submissions.


The bill efficiently addresses the need for a simple enduring national approach to product stewardship through a single piece of framework legislation. Three types of product stewardship arrangements will be catered for. Industries and products may be regulated through either a co-regulatory or mandatory approach and voluntary product stewardship schemes can be accredited.


This framework will allow for different products and materials to be covered over time as needs emerge, and for the arrangements to be tailored to suit different circumstances in a changing international, social, environmental and economic context. Importantly there is also a comprehensive suite of checks and balances built into the framework to ensure it is appropriate and transparent.


The bill sets the framework under which products and materials can be regulated and the obligations placed on various parties. It sets out the governance arrangements, the powers of the regulator, and the reporting and audit requirements for organisations delivering product stewardship schemes. It provides the offences and penalties together with the compliance and enforcement powers.


For a product to be covered it must further the objects of the legislation, which are an expression of the aims and principles of the National Waste Policy and its product stewardship strategy. The product must also satisfy specified criteria, including whether the product is in a national market. As each product, material and industry is unique, the regulations will set out the details of what is to be regulated and the actions to be taken.


The actions required in the regulations may include the need to avoid, reduce or eliminate waste from products. There may be a requirement to reduce hazardous substances or to manage the waste as a resource. Importantly, there may be the obligation to ensure that products or waste from products is reused, recycled, recovered, treated or disposed of in a safe, scientific and environmentally sound way.


The intent of the voluntary element is to encourage product stewardship without the need for regulation and to provide the community with more certainty, through the use of a logo, that accredited schemes actually achieve what they claim. In particular, product stewardship organisations that are accredited will meet specific reporting and audit requirements, which will provide for both transparency and accountability.


Co-regulatory product stewardship schemes will be delivered by industry with only outcomes and basic operational requirements specified in regulation. A company will not be able to benefit from refusing to participate, so there will be no free-riders. Thresholds may be applied to avoid impacts on small business.


Mandatory product stewardship would set obligations for parties to take certain actions in relation to a product. The bill provides a comprehensive set of product stewardship requirements that can be drawn upon for that purpose. These include the ability to require labelling, to require producers to take products back at the end of life for recycling or to require a deposit and refund be applied to a product. These requirements are based on those already in use, such as those in the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989.


There will be a rigorous transparent assessment and consultation process before a decision to make regulations on a product. This will follow the Australian government's regulatory impact analysis requirements. Through the Environment Protection and Heritage Council all governments have agreed that a national television and computer product stewardship scheme should be the first to be regulated under this product stewardship framework legislation. The decision regulation impact statement published in 2009 showed that a national television and computer product stewardship scheme would provide a net benefit to society in the range of $517 million to $742 million over the period 2008-09 to 2030-31.


Industry, jurisdictions and the community have sought national regulation for end of life televisions and computers for more than a decade. Around 32 million new television and computer products were sold in Australia in 2008, with an estimated 16.8 million units reaching end of life in the same year. Only 10 per cent are recycled, which is well below the average rate of recycling for all waste of 52 per cent. The volume of television and computer products reaching end of life is expected to grow to 44 million per year by 2028. This electronic waste is classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention.


The decision by all governments and industry to deliver this scheme is an important step towards sustainable management of electronic waste in Australia. This Product Stewardship Bill demonstrates the willingness of business, community and government to share responsibility for reducing the environmental impacts of products throughout their lives and will make a major contribution to achieving a more sustainable Australia.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (10:18):  It gives me great pleasure to support the Product Stewardship Bill 2011. This bill in its most practical terms is about giving Australia and Australians a way forward for the recycling of television and computer waste, an area in which the waste stream is growing. It is about protecting both the health and the environment for future generations of Australians.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from 
10:19
 to 
10:34





Mr HUNT:
  This bill has its origins, in many ways, in what happened in the 1950s in the town of Minamata on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. The situation was that the Chisso Corporation, set up in the 1930s, had been producing material and chemicals which were used in the production of plastics. One of the by-products was mercury. That mercury was allowed to leak into and be dumped into Minamata Bay. Over time, that mercury found its way into the food chain. In particular, it found its way into the shellfish, the crustaceans and the general fish community. It was ingested. The early 1950s saw what was sometimes known as the drunken cat syndrome, where small animals began to suffer and lost their motor coordination. Progressively this fed into the situation faced by the people of Minamata. It was an early warning sign in the postwar period of the danger, the impact, the hazard of heavy metal poisoning on the human population. 


The Minamata story was slow to occur and it was slow to be recognised. But what occurred in Minamata and what occurred through the negligence of the Chisso Corporation was a message that progressively made its way around the world—the message being that we have responsibility for the stewardship of our products and we have responsibility for the by-products and consequences which flow from our products. Against that background of the Minamata disease, as it was known, and the profound impact it had on the people and the life of the fishing community of Minamata, we now come to the situation where product stewardship is a legitimate, important national responsibility for Australia in the 21st century.


Let me make this point about bipartisanship in environmental affairs. There are points of disagreement but there are also significant areas of agreement. Currently, the opposition and the government are engaged in three major areas of cooperative activity. Firstly, there is this product stewardship legislation. Secondly, we have recently provided support for the government's revised vehicle emissions standards. That is an important direct action measure which the government has taken and to which we have given our support. Thirdly, we have also accepted—although we have some concerns about the way in which it was done—the changes to the fringe benefits tax to prevent the ludicrous situation of people driving enormous distances immediately prior to the cut-off date for the annual calculation of kilometres, thereby increasing emissions, fuel usage and waste in our society. These changes will end the windfall gain to be received by driving further, although we do have some concerns about the impact on legitimate, proper activities of tradespeople and people involved in travelling sales.


Having said that, these three examples of product stewardship, emission standards and fringe benefits tax reform are all examples of cooperative action. Where we disagree, it is not disagreement for the sake of it but disagreement on the basis of an alternative principle—a concern either about the structure or the implementation. In the same way that, right from the outset, we identified the home insulation program as a potential, an emerging and finally an actual disaster—on each occasion eliciting a denial by the government that such a problem either would be faced or was actually being faced—we now place our concerns on the record about using a massive electricity, petrol, gas and grocery tax as the means to reduce Australian emissions.


Against that preliminary discussion, I will deal with this bill in four brief stages—firstly, the nature of the bill; secondly, the background; thirdly, the principle; and, finally, the detail. The Product Stewardship Bill 2011 establishes a national framework to support voluntary, co-regulatory and regulatory product stewardship and extended producer responsibility schemes to provide for the impacts of a product being responsibly managed during and at the end of its life. This bill is about providing a structure for whole-of-life management of consumer products and the components contained within them. Very simply, it is about making sure that in the 21st century there are no more Minamatas and that we do not face the Rachel Carson Silent Spring examples which she so courageously raised. She was one of the harbingers of the modern concern for environmental management, and she paid a difficult price at the time. She opened up consciousness about taking responsibility for that which we produce and therefore for the consequences of those products. 


Having established the bill's purpose, I turn to the background to the bill itself. The commitment to establish the framework goes back a long way, through the Council of Australian Governments and in particular the Environment Protection and Heritage Council. There was discussion of the principle in November 2009 but I know discussions go back to previous years. I was involved myself in a discussion in Christchurch some years ago, on behalf of the Australian government, with the New Zealand government and the Australian states. There is a long heritage of bipartisan support for the concept and the direction, and I am pleased that we have been able to work with the government to achieve appropriate changes and amendments which will allow for a joint approach.


That brings me to the specific principle of the bill. The coalition fully supports the principle of product stewardship. This is the notion of shared responsibility for reducing the environmental health and safety footprint of manufactured goods and materials across the lifecycle of a product. That is drawn directly from the National Waste Policy. We support that concept; it is about doing things in a correct and appropriate fashion that will not inadvertently drive up the cost of living for Australians but will deal with the problem directly, head-on and in a way which can solve the problem at source. In particular, the coalition also supports the notion of voluntary schemes. Voluntary product stewardship schemes as set out in part 2 of the bill which sit alongside co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship schemes offer a very prospective way forward.


I now turn to the detail of the bill. I praise the work of coalition members Senator Simon Birmingham and Senator Mary Jo Fisher, both of whom have worked with the government. In particular, the coalition worked with Senator Don Farrell on a series of amendments. The result of those amendments is that there are now three very specific criteria for developing and recognising schemes for accreditation under this bill. The first element is that the system be focused very much on containing hazardous waste substances, the second element is that there be a clear test on the potential to significantly increase the conservation of materials used in the products or increase the recovery of resources from waste from the products, and the third element is that there be the potential to significantly reduce the impact that the products or substances in the products have on the environment or on the health or safety of human beings. The origins of the last element can be traced back not just to Minamata but to some of the tragedies we saw through industrialisation in the 19th century.


Having worked on these amendments, we are pleased to adopt a bipartisan position and to support this bill. On behalf of the opposition, I am delighted to commend the Product Stewardship Bill 2011 to the House and to the Australian public.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:44):  I am very pleased to rise today in support of the Product Stewardship Bill 2011 because I do think this is a very important bill. While it is not one which draws the most amount of attention, I think it is a very good piece of legislation that really does work with local areas to make sure that we recycle and reuse Australia's waste properly.


Australia remains the second highest producer of waste per person in the world. The magnitude of Australia's waste stream has reached such a point that, in the four years to 2007, the amount of waste generated in Australia rose by 31 per cent, equating to approximately 2,000 kilograms for every Australian every year. Furthermore, over this same time frame, hazardous waste has doubled in Australia. However, these figures were recorded over a period when Australia's resource recovery from waste had also increased to 22.7 million tonnes or approximately 52 per cent. That is to say that despite increased action in the recovery of waste, Australia's production of waste is still growing each year. This comparison illustrates how significant work targeted at reducing the impact of Australia's waste is being negatively offset by the gradual increase in waste generated. In doing so it also highlights the significance of the bill before the House today.


The Product Stewardship Bill facilitates two important roles. Firstly, it implements a commitment to the National Waste Policy by establishing a national framework underpinned by legislative support; this means government-supported action on waste management. Secondly, it seeks to combat Australia's problem of increasing waste generation by extending the responsibility for reducing the environmental, health and safety impacts of manufactured goods and materials across the entire lifecycle of a product. The National Waste Policy announced in 2009 heralds a new, coherent, efficient and environmentally responsible approach to the management of waste in Australia. I think this is important because we do have many organisations that are out there working very hard; organisations such as Keep Australia Beautiful have done a lot of work. So it is important that we tie together these communities under a national framework. The policy has been fully endorsed by all Australian governments, through both the Environment Protection and Heritage Council and the Council of Australian Governments.


The key aims of the National Waste Policy are to significantly improve Australia's management of waste and to achieve an overall reduction in waste. Product stewardship effectively facilitates these aims by providing industry, communities and governments with a consistent national approach to the management of certain products. It engages with those involved in the production, supply and use of products to share the responsibility for the environmental impact throughout a product's life from its production through to its disposal. Product stewardship provides a basis for either voluntary, co-regulated or mandated actions to be taken by manufacturers, importers, distributors and others with regard to avoiding the generation of waste, reducing or eliminating the amount of waste from products to be disposed of, reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in products and waste from products, managing waste from products and resources and ensuring that products and waste from products are treated, disposed of, recovered, recycled and reused in a safe, scientific and environmentally sound way.


The bill provides a basis for voluntary product stewardship as an avenue for encouraging and recognising unregulated industry action. It provides for the use of a Commonwealth product stewardship logo, which will encourage industry to bring forward voluntary arrangements and will provide a means through which consumers may identify accredited products.


It also provides a basis for a co-regulated approach to product stewardship, which involves a combination of government regulation and industry action. The co-regulated approach will provide industry with flexibility in how they achieve their minimum outcomes and operational requirements. It may also be applied in situations where a substantial part of an industry wants to take action but is concerned about the remainder of the industry freely benefiting from their efforts.


Finally, product stewardship will provide the basis to establish mandatory product stewardship schemes. Such schemes could require that specified actions be taken with regard to the reuse, recycling, treatment or disposal of particular products, or even prohibit the manufacture or importing of products deemed to contain hazardous substances. Australia's waste is not only growing but its nature is also rapidly changing. Today televisions, computers, mobile phones and fluorescent lamps are consumed in mass amounts. Goods are becoming increasingly complex and now contain materials that cannot be reused and are potentially hazardous. Furthermore, these particular products have their expected longevity drastically reduced and, therefore, greatly contribute to Australia's waste stream. I have to say I experienced this very recently when I purchased a DVD player which was very cheap. It broke down within, perhaps, about three months, so I took it back for repair. They said that it was much cheaper to buy a new product and that it was not something that you repair, you just buy a new one. These things are only meant to last for about a year. It is important to note that these products are becoming a problem. The short-life products are now placing a disproportionate burden on the general community rather than solely on those who benefit from their use. Product stewardship rebalances this burden by placing responsibility across the manufacture, consumption and disposal chain.


Product stewardship programs are already in place in many other parts of the world such as Europe and Asia where it applies to electrical equipment, packaging, batteries and chemical products. Australia also has many individual instances of product stewardship. For example, South Australia introduced a mandatory deposit refund scheme on drink containers in 1977, and a similar scheme is now being implemented in the Northern Territory.


The current existence of differing rules and regulations that apply to products sold in Australia is both unnecessary and inefficient. Attempts to reduce Australia's waste will benefit greatly from a consistent piece of legislation governing the manufacture of products and materials. A national approach to product stewardship also has a huge financial advantage over state based regulations.


The scheme will be very important, and it will be rolled out in Australia over a five-year period by the television and computer industry, who fully support the scheme. The product stewardship scheme, as part of the national waste scheme, is the result of extensive stakeholder and community consultation. It has been endorsed, as I said, by all Australian governments and has received broad support from business and industry communities.


I believe this is landmark legislation and I take this opportunity to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water for the work that he has done on this in bringing it to the House. I am pleased to hear that the opposition will support this bill because it is a very important bill. Usually they oppose, but they are going to support this bill and I certainly welcome that. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10:05):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Product Stewardship Bill 2011 implements a cornerstone commitment of the National Waste Policy, which heralded a new, coherent, efficient and environmentally responsible approach to waste management in Australia. The policy, which was endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in 2010, committed to establishing a national framework, underpinned by Commonwealth legislation, to support voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship schemes. Product stewardship involves shared responsibility for reducing the environmental, health and safety impacts of manufactured goods and materials across the life of a product.


Waste in Australia is growing. In the four years to 2007, the amount of waste generated grew by nearly a third, to around 44 million tonnes, which is the equivalent of over 2,000 kilograms for each Australian each year. Over the same period, the amount of hazardous waste has doubled. Even if the current recycling level of about 52 per cent is maintained, this trend could result in an almost threefold increase in the waste generated over the coming decade.


The nature of waste is also changing. The waste stream today is markedly different from 50 years ago when motor vehicles, refrigerators and televisions were less common, and home computers, mobile phones and compact fluorescent lamps did not exist. Today's goods are increasingly complex, and not only contain materials that can be re-used but also contain hazardous substances. As a result of their increasingly short product life, these goods now comprise a significant and growing component of the waste stream. At end of life, these products are placing a disproportionate burden on the general community rather than on those who use them or benefit from their use. Sharing responsibility is central to product stewardship.


Australia—as a responsible global citizen—is party to a number of international conventions, including the Basel convention and the Stockholm convention, which seek to reduce and manage waste and hazardous substances, including those substances that are persistent in the environment, toxic and accumulate along the food chain. Product stewardship can play a part as one of the means by which to achieve these goals.


These international obligations do not remain static. Under the Stockholm convention, some flame retardant chemicals present in many products are to be restricted or banned. There is also emerging global agreement on directions to reduce mercury emissions.


Mercury is present in many products. It is also harmful in minute amounts, and long-term, daily exposure above 25 millionths of a gram per cubic metre is considered unsafe. To place in context the importance of responsible end-of-life management of products—over 50 million lamps containing mercury, in particular street lights and commercial lighting, were imported into Australia in 2008 and these contained approximately 600 kilograms of mercury. The Commonwealth is responsible for ensuring that Australia's international obligations are met and the states and territories have the primary role in the management of waste under the Australian Constitution. This has led to a long history of collaboration by all Australian governments, anchored in the 1992 National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development. This was the first comprehensive domestic approach to waste and committed all Australian governments to improving the use of resources, reducing the impact of waste on the environment and improving the management of hazardous wastes.


The waste sector has also evolved to cover re-use, recovery, treatment and disposal of waste, and increasingly manages waste as a resource. This creates opportunities. Today the waste and recycling sector is valued at between $7 billion and $11 billion and employs a direct labour force of around 30,000.


The regulation impact statement for the National Waste Policy estimated the savings from a national product stewardship approach to be $147 million over 20 years. The regulation impact statement also identified the additional costs of jurisdictions implementing up to five separate product stewardship programs could be up to $212 million.


Product stewardship schemes are in place in many other parts of the world, including in North America, Europe and Asia. Electrical equipment, tyres, mercury lamps, batteries, packaging, chemical products and even cars are covered by such arrangements.


Australia has adopted many individual approaches to product stewardship. The Commonwealth's Product Stewardship (Oil) Act 2000 covers lubricating oils and its Ozone and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 covers the management of ozone-depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases. South Australia introduced a mandatory deposit refund scheme on drink containers in 1977 and the Northern Territory has recently passed similar legislation. New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia also have legislation that can require product stewardship schemes. Used packaging stewardship is covered by a national environment protection measure that has been enacted differently in each jurisdiction since 1998.


A complex mix of rules and regulations applies to products and materials that are sold nationally by companies operating Australia wide. A single piece of legislation that allows for the consistent regulation of products and materials provides a more effective mechanism than an array of individual product legislation at both Commonwealth and state levels.


There is no doubt that many companies wish to do the right thing and are already involved in voluntary product stewardship schemes. Some of these schemes are familiar. DrumMuster recycles used agricultural and veterinary chemical containers and has reformulated products to reduce packaging and waste. Planet Ark takes back printer cartridges, MobileMuster deals with mobile phones, and more recently Fluorocycle started recycling mercury from commercial lighting.


The states and territories, local government, industry, business associations, the retail sector, environmental groups and the community actively support the National Waste Policy, and a national approach to product stewardship. Extensive consultation has been undertaken over the past two years, with strong levels of participation. To date over 1,000 people have attended some 80 public and bilateral meetings, and there have been around 320 public submissions.


The bill efficiently addresses the need for a simple enduring national approach to product stewardship through a single piece of framework legislation. Three types of product stewardship arrangements will be catered for. Industries and products may be regulated through either a co-regulatory or mandatory approach and voluntary product stewardship schemes can be accredited.


This framework will allow for different products and materials to be covered over time as needs emerge, and for the arrangements to be tailored to suit different circumstances in a changing international, social, environmental and economic context. Importantly there is also a comprehensive suite of checks and balances built into the framework to ensure it is appropriate and transparent.


The bill sets the framework under which products and materials can be regulated and the obligations placed on various parties. It sets out the governance arrangements, the powers of the regulator, and the reporting and audit requirements for organisations delivering product stewardship schemes. It provides the offences and penalties together with the compliance and enforcement powers.


For a product to be covered it must further the objects of the legislation, which are an expression of the aims and principles of the National Waste Policy and its product stewardship strategy. The product must also satisfy specified criteria, including whether the product is in a national market. As each product, material and industry is unique, the regulations will set out the details of what is to be regulated and the actions to be taken.


The actions required in the regulations may include the need to avoid, reduce or eliminate waste from products. There may be a requirement to reduce hazardous substances or to manage the waste as a resource. Importantly, there may be the obligation to ensure that products or waste from products is reused, recycled, recovered, treated or disposed of in a safe, scientific and environmentally sound way.


The intent of the voluntary element is to encourage product stewardship without the need for regulation and to provide the community with more certainty, through the use of a logo, that accredited schemes actually achieve what they claim. In particular, product stewardship organisations that are accredited will meet specific reporting and audit requirements, which will provide for both transparency and accountability.


Co-regulatory product stewardship schemes will be delivered by industry with only outcomes and basic operational requirements specified in regulation. A company will not be able to benefit from refusing to participate, so there will be no free-riders. Thresholds may be applied to avoid impacts on small business.


Mandatory product stewardship would set obligations for parties to take certain actions in relation to a product. The bill provides a comprehensive set of product stewardship requirements that can be drawn upon for that purpose. These include the ability to require labelling, to require producers to take products back at the end of life for recycling or to require a deposit and refund be applied to a product. These requirements are based on those already in use, such as those in the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989.


There will be a rigorous transparent assessment and consultation process before a decision to make regulations on a product. This will follow the Australian government's regulatory impact analysis requirements. Through the Environment Protection and Heritage Council all governments have agreed that a national television and computer product stewardship scheme should be the first to be regulated under this product stewardship framework legislation. The decision regulation impact statement published in 2009 showed that a national television and computer product stewardship scheme would provide a net benefit to society in the range of $517 million to $742 million over the period 2008-09 to 2030-31.


Industry, jurisdictions and the community have sought national regulation for end of life televisions and computers for more than a decade. Around 32 million new television and computer products were sold in Australia in 2008, with an estimated 16.8 million units reaching end of life in the same year. Only 10 per cent are recycled, which is well below the average rate of recycling for all waste of 52 per cent. The volume of television and computer products reaching end of life is expected to grow to 44 million per year by 2028. This electronic waste is classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention.


The decision by all governments and industry to deliver this scheme is an important step towards sustainable management of electronic waste in Australia. This Product Stewardship Bill demonstrates the willingness of business, community and government to share responsibility for reducing the environmental impacts of products throughout their lives and will make a major contribution to achieving a more sustainable Australia.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (10:18):  It gives me great pleasure to support the Product Stewardship Bill 2011. This bill in its most practical terms is about giving Australia and Australians a way forward for the recycling of television and computer waste, an area in which the waste stream is growing. It is about protecting both the health and the environment for future generations of Australians.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from

10:34





Mr HUNT:
  This bill has its origins, in many ways, in what happened in the 1950s in the town of Minamata on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. The situation was that the Chisso Corporation, set up in the 1930s, had been producing material and chemicals which were used in the production of plastics. One of the by-products was mercury. That mercury was allowed to leak into and be dumped into Minamata Bay. Over time, that mercury found its way into the food chain. In particular, it found its way into the shellfish, the crustaceans and the general fish community. It was ingested. The early 1950s saw what was sometimes known as the drunken cat syndrome, where small animals began to suffer and lost their motor coordination. Progressively this fed into the situation faced by the people of Minamata. It was an early warning sign in the postwar period of the danger, the impact, the hazard of heavy metal poisoning on the human population. 


The Minamata story was slow to occur and it was slow to be recognised. But what occurred in Minamata and what occurred through the negligence of the Chisso Corporation was a message that progressively made its way around the world—the message being that we have responsibility for the stewardship of our products and we have responsibility for the by-products and consequences which flow from our products. Against that background of the Minamata disease, as it was known, and the profound impact it had on the people and the life of the fishing community of Minamata, we now come to the situation where product stewardship is a legitimate, important national responsibility for Australia in the 21st century.


Let me make this point about bipartisanship in environmental affairs. There are points of disagreement but there are also significant areas of agreement. Currently, the opposition and the government are engaged in three major areas of cooperative activity. Firstly, there is this product stewardship legislation. Secondly, we have recently provided support for the government's revised vehicle emissions standards. That is an important direct action measure which the government has taken and to which we have given our support. Thirdly, we have also accepted—although we have some concerns about the way in which it was done—the changes to the fringe benefits tax to prevent the ludicrous situation of people driving enormous distances immediately prior to the cut-off date for the annual calculation of kilometres, thereby increasing emissions, fuel usage and waste in our society. These changes will end the windfall gain to be received by driving further, although we do have some concerns about the impact on legitimate, proper activities of tradespeople and people involved in travelling sales.


Having said that, these three examples of product stewardship, emission standards and fringe benefits tax reform are all examples of cooperative action. Where we disagree, it is not disagreement for the sake of it but disagreement on the basis of an alternative principle—a concern either about the structure or the implementation. In the same way that, right from the outset, we identified the home insulation program as a potential, an emerging and finally an actual disaster—on each occasion eliciting a denial by the government that such a problem either would be faced or was actually being faced—we now place our concerns on the record about using a massive electricity, petrol, gas and grocery tax as the means to reduce Australian emissions.


Against that preliminary discussion, I will deal with this bill in four brief stages—firstly, the nature of the bill; secondly, the background; thirdly, the principle; and, finally, the detail. The Product Stewardship Bill 2011 establishes a national framework to support voluntary, co-regulatory and regulatory product stewardship and extended producer responsibility schemes to provide for the impacts of a product being responsibly managed during and at the end of its life. This bill is about providing a structure for whole-of-life management of consumer products and the components contained within them. Very simply, it is about making sure that in the 21st century there are no more Minamatas and that we do not face the Rachel Carson Silent Spring examples which she so courageously raised. She was one of the harbingers of the modern concern for environmental management, and she paid a difficult price at the time. She opened up consciousness about taking responsibility for that which we produce and therefore for the consequences of those products. 


Having established the bill's purpose, I turn to the background to the bill itself. The commitment to establish the framework goes back a long way, through the Council of Australian Governments and in particular the Environment Protection and Heritage Council. There was discussion of the principle in November 2009 but I know discussions go back to previous years. I was involved myself in a discussion in Christchurch some years ago, on behalf of the Australian government, with the New Zealand government and the Australian states. There is a long heritage of bipartisan support for the concept and the direction, and I am pleased that we have been able to work with the government to achieve appropriate changes and amendments which will allow for a joint approach.


That brings me to the specific principle of the bill. The coalition fully supports the principle of product stewardship. This is the notion of shared responsibility for reducing the environmental health and safety footprint of manufactured goods and materials across the lifecycle of a product. That is drawn directly from the National Waste Policy. We support that concept; it is about doing things in a correct and appropriate fashion that will not inadvertently drive up the cost of living for Australians but will deal with the problem directly, head-on and in a way which can solve the problem at source. In particular, the coalition also supports the notion of voluntary schemes. Voluntary product stewardship schemes as set out in part 2 of the bill which sit alongside co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship schemes offer a very prospective way forward.


I now turn to the detail of the bill. I praise the work of coalition members Senator Simon Birmingham and Senator Mary Jo Fisher, both of whom have worked with the government. In particular, the coalition worked with Senator Don Farrell on a series of amendments. The result of those amendments is that there are now three very specific criteria for developing and recognising schemes for accreditation under this bill. The first element is that the system be focused very much on containing hazardous waste substances, the second element is that there be a clear test on the potential to significantly increase the conservation of materials used in the products or increase the recovery of resources from waste from the products, and the third element is that there be the potential to significantly reduce the impact that the products or substances in the products have on the environment or on the health or safety of human beings. The origins of the last element can be traced back not just to Minamata but to some of the tragedies we saw through industrialisation in the 19th century.

Michael Powell trained with Sapper Robinson at basic training in Kapooka and the School of Military Engineering in Sydney and they were sappers in the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment in Townsville. Lance Corporal Powell has given me his words to read here today:


Sapper Rowan 'Robbo' Robinson was my mate. We joined the Army together and we served together. I knew him well. I miss him.


Robbo was an incredible person, a superb friend and an exceptional soldier.


Even upon joining the Army he was mature beyond his years and an inspiration to all his peers.


His skills and abilities were vast and varied. From singing and playing the guitar to military diving he could do it or he had done it.


With elite fitness and a rare strength of character his passing is devastating.


This was Rowans second trip to Afghanistan. When asked to serve, he stepped up proudly, with passion for his profession and unwavering commitment to his mates.


His vibrant smile and outstanding personality will be forever missed and never forgotten.


Those words are the words of Lance Corporal Michael Powell.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:07):  On Monday, 6 June this year, Sapper Rowan Jaie Robinson was killed by enemy fire in northern Helmand, Afghanistan. I did not know Rowan Robinson personally nor would most Australians, but with them I honour him.


I have read the brief report of the action in which he was killed and I have seen the statement by his family. But I cannot honour him as those who knew him and loved him honour him. I cannot share with you, with this House, some personal insight into this brave young man. What I can do is to thank him on behalf of so many Australians, because this brave young man went to war at his nation's request—at our request—not once but on two separate deployments. Rowan Robinson died fighting for Australia, for all of us. Not for him is the opportunity for the debate and discussions we have in this place—the debate and discussions we have because of the bravery of so many young Australians in Afghanistan and those who have gone before. It was simply an order, a deployment, an operation and a duty proudly undertaken. His family's statement said:


… he took his work very seriously, knowing he was responsible for the lives of those who followed him through dangerous ground. He knew the risk of his job and accepted it.


How courageous is that! And yet that is what we ask of our troops each time they go to war, each mission, each patrol and each action. That is what we must never forget. These brave young men undertake these risks and sadly, many die—sadly, too many die. They take these risks because their nation asks them to. As I said some time ago, sadly, the remoteness of this war and the 15-second grab nature of television news means that many Australians do not see the harsh reality of war. They do not feel the pain and suffering of those who have lost a son, a brother, a friend.


To Rowan Robinson's family I offer my sympathy and that of the people of Ryan. There is little I can say that can take away the pain of your tragic loss. Your nation is forever in your debt because, like Rowan, you have paid the greatest price. You have lost someone you love—as simple, as harsh and as tragic as that. We must never forget that debt. To Rowan Robinson, I did not know you but in this place I honour you as I honour those who have gone before and those who are still there. I can only imagine the pain and suffering of your family. My heart is with them.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:10):  'He gave his today for our tomorrow': words which describe the sacrifice Sapper Rowan Jaie Robinson made to help make our world a better place, a safer place.


Sapper Rowan Robinson was fatally shot on 6 June by insurgent fire after his patrol destroyed an enemy weapons cache during operations in southern Helmand. Sapper Robinson was 23 years young, an outstanding, brave man—one of the bravest of the brave—who had joined the Australian Army in 2006, becoming a valued member of the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment.


Originally deployed to Afghanistan when he was barely out of his teens in 2007 as part of Operation Slipper, on his second tour of duty Sapper Robinson was serving with the special operations Incident Response Regiment. He has been described by his mates and fellow soldiers as a happy-go-lucky guy and was a great member of his team. He was a dedicated and professional solider whose skills belied his youth. His friendly nature meant he was popular with peers and chain of command alike.


His family describe the immense pride with which Rowan wore his uniform and the seriousness with which he took his role as an Incident Response Regiment engineer. They were and still are so proud of their son and brother who chose to serve his country by joining the Army. To Sapper Robinson's family and wide circle of friends, I offer my sincere condolences and the heartfelt sorrow of the people of Riverina.


A soldier's death is always felt right across Australia because we are all mindful of the enormous devotion and extraordinary service given. The deep sense of individual and collective commitment and, at times such as this,


of personal and overall loss is felt particularly deeply at Blamey Barracks, the Army recruit training centre at Kapooka in my electorate of Riverina. Wagga Wagga is the home of the soldier—the regional city where every Army recruit goes to do his initial training.


When a soldier dies in combat it is a solemn reminder to new recruits of the challenges they will face but also reaffirms their commitment to serve Australia and reinforces their loyalty to the great ideal for which they serve—peace. It is a sad and sombre thought that Sapper Robinson's name has now been added to Australia's roll of honour for Afghanistan.


On 30 May this year we lost another two soldiers in Afghanistan, Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case. Both soldiers were on their first deployment to Afghanistan. Lance Corporal Jones was serving with the Force Support Unit as a cook and was fatally shot by an Afghani who was a part of the coalition defence force, a person deemed to be friend not foe.


Lieutenant Case was serving as a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle operator and was killed when an Australian Chinook helicopter crashed in Zabul province around 90 kilometres east of the Australian base at Tarin Kowt. We also remember these two soldiers who returned to their beloved homeland not the way any soldier should have to, having done their duty helping those who need defending, protecting those who need protection, opposing those who warrant opposing, doing what is right because the international community abhors terrorism.


The deaths of Lance Corporal Jones and Lieutenant Case as well as Sapper Robinson bring Australia's death toll in Afghanistan to 27. To ensure these great warriors and their fallen comrades did not die in vain we must remain committed to our obligations in Afghanistan. We must remain committed to the troops still serving and we must not let the Taliban think they have won by showing any signs of considering a withdrawal. Fighting season, the Taliban-led spring offensive in Afghanistan, has not long started. To leave now would signal to them they have won. But they have not won and they will not—not now, not tomorrow, not into the future. There must be no safe haven for terrorism, no training camps for terrorists, no more 9-11s, no more Bali or London bombings.


In my parliamentary office hang two framed posters from 1919 detailing the sacrifice of soldiers—willing, enthusiastic and patriotic volunteers who fought and fell in World War I. It was called the Great War, but we know that no war is great. It was called the war to end all wars, but we know that war continues to this day. Sadly, while ever evildoers threatened to rise up and do evil things to innocent people, stopping these bad and mad people from future acts of atrocity must and will be a priority of those nations such as Australia which are prepared to have their best and bravest fight and, if necessary, die in the pursuit of peace. My World War I posters of valour are poignant reminders of the ultimate price paid by the 59,341 diggers so that we can stand here in our democratic parliament, in a democratic country, and voice our opinions freely. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. 


Our troops in Afghanistan today are carrying on the mighty traditions forged in the battlefields of Gallipoli, the Western Front and Northern Africa in 1914-18. This wonderful and enduring spirit of Anzac was appropriately mentioned on Monday by the New Zealand Prime Minister, the Right Hon. John Key, in his historic speech to the joint sitting of parliament. Our military personnel are helping to restore democracy in Afghanistan so that Afghans can one day hopefully enjoy the freedoms and liberties we enjoy in Australia and in New Zealand. We must ensure we remember this. We must ensure we remember those who have fallen fighting for this. We must remember Sapper Robinson and his 26 mates and the wider family that is the Australian Army—always remember.  May they rest in peace. Lest we forget.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (17:16):  Today I rise to pay my respects and offer my heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Sapper Rowan Robinson. I would also say that, for a variety of reasons, I have not had the opportunity to place on the record my thoughts in relation to the loss of Lieutenant Marcus Case, Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, Sergeant Brett Wood, Sapper Jamie Larcombe and Corporal Richard Atkinson. I think back to some of the speeches which have been made since the Anzac legend was born on 25 April 1915. I want to bring forward a couple of quotes which are as true today as they were then. I would like to quote General Sir Ian Hamilton, who said:


Before the war, who had ever heard of ANZAC? Hereafter, who will ever forget it?


Mr Deputy Speaker, I put to you that the service of these Australian diggers has been in the same vein with the same spirit as those who have walked those grounds before them. They go to do the deeds of government in fighting for freedom and democracy. They embrace the challenges because those they leave behind in Australia—their family, their friends, their loved ones and their nation which they love so dearly—give them the strength and courage to stand side by side with their fellow diggers as they go into the heat of battle. As Henry Lawson wrote at the time of the war in a clarion call:


I tell you the Star of the South shall rise—in the lurid clouds of war.


Wherever these Anzacs served, they left a legacy, often larger than life. It was during March-April last year that I had the opportunity to go to Afghanistan. I did not know Sapper Robinson, Lieutenant Case, Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, Sergeant Wood, Sapper Larcombe or Corporal Atkinson and I had not met them, but I feel I had because I had met their colleagues, the people from the same units, the people these brave heroes served alongside. While I did not know them individually, I knew them because of what they were, who they were and how they served their nation with great distinction. We can never forget their sacrifice.


As it says in the Bible in John 15:13:


Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.


To a man, in our Defence Force, they are driven to fight as hard for their mates as for their nation. They would never expect their mates to do the heavy lifting for them. Their creed is that they do the heavy lifting for their mates. They never, ever leave anyone behind or in a position of danger. And that can be said of these fallen heroes. Other speakers have detailed their tours of duty and their well-earned, well-deserved medals of recognition for the campaigns that they have fought. But, simply said: how do you fill the hole that is left in the lives of their family and their friends? It is that hole that makes sure that they are remembered. 


The final words of the ode are: lest we forget. That must play hard on our minds because we should never forget their service or their sacrifice in Afghanistan not just fighting for the freedoms and ideals of the people in Australia and to reduce the opportunity for terrorism, but fighting for people they do not know, so that those young boys and girls in Afghanistan can have the freedoms, the democracy and the opportunities that we sometimes take for granted in Australia. This is a war fought in a foreign land against an evil that knows no bounds and no rules, but these diggers step up to the plate.


When I sat around in Camp Holland talking to people—including Sapper Smith, who I had the opportunity to meet when I and my colleagues visited there and who unfortunately met a terrible fate—I got to know what drove them. If they had kids, they were there fighting for their kids' future. What they saw in the kids of Afghanistan was a reflection of their own children. They saw sense, they saw hope and they saw a future. They wanted the children in Afghanistan to grow up with the opportunities and freedoms that they ask for their own children.


How brave is an Australian soldier? They are not forced to go to war; they volunteer to go to war. In fact, some of them fight and train very hard to qualify to go and do what they do. Quite often, people divide up the recognition and the allocation of heroism for people who serve in various positions in the theatres of operation. My understanding as the former shadow minister for defence science and personnel and assisting shadow minister for defence, and my understanding based on having had personnel from Williamtown RAAF Base in my electorate for a long time, is that each and every member of our Defence Force plays a key and integral role in the success of the units. We have suffered these casualties. We have also had 179 wounded in the theatres of operation, the majority of which have occurred since 2007. But these diggers join an honour roll of fine men who have paid the ultimate price, so I would like to put their names on the honour roll:


Sergeant Andrew Russell, Special Air Service Regiment. Trooper David 'Poppy' Pearce, 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment. Sergeant Matthew Locke, Special Air Service Regiment. Private Luke Worsley, Special Operations Task Group. Lance Corporal Jason Marks, 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Signaller Sean McCarthy, Special Service Regiment. Lieutenant Michael Fussell, 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Private Gregory Michael Sher, 1st Commando Regiment, Australian Special Operations Command. Corporal Mathew Hopkins, 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Sergeant Brett Till, Incident Response Regiment. Private Benjamin Ranaudo, 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Sapper Jacob Moerland, 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment. Sapper Darren Smith, 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment. Private Scott Palmer, 2nd Commando Regiment, serving with Special Operations Task Group. Private Timothy Aplin, 2nd Commando Regiment, serving with Special Operations Task Group. Private Benjamin Chuck, 2nd Commando Regiment, serving with Special Operations Task Group. Private Nathan Bewes, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Trooper Jason Brown, Special Air Service Regiment. Private Grant Kirby, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Private Thomas Dale, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Corporal Richard Atkinson, 1st Combat Engineer Regiment. Sapper Jamie Larcombe, 1st Combat Engineer Regiment. Sergeant Brett Wood, 2nd Commando Regiment. Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, 9th Force Support Battalion. Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case, 6th Aviation Regiment. Sapper Rowan Robinson, Incident Response Regiment. 


I sincerely pray that this roll of honour of our fallen heroes grows by no more. We have paid enough of a price but if, indeed, more is to be paid to make sure the job is completed then that is the way it is. All of their families, of course, are devastated and saddened by their loss but the families that I have met with at the various ramp ceremonies and funerals for our diggers that I have attended, each to a T, has said, 'Please don't let their sacrifice be in vain.' They want the job completed because they understand the ideals that these fine Australian men gave their lives for and that must always be remembered. So I simply say as I honour these fine Australian heroes: lest we forget.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (17:26):  It is with the deepest sympathy for the Robinson family that I speak on the loss of Rowan, who was killed while serving his country in Afghanistan on Monday, 6 June 2011, Afghanistan time. His loss is felt across this country but more so, obviously, by his mother and father, Marie and Peter, sister Rachael and two brothers, Ben and Troy. Words alone cannot express the heartfelt sorrow that we feel when one so young and full of life is taken from us. But it is with more than words that we reach out to those closest to Rowan. We also reach out with our thoughts, our prayers, our sympathy and our gratitude. We offer gratitude for the life, the joy, the mateship and the service that Rowan Robinson offered to those around him—to his family, his friends, his colleagues and his country.


Sapper Rowan Robinson, age 23, was a young Incident Response Regiment engineer based in Idalia in Townsville in my electorate of Dawson. His parents, too, live in Idalia but the grief of his loss is felt far beyond North Queensland. Rowan grew up with his family in Duranbah, where he attended Cudgen Public School. He later attended Mount St Patrick's College at Murwillumbah and Kingscliff High School. He was a long-time member of the Cudgen Headland Surf Life Saving Club. He left behind his life in New South Wales and fulfilled his dream of joining the Australian Defence Force. No doubt those who knew him back then will remember the easygoing nature that endeared him to so many. He was a popular young man among all he encountered—friends, colleagues and the chain of command in the Defence Force. His colleagues were as dear to him as he was to them.


Sapper Robinson was on his second deployment in Afghanistan as part of Operation Slipper when he was tragically killed by insurgents. I understand that Sapper Robinson and other Australian troops were with their partners from the Afghan National Police and were deployed to the northern Helmand province in Afghanistan, where there was a known insurgent distribution and supply cell. They discovered a large stash of weapons, including grenade launchers, ammo, assault rifles and communication equipment, and during that raid the patrol was shot at. The patrol destroyed the stash and moved on to another area where they again came under heavy fire from several directions, and this is where Sapper Rowan Robinson was tragically taken from us. I mention this only to say that Sapper Robinson died while saving lives. Every gun, rifle and grenade launcher in that stash, every bit of ammo and other equipment that was destroyed by Sapper Robinson and the rest of the patrol could very well mean that a coalition soldier or an Afghan national is not killed now and into the future. That is bravery, to lay down one's life for his friend, the friends in this case being his brothers in arms and our friends in Afghanistan who dream of a free and peaceful nation.


To lay down one's life for one's friend: there is no greater bravery or love than that. Sapper Robinson's service was recognised by the awarding of the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp, International Coalition Against Terrorism; the Afghanistan Campaign Medal; the Australian Defence Medal; and the NATO International Security Assistance Force Medal. He has also been awarded the Army Combat Badge and the Returned from Active Service Badge.


As civilians it is very difficult for us to understand the depth of mateship amongst those serving on the front line. Sapper Robinson died fighting with his mates in a mission that will save lives, earning the respect of fellow soldiers, officers and those here at home. Words alone cannot console, but I want to put on record my gratitude and respect for the life of Sapper Rowan Robinson and for his service to this country. I am sure that the entire electorate of Dawson joins with me in expressing sadness at the news of his passing.


Sapper Robinson is the 27th digger to die in combat in Afghanistan, and I take this moment to remember all of those who have fallen as well. Our thoughts and prayers are with Sapper Robinson's family at this time of grieving and also with all the families of our servicemen who have fallen in conflict in Afghanistan. I want to finish with St Ignatius' prayer. It reads:


Teach us, Good Lord, To Serve Thee as Thou deservest; To give and not to count the cost; To fight and not to heed the wounds; To toil and not to seek for rest; To labour and not to ask for any reward, save that of knowing that we do Thy will.


Sapper Robinson might not have known that prayer, but he gave, fought, toiled and laboured for us all and now he finds his rest and reward in the arms of the eternal Father while we here grieve for his wounds and the cost of his life for our nation.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (17:32):  I would also like to rise to add my words to the most eloquent words of my colleague who spoke just before me. It is with great regret that I do rise to speak on this condolence motion. Regret, because it is a national tragedy when we lose one of our soldiers in the theatre of war.


On 23 May Australia mourned the loss of Sergeant Brett Wood, aged just 25, who was killed in southern Afghanistan by an improvised explosive device. As we were coming to terms with this recent loss we have since had three more deaths: Lieutenant Marcus Case, aged 27, who died in a helicopter crash; Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, aged 25, who was shot by a rogue Afghan soldier; and most recently on 6 June, there was the death of Sapper Rowan Robinson, aged just 23 years, who died during a raid on a weapons cache in Helmand province. These were young men who had so much to live for. These young men sacrificed their lives for Australia's cause in Afghanistan. It is our duty to accord them the highest honour.


The past few weeks have been particularly difficult for our troops in Afghanistan. The news of these deaths has shocked and distressed millions of Australians. As we come to terms with 27 operational deaths in Afghanistan, our thoughts are with the families, friends and fellow soldiers who daily bear the burden of their sacrifice. For them, there will be moments of overwhelming grief and a permanent feeling of emptiness. There is no way for us to comprehend what they are going through. This is the serious price we pay for our involvement in the fight for freedom and security, and we must never forget it.


It is perfectly natural that Australians should question our involvement in Afghanistan when they hear reports of Australian deaths. It is not only natural but important that we continue to view our involvement in Afghanistan with a critical mind. So long as our troops remain overseas there will be moments of great sadness in Australia and in this parliament. It is at times like these that we must look to the objectives of our primary mission to defeat terrorists. To do this we need to train Afghan security forces so that they can provide for their own security. Our mission is also to honour and protect the US alliance, which is in our national interest. Our national security is in our national interest.


While Australia is a young nation when compared to other nations around the world, we have been steadfast in our determination to protect freedom, tolerance and democracy, making the supreme sacrifice so that we might live in a world of peace and prosperity. Looking to our efforts in Afghanistan, we can be proud of what we have accomplished thus far. We have made it a safer country. We have given opportunity to thousands of men, women and children who lived in fear under the Taliban. Together with the local people, we have put in place governance, security and education structures to ensure that the country will not again be used as a breeding ground for international terrorism.


We should listen to our Defence Force chiefs, who know the situation on the ground and the improvements we are making across the country. More than anyone else, our leaders in the Defence Force wish to preserve the lives of our troops in combat. They know the situation that confronts our soldiers every day, and they know best how to respond. We should respect their judgment. We should listen to Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who said:


Believe me, we need to stay the course, we are getting to the stage where we're seeing absolutely first-class results with the people we're mentoring.


We cannot deny the successes we have had in Afghanistan. Australia has played a key role in disrupting terrorist activities and breaking the stranglehold of the religious zealots who have kept the population of Afghanistan in fear for so long. We have helped rebuild a functional society where people have the ultimate say in who leads their country. We have helped put an end to much of the violence and suffering. It has been the efforts of soldiers like Brett Wood, Marcus Case, Andrew Jones and Rowan Robinson that have made Afghanistan a freer place for everyone, and particularly for women. We have forged an important friendship with the people of Afghanistan, who want to be a free people and need us there to help them build a free and democratic nation.


We should never forget what our soldiers have done to defend Australia and humanity abroad. We must bear in mind their great sacrifices and ensure that what they have fought to achieve is protected and fostered. The best way to do that is by growing the substantial gains we have already made in Afghanistan. We should bear in mind that our mission in Afghanistan is a noble one and will succeed if we stay the course. We should, though, be there only for as long as we need to be and not a minute more.


In this condolence motion today, we remember all of those men who have given their lives: Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David Pearce, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Private Luke Worsley, Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Signaller Sean McCarthy, Lieutenant Michael Fussell, Private Gregory Sher, Corporal Mathew Hopkins, Sergeant Brett Till, Private Benjamin Ranaudo, Sapper Jacob Moerland, Sapper Darren Smith, Private Timothy Aplin, Private Scott Palmer, Private Benjamin Chuck, Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby, Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney, Corporal Richard Atkinson, Sapper Jamie Larcombe and, as I have said, before, Sergeant Brett Wood, Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, Lieutenant Marcus Case and Sapper Rowan Robinson. We honour their sacrifice and the ongoing sacrifice of their families. We will keep their memory alive.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (17:38):  I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and all members who have spoken or will speak on this very important condolence motion. I rise, like all of them, to pay my respects to Sapper Rowan Robinson, another Australian hero who has given his life for his country at the tender age of 23. Sapper Robinson had been in the ADF for some five years, had two tours of duty to Afghanistan and had been awarded six decorations during that time.


We have now had 27 lives lost in Afghanistan; that is 27 too many. As a former Minister for Defence I have been very determined to ensure that I make a contribution on each of these condolence motions, and as I do so this evening I lament the fact that I find myself repeating myself, but I felt it necessary to do so, because the same things need to be said. Many of those things have been said in this chamber this evening. The first is that while I did not know Sapper Robinson—although I must say it is possible that I may have met him; if I did I just do not recall—I am sure that Sapper Robinson knew exactly what he was doing in committing himself to the ADF's operations in Afghanistan and that he fully understood the risks but was as keen as mustard to undertake the task. Likewise, having had the not-always-happy experience of meeting, mixing with and consoling families of fallen soldiers, I am very confident that Sapper Robinson's parents would also have been very supportive of his decision to serve his country in a very, very dangerous theatre of war. It is very tough for the families involved, but I always sense when I meet with them that they draw some comfort from the fact that the person they love so much and who is now no longer with them was doing what he loved and wanted to do and were supportive of that.


I will pick up on the theme of others. Afghanistan is very tough. The longer we are there and the more people we lose, the more difficult it will be for us to maintain support for our operations amongst the Australian people. Like many others, I appeal to people to hold their nerve. We are there for very important reasons. Afghanistan does go directly to the security and safety of Australians, both here on our mainland—on our continent—and as we travel around the globe.


As a former minister, I still have quite a deal of contact with many people who are heavily engaged in the mission—and indeed those on the ground in places like Tarin Kowt and Kandahar. They report to me that we are making very, very substantial progress there. In fact, one person said to me, 'If you come back to Tarin Kowt now you would be very, very pleased and very, very proud of what we have achieved.'


In addition to the excellent disruption work being done by our special forces, our infantry, engineers and others are helping to train the Afghan National Army, ANA, to a standard at which they will be capable of taking care of their own security. In addition to that, we are helping to train the Afghan National Police, and when they get to the required standard we will be able to come home safe in the knowledge that we have done our job. People often ask me: 'Can you win in Afghanistan?' My response always is: 'That depends on your definition of winning.' We will have won when we are satisfied that we leave Oruzgan province a better place, a safer place both within and as a consequence for Australians and, it goes without saying, when the Afghan National Security Forces are capable of taking care of their own security.


Of course, we are doing much more which is very important. We continue to build social and economic capacity and we continue to play a role in building governance in Oruzgan province. In coalition with others we still play a role in building governance across the country. We will not meet with success in Afghanistan by military means alone. It will be a combined effort between military effort, the efforts in governance, the efforts in capacity building and the efforts in training more broadly.


Afghanistan is a difficult place but it is a place where there is hope. It was interesting that this week US defence secretary Robert Gates confirmed that some negotiations had been taking place between coalition forces and the insurgents. I will say again what I have been saying for two years—and I say this for those who might be concerned about this: there is a big difference between negotiating with extremists and setting up dialogue with moderates. I think the latter can produce real results. Indeed, I think it is absolutely necessary. We cannot meet with ultimate success in Afghanistan without some form of political settlement. Afghanistan has to want to govern itself in a way we would expect them to, and the Afghan people have to have faith and trust in those who govern them. If we cannot achieve that, we will not meet with success. Again, I pay tribute to Sapper Rowan Robinson. He now will be recorded as a great Australian, a heroic Australian. The work of the sapper when out with special forces is of a kind we find difficult to fathom, wondering whether the next step will be your last. It is difficult for us to appreciate that. He was prepared to take those risks for those who were fighting alongside him, his mates. He was prepared to take those risks for the safety and security of his country and his fellow Australians. I extend my heartfelt sympathy to his family, his mum and dad, his mates, his friends and all who loved him.

Sapper Robinson leaves behind his loving parents, Marie and Peter, sister Rachael and brothers Ben and Troy. In the words of his family:


He knew the risk of his job and accepted it. It’s harder for us to accept he has been taken from us before his time—but we know he died protecting his mates and doing a job that he loved, a job for which he was greatly respected by the people who served by his side.


Sapper Robinson joined the Army in 2006 and subsequently became a member of the 3rd Combat Engineers Regiment and later the Incident Response Regiment, based in Sydney. He was on his second deployment to Afghanistan, having been first deployed on Operation Slipper in 2007.


Over his short but full life, his father Peter said that his son had:


… his fair share of luck. He escaped the jaws of a shark while surfing at South Kingscliff Beach and walked away from a motor vehicle accident when he rolled his brother's car.


He had been run over by an armoured vehicle, and a soldier walking beside him once stood on a home-made bomb that did not detonate. But at his son's funeral Peter said:


… that luck ran out on a hilltop in southern Afghanistan.


In the words of his commanding officer at IRR:


He epitomised everything that a special operations engineer can be and should be—bravery, mateship and a willingness to risk one's life so that others may live; those were his qualities, and to a soldier, we aspire to them.


The Australian Chief of Army, Lieutenant-General Ken Gillespie, put it this way:


As a Sapper, he led from the front, looking for threats and disabling those devices to keep his mates safe.


The death of Sapper Robinson is a tragedy for our nation and a tragedy for his family. His contribution to this vitally important mission of bringing security and stability to Afghanistan is not in vain, nor will it be forgotten by a grateful nation. Lest we forget.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (17:54):  I rise to pay my respects on the loss of Sapper Rowan Jai Robinson. Sapper Robinson was a member of the special operations Incident Response Regiment, whose job it was to clear the way for the Special Forces who come behind them. As many have noted, this is a very dangerous job requiring a high level of skill and the most courageous soldiers. Sapper Robinson fitted into this category perfectly. Sapper Robinson has been described by his officers as a motivated, dedicated and highly professional soldier who recognised the dangerous and important nature of his role and took it extremely seriously. His family have spoken about how proud he was to be an Incident Response Regiment engineer.


After joining the Army in 2006 Sapper Robinson was posted to Townsville, my home town, to be followed soon after by his family as they sought to be closer to their children. As the home of Australia's largest defence base the people of Townsville feel the pain of his death acutely. I offer my sympathies to Sapper Robinson's family, friends and mates, particularly those with whom he served and who are still based at Lavarack Barracks. The community of Townsville is standing right beside you at this difficult time.


It was in protecting his mates through providing cover fire in overwatch that Sapper Robinson was killed. You sometimes think about how you would react if you were put into a situation like that. It is only when you are actually faced with situations like that that you find out whether you have the bravery or not. The Army does a lot of training so that it becomes muscle memory and they train over and over and over again. They take their training very, very seriously because if they get it wrong people die. In some cases even when they get it right people die.


Sapper Robinson showed great courage. He was killed in crossfire but he was able to show the grit in his teeth and the steel in his spine that truly makes our soldiers and the men and women of our ADF the best defence force in the world. Earlier in the day he had been part of a team that removed the largest cache of weapons, ammunition, drugs and bomb components found in Afghanistan this year. The significance of this and the wider role played by Sapper Robinson cannot be overstated. What he did was to take those weapons out of circulation so that they could never be used against anybody else. Sapper Robinson played a crucial role in contributing to a crucial war.


Thanks to our soldiers, the Afghanistan of today is unrecognisable compared to the Afghanistan that we first entered. That country, under the power of the Taliban, had no regard for justice, no regard for basic human rights and no regard for the lives of its people. The Taliban regime openly supported and fostered terrorism, and reports of atrocities committed against Afghanis by their own government quickly became common knowledge. The Taliban's values could not have been further removed from those we are fortunate enough to enjoy here in Australia and in other Western countries, and they targeted us for that.


Afghanistan has come a long way thanks to soldiers like Sapper Robinson, but the journey is far from over. We watch as our death toll from this deployment rises to 27. We must not forget what we are fighting for and how important it is. Afghanistan must become a democratic country where all its citizens are treated equally regardless of their age, sex, religion or ethnicity. Sapper Robinson was a brave soldier who played a role in Afghanistan that has not gone unnoticed, and he will never be forgotten. As I offer my deepest condolences to the Robinson family, I join the chorus of voices which reflect on the bravery and courage of a young soldier who has made the ultimate sacrifice for his country and for the international community, and with the promise that he did not die in vain.


Sapper Robinson's parents live in Townsville and when I called at his mum and dad's house the front step was covered with flowers. They were not home and it looked like they had already left for northern New South Wales in readiness for the funeral. I left a card to say that whatever they wanted they should call me. Those of us who are parents will mourn with Sapper Robinson's parents. Surely having to bury a child of your own is the hardest thing one must ever have to do. I pray that we do not have to do it. Our hearts go out to Sapper Rowan Robinson's parents and family. Our thoughts are with you. You are not alone. I honour the bravery of this young man and soldier. May he rest in peace. Lest we forget.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:59):  I rise to add my voice to those who have spoken before me in offering my condolence to the family, friends and colleagues of Sapper Rowan Jaie Robinson. The life of Sapper Robinson has been cut down all too soon. At the age of just 23, Sapper Robinson had achieved much more than many others of such a young age, and it is noted that his skill belied his youth. He joined the Army in 2006 and after his initial recruit training joined the 3rd Third Combat Engineer Regiment. Sapper Robinson was on his second deployment to Afghanistan, after also having diligently served under Operation Slipper in 2007-08.


The sapper's role is truly an important one—and, as often coincides with such importance, it is also a dangerous one. The combat engineers lead from the front, protecting their colleagues from the dangers they are to walk into. It takes a truly brave individual to serve in this role, and Sapper Robinson was one of those special individuals, possessing the required characteristics of courage, leadership and, above all, mateship. As his commanding officer said of Sapper Robinson:


Whether it was clearing a path potentially littered with IEDs, fighting for his mates or providing overwatch, no task was too great and no request to help was ever unanswered.


He went on to say:


Rowan was a man who was as selfless as he was courageous.


The loss of Sapper Robinson, following that of Sergeant Brett Wood and Lieutenant Marcus Case, has had a deep impact on the Holsworthy community. Each time news breaks of the loss of a soldier serving overseas, our community turns inwards, asking whether the soldier lost was 'one of ours'. Ultimately, the answer to this question is yes—for even when the soldier in question has not been stationed at Holsworthy, he is Australian and we feel the same deep sense of loss.


Coincidentally today, parliament had a group visiting from the Holsworthy Public School, a school heavily populated with the children of service personnel based out at the local Holsworthy Barracks, including friends and colleagues of these three brave young men. The principal, teachers and students feel this loss, alongside our broader community and the nation as a whole, and this was evident today.


Living in our nation, we sometimes take for granted the freedom, democracy and opportunity that we all enjoy. But we must be ever vigilant to protect these sacred principles. Sapper Robinson certainly did not take these principles for granted, and his actions showed this. Our nation and those that cherish these sacred principles will forever be indebted to Sapper Rowan Jaie Robinson.


In closing, I would like to express my personal and deep sympathies to Sapper Robinson's family, whom he loved so much, in this time of such great loss. To his parents, Marie and Peter, to his brothers, Ben and Troy, and to his sister Rachael: my thoughts are with you.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (18:03):  I acknowledge those who have spoken on this condolence motion for Sapper Rowan Jaie Robinson. Firstly, let me offer my deepest sympathies on the death of Sapper Rowan Robinson and express my condolences to his parents, Peter and Marie, and his siblings, Rachael, Troy and Ben.


Sapper Robinson was described as a soldier whose luck had run out on a dusty Afghan hilltop. Rowan was a dedicated and professional soldier whose skill belied his youth. He was born in Wahroonga, New South Wales, in 1987. He joined the Army in 2006 and after his initial recruit training joined the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment. After four years of service he was posted to the Incident Response Regiment at the start of 2010 where he completed his reinforcement cycle.


Sapper Rowan Robinson was serving with the Special Operations Task Group when he was tragically killed in action on Monday, 6 June 2011. This was his second deployment to Afghanistan, having first deployed in Operation Slipper in 2007. His colleagues described him as a superb young man who was fit, happy-go-lucky and a great team member. I am told that those who had the pleasure of meeting him instantly warmed to him, and his easygoing nature made him popular with his peers and chain of command. Sapper Robinson was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp International Coalition Against Terrorism (ICAT), the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal and the NATO ISAF Medal. He has also been awarded the Army Combat Badge and the Return from Active Service Badge.


At his funeral service on Friday, 17 June, in Kingscliff, a colleague from Sapper Robinson's regiment said the fallen soldier had made the choice to put his comrades' safety above his own:


""You could have sat back and considered your job done when the position was cleared and yet you pushed up, right to the front line … I strongly doubt there was ever a better example of a combat engineer and a brother in arms.""


His father, Peter, told of Sapper Robinson's luck running out on that dusty hill in Afghanistan and how in his youth Sapper Robinson had escaped the jaws of a shark while surfing and walked away from a car accident where he rolled his brother's car. He had been run over in training by an armoured vehicle, and in another incident he had survived an improvised explosive device which failed to detonate after a colleague who was right beside him trod on the device.


Too often now we stand here and have motions of condolence for brave soldiers like Sapper Robinson. As an Australian community, we can only wonder and marvel at the courage and bravery of these young men who lay their lives down for Australia. On behalf of the Australian government, I offer my support to Sapper Robinson's family and friends through this very difficult time and assure them that the sacrifice of this outstanding young Australian soldier will be remembered. They should know that Australia is proud of his courage, his selflessness, his service and the ultimate sacrifice that he has made. He will surely be sorely missed.


It behoves us to understand the nature of armed conflict but more importantly, from my point of view, to understand that anyone who puts an Australian uniform on to work for the Australian Defence Force is a special person. Those special people go where others will not go; they do what others will not do; and ultimately they are prepared to lay down their lives for this great nation of ours, as Sapper Robinson has done. May he rest in peace. Lest we forget.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2011-06-22,"



Ms Roxon:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


(1) The Australian Government currently supports the provision of after hours primary care services through:


Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) After Hours Rebates– higher rebates are offered for after hours consultations by GPs and other medical practitioners;


the General Practice After Hours (GPAH) Program – competitive based program that provides funding to organisations wishing to provide after hours GP services; and


the Practice Incentives Program (PIP) After Hours Incentive – payments are made to eligible general practices which arrange for, or provide, after hours care to their patients.


In the 2010-11 Budget the Australian Government announced reforms to after hours primary care under the 'Establishing Medicare Locals and Improving Access to After Hours Care' measure. This will involve:


the establishment of a national telephone-based after hours GP medical advice and diagnostic service as an additional service to the nurse triage, information and advice services currently provided by the National Health Call Centre Network, trading as healthdirect Australia; and 


the introduction of new Australian Government funding arrangements through Medicare Locals to support the provision of face-to-face after hours primary care services at the local level.

The National Association for Medical Deputising (NAMDS) estimates that MDS provided approximately 600,000 after hours home visits in 2009-10. This figure has not been validated by the Department.
