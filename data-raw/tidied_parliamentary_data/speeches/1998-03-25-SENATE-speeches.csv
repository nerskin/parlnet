"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-25,"—When I left off in my speech last night on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997, I was looking at that part of the second reading speech of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in the other place where he referred to employers being protected from frivolous and mali 
 cious claims. My concern here primarily is that the issue is not about frivolous and malicious claims; it is about the rights of people to seek redress when they have been removed from their employment. It is terribly important that this idea that is being peddled in the minister's second reading speech is absolutely put to rest. The fact is that people are being denied a right of natural justice which this government is seeking to remove through this legislation.
The last thing I wish to look at in the second reading speech of the minister in the other place is this. The minister said:
It is an unavoidable fact that the defence of an unfair dismissal claim, however groundless, is especially burdensome for small businesses.
This is a complete nonsense. The fact of life is that these people will be denied a fundamental basic right, a right to seek their job where they have been unfairly dismissed. In relation to the `however groundless', people invariably do not seek to redress their dismissal because it is groundless; it obviously has a substantial meaning to them and for them. The provision that the government is trying to bring in will do nothing other than to encourage employers to abuse the rights of their employees. Far from being groundless, there will be many grounds upon which employees should be able to claim reinstatement but will have it denied because the government seeks to have this legislation passed through this Senate.
Employees with genuine claims, and there are employees with genuine claims, will be totally disadvantaged by this bill. The fact is—and this was brought out by previous speakers in this debate—that there are very few people who will be covered by the provisions of this bill anyway, because most of the people in small businesses, as has been stated earlier in this debate, are people who are covered by state awards. Very few people are going to be touched in effect by this legislation. Really, this legislation has no purpose other than to provide the government with the trigger for a double dissolution. The legislation should be rejected as it has no moral basis whatsoever. All it seeks to do is to deny people their basic rights.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1998-03-25,"—I am pleased to be able to readdress the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 on the occasion of its second reading to make several further points following from the second reading speech of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in the other place. Before I go into the detail of the misrepresentations that have been presented there, I want to revisit the basic points of what this legislation is about. The most fundamental misrepresentation involved here is in relation to a fair go all round.
Senators will recall that champion phrase used by the government in relation to its representation of battler workers, that it was about `a fair go all round'. But a fair go all round does not mean, ultimately, that one-third of all workers—if you follow the government's harmonisation agenda—lose their rights to fair and secure employment. That is the final point of this legislation. As Senator Hogg said, yes it is a political tool at this stage, which really does not affect that significant change at this point in time. But the final end point with harmonisation would mean that the one-third of workers who work for businesses with 15 or fewer employees would lose their rights in relation to unfair dismissal.
There is no case for this legislation. We argued that point quite strongly on the last occasion and nothing has changed. The government's economic arguments regarding the need for these changes—to generate growth, to drive small business and to drive the economy—have no validity. They have as much validity as the suggestion that the solution to the South Korean economic crisis would be to change their legislation. It does not just exempt businesses with four or fewer employees; it exempts businesses with 15 or fewer employees. That is how much validity this argument has. It has no substance.
The argument for these changes, ironically, has as much substance as the size of this actual bill. It is about using a political tool for a double dissolution; it is not about a fair go all round for Australian workers.
The case for this legislation has not been improved in the interim between now and its last presentation. When it was first presented, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry was the only business organisation advocating support, but it was on the ludicrous case that addressed the legacy of the old legislation. Their only argument was that a legacy existed in terms of the attitudes of small business employers with respect to the old legislation, not the government's new legislation that the government went to the last election with.
Even if you take an extension of that argument, if the argument is that there is a legacy of the old legislation, surely the answer is an education campaign. We should re-educate these small business employers so that they understand the current act, not amend it further on some myth.
Small business organisations were, at that time, more concerned about the fair trading issues, which, ironically, are due in the Senate later this week.
Small trading was their concern at that stage. In the meantime, the government has probably belted a few of these organisations across the ears and they have come forward to say what Minister Reith wants them to say. Maybe there was something involved with the fair trading legislation which was finally brought on. Mr Reith cited a couple of the examples that he was able to bring forward in support of this legislation. Let me take one step back. In his second reading speech, Mr Reith said:
Senators who spoke against this bill said that there was insufficient evidence of the need of the bill, and its benefits.
He then cited several of the surveys that were addressed in the committee hearings, which were misrepresented by the government, discredited in our hearings and also discredited through the estimates process. They all related to the old legislation, not to the current act.
We go on to the claims now coming forward from small business who, strangely enough, apart from the ACCI, were not around to present any case during the committee hearings. Mr Rob Bastian, representing the Council of Small Business Organisations of 
 Australia, said that small businesses would create 50,000 jobs if this bill got through the Senate. Well, Minister Reith, that is a very nice statement, but where is the substance? Where is the support for that statement? Where is the proof? This is what we have asked time and time again right through this process: where is the proof?
We then go to Ms Katie Lahey's statement where she drew attention to the New South Wales chamber's own survey conducted jointly with the St George bank. Again, there is no detail of the basis of this survey. Every time we have asked for detail of the basis of any survey, ultimately it ends up being discredited. We move on to the main statement made by Mr Reith in his second reading speech that:
To make it all completely clear for the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate, the Commonwealth government has commissioned . . . a Yellow Pages Small Business Index survey—
to ask several questions. In this speech, the minister cited a couple of the outcomes of that survey and said:
In this survey, 79 per cent of proprietors thought small businesses would be better off if they were exempted from unfair dismissal laws.
That is almost a bit like asking the question: have you stopped beating your wife? I am sure, if we asked small business whether they thought they would be better off if they could pay under-award wages, they would be pretty happy too.
—Or no tax.
—Or no tax—that is a very good point—no payroll tax. They would like that situation. The only problem we have with this survey—and it is a pretty fundamental one—is that we have asked the government, through the estimates process: if his survey is good, then please, can we have a look at the questions that were asked? During the estimates process, questions were put on notice asking precisely those questions. Even though the deadline for questions on notice is past, we still have not seen those answers. So the minister is relying upon this survey. And I cannot say I am surprised, given past experience, that he will not fess up to the basis of that survey be 
 cause, as soon as he does, it will be completely discredited.
So here we are in the Senate dealing with this legislation, and the questions we have asked in estimates pertaining to issues very relevant—in fact, referred to in the minister's second reading speech—are not coming forward to the Senate. I hope, when we finally get those questions, we will not be in the situation where we can say, `We think we have been misled in this process because that information has been withheld.' I hope we do not get to that point, but the basics of the situation are this. The minister has referred to this survey in his second reading speech claiming that it should help deal with our concerns and, when we ask basic questions, such as, `What were the questions asked in that survey,' that information has not been brought forward. Why is that?
I could be quite cynical and give another example of why that might be the case. In the estimates process, another question was asked—and we did not need to put this one on notice, fortunately. The question was in relation to a press statement made by Minister Reith which said that information that had been brought forward from the Industrial Registrar was good news in relation to the government's intentions with this legislation. It helped to demonstrate its case on the number of small businesses that were affected by unfair dismissal claims.
When we went back to the basis of that survey and asked precisely what question was asked, we found that the question had been asked in such a way as to be self-selecting. It was self-selecting in the sense that the headline of the question was businesses with 15 or fewer employees. Half of the businesses confronted with that question would have said, `That doesn't apply to me. I won't bother answering it.' This is the quality of the research done when Minister Reith wants to sustain the case for his political tool.
On our side, we are still waiting for questions to be answered in relation to the Yellow Pages survey. I do not think anybody in this place would be surprised that we are not convinced about what Minister Reith has said in his second reading speech on further 
 evidence supporting his case because it simply is not there—the evidence does not exist.
The other concern we have with this legislation is the arbitrary nature of only exempting small businesses with 15 or fewer employees. In his second reading speech, Minister Reith said that this size of small businesses was chosen because of the precedent provided by the Employment Protection Act 1982 in New South Wales, which was introduced by the Wran government and followed by the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the 1984 termination, change and redundancy test case.
This was addressed by the committee. It was addressed last time we debated this legislation. We drew on the international comparisons—and I think Sri Lanka was the only country anywhere near this sort of benchmark. In fact, as I said earlier, South Korea looks extremely generous in comparison. I would like to refer back to a point made in the Labor members' report on the committee hearings on that issue. We commented on the examples used for this benchmark of 15 or fewer employees. With respect to the examples used, we said:
The Wran Labor government's employment protection act and the commission's decision on the right to redundancy pay can be clearly distinguished from the present case. In both those instances, new employment rights were being introduced for the first time. The decision was made not to extend them at that time to employees of small businesses (as it has transpired on most occasions, the commission has revisited the redundancy decision. On an industry basis, it has removed the arbitrary exclusion). In contrast, the present case involves an attempt to remove existing rights by reference to an arbitrary measure.
This legislation is about a mean attempt to remove the existing rights of employees working in small businesses. The week before last, the standing that the Australian government currently has internationally in relation to the Workplace Relations Act was highlighted. Add this one as well and you make us look like an absolute international basket case.
—Did you say a banana republic?
—No, I said a basket case. Obviously, senators on the 
 other side are very sensitive to that suggestion—and they should be. Anybody who has any understanding of the nature of exemptions and the application of international law knows that exemptions are things that you are meant to move away from over time, not reintroduce. We have no history of introducing exemptions of this nature—none at all. But again, that characterises the current government and its approach to a fair go all round. I do not remember a rider on the promise of a fair go all round that said `except if you happen to work for a business which has 15 or fewer employees'. I do not remember the Prime Minister making that point.
—It was Neville Wran, not the Prime Minister.
—I was talking about the misrepresentations in Minister Reith's second reading speech. Members of the government have continued the misrepresentation of what is really involved here.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—The misrepresentation has been that it is fine to introduce this exemption because other rights exist—people have access to other mechanisms.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—Order! Senator Campbell, Senator Collins has the call. You will cease interjecting.
—I am hoping that Senator Campbell will make a contribution in this debate. I was quite pleased when I saw on the speakers list that Senator Alston is actually going to make a contribution. I dearly hope that that will be the case, as my recollection is that on the last occasion he avoided doing so. Given that this piece of legislation has such significance to the government and its political agenda, I invite Senator Campbell to speak to the legislation when it is his turn—and, in fact, I look forward to it.
Moving back to the point about the misrepresentations that have been made, particularly in the debate in the other place, 
 those misrepresentations were that it is okay to remove employees' rights in relation to unfair dismissal because they still have access to rights in relation to unlawful termination. Unfortunately, that supposed protection is a myth. It is a myth because of the sorts of examples that Mr McMullan raised in his speech in the other place. Let me give one example of that in this place. I liked this example most particularly.
The example was: if you are a pregnant woman and you work for a business with 15 or fewer employees, you are fine because, if you were terminated, that would be discrimination and you would have access to unlawful termination. However, if you were the boss of that pregnant woman and you refused to sack her, you have no protection if you were sacked and that was unfair or unreasonable behaviour because you are the sucker who works for a business with 15 or fewer employees. That example is just absolutely ludicrous, but true and real. Senator Campbell's boss has no idea of the number of those sorts of cases that really do occur.
—Those 50,000 people would like jobs except for you people.
—Senator Campbell interjects that, if we can sack people under those circumstances, we can create 50,000 jobs. So it is okay to introduce injustice because it is going to create 50,000 jobs that the government cannot even demonstrate will be created.
—You kept unemployment at the highest levels in Australia's postwar history.
—There is no demonstration, apart from the bold claim by Mr Bastian—
—World record unemployment your party. Highest levels of unemployment in history for over 13 years.
—There is no demonstration that more jobs will be created. Absolutely no demonstration.
—Order! Senator Campbell, you will cease interjecting please.
—Absolutely no demonstration and absolutely no evidence. I wonder why Senator Campbell is so sensitive on this issue. Has he had a bad morning this morning? What is the reason for his ridiculous behaviour?
—I would like to see unemployment reduced in Australia. You want to keep unemployment higher.
—Senator Campbell, I look forward to you making a contribution in this debate and actually demonstrating it.
—Order! Senator Collins, address your remarks through the chair please.
—I apologise for that, Mr Acting Deputy President. Through you I say I look forward to the government actually demonstrating that case. As you are aware, we have been pursuing for, good heavens, it must be around 18 months now the case that Senator Campbell sits there and claims exists, but the government has not been able to demonstrate it. The case is not demonstrated in Mr Reith's second reading speech. It is a just a bold claim represented by Mr Rob Bastian. That is the case. That is the extent of the case. There is no case. This legislation represents a mean and politically cynical double dissolution trigger. That is what it is about.
—Stick up for your union mates!
—Senator Campbell interjects that I should stick up for my union mates. The point I will make in conclusion on this debate is, yes, that is exactly what I am doing.
—Declare your interest.
—I am doing it because, yes, I do have an interest. I have an interest in representing more than 200,000 retail employees. Most of them work for small businesses and most of them rely desperately on their rights to secure employment. Ironically, these unions actually represent a vast number of non-union members in their entitlements in relation to unfair dismiss 
 al. In fact, they probably represent more non-union members than union members. We are concerned about those rights being removed as well, Senator Campbell.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-03-25,"—When the Howard Liberal-National party government was elected in March of 1996 it declared in respect of federal termination laws that it intended to ensure the provision of a fair go all around. In my contribution to this debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  I intend to deal with the issue of whether the legislation we have before us presents a fair go all around for every Australian worker. Before I do that there are two other issues I want to raise in the context of this legislation.
The legislation provides that a small business employer who employs fewer than 15 employees as defined in the bill will be exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. In fact, it represents an attempt to exclude employees who are unfairly dismissed from an employer who employs more than 15 employees because, when you include casual employees in the definition of 15 employees in the act, you exclude casuals who have been regularly employed for fewer than 12 months.
There are many employers in this country with a substantial proportion of their work force who are casual employees who have worked for fewer than 12 months. Certainly in the hospitality industry, which I have some working knowledge of, there would be many employers employing 20, 30 or 40 employees who, because of the definition of `a casual' within this bill, would be excluded for the purposes of unfair dismissal.
A second very important practical issue that I want to raise is in respect of employers who are covered by federal awards and are also covered by state awards. Of course, the legislation that we have before us will apply in respect of federal legislation; it will not apply in respect of state legislation. There are many workplaces in that situation. We will have an absurd position where some employees in a small business are covered by a federal award cannot seek redress in the event of an unfair dismissal and some employees at the same business covered by a state award 
 can seek redress in the event of an unfair dismissal. That would be an absolute absurdity. I submit to the Senate that that will be a relatively frequent occurrence.
This bill will establish two sets of employees in this country. If you work for an employer who employs more than 15 employees, as defined, you have a basic set of rights. If you believe that your termination was harsh, unfair or unjust, you have the ability to lay your case before an independent tribunal to determine whether in fact you have been harshly, unfairly or unjustly dealt with. But it will create a second class of employees. Those who work for small businesses, as defined, will have no fundamental right, no matter how harshly they have been dealt with by an employer, to have the facts of their case examined by a tribunal to determine whether they have been harshly, or unfairly or unjustly dealt with.
This creates two sets of principles in law. It protects employees, or gives them the capacity to be protected, if they work for an employer who employs more than 15 employees, but it removes any effective protection if you are dismissed from the services of an employer who is a small business employer. You have no right in law to have your case considered at all. This is quite an extraordinary approach to human rights as we know them in Australia. I submit that it does not fit the government's definition—certainly not Mr Howard's or Mr Reith's definition—of a fair go all round.
It is not as though the matter of unfair dismissals has not been considered by the Senate before. In May 1996, the then minister Mr Reith put before the parliament a new set of industrial relations legislation. That was ultimately passed and enacted into law on 31 December 1996. There was major debate in the Senate chamber about that legislation. Significant changes were made with respect to unfair dismissals at that time. Without going into all the details of the significant changes, the definition of fairness was changed. Before awarding a remedy, if any, to an employee, account had to be taken of the ongoing interests of all the parties. There was a rebalancing of the statutory test to 
 ensure that procedural fairness is only one factor when determining whether a dismissal is unfair.
Secondly, there were separate streams for handling unfair and unlawful dismissals. The power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to award costs against employees was dramatically increased and was coupled with a compulsory conciliation stage. A $50 filing fee was introduced. The new act, while retaining the expression `harsh, unjust or unreasonable' in relation to unfair dismissals, went on to confine the operation of federal statute to a narrower field.
When this act was passed at the end of 1996, Mr Reith was triumphant about the changes that were to apply with respect to unfair dismissal. He said at that time that this was a magnificent example. I am not quoting him, but he was triumphant in hallooing the great negotiating skills and the great processes he had gone through to reform Australia's industrial relations laws. I suspect that it also had something to do with the fact that he wants to be a future Prime Minister—we hope, Leader of the Opposition—of this country that he engaged in such dramatic grandstanding at the time. But here we are, a year on, re-examining the very laws that Mr Reith was so triumphant about just over one year ago.
During this debate, at various times not only Mr Reith but also Senator Alston—who is handling this matter in the Senate—accused Labor senators of having a vested interest because a number of us happen to have been former union officials before we entered politics.
—Very touchy, aren't you?
—I am not touchy about it. In fact, I am proud of it Senator O'Chee. I am proud of the occupation I had before I entered this parliament. Labor does not make a habit of belittling the former occupations of members of the parliament. Frankly, I think it is largely irrelevant. I do not choose to draw to the attention of this chamber that there are many members of the Liberal-National Party who are farmers and belittle them because they were farmers and belittle their contribution on primary industry, for example. 
 I think that they bring a level of expertise and knowledge that is worth while having in the contribution to debates in this chamber. So I do not belittle the former occupations of senators in this chamber.
I say again for the record that I am proud to have been a trade union official. Many of my colleagues in this place are former trade union officials—for example, Senator Collins, Senator Conroy and Senator Cook. We are proud of our background and the contribution that we have made with respect to representing workers in this country in our former occupations. It is in this context that I will read to the Senate a list of wrongful dismissal cases that I handled when I was a former trade union official. It is only a summary of a small number of cases that I handled over a number of years which involved wrongful dismissal.
The cases included: the dismissal of an employee for eating a sweet from a burst packet of sweets—it was spillage, and she was dismissed for theft; the termination of the employment of an employee of long standing because the employer wanted to employ a family friend; the dismissal of an employee whilst on sick leave for quite a serious illness that had been certified by a doctor; the dismissal of a number of regular, longstanding casual employees working as room attendants, some for eight or nine years, with no reason given; the dismissal of a bottle shop attendant, with no reason given—in fact, what was incredible about this case is that the bottle shop attendant read about his termination in the newspaper when he saw his position advertised in the jobs vacant section before he was dismissed; the termination of an employee because she would not have sex with the manager; the dismissal of a club bar steward because a new committee of management was elected and the new president did not like the bar steward so he decided to sack him; the dismissal of a green keeper because he was too old at 58, despite the fact that there were never any complaints made about his work and he was never counselled, guided or warned.
What do these eight or nine cases that I have personally been involved in have in 
 common? They were all cases that involved a small employer where there were less than 15 employees as defined by this bill. I do not think there would be a senator in this place, including in the government, who would believe that the circumstances of the terminations in the cases I have just referred to were reasonable. Certainly, I do not think there would be a senator who would argue that, given the circumstances of these cases, these employees should have been prevented from having the facts of their case determined by an independent tribunal. In the cases that I have outlined briefly to the Senate, all of these employees were re-employed, because it was found that their termination was harsh, unjust and unreasonable. The fact is that these types of cases could not be considered by a tribunal if the bill that we are considering is passed into law.
As I said earlier, I speak with great pride about my background and about my involvement in defending workers who by any judgment have been treated harshly, unfairly and unjustly. For the vast majority of workers in this country it is very important that there are some fundamental protections in law in regard to their employment, their wages and conditions, and the way they are dealt with at the workplace. It is important, because that is all they have. They are totally dependent as employees on their employment.
It seems to me that if we are to uphold the dignity of labour in this country all employees are entitled to a fair go all round. If they believe they have been harshly, unfairly and unjustly dealt with, they do have a fundamental human right to be heard in front of a tribunal and for that tribunal to determine whether, given the facts of the case, they should be reinstated, or perhaps some compensation paid.
What type of society is it that Australia is evolving into if we endorse the principle that a person, because they work for a small business, can be sacked, dismissed, with no reason given? If they can be dismissed because the employer wants to employ someone else—a friend or relative—if they can be dismissed because they refuse to have sex with the employer, if they can be dismissed 
 because they are too old, if they can be dismissed because they eat a sweet on the job and that is allegedly theft, what type of society is it that will say that those former employees have no fundamental right to put their case before a tribunal?
I sympathise with the circumstances of small business. There is certainly no-one in the Labor Party who does not sympathise with the difficulties that small business faces. Many small businesses are struggling. It is argued that small business is struggling and the assertion is—and it is an assertion; it is not provable—that in order to encourage employment small businesses should be exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. But this is just an excuse for the failure of this Liberal-National Party government to address many of the fundamental problems that small business faces. Fundamentally, small business is struggling in many sectors not because of the unfair dismissal laws but because they lack consumer demand, they lack customers coming through their shop or buying their goods and services.
—The best retail sales figures in a decade.
—Well, come to Tasmania, Senator Campbell. The reason employers employ people in their business is that they have demand for their goods and services.
Ultimately, if this law is passed at a federal level and it flows into the state jurisdictions—which, I am sure, this government will be anxious to pursue—we will have 2.8 million workers who will have no right at all, no matter how unfair and unjust their dismissal is, to put the facts of the case before an independent tribunal. I submit that this approach is not in the interests of small business.
I know that the vast majority of small businesses are responsible employers. They do the right thing. They treat their employees fairly and reasonably. But, regrettably, there is a very small number of businesses that do not treat their employees fairly when it comes to termination of employment. Is it reasonable to say to the vast majority of small businesses who do treat their employees fairly and 
 reasonably when it comes to termination that the small minority of small businesses who do not behave responsibly should be excluded from the adjudication of a tribunal which should determine whether or not the employees have been treated unfairly or not?
As I said earlier, I am proud of having been a trade union official and I am proud of some of the cases that I have defended and the results I achieved. I am proud of the Australian Labor Party for taking a position in opposition to this legislation. It seems to me that this law will strip 2.8 million workers of a fundamental human right, that is, to be allowed to appeal if they believe they have been harshly dealt with and to be allowed to lay the facts of that appeal before an independent tribunal to determine whether they should be reinstated or whether some compensation should be paid. That is a fundamental right of labour in this country and it should not be taken away. It is about time this government, the Liberal-National Party government, stopped using this sort of issue as an excuse for its failure to assist small business in this country.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-25,"—I have not heard anything since the defeat of this legislation in the Senate on the last occasion to convince me to in any way change the vote that I cast on that occasion. I have listened carefully to what has been said this morning by Senator Hogg, Senator Collins and Senator Sherry and to the speeches yesterday. Having listened to all those speeches, one must, if one is reasonable, say not only that nothing in those speeches would convince one to change one's vote the other way but also that it confirms one's decision to vote against this legislation.
The legislation is simply unfair, unreasonable and unjust. I am quite conscious of the ramifications of the Senate voting this down for the second time after the constitutional period has elapsed, nevertheless, I do not believe that the Senate should vote for a measure which can justifiably be described as unfair, unjust and unreasonable, so I will be voting against the legislation.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-25,"—Senator Harradine has just described this bill as unfair, unreasonable and unjust, and he is correct. I start my contribution to the debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  by quoting a significant figure in Australian politics. This person, in a speech to the South Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 25 October 1995, said:
I'm not going to leave employees exposed to unfair dismissal by capricious employers.
The same figure, in a speech to a community breakfast in Perth on 11 July 1995, said:
We're not going to replace (Labor's unfair dismissal laws) with a law that gives ruthless employers carte blanche.
In a speech on 18 July 1995, the same figure said:
Let me make a hard and fast commitment that when we win government we will ensure that Australia has a balanced unfair dismissal provision which is fair to both employers and employees. We won't tolerate unreasonable dismissals.
Who is this figure? This figure is the Prime Minister. Why is this bill before us, given those commitments on the public record by the leader of the government? Because the Prime Minister is weak and the Prime Minister is lacking in leadership and authority.
This bill is a stunt. The Prime Minister is allowing a stunt to override commitments he made to the electorate before the election and commitments he made after he became Prime Minister. Why do we have that? It was not a core promise. We remember that, whenever the Prime Minister is in trouble, he defines his way out of trouble. He defines whether it was a non-core promise or a core promise. He did not tell the electors before the election that there are such things as core and non-core. But, since the election, to suit his own needs, he has defined things as core and non-core. The poor fool voters did not recognise that, when he made those commitments that he is now expected to honour, they were not core promises and he never intended to do so. This is not only gutless, this is not only a lack of moral authority; this is, of course, dishonest.
I want to go to the three major reasons this bill is before us. At one level, it is proposed that it will make it easier to sack people and that, because it does, it will therefore somehow improve employment. If it is easier to sack people, apparently more jobs can be created. The government are campaigning around Australia saying, `Look how many jobs we've created.' If they make it easier to sack people and then rotate the unemployed through those jobs, they do not create an extra number of new jobs. They report the number of new starts that were achieved in the economy and say, `Look how many new jobs we've created,' as if they have done something to improve unemployment. Have they? Of course they have not. They have just revolved the unemployed through some jobs, taking advantage of being able to peremptorily dismiss people without them having a reasonable recourse to appeal and a reasonable recourse to their circumstances being fairly reviewed.
What else has the government done? Very importantly, they have changed the bargaining relationship between a worker and an employer. Remember that Mr Howard, before the last election, also promised that there would be no reduction in working standards. He made a solemn promise on that.
By enacting this legislation, the government makes it impossible for a person in a small business negotiating a wage with their employer in a one-on-one situation to win because, if that employer does not like the claim, he can dismiss the individual and there is no effective recourse to an independent appeal. Is that fair bargaining?
How does a junior worker get on in those circumstances? What about a migrant woman? What about an ordinary Australian male? How do they get on in those circumstances when they are asked to choose between accepting the offer that they have to take or losing their job, and they have a family to support? How do they get on in those circumstances? Is this what we now call job creation? Is this what we now call dealing with unemployment?
The first proposition that this will make it easier to sack people and, therefore, will 
 improve employment is a false proposition and an arid claim. Indeed, my colleagues who have spoken in this debate who have pointed to the government argument that there will be 50,000 new jobs created because of this provision have demonstrated amply that there is no basis in statistics, there is no basis in objective collection of facts, to justify that. The 50,000 new jobs that will allegedly be created is an assertion. It is not underpinned by any statistical work whatsoever. It is a claim, yet it is bandied around as a fact when, in fact, there is no support for it at all. So let us just deal with that first proposition.
The second false claim here is that it will help small business. The government must have a very low opinion of many employers in small business. I happen to know a lot of small business people who are proud to be good employers. I do not make the automatic assumption that everyone in business wants to exploit their employees. We do not hear about the examples of good employers; we hear about the examples of bad ones. But there are many people in Australia—and I want to go to this in some detail in a moment—who are proud to have good employees, impose trust in them, make sure they are properly trained, encourage observance of occupational health and safety standards and pay them a decent wage and are repaid by loyalty, productivity and the growth of their own enterprises. They know that the best asset their company has is the people who work for it.
If you downgrade and humiliate those people, you will get a downgraded, low outcome result. The bottom line is your profit will fall. If you encourage, train, protect the health and safety and pay a decent wage, you will get committed employees, proud of their work, satisfied in their job, who contribute to the growth of that company. There are many employers in this nation who know that and do not want this legislation where the lowest common denominator prevails. They know that, if this is carried, they are in the hands of the narrow-minded, exploitative employers.
For example, you have a good employer on the block and a bad employer on the block competing with each other. One wants to pay decent wages, respect their workers and 
 encourage higher productivity and one wants to exploit them. If this law comes into being, the second employer wins. Because, therefore, wages fall and the cost of his goods fall, the first employer has to follow suit and reduce his work force as well. You have a race to the bottom.
Is that the country we want for Australia? Is that what a modern society is about? Are they the high living standards that we always talk about, that we aim to achieve—that is, where fear and exploitation rule the workplace, not a fair go, not decency, not an aspiration for higher skills, better quality output and a committed work force? I do not hold the view that the government holds that exploitation should rule. I hold the view that many employers hold that we should have a committed work force. This legislation does not do that.
The third thing about this legislation which has been said by all of my colleagues in this debate, and rightly, is that this is an outrageous political stunt. It is an outrageous political stunt because this is an attempt to procure a double dissolution, or, as I heard a breathless journalist say the other day, a double disillusion. One could be disillusioned by this government, but they are after a double dissolution.
So they put an outrageous piece of legislation to the Senate knowing that Senator Harradine, who holds one of the key votes in this chamber—a balance of power vote—is committed to not supporting it. They want his vote on Wik. They know that he cannot in all conscience, in coming to terms with what he understands as decency in the workplace, vote for this. They know he describes it, as he did a minute ago, as unfair, unreasonable and unjust. They know that. So they confront the Senate in order to artificially contrive a constitutional trigger so they can have an early election.
—A race election.
—And a race election, as Senator Faulkner points out, quite rightly. So this is a stunt. This is a contrivance. This is a manipulation of the democratic process in order to achieve that.
I want to say a few words on behalf of the good employers in Australia on what they aspire to, together with the good workers of this nation, and what they want to see. What does small business really want? Small business really wants as its first priority a stronger economy with stronger growth rates. If the economy is strong and growing, unemployment is falling, there are more wage earners than there are unemployed. People have the purchasing power to buy the goods and services produced by small business. There is greater opportunity with growth. That is what they want to see.
What is the performance of this government? The national accounts for the March quarter came out just three weeks ago. The markets were anticipating a growth rate for the Australian economy of four per cent for the year or four plus. Many of them looked on the bright side and thought it should be four plus. I punted in the privacy of my own office that it would be around four per cent.
What did the national accounts show? They showed that the growth rate for the year was 3.6 per cent. They surprised the markets. The exchange rate fell on those figures and the stock exchange went down on those figures because they expected something higher. In other words, this government not only underperformed in terms of growth in the economy on its own estimates, but it surprised the market with how poorly it did as well. The true picture is an economy which came out of a recession—it was not a technical recession, but a low growth period imposed by cuts by the government in the 1996-97 budget which reduced domestic demand—and grew and people thought, `Here is the stronger recovery.' Now that it has wilted, now that it has died in the traces, what we are seeing is much lower growth, and the impact of the Asian currency meltdown has not yet hit the Australian economy either.
Today we have reports that the Australian economy's growth will be cut by one per cent because of the low demand in Asia for our goods and services. If that is one per cent off the 3.6 per cent, we will have a 2.6 per cent growth rate in the Australian economy. If that is what they are talking about, it will mean 
 higher unemployment, a contracting demand, bankruptcies for small business and many more people out of work. Small business wants a growth economy. They do not want to see that economic performance.
What else does small business want? I will tell you one of the things they do not want. They do not want a GST. Small business does not want to have to be turned into a tax collector for this government. Small business does not want to have to levy a 15 per cent—or whatever the figure is—goods and services tax on every transaction they make.
The Australian economy, if you look at it, is about a 73 per cent service economy. About 78 per cent of the Australian work force are employed in the services sector. There is no tax on services, so what the government are going to do is introduce a 15 per cent tax on services. That is not there now and they say that, by making it easier to sack people in small business, somehow we will get employment growth.
What about a 15 per cent tax on goods and services? That will take money out of the pockets of small businesses. That will be an increase in taxes. They do not want it, but the government are going to introduce it and they have announced confidently that this is so-called tax reform. Well, I urge the government to go back to their dictionaries and look at the meaning of `reform'. `Reform' means positive change. A 15 per cent goods and services tax or a goods and services tax at whatever level is not positive change; it is regressive.
What else do small business want? They want protection from harsh and unconscionable conduct. They want to make sure that the big end of town cannot manipulate the contracts with the small and more vulnerable businesses to diminish their rights and exploit them. That is what they want. Has this government introduced legislation to meet that need? No, it has not. Will it? It says it will, but does it go far enough? No, it does not either. 
The greatest growth area for litigation in Australia at the moment is that litigation that goes on between franchisors and franchisees. Most of the franchisees are small businesses. 
 It is a classic case. Someone holds the central franchise and asks people to bid for it. They strike terms in a contract, then the franchisee can go out and trade under that franchise name. The fastest growth area in the Australian economy, particularly for small business, is from the blossoming of franchisees everywhere. People owe their future to the company store but they find that, whenever there is trouble, under the terms of their contracts, often that trouble is exacted on to them at the bottom of the pile—not on head office, but on the franchisees. That results in litigation, and it is the fastest growing area of commercial court work in Australia and it is growing uncontrolled. It is a big cost, a big surcharge, to impose the high price legal costs on small businesses that way and it ought to be sorted out.
Senator O'Chee interjecting—
—Kim Beazley has tried to sort it out. He has introduced a private member's bill and we have introduced one here. The government has not moved. Small business is in pain over this and the government's bleating is an indication of its embarrassment on the issue as well.
What else does small business want? Let me tell you. Small business wants a restoration of the incentives for growth that applied under the Labor government and which were cut in the 1996 budget by this government. They want to see—and particularly now with the Asian currency meltdown—a restoration of export market development grant assistance for small business. Because the Asian economic crisis is destroying their markets, they need to be back in Asia to help protect and renegotiate their contracts. They need to be in third markets to develop opportunities for themselves.
What is the government's response? The government's response in 1996-97 was to cut those incentives so they could not do it. With the present crisis when they need to do it, has the government's response been to restore those incentives to help them achieve it? No. There has been some playing around with the definitions and there has been some alteration of the red tape but, effectively, there has been no real improvement for small business. That 
 is what they want. They do not want this particular law.
I want to conclude in the few minutes available to me with another thing that I think small business wants as well. They want to know how to succeed. Most small business people I know want to become medium sized business people as quickly as possible and many of them want to become big business people. They want to be able to grow. This government cut the Australian Manufacturing Council, which for small manufacturers was a major source of guidance and advice on what you have to do to become a more effective company. I recall one of the surveys—the leaders and laggers survey—by the Australian Manufacturing Council. It took a snapshot of what a leader, a successful small business, looks like and what were the ingredients that had added to its success for Australia, and it took a snapshot of what a lagger, an unsuccessful small business, looks like and what were the ingredients of its failure.
This survey is very instructive. The ingredients of success were good industrial relations, high investment and trading, protection for occupational health and safety, and harmonious workplace relations. They have a committed work force. None of those were problems. There problems were getting into new markets, finding opportunities for their goods. The ingredients of the laggers were bad industrial relations, no commitment to training, high staff turnover, and blame shifting—`everyone else is at fault, not me'.
In short, leaders, successful companies, are outward looking and have formed their work force into a team, not into confrontation but into cooperation. Laggers are those who want this legislation and they are the failures. This legislation speaks to those companies that want to blame others because they do not succeed. They want to blame their workers because they could not lead an effective workplace team to grow their profits. This legislation should fail with them.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-25,"—I join my colleagues in opposing this legislation. The opposition has already put on the public record its clear posi 
 tion on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  in both this chamber and the House of Representatives. What we are debating here is the government's broken promise on unfair dismissal and an attack on the security of working Australians and their families.
We are also debating, as my colleague Senator Cook has pointed out, the government's election agenda, an agenda for a politically motivated and socially divisive double dissolution election particularly focused on the issue of race. At the moment unfair dismissal legislation provides for the right of all employees to have access to appeal mechanisms against unfair, harsh or unreasonable dismissal. If passed, this legislation will take away that right for thousands and thousands of Australian workers.
—Three million.
—Thank you, Senator Mackay. Millions and millions of Australian workers—three million Australian workers, workers who are employed by an operation that has 15 or fewer employees. We just ask the question: why should workers in that situation have fewer rights than those workers who work for larger organisations? That is the nub of it, and not one speaker from the government has been able to defend that position.
I would like to remind the Senate of the outstanding minority report that has been prepared by opposition senators on this legislation. I read that report with a very great deal of interest. They said that the legislation was very seriously flawed. They also pointed out that opposition to the measures in this bill could be grouped into effectively three major arguments. It is worth repeating them. Firstly, this exemption is an explicit breach of the government's pre-election commitments. Secondly, this exemption is totally unnecessary. Thirdly, this exemption is unfair. We stand behind those arguments.
But I think we ought to also acknowledge that this legislation amends the Howard government's own unfair dismissal laws, the government's own much touted, much vaunted Workplace Relations Act. It extensively amended the unfair dismissal laws, which 
 came into effect in January of last year. Who could forget the debates that took place in this chamber around those issues, so ably led by Senator Sherry and so many other opposition senators who participated in the debate at that time?
The Prime Minister and his Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, boast that their new system of unfair dismissal laws provide for `a simpler, more balanced system that provides a fair go all round'. There is nothing fair about this exemption. It is an exemption that discriminates against employees who work for a small business employer with fewer than 15 employees. If Mr Howard and Mr Reith believe that their own unfair dismissal laws are so simple and balanced to provide a fair go all round, why do they have to seek this exemption for small business?
We have heard the justification, the naive insistence, that this will boost employment by removing apparent disincentives for small business to hire new staff. But, as Senator Cook pointed out, there is absolutely no tangible evidence to support that assertion—none at all. This does not have any justification beyond what is the government's ideological obsession, which we have highlighted over the two years since this government came to office, to dismantle the rights of Australian workers.
It is worth recalling the recent Morgan and Banks job survey that revealed that 80 per cent of small business employers did not believe that the existence of the unfair dismissal laws affected their decisions to employ staff. Only 16 per cent of small business employers believed they would benefit from the exemption that this legislation provides. I have to say that those figures were also consistent for all other sizes of business.
We have heard about the claim that this government is committed to reducing the burden of red tape on small business.
—GST.
—Exactly. What about the government's assistance for small business? What is its commitment to reducing the burden of red tape? John Howard is 
 absolutely kidding himself if he thinks that this legislation will solve the problems and relieve the burdens of small business. And just around the corner lies in wait a goods and services tax for small business! We do not know what corner it is around, and we do not quite know when we will get around the corner to see what the government has in mind because they are keeping it under wraps. But we know what that will mean for each and every small business in Australia.
I think the government would perhaps be a little better served paying heed to a recent Yellow Pages Small Business Index showing that just five per cent of small businesses are concerned about industrial laws. But that same survey showed that 84 per cent of small business are far more concerned about this government's lack of action in getting the economy moving.
The point has to be made in this debate that this bill is yet another betrayal of the electorate by the government. This is yet another betrayal by the coalition of the Australian people. They have, of course, had a very good record, I think we would all have to acknowledge, of breaking the promises they made to the Australian people in the last election. I think we would all have to acknowledge their record in that regard.
—Non-core promises.
—That is true. The other thing I think we would have to acknowledge is the capacity of this government to redefine political terminology and to redefine issues of public policy. If you break a promise, it becomes a non-core promise. The Prime Minister has been absolutely expert in the last couple of days in redefining his own discredited code of ministerial conduct. He has done a good job of redefinition. With those broken promises, the government really has revealed to the Australian people its true colours, and it has done so on many issues of importance to the Australian people.
This is a government that wooed voters with its weasel words about its commitment to delivering to families. This is the same government that talked about protecting the poor and needy in our community. It is the same government, I recall, that guaranteed 
 that no worker would be worse off under a John Howard industrial relations regime. Who could forget that promise?
Mr Howard and Mr Reith promised to give workers a right of appeal if they were unfairly dismissed. What they did not do is qualify it. They promised to give workers a right of appeal if they were unfairly dismissed, but they did not say, `If you work for a small business, that promise does not count.' That was never said by anyone at any time. They did not say, `If you work for a small business, you do not have a right of appeal.' That was never said by this duplicitous government. What John Howard did say in the good old days when he was Leader of the Opposition was:
I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hardworking employee.
That is what he said. He then went on to one of his headland speeches. Who could forget those headland speeches? He said:
Let me make a hard and fast commitment that when we win government we will ensure that Australia has a balanced unfair dismissal provision which is fair to both employers and employees. We won't tolerate unreasonable dismissals.
On 20 February 1996, the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, said that the redrafted system of unfair dismissals would not contain any exemptions. I remind the Senate that he also said, on 28 February, `Look,'—you have always got to worry when he starts his sentences with `Look,' and `our position is very clear'. We have always got to focus, when Mr Reith says, `Look, our position is very clear.' But that is how he started his contribution on 28 February. He said:
Look, our position is very clear. If you have been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal.
Nowhere did either of them—Mr Howard or Mr Reith—say to anyone, `There is a major qualifier here. You can have all that, unless your employer employs less than 15 people.' That was never said by either of them, or anyone else from the government, at any time. It is just another example of broken commitment and broken word to Australian workers.
The measures that are proposed by this legislation go to the very core of the lives of all working Australians and their families. There is a very strong link between a worker's role in the workforce and the quality of life that is enjoyed by a worker's family and children. John Howard promised to provide security and certainty to families. Yet this is legislation that does an enormous amount to dismantle the security of employment that Australian workers hope to enjoy. Of course, security of employment—something that the government does not seem to understand—is fundamental to the security that workers have as a family.
We say, look, this is not something that John Howard ought to be messing with. And we say it is an absolute disgrace that he has asked this parliament to do so. This parliament has made a decision about this legislation. It was the right decision. The Senate has expressed its view to the government and properly rejected the legislation. You have got to ask yourself—why are we revisiting it? Why has it come back to the Senate? Because the government does want this ideologically-conceived bill to be a double dissolution trigger.
We say that this legislation is also about the government's election agenda. This is just part of the government pursuing a desire to have a double dissolution election focused on the Wik issue, focused on race. This legislation, along, perhaps, with the Public Service bills, helps to provide a smokescreen for that race election agenda by providing perhaps one or two other triggers for the election. As with the native title legislation and the Public Service bills, the government is not interested in negotiation, it is not interested in compromise; what it wants is confrontation, what it wants is a double dissolution.
Let me say very clearly on behalf of the opposition, we do not want an election on this bill. We do not want it. We do not even want to mask the government's race election agenda. But we are left with absolutely no choice. We are implacably opposed to the measures contained within this bill. We do not and we cannot support legislation which allows people to be sacked, even if that 
 dismissal is harsh, unreasonable and unjust. We cannot support legislation which takes away the right of appeal and the right to job security and certainty.
Our position on this matter remains unchanged. We will go right to the wire on this legislation. And I urge the Senate to stand by the view it has earlier expressed on this legislation and reject this unconscionable bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-03-25,"—I want to speak on Cheryl Kernot's law. Clearly it is something that she regarded as a triumph, and that is why she supported it in the first instance.
But I want to make some preliminary remarks. I am sure none of us in this chamber will forget Greg Louganis—not only was he a gold medallist but he also inspired the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to actually boast about triple backflips with pike. The Labor Party in government had a notorious record for reneging on solemn commitments whenever it suited their political purposes.
We do not have to simply refer to the occasion on which Greg Louganis was invoked, we have to remember not just the solemn promises, but the legislation actually passed through this parliament which misled millions of Australian voters into thinking they were going to get additional tax cuts, because they were l-a-w, law—ripped up as soon as Labor got back into power. We had all the promises on Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, about not selling down any further or not selling at all. As soon as they won the next election, they immediately ripped up those promises. So I would have to concede that Labor has an outstanding track record on reneging whenever it suits their political purposes.
During the life of this government, Labor has also done some amazing backflips. One only has to remember the work for the dole legislation and, indeed, the charter of budget honesty. We had Senator Faulkner fulminating about the evils of work for the dole. He thundered and he postured and he jumped up and down and he wanted to move a whole raft of amendments because these were such odious and unacceptable provisions. But, of 
 course, what did they do? They rolled over. They were arguably much more significant pieces of legislation than this current piece, important though this is.
Why is it that Labor will not roll over on this bill? Why are they prepared to go to the wire and face the prospect of a double dissolution on it? Quite simply because they have a massive and irreconcilable conflict of interest, because this chamber on that side is a wholly owned subsidiary of the trade union movement. They have said, `No, you are not allowed under any circumstances to support this legislation.' About two-thirds of those on the other side, including Senator Mackay, have very strong trade union backgrounds and have come here out of the sheltered workshop because they could never get a job in the real world.
I should remind the chamber that Senator Lundy is a classic example. She recently addressed a seminar in this building and solemnly explained that she did not understand the procedures of the parliament because, after all, she came from a private sector background. It really took my breath away to think that dyed-in-the-wool trade unionists now regard themselves as private sector individuals. But of course they are not.
—She does come to divisions though, Richard, which can't be said of all members of the chamber.
—She does come to divisions. I will give her that. Certainly, I trust that those who miss them have very good reasons for not attending and that, when they are in that situation, they explain. The fact is that there are very many on the other side who simply have no choice. In fact, I think the last 10 who have come into this chamber as Labor senators, including Senator Quirke, have very solid trade union backgrounds.
—So what! What's wrong with that?
—So what? What flows from that is that you have the biggest long-playing record in history. Of course the owner of that record is the trade union movement—His Master's Voice. They tell you what to do. 
 They tell you whether they support legislation. They tell you whether they do not. Kim Beazley's office has been known to say that they cannot get back to us yet because they have not had a reply from the ACTU.
The reason Labor will not roll over on this is that they are not allowed to do so because the trade union movement sees this as one of their last opportunities to somehow pretend that they have derived advantages for the workers, that they have been able to generate a little more by way of damages in common law suits and statutory claims, and that this is somehow a justification for trade union membership. We all know that people are deserting the movement in droves, but it is alive and well in this chamber. Here we have another trade union rep coming in for the debate.
—And pleased to be one.
—It could have been anyone. I am not being personal. Anyone who could have walked in from that side would have been a trade union member. You have a two out of three chance. There is nothing surprising about you not rolling over on this one.
—Are you still a member of the law society, Richard?
—No, I never have been. Actually, I might have been in 1966 for one year before I became a barrister. They do not have law societies for barristers.
—You joined the barristers' union then, did you?
—I did. I also belonged to the BLF, if it is of any interest to you. I am certainly not in any shape or form anti-union.
—Did you declare that?
—Yes, I did. It won me the preselection. When I said I had been a member of the BLF, my people were absolutely astounded and said, `Well, you'd have a good understanding of the way the system works,' and I do.
—No, you don't.
—I certainly understand the power of the union movement which tells you people how high to jump.
—Why are you trying to take advantage of it?
—I paid my dues. You are still paying yours. You have your preselections. You have a lifetime commitment to repay, and I understand that.
I would like to thank all honourable senators who have contributed to this debate. The debate is all about jobs and about letting small business get on with business. Small businesses want and need an exemption from the federal unfair dismissal provisions not so they can dismiss unfairly but to relieve them from the threat of unfair dismissal proceedings.
—Your bill's provisions.
—No. They simply want to be able to get on with it and act fairly. They do not need your crowd looking over their shoulders. They simply want to get on with being productive. We acknowledge that more needs to be done in this area and this bill will improve outcomes and help deter undeserving applications. Employers are still fearful of incurring very expensive and time consuming arbitrary outcomes which can impel them to a commercial settlement regardless of the merits of the case. A time-honoured tactic—you simply threaten long, drawn-out proceedings with the vast power of the union movement behind you—`Our pockets are limitless. You're a small employer. Pay up or else.'
What those opposite fail to understand is that businesses take into consideration issues such as the dismissal of employees and how they might have to manage unsatisfactory workers when they decide whether to engage new staff. Probationary periods will not solve that problem because the employee might slacken off once the probationary period is up. I was very interested to hear Senator Faulkner quote a recent Yellow Pages small business survey—if this isn't the ultimate in selective quotation! He said that five per cent of small businesses were concerned about 
 industrial laws. What he did not tell you was in that presumably same survey in November 1997 covering 1,200 small businesses—
—That's the one you paid for, Richard.
—Well why is he quoting it? He obviously thinks it has legitimacy if he quoted it. In that survey, 79 per cent of proprietors thought that small businesses would be better off if exempted from unfair dismissal laws. Thirty-three per cent said they would have been more likely to recruit new employees had there been an exemption in 1996-97.
We have unlimited funding coming from the trade union movement. Literally millions of dollars being money-laundered from a Labor government through the system and washed back in, in terms of contributions to the election campaign. An absolute scandal. You are shameless about it. It does not trouble you in the slightest because that is where your bread and butter is.
We understand that, but you ought to at least declare it when you vote on this bill. You ought to stand up on the other side of the chamber and state whether or not you have an interest in the outcome of this legislation. Let there be no doubt that this bill is about jobs and that those opposite from the trade union movement have no idea about the issues confronting Australian small businesses. This bill will remove a major disincentive to small business growth, and that is why this bill should be supported.
	 Question put:
	 That this bill be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-03-25,"—I want to make a few comments on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2]  which is currently before us. It has been a fairly topical issue in Australia in the last four or five years, and probably derives from similar discussions and concerns in a number of Western European countries 
 and particularly in the United States over recent years.
It derives from concerns that developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s which arose primarily from decisions made in the United States in the early years of the Reagan government which legislated for massive tax cuts, with continued outlays growing at significant rates. That resulted, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, in huge budget deficits in that country. It was suggested that, in due course, the budget deficits that arose, and which were forecast to go on if the then budget prescriptions had continued, would imperil the welfare, health and social security systems of that country.
One of the results that emerged from discussions in the United States in the early 1990s was the balanced budget bill, which was passed by both houses of the US Congress. That bill required the Congress to legislate for balanced budgets by the end of this decade. They have achieved that, not particularly as a result of that balanced budget bill, but because of growth in the US economy.
Australia has picked up on a variation of that debate and it is apparent in the title of this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. A number of issues arise from the presentation of the bill to the parliament which are worthy of discussion. I seek to place the views of the Australian Labor Party firmly on the public record. The issues of concern to us are, firstly, the lack of commitment to the real intent of this bill by the current government; secondly, the government's performance to date in relation to the spirit of the legislation behind the bill; thirdly, transparency; and, fourthly, compliance and interpretation when the bill becomes law.
From the outset, I would like to place on record my support for the bill which has at its core the intent to ensure that there is transparent honesty in fiscal reporting by governments in this country. Such transparency is essential through all stages of the electoral cycle, and the spirit of the bill, as its title suggests, attempts to address this outcome. Unfortu 
 nately, the spirit of the bill has not seen justice in the drafting by the government.
That brings me to my first point: the lack of commitment by this government to the real intent of the bill. That intent, as the government has suggested for many years now, is integrity. There has been much discussion by coalition members of both chambers on the virtues of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. It has been heralded by the Prime Minister, Treasurer and government backbenchers as one of the great savers and enforcers of fiscal rectitude in the history of federation.
Government members have talked ad nauseam about the importance of such a bill and the impact it will have on governments in the future. From the outset, I must say that I understand the need of this government to sing such high praise for this initiative. It is almost as though, if they keep talking about the charter of budget honesty long enough, the electorate may forget the blatant dishonesty that has characterised the budgets of this government to date. Unfortunately for the government, however, neither the community nor the Labor Party will forget the budget dishonesty exercised by this government.
However, the opposition also believes that this bill presented to us by the government does little more than make nice noises about honesty, rather than drafting legislation that would actually play a role in enforcing some standards of decency and honesty in budget reporting. The problems with this bill are paralleled by the hypocrisy of the government. When this government was in opposition it made a commitment to budget honesty, while making a range of other promises.
Those promises included: to maintain funding levels for the ABC; to make no changes to the operational subsidy of the community based long day care sector; not to introduce health policies which would entail funding cuts to public hospitals; to maintain expenditure on labour market programs; to maintain all concessions for older Australians; to continue support for research and development; to maintain regional development funding of over $150 million over four years; to give a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue to the states and territories; not to 
 increase taxes or to introduce new taxes; and to maintain funding levels for Australian universities.
What has happened to the promises made by the coalition, remembering that they were part of the package that promised the charter of budget honesty? I am sad to report that all of the above-mentioned promises have been broken in one form or another. The ABC has had its budget cut by $209 million over four years. Operational subsidies for community based long day care were abolished, costing families in the order of an extra $14 per week. The health budget was severely cut, with widespread reductions in public hospital funding, totalling approximately $800 million.
Labour market programs were cut by $1.8 billion over four years. Concessions for the elderly were cut, with the most notable being the dental care scheme. Research and development concessions were reduced and syndication was abolished. The regional development program was abolished. Fiscal grants to the states and territories were cut by $1.5 billion over three years, and specific purpose grants were cut by three per cent per annum. New taxes have been introduced on superannuation, and the Medicare levy has increased for those without private health insurance. Operating grants for universities have been reduced by over $600 million over the four-year period.
The government's response to the intent and spirit of the legislation is not the only issue. One of the fundamental problems with this bill and with the government's attitude is the lack of transparency. The Howard government provides significantly less information in its budget papers than the previous Labor governments. In the 1996 budget papers, the government excluded information detailing specific purpose grants to the states and territories, thus denying the states information necessary for the preparation of their budgets over time. After pressure from the opposition, the government agreed to publish those figures in the 1997 budget papers.
Additionally, the government removed from the budget papers international comparisons that were common under previous Labor budget regimes. These international compari 
 sons play an important role in the comparative analysis of the Australian economy. By excluding these comparisons, the government was trying to avoid that detailed comparative analysis.
Finally, in respect of budget paper presentation, is the treatment of asset sales. The Labor Party was constantly accused by the coalition of fiddling the budget papers through asset sales. This was untrue as the Labor government always disclosed underlying as well as headline results. The coalition in government, though, has included asset sales, including property sales, only in its underlying budget bottom line, even though it attacked Labor for a similar practice.
With the coalition's broken promises in mind and its hesitancy in ensuring transparency of budget papers, claims of budget honesty appear not to ring overly true with this government. To justify these broken promises, the coalition introduced the classification of core and non-core promises. It would appear that this classification of core and non-core promises overrides the necessity for budget honesty as far as this government is concerned.
The introduction of the non-core promises fiasco and the blatant disregard for pre-election promises by the government highlight another key problem with the bill before the chamber—that is, transparency and compliance. If the government is serious about the need for budget honesty, then it ought to consider a range of options that would improve the process and make budget forecasting more transparent.
Firstly, the government should allow full scrutiny of the bill. Appropriately, this would require the legislation to be examined by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. Such an examination is recommended by the committee for all fiscal reporting mechanisms. This is an idea opposed by the government in the House of Representatives, but imposed upon it by the Senate. However, the time allowed for such examination was very restrictive. The chair of the joint committee himself made this point, `Even without committee examination, there are a number of apparent problems.'
Accountability is a significant issue. It has been widely recognised that this bill provides less accountability than that recommended by the National Commission of Audit, the government established body. The primary recommendation of the commission was that economic forecasts concerning pre-election reports, the budget and the mid-year economic review should be the responsibility of, and at the discretion of, economic bureaucrats instead of the Treasurer.
The government has rejected this recommendation of its own commission and has decided instead to allow bureaucratic discretion for only pre-election forecasts. New Zealand, which is a country that this government likes to model itself on in terms of economic reform, requires bureaucratic certification of economic forecasts at all stages. It is apparently okay for that country but not for the government of this country to adopt.
I would now like to turn to some comments regarding the fourth area of significant concern, which is compliance. Essentially, the government has drafted legislation that does little to ensure compliance. The bill is really a set of motherhood statements. The government has failed to draft legislation that ensures—or, indeed, even encourages—any degree of budget honesty. Why has the government failed to address this issue of compliance? Because at the end of the day it is not serious about the charter of budget honesty. The government has no intention of enforcing standards of decency and compliance. With its record we can see why it has avoided this compliance issue. This is the key problem with the bill. It is meaningless without compliance provisions.
I return to the comments made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. The financial committee stated:
. . . the Committee does not see a need to formulate binding statutory principles of fiscal responsibility. In any case, such fiscal principles would be so imprecise and so wide open to interpretation that there seems little point prescribing them in legislation. 
The Committee is also wary of the idea that there are enduring fiscal principles. 

Of course, the committee is referring to the type of motherhood statements espoused by this government. For example, part 3 of the bill talks about managing financial risks prudently, achieving a reasonable degree of stability and predicability in the level of tax burden, and achieving adequate national savings. All of these points are worthy of support. The problem, however, is that all of them can be interpreted differently by varying governments. With the problem of interpretation we are brought back to the issue of compliance. On what basis is compliance enforced and what is the impact of no enforcement?
If we need an example of compliance problems, we need look no further than the performance of this current government. Principle (d) of the bill requires the government to maintain the integrity of the taxation system. Yet the first test of their commitment to the integrity of the tax system has resulted in failure by this government. I refer to their refusal to cut back on tax avoidance, particularly in the area of family trusts. The first chance this Treasurer got to show his commitment to the charter, he broke one of the fundamental principles and, as we know, there is nothing that can be done about it because there are no compliance provisions.
In the House of Representatives question time on 11 March the Treasurer was asked to comment on the opposition's view that the charter is unenforceable. Mr Costello responded:
It is a completely binding law of the country. Once it is enacted it binds our government, Mr Beazley or any future government to come clean to the Australian people.
However, section 3(2) of the bill states:
Nothing in the Charter of Budget Honesty creates rights or duties that are enforceable in judicial or other proceedings.
When the Labor Party proposed to delete this section from the bill, the government used its numbers and opposed such a measure.
This is not the only failure of the government in regard to this charter, however. As I have already mentioned, the legislation espouses the commitment to achieving adequate national savings. We have been told time and 
 time again by this government that fundamental to its budget strategy is the need to boost national savings. Yet when it comes to scrutiny of this commitment, as is the role of parliament, the government refuses to provide savings projections. The same issue arises when it comes to unemployment. The Treasurer continues to refuse to provide employment forecasts from the mid-term review beyond the immediate year. Clearly, the government has no commitment to transparency in budget preparation.
The final significant problem with this piece of legislation is the government's lack of understanding of the real role of government. This matter shows itself to us in the principles of sound fiscal management. These principles, as drafted by the government, illustrate a commitment to government and budget formulation that is not appropriate. These principles are an accountant's view of the way in which government should be managed. There is no commitment within these principles to the role of government as policy maker. There is no real thought given to the government's role in solving problems such as unemployment, education and health care. In this regard, the document is an accounting tool and little else.
The notion of a charter of budget honesty is one worthy of support. The spirit of the legislation is clear. However, the weaknesses in the legislation are also blatantly apparent. One can immediately recognise the spirit of the legislation and directly ignore that spirit, as this government has done, as there are no consequences for such action. If the government were sincere about a charter of budget honesty, they would accept a detailed review and examination of this legislation by the joint committee. They would take advice in a bipartisan manner to ensure that transparency in fiscal policy and management were unquestionable.
Instead, they have presented this chamber with a piece of legislation that is highly cynical, largely ineffectual and potentially irrelevant. They have dishonoured their election promise through the shallowness of this bill. However, as I have said, the notion of budget honesty is indeed worthy of sup 
 port. We should all aim for greater transparency within government and, importantly, through the parliament. For this reason, the Labor Party is supporting the bill, even with the acknowledgment of its many flaws. The best outcome for decision making transparency would be for this to be recognised as the first step towards honest fiscal reporting.",SENATE,<title>CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-25,"—As the Senate knows, the Democrats were strong supporters of the introduction of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill and did indeed commend the government for introducing it, but believed that it was a weak bill in a number of respects and needed reinforcement and strengthening. We still feel that way.
By insisting on the amendments last time, we believe the Senate showed our disapproval of a government that will not accept improved legislation—amendments which, in our opinion, considerably improved the bill. However, we have been advised by Labor that they are going to let this bill through this time, so there is obviously no point in further pursuing amendments to the bill. Despite the fact that it seems we will have at least one double dissolution bill whatever happens—and one more will not make any difference—in my view it would be foolish to put to a double dissolution a bill we support in terms of the fundamentals. Even in its unamended form, this is a bill better passed before the election than after, since it does contribute to a better policy costing and appraisal for elections.
The thrust of our amendments the first time around was that we focused on the fact that the act was unenforceable; it was not binding on the Crown. I pricked up my ears when Senator Bishop said Labor had been pursuing that same issue. I checked the amendments in the last debate—in October, I think it was—and it was in fact the Democrats who moved to make the bill enforceable. Labor quite correctly supported it, and subsequently moved that same amendment, I believe in the House of Representatives, when it came through the second time, and felt very strongly about it. I think Labor coined a rather nice phrase for it when they referred to it as the optional honesty bill.
If there is anything which is a great sadness to the Australian Democrats, it is that the government should allow a bill which stands on accountability, which has honesty in its title, really not to enforce that dictum. Clause 3(2) of the bill states that the charter of budget honesty is not judicially enforceable and the charter is therefore much like a code of conduct which does not have any enforcement procedures or penalties, a situation which clearly is unsatisfactory. There is no penalty should a party fail to fulfil its pre-election reports and costings or its commitments. The only sanction currently available for when a government ignores the need to comply with the provisions of the charter of budget honesty does rest with the parliament, and that is an unsatisfactory situation given that the government of the day will have a majority in the parliament.
As Senator Bishop outlined, in contrast, the New Zealand Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994 is binding on the Crown. This means that if the New Zealand government does not comply with the requirements in the act, any citizen has standing to initiate an action in the courts. What we and Labor and the other non-government parties in the Senate felt strongly was that this government should be obliged to face up to its responsibilities with an enforceable act. In our view, such enforceability would demonstrate a serious rather than an optional commitment to the provision of information and the accountability of the government to the electorate. We were disappointed not to see it in the legislation before us. The remedy of enforcement where there is a failure to act is denied Australian citizens, in contrast to New Zealand citizens in their act, and it effectively provides a shield of immunity to any claim on public interest grounds preventing the disclosure of information. This limits the effectiveness of the charter as a mechanism to improve scrutiny, transparency and fiscal responsibility.
So, Minister, on the one hand, this bill is proclaimed to be an important contribution to the government's accountability efforts and we agree with that claim. On the other hand, the government cannot be held accountable to the provisions in this legislation, and we 
 strongly disagree with that. I was so startled by the very concept that there could be a bill which could be valid when it did not provide for enforceable rights or duties that I put a Senate question on notice to the Minister representing the Treasurer on 30 October 1997. I asked:
(1) Is the Minister aware of any Act which has been passed by the Federal Parliament which does not provide for any enforceable rights or duties; if so, which Acts are they.
This was the answer; listen carefully:
There are a number of Commonwealth Acts which impose duties on a statutory body, but provide that such duties are not enforceable in judicial proceedings. Some examples are:
. the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986;
. the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986;
. the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991;
. the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983
I surmise from that answer that there are no acts relevant to the operation of government, as opposed to a statutory body, which are not enforceable. So this is a first-time, appalling precedent, one which we do not agree with.
The Australian Government Solicitor's Office advised in an answer to that same question as follows:
The fact that the Bill is not enforceable in judicial or other proceedings does not affect its validity.
I am not a High Court judge and I am certainly not a Solicitor-General so I am not going to quarrel with that, but it does not do away with the principle. The Treasurer, with his wonderful ability to spin lines, can never get over the fact that this is an optional honesty bill, that this bill is not enforceable. We commend the Treasurer for the bill, but it is an optional honesty bill.
Other amendments we focused on the first time around included the fact that the act provided for costings only for the Liberal and Labor parties. I am often surprised in this parliament when the word `bipartisan' is used. I would have thought that they could at least use `tripartisan', because the National Party are part of the major scene. As for the rest of the cross-benchers, we prefer `multipartisan' or `cross-party'. The fact is that even the National Party are excluded from the costings 
 of this bill. That struck us as extraordinary. We tried to fix it up for them, but they as the junior partner were not able to help themselves on this issue. Anyway, it is another amendment that went through which the government refuses to accept.
We also focused on the fact that in appraising the effects of taxes and spending proposals, the social effects on future generations were insufficiently covered and the principles of ecologically sustainable development were not covered. In a country where, in the last 15 or 16 years, salinity has increased something like 18 times and is forecast to reach 12 million hectares, I would think that a focus on ecologically sustainable development makes very sound economic environmental and social sense.
We also focused on the costing of election commitments and various matters to do with that. We focused on an issue which we have been running hard on for nearly 20 years now in a number of parliaments in the country, and that is truth in political advertising—to try to get some honesty in that area. And we focused on the nature of modelling processes used in economic and social forecasting. However, the government in its wisdom is not going to accept any of those solutions.
 If we are not going to push through those amendments this time, let us focus on why this bill is necessary. In the 1982 budget, an election budget, the then Treasurer, Mr Howard, forecast a surplus of $230 million which blew out to a deficit of $4,473 million. The post-election revelation of the budget deterioration allowed the new Labor government then to junk virtually all their election promises. It sounds familiar, doesn't it? Since then, that practice has become pretty much a recurring picture.
Again, in 1992, Labor's then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, produced his infamous One Nation forecast which claimed that the deficit would repair itself. On the back of this, he and Dr Hewson went into the 1993 election campaign with what we regarded as outlandish and unfunded tax cut promises. The Democrats said at the time that the tax cuts were not funded and were not fiscally responsible, but the coalition joined with 
 Labor to vote in the $4 billion of tax cuts which they both knew were not funded. Three years later, the coalition were busy gloating over the Beazley black hole, but if they had voted with the Democrats to stop an unfunded $4 billion in tax cuts, there would not have been a Beazley black hole, just a minor Beazley blemish.
Over the last four years, fiscal reporting continued to be a very political process. The 1995 budget included the claimed headline surplus of $718 million. The real picture was an underlying deficit of $7.2 billion. Again, the coalition joined with Labor to defeat the Democrats' proposal to set up a Senate inquiry into the matter. It suited the coalition at that time, in our view, to rely on Labor's ridiculously rosy economic forecasts which Labor was using to build up unaffordable election promises of $7 billion. So with the change of government, again, the new government were able to junk most of their election promises, their so-called non-core promises, after a shock-horror revelation about the black hole which our parliamentary records showed they helped create. 
If this charter of budget honesty bill is in fact going to stop that kind of malarky between the two parties contending for power in this country, I think—and my party thinks—it is to be very warmly welcomed. The Democrats congratulate the government on recognising this as a problem, on recognising that there is a public perception problem out there, on recognising that a much improved budget presentation process, a much improved and transparent process, will advance the cause of more accountable and better government.
In concluding, Minister, whilst I say that we are disappointed that the bill remains weak and optional we are nevertheless delighted that the bill will move into legislation, because it does at least advance the cause of accountability in a number of important directions. I move:
At the end of the motion, add "", but the Senate:
(a)	 calls on the Government, at the earliest opportunity and preferably before the next or the following Federal election, to follow the lead set by New Zealand's Fiscal Responsibility Act and replace the optional and weak nature of the unenforceable Charter of 
 Budget Honesty with a Charter that binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth and creates rights and duties that are enforceable in judicial or other proceedings; and
(b)	 is of the view that access to the bureaucracy to provide costings of policies should be extended to the nominated representative of any party which is registered under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918  or which has at least one representative in the Parliament; and
(c)	 urges the Government to include consideration of the social and environmental effects of its policies on future generations, as well as the financial effects, in its principles of sound fiscal management and in intergenerational reports.",SENATE,<title>CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-25,"—The key issues for the Greens (WA) in relation to this boomerang bill, the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2], are the government's commitment or lack thereof to the democratic process and the inherent dishonesty of a bill which basically claims to be a bill about honesty; a bill which gives a narrow and misleading account of fiscal policy which does not include social or environmental accounts.
The government's commitment to the democratic process is, we believe, highly questionable. The government seems to have no respect for the Senate as an institution or the legitimate role in the democratic process that the Senate plays. In that sense, it is tending to echo the last few years of the Keating government: contempt for the democratic process. We are moving, I believe, more and more to three-year elected dictatorships, judging from the kinds of statements that have been made in relation to the Constitutional Convention.
But let us get back to the process in relation to the charter of budget honesty—or dishonesty, depending on which side you take. The first point I want to make is that the government has returned this bill to the Senate without considering the range of amendments put forward. I did not agree with all the amendments, but that was the Senate's decision in relation to those 10 amendments which were passed.
A double dissolution is only intended for a situation where a hostile Senate fails to pass bills that render the government unable to govern. It is custom to provide the Governor-General with advice as to whether the parliament has become unworkable. It would, in the opinion of the Greens (WA), be preposterous to argue that this is the case with the charter of budget honesty. These are the reasons we believe so. The bill is not justiciable or enforceable in any manner, thus failure to pass the bill cannot affect the ability of the government to govern.
The legislation is unnecessary to achieve its immediate purpose. What is to be achieved under the bill can be achieved administratively through existing executive discretions for the life of the present parliament. Regulations are not required to allow the government to provide the electorate with the sort of information that the bill seeks to guarantee. How can anybody say that the passing of amendments to this bill would make Australia ungovernable?
The second point I want to make is in relation to a point I made in my speech during the second reading stage when we previously debated this matter: whether or not under the trade descriptions act there might be a problem with the naming of this bill. We believe the bill promotes a narrow and misleading account of fiscal policy. This is, in fact, a charter of budget dishonesty, as it does not give the full picture. Rather, it gives a narrow view of what the national accounts are and a narrow view of what the economy consists of and the implications for the economy in the future.
Budgets are not about economics in the restricted sense; they are about public policy and people. These days, this mostly seems to be forgotten. All decisions on revenue tax and spending are about politics and how to make and direct choices. The use of fiscal accountability implies that fiscal benchmarks are the most important or, perhaps, the only relevant criteria for judging policy. This implies certain values. It pre-empts discussion and forces conclusions in certain directions. It fails to take into account, for example, environmental and social accounts, indexes on 
 equity, employment, greenhouse gas production and so on, and fails to give a complete picture of what is happening in the wider economy. This is in contrast to the momentum established internationally against such narrow economic accountability. There has been much talk overseas about widening the accounts basis by integrating environmental and economic accounting and social impacts. Australia is going in the wrong direction.
I find the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill a problem, as it suggests that the government presents budget information honestly. In other words, it suggests that the information presented to the Australian public concerning what is important now and in the future is honest whereas, in reality, they are presenting only one side of the picture and a very narrow view of life, valued in monetary terms, in the present.
The reductionist nature of this bill is, of course, problematic to us. It has the potential to be used as part of the growing view towards fiscal restraint which is used as an excuse to further reduce revenue from those who cannot afford it and to devalue legitimate concerns in the community.
The views of the Greens (WA) have been made very clear in this respect. We believe that many people—and Senator Murray has expressed the views of the Democrats—see this bill as weak. I see it as less than weak; I see it as going in the wrong direction, according to the principles of ecological and social sustainability.
My views on the bill have not changed, but the way the government has dealt with this bill and the way the Senate has responded to this bill are, in my view, despicable.",SENATE,<title>CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-03-25,"—I rise to speak ever so briefly to support the government's charter of budget honesty. But, having listened to the three speakers before me—Senators Bishop, Murray and Margetts—I am at a loss to understand Senator Murray's point that the National Party are losers in this. It is quite the opposite. The National Party, like my coalition colleagues, support the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2]  wholeheartedly for the reasons 
 outlined in the government's second reading speech.
Senator Bishop should be aware that his Labor opposition are, in fact, supporting this bill. We know they have done a somersault on this matter. They fear that this bill will become a double dissolution trigger. Just as they fear that the bill we have just dealt with, the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2], will become a trigger for a double dissolution, so do they fear this bill; that is, the determination of the government to pass this legislation. The opposition have done a backflip.
Although Senator Bishop spoke against this bill throughout his speech and went off on all sorts of strange tangents about the methods that the government used to balance the budget—for which it should get credit—he is going to vote for this bill. So work that out.
No-one is really quite sure what Senator Margetts is on about, but we do know she has her own pet projects. If you do not come to hand for her pet projects, she finishes her speech—as she just did—and dashes out of the Senate saying, `This is despicable.'
The truth of the matter is that this is a most important piece of legislation where major structural reforms will be brought to the parliament in presenting fiscal responsibility and policy. We all know how we got to this point. It is because of the legacy this government was left by the previous government. It was not just a $10.5 billion deficit.
—It was $10.3 billion, I think.
—It was between $10.2 billion and $10.5 billion.
—Better get it right, Senator.
—We know it grew from the first estimation, which was $8 billion. The deficit grew to $10.3 billion—I will accept your figure, Senator Quirke.
—It's growing like Pinocchio's nose now, Senator.
—It was definitely $10.3 billion, and we have reined it in. Straight after the election, we found out the 
 dishonesty and the cover-up that occurred. The previous government went into the election campaign claiming that there was in fact a balanced budget. Not only that, the legacy of the debt that was left, I believe, is worse and harder to overcome than the deficit itself. The debt figure left for this government was well over $100 billion. To put that in perspective, ironically, when Mr Keating was first elected as Prime Minister, the Commonwealth debt was $30 billion—quite manageable. But, within four years of the Keating prime ministership, it blew out to $100 billion plus. That is a harder figure to pull back, Senator Quirke, than the $10.3 billion deficit, which we have done.
We are now working on that major debt left to this government. We are doing it through asset sales particularly. This government's asset sales will be dedicated to reducing the Commonwealth debt. We believe that the two-thirds sale of Telstra will bring in some $40 billion, which will go towards reducing the Commonwealth debt to under the $50 billion mark. That is a responsible attitude towards privatising our national assets or our national carriers like Telstra.
It is not just the Telstra sale that we will be dedicating to the reduction of this government's debt. The airport sales of over $4 billion must go towards reducing the heavy debt burden that this government was left. There are the sales of AN rail and ANL, Australia's shipping line. Commonwealth offices and property to the tune of billions of dollars will also be put on the market. There will be other such asset sales like Dasfleet. They will all responsibly go towards the reduction of Commonwealth debt.
The point is that, when the opposition was in government, it chose to privatise in the most tortured way possible. For example, Qantas was on the budget four times to be sold and dishonestly used to reduce the government deficit of the day, yet it was not sold until the fourth occasion. Also, in relation to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, those opposite went to the people in a dishonest fashion and said that they would not privatise it, and they did—unlike us. They got a very good price for it too. The Australian 
 taxpayers got their first taste of shareholding a former government asset, like they did with Telstra.
What did you do with those funds? You did not use it to reduce debt at all. You frittered it away on the current expenditure. It was completely frittered away. Where did the billions of dollars received from the sale of the Commonwealth Bank go? It was completely wasted on the budget because we still ended up with a $10.3 billion deficit.
The point of the legislation before us today, the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, is that that sort of dishonesty can no longer occur. We are locking you in now, should you ever have the opportunity to return to government—and perhaps in the decades to come that will be possible; the wheel always turns in politics, as we know. We are now locking a future Labor government and ourselves into responsible, transparent fiscal reporting. No longer can we set up budget surpluses for you to come in and fritter away on the taxpayers. We will come back into government, as a result of the slow turning of the wheel of politics, and have to rein in the expenditure again.
Now it is going to be open for judgment by financial reporters and by the taxpayers. The books will be open to show exactly the government's financial situation. The underlying budget deficit or surplus can no longer be hidden from public scrutiny, as it was during the Hawke and Keating years. You never really reported correctly what your budget deficit was. You tried to constantly cover it up through asset sales. There is now going to be a separation of asset sales and proceeds from the underlying budget figure.
In order to reach that situation of accurate government reporting, the charter of budget honesty will establish a framework within which formal reports will be made. Along with the release of each year's budget, a report will be required that states the government's economic and fiscal projection for both the budget year concerned and three years ahead. These projections will indicate the expected consequences of the proposed fiscal system. Midway through each financial year, another report will update the process of 
 the fiscal and economic projections that were set out in the budget. Within three months of the conclusion of the financial year, a report will be issued detailing the fiscal outcomes of that year. Further, every five years, a report will be made outlining the long-term sustainability of the current fiscal policies.
This bill ensures that the secretaries to both Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration prepare a pre-election report providing an up-to-the-minute assessment of the government's fiscal policy. What could be more transparent? What greater scrutiny could be put on a government—and which we are putting on ourselves—than that form of reporting to the parliament and to the people?
There will also be a provision for more equal access to Treasury and Finance costings of election commitments. That should make for a very interesting exercise in the upcoming election, because we heard from Senator Kemp yesterday during question time that the shadow minister for health, Mr Lee, has already committed the opposition to a $6 billion health budget, while at the same time the former finance minister and current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has committed the opposition to a balanced budget. This is the man who left us with a $10.3 billion budget deficit, but now he has changed on the road to Damascus and he is going to produce three years of balanced budgets if he ever gets the opportunity.
The pull on that is that Mr Ferguson, in the other House, does not believe in surplus budgets. He and his left wing  colleagues will be coming to Mr Beazley saying, `We don't believe in balanced budgets.' So you can see the pull and the tug from the Labor Party but, under this legislation, they will be committed to costing their election commitments under the scrutiny of Treasury and Finance. So will our side, but we can deliver because we have delivered a balanced budget already and we are reducing the burden of the government debt.
—It has gone up.
—No, it has not.
—Total Australian debt has gone up in the last year.
—Order! Senator McGauran, do not be distracted by interjections.
—Senator Sherry does distract me and, Mr Acting Deputy President, I take your advice that I should not be distracted by him. Finance and economics are not Senator Sherry's great strengths. Sure, I saw him stand up before and talk about industrial relations, on which he has some expertise, but haven't they all over there? Haven't they all got a self-interest in industrial relations? They can all wax lyrical when it comes to industrial relations and protection of their old union mates but, when it comes to finance, let us face it, on any sort of scrutiny or any sort of poll, the Labor Party are not known to be very good finance managers.
Let us go back to the Whitlam years. What a financial mess the country was left in after the Whitlam years. What a  financial mess. When you got your second shot at it, what a financial mess the country was left in after—
—What did John Howard leave when he went out of government as Treasurer? What was the debt then? Twenty odd billion dollars—in today's money, $20 odd billion.
—Senator Sherry, you are prone to exaggeration; it was not $20 odd billion. That is how much you know, and I refuse to be further distracted by you.
In conclusion, I would just like to say that this is a very significant piece of legislation. I know quite often that the finance bills that come through this parliament are not met with great interest—in particular, by the press gallery—but this legislation is going to fundamentally change the financial reporting of governments and the responsibility that governments have. It is in fact quite a revolutionary reform, along with, need I say it, the other revolutionary reforms that have come out of the Finance and Treasury departments. So I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-25,"—Before I start on my 
 formal remarks on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2] , I want to reply to one of the points raised by the previous speaker, Senator McGauran. He said that this is a revolutionary bill and that it will ensure honest reporting. Of course, it is nothing of the sort and I suggest Senator McGauran consult the bill to see where the accuracy of my comment is and where the error of his might be.
There is nothing compulsory about this bill. If this bill becomes law, there will not be a charter of budget honesty that any party in Australia need comply with. It is not enforceable. No court in Australia will enforce it. We moved in this place to put in a provision that the charter of budget honesty be enforceable, and what you are proposing to do by what you are doing now is to remove that provision. You removed it in the House when the bill went back. The bill has now come back here and you want to take that provision out.
So let us deal with this cant, this hypocrisy, that this bill will in fact do anything. This is an optional charter of budget honesty. There is nothing compulsory about this. If we wanted to enforce this legislation on the government, should it become law, no court in the land will be able to adjudicate on it because the government does not want them to do so and they are using their numbers to crush that possibility. So let us just get them little apples out there in the clear. This is optional. This is not real. This is a stunt. If it were not a stunt, you would make it compulsory. What have you got to hide? Why won't you do that? You prefer the stunt of course.
Can I just say this: we are very disappointed that the government has taken the view it has. This bill was brought to this chamber some months back. This chamber, which is not a chamber dominated by the Labor Party, constructively amended this bill. We put through 10 amendments. The bill went back to the House and the government refused all of them. When I say this is not a chamber dominated by the Labor Party, I mean that the balance of power here is held by Senator Harradine, the Greens and the Democrats. All of us agreed that these changes would improve the bill. The government does not want 
 to accept any of those changes. Who is being intransigent here? Isn't there a middle ground? Couldn't some of them have merit at least? Wouldn't it be a useful thing, for example, to make this compulsory, to give it a standing in law so that it could be enforced? What does it mean if it cannot be enforced? A sham is what it means. But, no, none of those proposals that this Senate put are acceptable and the government is confronting the Senate and accusing the Senate of causing obstruction if the bill is not carried.
The second great lie about this legislation is that the Labor Party does not support it. We have supported this legislation in the House and we have supported it here. What we have tried to do, however, is improve it and make it workable—change it from a stunt to something of substance. That is what we have tried to do. Of course the government does not want to hear any of that. It is my intention at the conclusion of my remarks to move an amendment to the second reading, which has been circulated in the chamber.
—Senator Cook, you will be foreshadowing an amendment because we already have an amendment moved by Senator Murray.
—If that is the right form, then I foreshadow an amendment. I have seen Senator Murray's amendment, by the way, and I will support that. The Labor Party will support the Australian Democrats on their amendment and I do anticipate they will support us on ours. However, I want to go to the detail of the amendment I intend to move because it does put this whole debate into context.
The first part of it is that the charter of budget honesty should be legally binding on governments and not be optional. I have dealt with that in my lead off remarks. This is a sham. This is a fraud. The title `charter of budget honesty' can note something good is happening but if it is not enforceable then you can drive a coach and four through it and it does not matter. This is in the realm of core and non-core promises. We heard from the Prime Minister after the election that he made two types of promises. Only one type would 
 be kept—they were core promises. The non-core promises would not be kept. But he never differentiated between them at the time of the election, so Australian electors did not know.
This charter of budget honesty sounds cute, addresses some important principles I have to say, but unless it is enforceable then it has no real meaning. The first point of my amendment is to make it enforceable. The second part of my amendment is to include, among the stated principles of what constitutes sound fiscal management, commitments to achieve full employment in Australia. That should be something that a charter of budget honesty should examine, and it should examine the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia and the maintenance or improvement of the real value of wages and conditions and the welfare of workers.
Anyone listening to this debate who is familiar with the legislation governing the Reserve Bank of Australia knows that those principles are enshrined in the legislation of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank, which fixes the interest rate level effectively in Australia, is governed by those values. Why can't we put in this bill those exact same values so that when parties make promises at election time those promises can be costed against the achievement of full employment and the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia and the maintenance or improvement of the real value of wages and conditions and the welfare of workers? Isn't that reasonable? The Reserve Bank must do it. Why can't the political parties be made to measure up by those standards? The government does not want them to. We do. The government does not want that to be in their charter of budget honesty.
The next provision in my amendment seeks to include in the required budget economic and fiscal outlook report an estimate of the net effect of the budget on public saving, private saving and national saving and an independent report by the Commissioner of Taxation and the secretary to Treasury on material threats to the tax base, the size of the fiscal threats and the specific means necessary 
 to counter these threats. Let me take those two ideas together.
The biggest problem this nation has is generating a level of national savings, that is, a pool of money owned by Australians, that can be used to invest in the development of this nation. Australia is a net borrower in the world. We do not finance all of our own development. We borrow from overseas to do so. A prime economic goal ought to be to build up a level of national savings so that we can finance our own development and we are not in hock to foreigners.
One of the biggest advantages of Labor's great reform on superannuation is that it established a massive pool of national savings which will build up over years in order that Australians can own the farm and buy back the farm. That is something on common ground among most economists in Australia. When we ask the political parties to declare their promises, why can't they say what those promises will do about building up a level of national savings, both private savings and public savings, so that Australia can look forward to a time in which it can finance its own development?
The second part of this provision is about tax. This is a major debate in Australia. Threats to the tax base—that is, areas of massive avoidance or evasion of taxes—means that governments increase taxes to compensate for the loss or, if they do not do that, they reduce the services provided by the government to the community, usually important services. We have seen in the last week the stand off between the Prime Minister and the premiers over health. The argument is that the government does not have enough money to provide Australians with a decent health system. The Labor Party will not cop that argument, but that is what the government's argument is.
If the tax base is haemorrhaging because there is massive avoidance, why can't we know about that at election time? Which way is it haemorrhaging? What is the nature of those threats and what can be done about it?
—Family trusts.
—There are two issues of considerable importance immediately. One of them has been mentioned by my colleague Senator Conroy—family trusts. It has been on the news this morning. We know that 19 members of the front bench of the government, 19 ministers, have family trusts, and the purpose of trusts is to minimise the amount of tax you pay. For every dollar a rich person saves on tax a poor person pays it. That is the effect.
—You did nothing on trusts.
—He says that we did nothing. That is absolutely untrue. We introduced a bill into this parliament to deal with the matter. You referred it to a committee. You stonewalled it and then you brought back a pallid version of that bill. What the tax commissioner tells us is that the amount of resort to family trusts is getting to epidemic proportions and there is a real threat to revenue, that the number of family trusts is growing faster than the number of private companies in Australia. And here is a chance for people who have the income, who can consult the tax accountants and smart lawyers, to arrange their affairs so that they get under the tax-free threshold and not pay tax.
Why can't we know about that in your charter of budget honesty, Minister? Why won't you allow that to see the light of day? Let me cite another example of a threat to the revenue—salary repackaging. This is where wealthy people say, `My salary is worth $150,000 a year, but I won't take it as money. Give me a car; put my kids in a private school; give me admission to all these private clubs; give me services in kind which I would like to buy, and reduce the amount of cash in hand I get so that I am down the scale and I pay less tax.' That is, you rearrange it with sharp accountants.
Most wage and salary earners in Australia have their tax taken out of their wages every week, or every fortnight, or every month—whichever is the interval of payment for them. They cannot avoid that. So why should the salary repackaging, where people can avoid tax, be allowed? Why can't we honestly see, in this so-called charter of budget honesty, what the effect to the revenue base is of smart 
 manoeuvres that minimise the tax payable by wealthy people in Australia? Why can't we see that, and why won't your government allow that to be in there? Because what you are proposing is to prevent it from being in there. That is exactly what this bill deals with. I have dealt with those three matters, Mr Acting Deputy President.
Let me go to point (d) of the amendment:
require the Government to improve the transparency of its fiscal reporting by publishing each month a consolidated list of Budget-significant decisions announced in the previous month, quantifying the effect of those decisions over the full forward estimates period
What does this mean? When the budget comes out, the government says, `This is the amount of surplus that there will be in the budget. These are the expenditures that we'll outlay funds against, and that's how it is.' Then, as the year rolls by, they make little extra payments here and little grants there and so forth, which alter the bottom line. So what you hear on budget night is one version of the truth; what you see at the end of the budgetary period is what actually happened, and the difference usually is the amount of change that went on through the year.
But these things do not often go to the macrostructure of the budget. The government will not admit that its expenditure levels are increasing and it will not say what the causes of those increases are. The effects on the macro-outcomes usually are different. We want these rules applied to us; they should be applied to you as well. All we are saying is: when you do something that changes the bottom line on the budget, then declare it, and do so on a monthly basis. No change? Fine. Some change? Well, let's see what it is so that we know what the macroparameters of this budget are. To shift your funds around otherwise is to present a distorted picture to the community and, importantly in this context, to the money markets as well.
Point (e) of the amendment says:
require inter-generational fiscal reporting to occur at least every three years rather than five years;
Intergenerational fiscal reporting is where we borrow in the future against the costs of today. Therefore, we bill our kids for what we 
 are expending today. Intergenerational reporting is about exposing—
—You disgraceful hypocrite. That is  outrageous.
—Order! Senator Campbell, withdraw that remark.
—These guys racked up $100 million worth of debt. How the hell can he come in here and be serious?
—Order! Senator Campbell, resume your seat and withdraw those remarks.
—I withdraw, but the hypocrisy is overwhelming, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—I asked you to withdraw those remarks.
—I withdraw again.
—You can dish it out, but you cannot take it.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—If you want to speak on this bill, Senator, speak on it.
—I am going to interject. I can't stand your hypocrisy.
—No. That is against standing orders and you are in contempt of the chair. So behave yourself, and conduct yourself properly. Try to contain yourself a little, if you would not mind. I know this is uncomfortable for you.
—Order!
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I have described what intergenerational equity is about. In this bill, the government wants to report on it every five years. That is, they can now launch into their next parliamentary term and they will not have to say a word about this for five years. It ought to be something that is reported on every parliamentary term, so that it has to be reported on by the next election, and the election afterwards, and the election after that. If you hide it by saying that it falls between election periods, then you are hiding a full understanding by the Australian community of what 
 the implications of budgetary decisions are. You cannot have a charter of budget honesty which, between election periods, hides issues of intergenerational equity. Despite Senator Ian Campbell's outburst, his extraordinary behaviour, all we are saying is that we are happy to abide by those rules. We want to see those rules enshrined in a charter of budget honesty; why doesn't the government? What are you trying to hide by not allowing that to occur?
—It's ironic that you are saying—
—Order! Senator Campbell, would you resume your seat please. You have been interjecting not from your correct place and I would ask you to resume your seat.
—It is disorderly, Mr Acting Deputy President. I know that is a trial, but most of us put up with it. Point (f) says:
require responsible secretaries—
that is, the heads of the departments—
to jointly publicly release a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report either two years and nine months after the first day of sitting of the House of Representatives following the previous election, or, should writs for an election be issued prior to that date, within five days of the issue of those writs;
We are saying here that, for the Australian public to understand what the implications of a budget are, three months before the scheduled time for an election we ought to have a full accounting. The departments should say what their expenditures are and what the outlook is. The outlook is particularly important so that we can get a clear idea, and so Australian voters have a clear understanding, of what the economic future holds for them by the paid bureaucrats of the departments who are bound to objectively report.
It is very important that this be in the public domain. In an election campaign, it is often said that the first casualty, as in war, is truth because parties exaggerate claims and counter-claims. All we are saying here is: let us get the facts on the table, and let the bureaucrats who have access to that information put it there. Let the Australian people judge that, so that when they hear the argu 
 ments and counter arguments between political parties, they will be able to say, `Well, hang on. This department said that the outlook for Australia, given the Asian currency crisis, is one per cent less growth than we anticipated, therefore more unemployment. We can then judge what the parties are saying to combat that.'
That is a reasonable thing. In any charter of honesty you would do that. But does the government want to do it? No; it does not. It does not want those things to be on the table because it wants to be able to pretend what the circumstances are, not have the umpire say what they are. All we are saying is, `Let the umpire put them down so that the contentions between the major parties can be interpreted by electors on the understanding of what the truth of the situation is.'
Item (g) of my amendment—and I see I have only a minute to go; I have three other subclauses to refer to, but I will not make the cut—
—No, talk about (g); it's the Beazley clause.
—It is to prohibit the Treasurer from interfering in the production of pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report. Let me go to the next one—item (h).
—Tell us about the Beazley clause.
—You can make your own speech. Item (h) refers to the requirement in the bill that the opposition give to the Prime Minister its election promises, and he decides how many are costed and how many are not. If this bill were fair, we would give them straight to the Treasury Department so that the Prime Minister does not intervene. An opposition has to give the Prime Minister its promises, and he then decides what goes ahead for costing and what does not? And you say this is fair? Why can't we just give them straight to the umpire? Why can't the umpire come back and say what the costs are? Why do we have to go through the Prime Minister? My foreshadowed amendment reads as follows:
At the end of the motion, add: 

""but the Senate is of the view that, while the Bill should proceed in its present form, a Charter of Budget Honesty Act genuinely worth the name would:
(a)	 be legally binding on governments and not optional;
(b)	 include, among the stated principles of sound fiscal management, commitments to achieve full employment in Australia, the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia, and the maintenance or improvement of the real value of wages and conditions and the welfare of workers;

(g)	 prohibit the Treasurer from interfering in the production of the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report, except for providing requested information;
(h)	 amend the proposed costings regime during the election caretaker period, to remove the necessity for the Leader of the Opposition to send policies through the Prime Minister when requesting a costing from the responsible secretaries, and to remove the discretion of the Prime Minister to refuse to pass requests for costings from the Leader of the Opposition on to the responsible secretaries; and
(i)	 provide the Leader of the Opposition with access to the responsible secretaries for the 
 purpose of costing policies prior to the caretaker period for a general election"".
(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-25,"—We have been treated to one of the most amazing speeches that I have heard in this chamber.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—It was even worse than Senator Conroy's speech yesterday. Truly, by that measure, that is saying something. Let me make it clear to people who are listening to this debate that you would not believe, from Senator Cook's speech, that he is actually supporting the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2] . Admittedly, the Labor Party had to do a mighty backflip on this issue and, admittedly, they had to change their minds about it. But this bill has come back to the Senate and, despite what people may think, from what the Labor Party people have been saying in this chamber, their leader, Mr Beazley, has indicated that the Labor Party will be supporting it.
The reason they are supporting this bill is that they know that out there in the public there is very strong support for a charter of budget honesty bill, and they understand the reasons why this has been brought in. As Senator Cook is still in the chamber—he is about to leave—I point out to him that one of the reasons is, of course, a result of the behaviour of Senator Cook and his colleagues, who were former ministers in the Keating government. In, I think, November 1995 Senator Cook made one of his many famous quotes in this chamber when he forecast that the budget was in surplus and would continue in surplus. Of course, in less polite society and in a less august chamber there is a word for the type of comment that Senator Cook made, but I will say that what Senator Cook said was untrue, and it was proved to be untrue.
When we were looking through the pious amendments that Senator Cook is seeking to move, my colleague Senator Ian Campbell quite rightly got very upset at the hypocrisy, as he saw it, in all the amendments and particularly in amendment (g), which reads:
(g) prohibit the Treasurer from interfering in the production of the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report, except for providing requested information;
Those who can cast their minds back to the last election will remember Mr Beazley, the current leader of the Labor Party, giving assurances to the public that the budget was in surplus. He was unable to give us the latest figures, but he gave us those assurances. However, two days after the election, on the Monday, the Treasury was able to inform the incoming government of a massive black hole that had been left by the Labor Party. That was the $10.3 billion black hole which the fiscal mismanagement of the Keating-Beazley government had created. That was the genesis of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill.
We said that no government should be allowed to pull the stunt—a disgraceful, dishonest stunt—that was pulled by the Keating-Beazley government prior to the last election, pretending that their budget was in surplus when in fact the budget was in massive deficit. As a consequence, we indicated that there would be a charter of budget honesty bill which would do quite a number of things but, among other things, it would make it very clear what the fiscal position of the country is before an election.
So there has been very wide support for this bill. We welcome the comments by Senator Murray, who has qualifications. We do not agree with him on those qualifications. But Senator Murray of the Democrats indicated in his remarks that he saw this as a very big step forward, and he is dead right in that respect. That is precisely what this is.
As I said, this is a very important bill. It is a bill widely welcomed by the public. It is a bill which was promised by the Howard government in the pre-election phase and it will now be passed by the Senate within, hopefully, a comparatively short period of time, largely as a result of the fact that the Labor Party has backed down on their amendments.
Senator Cook made it very clear in his remarks that he was a bit concerned about tax avoidance, as indeed we all are. But, of course, one of the reasons why there has been 
 concern about tax avoidance was the very lax administration of the previous Keating government and the holes that it left in tax law. I was amused to hear Senator Cook indicate that he was particularly concerned about certain measures on tax avoidance. If we hark back, we will remember that it was Senator Cook himself who, when we tried to close major tax loopholes like the R&D syndicates, led the attack and encouraged the Labor Party to vote against what the coalition was doing. If Senator Cook had had his way, a major hole would have been left within the tax law of this country on syndicates.
Then Senator Cook was concerned about whether the wealthy were paying their fair share of tax. We well remember the campaign led by Senator Cook and Senator Nick Sherry to try to prevent the superannuation surcharge from being passed by this Senate. It was a very inglorious period for the Labor Party, out of a lot of self-interest on their part it has to be said, in their campaign to prevent the surcharge from coming in. So for the Labor Party to get up and pretend that they are serious about closing loopholes in the tax system when we review their record in government and out of government is a gross hypocrisy.
The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is a major structural reform in the way this country presents and runs its fiscal policy. As I said, the bill fulfils an election promise made by this government to make sure that the Australian accounts are presented in a fair and honest manner and to enshrine in legislation a requirement which will govern this government and any future government as to the way in which they present and improve their fiscal performance. No government will be able to do the sort of gross cheating that the Labor Party got up to before the last election and which was exposed within 48 hours of the Howard government coming to office. This kind of reform will be a permanent feature in making sure that Australian economic policies run better, in making sure that the public is kept better informed and in making sure that there is transparency in the economic policy of this country.
This is the same bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 11 December 1996 and passed by the House of Representatives on 10 February 1997. On 28 October 1997, the Senate passed the bill with 10 amendments. These amendments were unnecessary and made aspects of the bill unworkable. I will not go through the arguments on those amendments, but let me make it clear that those people who are interested in this debate should refer to those earlier copies of the Hansard to see the pathetic way the Labor Party attempted to deal with this bill. As on a number of other issues, such as work for the dole, we have seen a very inglorious backflip as their hypocrisy has been exposed. Make no mistake: the Labor Party's intention was to make this bill unworkable. They knew the government could not and would not accept the amendments they moved. As a result of the government's determination and as a result of public support, the Labor Party has had to back down.
The bill will reform fiscal policy formulation through introducing principles for sound management of fiscal policy against which governments must develop their fiscal strategy. These principles will focus attention on a range of issues that must be addressed if fiscal policy is to be sustainable over time. The charter of budget honesty will also ensure that up-to-date information is available so that the government's performance can be assessed against its fiscal objectives. To achieve this, the bill establishes a formal reporting structure. With each year's budget, a report will be released setting out the economic and fiscal projections for the budget year and three forward years. These projections will illustrate the consequences of the adopted fiscal strategy.
A further report released midway through the financial year will update the fiscal and economic projections contained in the budget report. The details of fiscal outcomes for the just completed financial year will be presented in a report to be released within three months of the end of that financial year. In addition, an intergenerational report will be produced every five years to report on the 
 long-term sustainability of the current fiscal policies.
It was amusing to listen to all of Senator Cook's comments about the need to reform the fiscal reporting of this country and to note how little the opposition did during their term in office on that.
—You're not serious.
—The Keating government will be remembered for attempting to cover up, Senator Conroy, the fiscal position of this nation. Senator Conroy, as you and I know, the sooner those Keating ministers like Senator Cook get off that front bench and space is made for people who have clean hands on this issue the better for the Labor Party. The Labor Party is in a very sorry shape in Victoria, and rightly so, but at least they have recognised that the former ministers had to go. The federal Labor Party has not made that decision and that is why you have people like Senator Cook still on the front bench.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—I know this embarrasses you, Senator Conroy, because you fully agree with me. I know you fully agree with me. Your pathetic protesting will not fool anyone on that issue.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Senator Conroy, you just wait for the big one. The Labor Party, as you and your colleagues know, is history in that state. But at least, and let me make it clear, Senator Conroy, they have purged the failed ministers from their front bench. That is a decision that the federal Labor Party needs to make, particularly in relation to Senator Cook. The bill will provide a strong impetus towards achieving better fiscal outcomes by providing greater discipline in policy formulation, regular statements of fiscal objectives and increased accountability for fiscal performance. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Amendment (Senator Murray's) agreed to.
Amendment (by Senator Cook) proposed:

	 Question put:",SENATE,<title>CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Synon, Sen Karen",LP,1998-03-25,"—I stand here today to speak on a matter which has long been of interest to the Senate, to those in the other place and to many of my fellow Australians—the matter of Tibet, human rights in that country and the rule of law. The Australian parliament has a long history of acknowledging allegations of human rights violations in Tibet. This parliament has called on China to respond constructively to discussions with Tibet's spiritual and temporal leader, the Dalai Lama, and to address the issue of allegations of human rights abuse in Tibet.
I stand here today in recognition that we live in a country in which our rights as individuals are recognised and respected. I stand in recognition that as Australians we have a duty to assist people elsewhere to receive similar recognition of their rights and dignity, and to assist people elsewhere in the exercise of their right to self-determination. For many years, I have watched the oppression of the Tibetan people and the suppression of their culture. I have watched as democracies around the world have passed and implemented significant initiatives in support of the people of Tibet. I am proud to publicly support that movement in championing the Tibetan people, their culture, their language and their identity.
One of the most influential bodies which has been involved in and concerned by developments in Tibet for nearly four decades is the much respected International Commission of Jurists. The commission is made up of 45 leading judges and lawyers from around the world. In 1959, the International Commission of Jurists published a report called The question of Tibet and the rule of law. This report examined Chinese policy in Tibet, violations of human rights in that country and the position of Tibet in international law. The report found that:
. . . almost all the rights which together allow the full and legitimate expression of human personality appear to be denied to the Tibetans . . . on the basis of the available evidence it would seem difficult to recall a case in which ruthless suppres 
 sion of man's essential dignity has been more systematically and efficiently carried out.
In the following years, the ICJ published further reports detailing evidence relating to genocide in Tibet and finding that acts of genocide had been committed in Tibet in an attempt to destroy the Tibetans as a religious group. The ICJ also found widespread violations of numerous civil and political, as well as economic and social, rights.
The United Nations, like many individual countries, also expressed concern during those years about the continued ill-treatment of the Tibetan people. The UN called many times for China to ensure respect for the fundamental human rights of the Tibetan people and for their distinctive cultural and religious life. In 1961, the UN General Assembly called on China to cease `practices which deprive the Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedoms including their right to self-determination'. This call was repeated again in 1965. Yet the situation of the Tibetan people deteriorated further.
During the Cultural Revolution in China, every aspect of Tibetan culture came under attack. By 1976, Tibet's cultural and religious heritage was decimated, as were almost all of its thousands of monasteries. Hundreds of thousands of Tibetans had been killed. More recently, the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the UN Commission on Human Rights expressed concern at `the continuing reports of violations of fundamental human rights and freedoms which threaten the distinct cultural, religious and national identity of the Tibetan people'.
In response in 1991, the International Commission of Jurists decided to conduct an up-to-date study of the situation of the rule of law and human rights in Tibet. The report Tibet: Human rights and the rule of law, published last December, is a result of that study. It notes the intensification of repression in Tibet since 1996, focusing particularly on the re-education drive in the monasteries, arrests of leading religious figures and the ban on photographs of the Dalai Lama. It also examines increasing threats to aspects of Tibetan identity and culture through colonis 
 ation, the erosion of the Tibetan language and the degradation of Tibet's environment.
The report describes the Tibetan people as a people under alien subjugation, entitled under international law to the right of self-determination. Many policies erode, or threaten to erode, the distinctive elements of Tibetan identity and culture. These are outlined in the report of the ICJ. They include the fact that systematic population transfer from China to Tibet has ensured that Chinese people now account for approximately one-third of the total population of all areas with Tibetan autonomous status. Tibetans have become a minority in their own land.
The report also noted the undermining of Tibet's cultural heritage through the destruction of over 6,000 Tibetan monasteries, the restriction of cultural activities and the blatant assimilation policy, as well as the erosion of the Tibetan language—an issue intricately bound with identity, communication and education. Chinese language dominates education—an issue to which I shall return—and it dominates commerce and administration. In so doing it marginalises Tibetan as a language and the Tibetans as a people. Finally, the report also noted the environmental degradation and the resource exploitation which have destroyed most of Tibet's wildlife and seen much of its forests cut, hills eroded and the threat of flooding magnified. As a direct consequence, the long-term viability of Tibetan civilisation is threatened.
Education—obviously a key factor in the propagation of a people's culture and identity—is also severely restricted. The United Nations Covenant on the Rights of the Child, of which China is a signatory, safeguards the right of a child to education, the development of the child's cultural identity, language and values, the minority rights of culture, religion and language, and the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.
However, in direct contravention of this, some recent evidence suggests that many Tibetan children receive no education and the Tibetan language is being phased out of schooling and students are forbidden to worship the Dalai Lama, to visit a temple, to 
 eat Tibetan food or to read material written in Tibetan. I note that there are many Australian school children in the gallery today. I ask how we would feel if they were forbidden to eat Australian food or to talk in English. Children are further promised money to report their parents if they talk about subjects relating to Tibetan culture, history or religion—obviously very divisive—and children often suffer brutal punishment in schools.
Not only will Tibet's unique and special culture die if its children are not taught about it but the current system also prevents Tibetan children attaining a sufficient standard of education to participate fully in their community. This also decreases their chances of employment. Tibet's very survival is threatened. These are merely the policies which are subsuming Tibetan culture and identity, not the abhorrent breaches of political and religious rights perpetrated in Tibet and which have been well documented for over nearly 40 years.
In 1948 Australia was one of the first members of the United Nations to vote for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since that time it has been a party to several declarations and conventions which reinforce that declaration. One of the most important of these is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This covenant stipulates that people have a right to, among other things: their own language and religion; participation in public affairs; freedom of expression and opinion; freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; freedom of association and assembly; a fair trial and equal treatment with others under the law; freedom from cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment; and life, liberty and the security of person.
These rights, which we as Australians recognise and take for granted, are denied to the Tibetan people by a totalitarian regime. In particular: those in detention, as documented by groups like the Australia Tibet Council and Amnesty International, are often subject to torture and ill treatment; the death penalty may be imposed without due process or fair trial; restrictions on freedom of speech are rife and re-education is even monitored by neigh 
 bourhood committees; freedom of religion has been inhibited by the destruction of monasteries, subjugation of monastic orders and the severe curtailing of religious teaching; the forced sterilisation of thousands of Tibetan women, the forced abortions and the imposition of fines ensure that Tibetan families are restricted to having only one child; since 1949, 1.2 million Tibetans have been killed; and the Tibetan people are clearly unable to exercise their entitlement under international law to self-determination.
The history of human rights in Tibet is disgraceful. I stand here, as others have stood before me, to highlight the situation in Tibet and to call for the reaffirmation that human rights are both universal and indivisible. The Tibetan people are entitled to a constructive engagement on the issue of human rights in their country, a restoration of an atmosphere of trust and reconciliation between their leader in exile, the Dalai Lama, and the People's Republic of China, and the right of religious freedom and the release of all political and religious prisoners of conscience in Tibet. Together we must work towards a common goal—a goal that human rights abuses are eradicated around the world and that individual's rights are protected. The Tibetan people have suffered brutal treatment in their own country. Their human rights must be upheld.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Tibet</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-25,"—My question is directed to Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy. Minister, do you recall that you told the Senate yesterday in relation to the QCMM Group (ESP):
I have never had any involvement in what that company puts money into . . . I have no control over it and never have had any control over it—
Minister, isn't it actually true that on at least eight occasions you chaired meetings of QCMM Group (ESP) which discussed allotting 1,000 employer shares to AQRM, putting money into Bruce Resources, the impact on ESP shares of Tomen's takeover of AMI and which authorised you to sign off on the annual financial statements? Do you still maintain, as you said yesterday, that you have no involvement and no control? Minister, why did you mislead the Senate again? Will you now correct the record?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-25,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, yesterday you said to the Senate—let me quote you again:
I have never had any involvement in what that company puts money into . . . I have no control over it and never have had any control over it—
Now you are reinterpreting that answer. You do accept that that was a mislead yesterday, do you, Senator Parer? Do you stand by your statement, Senator Parer, of yesterday in question time?
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. I ask that you direct Senator Faulkner to direct his questions through you and not scream them across the chamber at Senator Parer.
—Questions should be addressed to the chair.
—I ask the minister whether he stands by his statement yesterday:
I have never had any involvement in what that company puts money into . . . I have no control over it and never have had any control over it—

"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-03-25,"—Here we have a regurgitation of this over and over again. You are at the bottom of the barrel, Senator. What I said is that I had no involvement in the decision making process, certainly in relation to the time that I got out of it. I had very little involvement in the past. Certainly for the official returns you have to sign off on them. Let me also say, because I suspect there will be some more questions coming from the other side, that this was set up as a retirement type fund.
During the debate on matters of public interest Senator Cook came in here and tipped a bucket, or tried to tip a bucket all over me. Normal courtesies in this place are—whether you do it in a public interest debate or an adjournment debate—that you let the other person know that you are going to do it. All I can say is that you people on the other side have sunk to absolute lows.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. I asked Senator Parer a direct question about a statement that he made to the Senate yesterday which I believe was a deliberate and serious misleading of the Senate. Senator Parer may well want to respond to something else that was said at 
 another time. There are plenty of opportunities, as you are aware, Madam President, that he can take if he cares to do so, not the least of which is a personal explanation at the appropriate time. But I do think on this occasion you ought to direct the minister to answer what is a very serious question that I have directed to him about his misleading the Senate yesterday.
—Madam President, on the point of order: an even much more serious matter is Senator Faulkner's consistent use of points of order to effectively impugn the integrity of other senators. His question was: why did you deliberately mislead the Senate yesterday? He then got up and said that he believed that Senator Parer had deliberately misled the Senate. He is simply using points of order as a vehicle for saying things that are quite contrary to standing orders. That should not be allowed. There is no point of order, of course. He does not even purport to have one because Senator Parer has not even started to answer the question. He is simply abusing the processes of this place and he should not be allowed to continue.
—Senator Parer has been answering the question, and I do not know whether anything that Senator Cook raised relates to this or not. So I cannot comment on whether the remarks arising from that are relevant to this answer or not. I would draw Senator Parer's attention to the question that has been asked of him.
—Everyone knows in this particular chamber—and, from the scurrilous campaign waged by Senator Faulkner and others, I assume everyone in Australia knows—that I was on the board and was chairman of the Queensland Coal Mine Management companies and all subsidiaries. They also know that when I was appointed as a minister I resigned from those and had no involvement whatsoever in the operation of either the Queensland Coal Mine Management company or its subsidiaries. The people on the other side tried to run the line that I did. They said that I went to Japan. There was a scurrilous article in the Sydney Morning Herald  that said I had met with one of the major trading companies and, as a result of 
 that, additional coal sales contracts. The dope who wrote that did not even realise that the group I spoke to do not buy coal. They are a trading company.
—Sue him because we were not behind that one.
—Good idea, Senator Ray. Then they were running the line saying, `Have you met with Mr Shand? What did you talk about?' That has been totally debunked. You are running this technical question saying that I somehow misled the Senate deliberately. I can assure you, Senator, I did not. The point I made yesterday was that I had no involvement, and the implication is since I actually resigned from those boards. Naturally I did because I was there up until that time and everyone knows that.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-03-25,"—My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. It relates to Australia's anti-jobs unfair dismissal laws which today were supported by the Australian Labor Party. What will be the impact on job creation as a result of this action?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-03-25,"—Yes, it is extraordinary that the Labor Party is opposed to the creation of jobs. The way the Labor Party continues to oppose the interests of small business is also extraordinary. They have not learnt a thing. They have not learnt the necessity to create an economy in which small business is free enough to grow, expand and create employment opportunities. Anti-jobs is the Labor position. Anti small business is the Labor position.
One would have thought that they would have listened. The evidence was overwhelming. They could have listened to what was put forward through the Yellow Pages Small Business Index, which showed that 79 per cent of small businesses thought that small business would be better off if exempted from the unfair dismissal laws. Thirty-three per cent said that small business would be more likely to recruit new employees had there been such an exemption, and 33 per cent of small businesses said they would be more likely to recruit new employees if they were exempt from the current unfair dismissal laws. So there is the evidence from small business itself.
—I raise a point of order, Madam President. Is the minister referring to federal laws in that survey or to state laws?
—There is no point of order.
—If they were not prepared to listen to small business as expressed through the Yellow Pages survey, perhaps they could have listened to the state chamber of commerce in New South Wales, which surveyed 700 small businesses. They said that 42 per cent of businesses believed unfair dismissal laws were a deterrent to employing more staff. An overwhelming 85 per cent of small businesses nominated unfair dismissal laws as a key factor affecting businesses with 15 or fewer employees. If they do not want to look at the statistics, they could have listened to what the chamber said.
—Common rule awards.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order, Senator Hill. There are far too many people interjecting on my left. I ask them to desist.
—I know this is embarrassing for Labor. They do not want to be seen as the anti-jobs party. They do  not want to be seen as the anti small business party. But the evidence is overwhelming. They could have listened to the chamber of commerce saying that `the small business community is the engine room of job creation and it is crying out for relief from what it sees as an impediment to employing people and growing small and medium-sized companies'. But of course the new Labor Party simply will not listen.
If they did not want to listen to the chamber of commerce from New South Wales they could have listened to the fact that 50 small business organisations referred to under the umbrella of the Small Business Coalition all met in Canberra last month and unanimously said that the exemption should be passed in the interests of small business and more jobs. Or they could have listened to the Council of Small Business Organisations, which indicated even this week that 50,000 jobs would be created in small business if the exemption law were passed. Fifty thousand jobs: I would have thought that that would have caused the 
 Labor Party to stand up and listen, but they will not. What are they embarrassed about? Is it the fact that the coalition, by contrast, has created 220,000 new jobs since it came into office? Are they embarrassed by the fact that they have asked only three employment questions in 88 sitting days? Why is the Labor Party so disinterested in job creation? Why isn't the Labor Party interested in supporting small business, freeing them up so they have the opportunity to grow and to employ more Australians, particularly young Australians? Those Australians out of work will be very disappointed by the Labor Party of today. (Time expired)

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-03-25,"—My question is to Senator Hill, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Does the minister agree with the Clerk of the Senate, in his advice to Senator Faulkner of yesterday's date, that a conflict of interest exists where a senator has a private interest which could be served by the senator's performance of official duties? Does the minister agree with him that it is a complete misconception to maintain that a conflict of interest does not exist until it is established that public duties have been performed in such a way as to favour a private interest? Does the minister agree with his view that the conflict of interest exists regardless of how the public duties are performed? Or does the minister subscribe to the Prime Minister's interpretation of conflict of interest as being the actual performance of public duties so as to favour a private interest—the so-called `hand in the till' interpretation?
—Madam President, on a point of order: that question seems to be directed to ascertaining a legal assessment of something that appears to have been leaked by the Labor Party based on a few remarks from the clerk, who is not a legal expert. I would have thought in those circumstances it is completely out of order to ask the government to, on the run, express a qualified legal opinion on a matter such as that.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-03-25,"—I think I could give a pretty good legal opinion, but I know it is inappropriate. I understand that Senator Faulkner sought advice from the clerk as to what `conflict of interest' might mean within the terms of the Senate resolution. If Senator Faulkner is so uncertain, there is nothing wrong with him seeking advice from the clerk or anyone else. I understand that the clerk expressed his view, and that is one view. It can be matched against the views of others.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators on my left will remain silent.
—What I can tell you with great certainty, Senator, is that I have not seen any evidence of a conflict of interest in this place in the last couple of weeks. What I have seen is an appalling attack upon a good minister who is doing a fine job, and possibly believed by some to be the finest resources minister in the history of this country, I might say.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Hill, we will wait till we have some order in the chamber.
—In such circumstances, one wonders why the Labor Party continues with this attack. I think perhaps we got a hint of the reason from Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition who, when speaking to Jeremy Cordeaux on Radio 5DN in Adelaide about his job, said:
The toughest part is just sitting down to get a positive set of solutions. I mean, it's easy to be negative.
Doesn't that reflect the Labor Party of today? All they have done for a fortnight is come in here and attack Senator Parer—made no case, established no conflict; dredging in the gutter, apparently now using stolen documents to try to advance their interests when there are so many big issues out there that the Labor Party ought to be addressing, issues of job creation, issues of health policy and issues of education. How many policies have they got?
—None.
—None. Two years of opposition—in fact, Mr Beazley said it. He went on to say, `We've been trying to develop a set of policies and it's not always easy to get these together.' It is certainly not easy for this Labor Party.
—Ha, ha!
—Order! The level of noise is too high.
—So if you have been struggling at it for two years and you have not been able to settle on one policy—therefore, not able to demonstrate in any way 
 that you are presenting yourselves as an alternative government in this country—how do you cover that deficiency? Just be negative; just attack; just dredge in the gutter. Try to get something to distract from your incompetency in opposition, let alone your incompetency in government. That is what this is all about.

—What I am saying is that it is easy to be negative, as Mr Beazley said. The test will be whether this opposition turns itself into an alternative government.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-03-25,"—I was a bit mystified, as a matter of fact, that this happened yesterday because I have had very constructive meetings with the ATSIC board of commissioners. Then, out of the blue, this happened. I understand that when the Labor Party was 
 in power for 13 years they ran it out of the minister's office. Well, look what happened to him! I am not aware whether he was reprimanded or not. In fact, I asked if he was reprimanded, and they could not tell me.
—He wasn't
—He was, was he, Senator Cook? That is interesting.
—I said he wasn't.
—Senator Cook seems to know whether he was or he was not. They were in for 13 years. The thing that strikes me about the Labor Party is that, after 13 years, the life expectancy of Aboriginal people did not improve—not even by one day. It is now an 18 or 19 year discrepancy between the life expectancy of Aboriginal people and other Australians.
The priorities of the government, which are not accepted—and I accept that from Senator Evans—by some of the ATSIC commissioners, are that we want to concentrate on health, housing and education. What I did on Monday was announce an economic development paper, and that is being opposed. I remember the ATSIC board opposing me about the army ATSIC program. Go to those communities, which I have done. I have to tell you that every community the army has been into is grateful. You will recall that, at the time, ATSIC said that it was a `white fella's solution to a black fella's problem'. That is what they said. So when this comes out of the blue, I have to think to myself, `What's on with them? What is going on?' Well, it does not need a genius to know that the Wik debate is going to come on next week. I have no doubt that there will be further stunts like this. That is what that was—a stunt.
I accept they have a genuine desire and a genuine interest in the native title debate, and that comes from the heart unanimously. That is not the government policy. I accept that they have a legitimate interest and a legitimate opinion, and we should accept that.
Madam President, you will recall right at the beginning that I put a special auditor into ATSIC. You are probably not aware that, after tightening up accountability, that is still being opposed. But what did the special 
 auditor find? He expressed serious reservations about 292 of the 1,200 ATSIC funded organisations examined. In their last year of funding, these organisations received a total of $172.4 million. Sixty of these organisations were judged as not fit and proper.
Senator Faulkner interjecting—
—I want to give the correct figures, Senator Faulkner. It was $27.8 million that they defunded. They said that they were not fit and proper and the remainder were required to undergo remedial action. Despite that, I note that the latest Australian National Audit Office report of December last year, Senator Faulkner—this is reporting on when the government was in opposition and when the Labor Party was in power—states:
In respect of the 1995-96 grants which were required to be acquitted during 1996-97, despite remedial action the level of compliance with grant acquittance procedures by grantees and, in some instances, ATSIC staff remained unsatisfactory.
That is their record. That is the record that they had in government. They cannot talk. I regard the fact that I am being criticised by the ATSIC board with a certain amount of pride because I am on about accountability, and the government is on about health, housing, education, economic opportunity and the future of the Aboriginal people. So I wear that as a badge of honour.

They were critical of the previous government, and so they should have been critical of the previous government given the record that you left behind.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by Senator West today, relating to conflicts of interest and ministerial responsibility.
It is true that I did seek advice from both the Clerk of the Senate and the Registrar of Senators' Interests in relation to the issue of conflict of interest. If a person was serious about this issue, it would be extraordinary if they sought advice from this government, which has redefined the concept of conflict of interest in public life. But I did seek advice from the Registrar of Senators' Interests. I would like to quote part of a letter in response to my request. The registrar said this:
A conflict of interest is a state of affairs in which one's concern for personal benefit coexists with one's public duty in a relevant office to act in the public interests without regard to personal benefit.
He went on:
This coexistence of personal interest and public duty gives rise to the risk that concern for one's personal interests may influence performance of one's public duty in that office.
He then said:
The influence of personal interest over public duty may not arise or, if it arises, may be suppressed. However, for there to be a conflict of interest, actual influence, let alone personal benefit, is not necessary, only the risk of such influence.
That is what has been known and understood as the definition of conflict of interest in Western democracies. It has been well understood by most. In relation to risks, the registrar went on further to say:
. . . so grave that both formal codes of conduct and practical modes of political accountability often require prior removal of the risk of influence. Prior removal is achieved either by disposal of the personal interest before assuming the public office or by declining the public office.
Again, that is an accepted course of action—hitherto an accepted course of action. I want to quote one brief paragraph of the advice of the Clerk of the Senate on the same issue of conflict of interest. He said:
It has been said that a conflict of interest does not exist until it is established that public duties have been performed in such a way as to favour a private interest. This is a complete misconception. The conflict of interest exists regardless of how the public duties are performed.
Again, this has been an understanding that all of us have had in relation to what conflict of interest is and how a person holding public office deals with conflict of interest.
The problem that we face in Australia today is that Mr Howard and his government have redefined conflict of interest. What Mr Howard now says is that a conflict of interest does not arise unless you have literally been caught with your fingers in the till. That is what he is saying—unless you have literally got your hand in the till and you have been caught. That is what Mr Howard has now redefined as conflict of interest. The problem is that that is a redefinition to suit Mr Howard's own purposes because any proper definition of conflict of interest would ensure that Senator Parer would have to resign.
The government says we are muckraking as we focus on Senator Parer's many investment 
 related activities, but there is very good reason why an opposition would concentrate for such a period on Senator Parer, on the Prime Minister's code and on the issue of blatant conflict of interest. We have a situation where this redefinition has led to a very sad day for Commonwealth decision making. I believe that Mr Howard should hang his head in shame and that Senator Parer should resign.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-03-25,"—It is quite clear that the wheels have fallen off the Labor Party's smear wagon against Senator Parer. Day after day we have been subjected to these allegations against Senator Parer, none of which have stuck. What do they do now? They come out with a version of conflict of interest which is completely and utterly irrelevant to the ministerial code.
I have some questions in relation to the commentary provided by officials of the Senate in relation to conflict of interest, but that aside, that only relates to senators in relation to declarations in this chamber. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the ministerial code of conduct, which the Prime Minister wrote up and which the Prime Minister applies. We are talking about two completely different documents and two completely different scenarios. What Senator Faulkner, quite cleverly, has sought to do is to merge the two to try to make them into the one, and then further besmirch Senator Parer.
There are two things that Senator Faulkner does in his little repertoire—and there are only two things. He never has the facts, so we witness hysteria like we did on Monday and Tuesday of this week or he struggles through his speech without his heart being in it, as was quite obvious today. Indeed, the real Leader of the Opposition walked out of question time early and, I am sure, will not participate in this debate because he saw that the tactics were falling to pieces and he did not want to be associated with the sham with which the Labor Party were associated.
If the Labor Party were so genuine about conflict of interests, I wonder whether Senator Faulkner wrote to the good Clerk of the Senate or to the Committee of Senators' Interests, or indeed to people in the House of 
 Representatives, to inquire whether there was some conflict of interest when a person who was then federal Treasurer of this country gained a loan from the Commonwealth Bank for a piggery that was basically impecunious. No, of course Senator Faulkner did not write then, and that was a clear case where somebody enriched themselves through their position. The Labor Party were deathly quiet on that. Yet they seek to besmirch Senator Parer when they have been unable to lay a glove on him.
If the Labor Party were genuinely concerned about ministerial ethics, they would explain to the Australian people why they still hold out Senator Nick Bolkus as an appropriate person to be the first law officer of this country—a person who, if Labor were to win office, would be in control of the Skase matter; indeed, as Attorney-General, would be in control of funding for the Federal Court. Do you know what he did? In breach of Federal Court rules, he leaked a confidential affidavit from the Federal Court. He got caught red-handed. This senate censured him for it. Every single person in this Senate, other than Labor Party senators, voted for that motion.
If you are so concerned about ministerial ethics, why is it that Senator Nick Bolkus is allowed to retain a position on the front bench of the Labor Party? It is because the leadership of the Labor Party is too weak to remove him. But if the people of Australia want a clear demonstration of the standards that would apply in relation to ministerial conduct were Labor ever to win, all they need to do is look at Senator Bolkus, who is allowed to leak, in breach of Federal Court rules, confidential documents which have the capacity to undermine our chase for the Skase assets, and he is allowed to continue on the front bench.
While Senator Nick Bolkus remains on your front bench, the opposition has no right to talk about ethics in any shape or form because the actions of the Labor Party speak a lot louder than their words during Senate question times.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ministerial Code of Conduct</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-03-25,"—In speaking to this motion, I wanted to refer again to the speech which the Prime 
 Minister, Mr Howard, made to the House of Representatives on 11 April 1986. I see that two journalists writing in the Sydney Morning Herald  today have recited large tracts of that speech in their articles, no doubt having regard to the fact that it was drawn to the Senate's attention yesterday in my speech. The reason I want to do that is that it places Mr Howard's position today in such stark contrast to his self-righteous indignation in 1986 when the mother of the then Minister for Trade, Mr John Dawkins, held BHP shares, which Mr Howard said was a heinous crime. Mr Howard was attempting to censure the then Prime Minister over this.
Mr Howard wanted the House to censure the then Prime Minister for condoning the failure of the Minister for Trade to make full and frank disclosure of matters which may have given rise to a conflict of interest. He also said that he wanted to censure the Prime Minister for his failure to maintain proper standards of ministerial conduct. He also wanted to censure the Prime Minister for his blatant double standards relating to ministerial propriety and for his expedient and opportunistic interpretation of rules which he himself had laid down for the conduct of ministers. If that does not apply to Mr Howard today, nothing does.
Clearly, the Prime Minister has redefined and reinterpreted his own rules so that Senator Parer can get off the hook. He is clearly caught. The editorials of the major newspapers around this country have said that Senator Parer should stand down and that the Prime Minister should cease protecting him. That is what they have said. They said it days and days ago. But this government has decided that it is going to abandon its standards because it cannot afford to lose a minister.
No-one on the government side should talk to us about double standards, because here we have evidence that the Prime Minister has changed his standards. The standards which Mr Howard wanted applied to John Dawkins because his mother owned BHP shares do not seem to apply to Senator Parer, who is part of a family trust with $2 million worth of coal shares. Other issues were raised in question time today relating to the non-declaration of 
 valuable shareholdings, which he was required to declare by the Senate. No doubt we will hear more about that.
In April 1986, Mr Howard, quoting Prime Minister Hawke—but he chose to repeat it and he took comfort in it—said:
If a man . . . shouts from the roof tops that those in high office should be subject to scrutiny he should have exactly the same standards applied to himself.
I say to the Prime Minister that they do apply to him and they will be applied to him. As quoted by Mike Seccombe in today's Sydney Morning Herald , the Prime Minister said:
Everybody knows that if a man who stands to gain . . . goes out of this Parliament and tries to tell the average Australian that he may not have a conflict of interest . . . there is not a man or a woman who would believe him.
That is what the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said.
—That is just the politics of envy, that's all.
—You are the one who punched the air over the vote this morning, Senator Calvert. You want a double dissolution on Wik because it suits you. You do not want a double dissolution on the issues.
Government senators interjecting—
—Where were you this morning?
—I was here. The Prime Minister said in 1986:
There is only one thing involved and that is whether or not in the circumstances applying to the minister for trade there was a potential for a conflict of interest to arise.
In this case, Senator Parer had a situation where there was potential for a conflict of interest. Indeed, he clearly broke the guidelines. He broke the guidelines in a way that in other cases caused the demise of Senator Short and Senator Gibson, but in this case the Prime Minister's friend Senator Parer is being protected, notwithstanding the stance of the Prime Minister when he said that John Dawkins should go and that the then Prime Minister should be censured because Dawkins's mother had BHP shares. That was the stance of the Prime Minister then. The 
 question is, are the electors of this country entitled to have confidence in the integrity of their elected representatives? (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ministerial Code of Conduct</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,speech
"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1998-03-25,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the answer supplied by Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I have had some experience in parliamentary procedure, particularly at question time, and I must say that in my experience, which spans 11 or so years in state politics in Western Australia, I have never seen an adversarial atmosphere like this in politics before. What is it going to achieve for Australia? Nothing. Nothing has been achieved in the last two weeks in question time. There has been an unmitigated attack on Senator Parer.
—We have asked some very good questions.
—There have been some valid and warranted questions from this side, but there has also been an unprecedented and unwarranted attack on Senator Parer. What is it? Is it the politics of envy? Is it the politics of hate? Is it the politics of lack of achievement that drives this along? Why do we have a situation where nothing can be achieved of any consequence by the other side?
It is like a pack of jackals attacking a lion. The more jackals there are, the more likely it is that they will bring the lion down, but they will not bring this lion down because there are not enough jackals on the other side. I am not the only one who says that that is so. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 24 March, Kate Askew said:
Because Pan Australian is a small explorer, not a miner, its activities arguably would not be affected by any of Senator Parer's policies. It has been a loser as an investment for him and his partners.
They do not seem to have landed anything on Senator Parer yet that is in any way approaching a conflict of interest. Indeed, the Prime Minister himself has said that there is no conflict of interest. The head of the Prime Minister's department, Mr Moore-Wilton, has also said that there is no conflict of interest. But if there was a conflict of interest and it has been rectified by the senator, why is he 
 still being pursued to the detriment of the Australian people?
There is no doubt that Senator Parer is one of the best that this nation has ever seen in the portfolio of minerals and resources. People of his acumen, ability and expertise do not come along every day who are prepared to give up a very rewarding life in the private sector in order to come into this place and serve their nation as they see fit and as the expertise which they have built up over a lifetime in that particular area dictates.
As I have said, even if there had been some blows landed, I do not believe they have been justified in any way. It is cowardly to accuse a man of a conflict of interest, of misleading parliament, in this place. People who do it without justification and when there is evidence to the contrary are nothing less than cowards in everybody's eyes.
There is no question that the media know that the other side are running out of puff, out of steam. How much longer is the charade going to go on? They are hoping and praying that at some stage they are going to lay a blow but they will not lay a blow on Lion Parer. The jackals can yap, scream and screech all they wish. I think it is disgraceful for the opposition to continue this to the detriment of Australia.
Senator Warwick Parer is here in the national interest. It costs him money to come into this place. I think that the politics of envy, the politics of hate and the nefarious behaviour by the other side should be condemned by this side. No doubt we do that privately, but we do not use the chamber and we do not use the time of this place to discredit someone who does not justify it. But we do heap discredit upon the other side for what they propose and hope—indeed, they have failed to bring about the degradation of one of the finest senators this chamber has seen.

"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-25,"—Senator Lightfoot just made a few interesting remarks. One of them, about halfway through his address—I cannot remember the exact words, Senator, but I think the words were something of this order—was that the Prime Minister has signed off on this; 
 therefore there is no conflict of interest. Unfortunately, we are not as naive as that. We cannot accept that, because the Prime Minister has signed off in this instance, a potential, at the very least, conflict of interest does not exist.
I do not want to spend much of my time here this afternoon on Senator Parer. Basically, I think Senator Parer is a decent fellow and a good minister. I think his administration of that area, at least as far as I have seen it—and I have had only some six months to take a close look at it—is reasonably good. But, unfortunately, owning shares—albeit in some contorted system of ownership that keeps them supposedly at arms-length—in an area of portfolio responsibility is inappropriate. In my view it is an open and shut case.
I want to quote a couple of people who I think share that view. On 14 October 1996—Senate Hansard page 4,074—Senator Hill, in referring to the guidelines that we are talking about that are at the very heart of this matter, said:
Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in an area of their portfolio responsibilities.
Again on the same day—page 4,064 of the Hansard —Senator Hill said:
It is true that the guidelines set a very high standard and we do not apologise for that. We believe that the Australian people are entitled to that. The Prime Minister has said that ministers are expected to keep those guidelines. As a result of the breach—
and this was talking about a much earlier one—
that just occurred of those guidelines, even though there is no suggestion there was any intention of personal benefit that would flow from that breach, a minister has paid a very high price—the highest price a minister could pay. I would have thought that that is the proof that this government intends to maintain high standards of ministerial conduct.
Again, this time two days later on 16 October, Senator Hill—page 4,265 of the Senate Hansard —said:
I remind you that those guidelines say that ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in companies or busi 
 nesses involved in any area of their portfolio responsibilities.
Again on the same day, 16 October, Senator Hill said:
The guidelines provide that ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. As I interpret that, if the company in which the minister holds shares is the company out of which the conflict arises, there would be a need to divest.
Sadly, I think it is quite straightforward that in this instance the Prime Minister's code of conduct is not to be applied. I can only speculate as to the reasons for that. Those reasons have been speculated upon in this chamber.
Quite frankly—and I agree with the clerk on this point—Senator Parer owned those shares, however so constructed—and I use the word closely and I make no point on that. The fact of the matter is that at the time he was a minister he had a family trust that owned extensive mining shares in areas of his ministerial responsibility. In my view, that is inappropriate. I would have thought that the Prime Minister would need to be consistent on this matter for the sake at least of poor old Senator Gibson and, indeed, for Senator Short, who was in this place before I got here.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Ministerial Code of Conduct</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1998-03-25,"—I am rather pleased that the opposition is yet again wasting time on this issue because it does give me an opportunity to carry on from where I left off yesterday. I did complain in yesterday's five-minute slot that I did not have enough time to go through a complete list of conflicts of interest of the Labor Party. Now I will have time to finish it off.
I think Senator Quirke is probably quite an honourable gentleman, from what I know of him in his short time here. I am sorry he did not follow me yesterday or today because he might have been able to explain to the Senate why the Labor Party remained deafeningly silent through many of those things that I mentioned yesterday, such as Minister Griffiths owning a sandwich shop while he was the minister for industry and Senator Richardson, while minister for communications, being a director of a radio station, not 
 declaring his interests and using his position as a minister to influence the President of the Marshall Islands on behalf of his cousin, Greg Symons.
I wonder why they did not complain about Treasurer Dawkins not declaring that his mother owned Bell shares while Holmes a Court was trying to take over BHP and why they did not complain about Prime Minister Hawke's personal friend Peter Abeles trying to crush the pilots' union. Why didn't they complain about Prime Minister Hawke using his position as PM to collect $1 million from four Western Australian business leaders at the gold tax lunch?
I went on to outline a whole range of other things, like Prime Minister Keating and Gareth Evans using their positions to attack Justice Marks and the royal commission on the Easton affair. Why did they not go for the then minister Carmen Lawrence when the Marks royal commission found that she had lied to the royal commission? They did not do a thing in relation to that. Why did they not have a go at the then Speaker Leo McLeay, who used his position as Speaker to collect $60,000 for falling off his bike? Why did they not have a go at Paul Keating when in the wilderness he bought a piggery using his superannuation as collateral? He did not declare that piggery. They did not have any answers to that.
Why was it all right for Paul Keating to use his position as Treasurer to protect the State Bank of Victoria from going under by selling it to the Commonwealth Bank? Why did they not have a go at Paul Keating when he was Treasurer for not lodging his income tax return for two years? Why did they not have a go at Gary Punch when he was minister for aviation and was opposed to a second runway? Why did they not have a go at Senator Bolkus when he was Minister for Administrative Services for negotiating to move the audit office into the ALP Centenary House, thus just happening to give the ALP an absolute windfall?
Unfortunately, none of those questions have been answered at all. Yet we still have a situation where the Leader of the Opposition in this place, Senator Faulkner, in his screech 
 ing, yelling and screaming across the chamber, has still asked only three questions without notice on unemployment in 12 months. What is wrong? Do you know that in 1997 the opposition did not ask one single solitary question on debt, not one on inflation, not one on interest rates and not one on small business—all the things that are crucial to this country. Inflation is down under the coalition government to zero, and yet not one thing has interested them in those issues.
What has interested them is the question of smut, muckraking, innuendo and everything else that can be smearing the government, but nothing on policy. As I said yesterday and as Senator Hill said today, there are no policies coming from the opposition. Here they are two years into opposition and not one policy—no policy on tax, trade, primary industry, environment, communications, industrial relations, social security, foreign affairs, industry, defence, health, finance, employment, transport, justice, immigration, resources and energy, family services, status of women, veterans' affairs, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, schools, vocational education, sport, customs, regional development—not one single solitary policy. They are constantly day after day muckraking and smearing an excellent minister who has been the best minister for resources the country has ever seen.

—They will be called on when we reach that business, Senator Harradine.
—I rise to order. On page 2 of the red, it says `Discovery of formal business, Business of the Senate, notice of motion no. 1'.
—That is for the possibility of the mover making application for formality. That has not happened at this stage.
—Madam Deputy President, I seek leave to make a statement.
—They come up again in item 17 on page 4 of the red. Is leave granted on this matter for Senator Harradine to make a statement?
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate. I was not aware that one would be faced with this situation at the present moment. It is an example of the fact that honourable senators are faced with a growing number of notices of motion. The time that is given to us does not enable us to seek or obtain detailed information and advice on these notices of motion, particularly when you are in the situation, as I am, where you have a whole range of matters to get over. In this particular case, one is engrossed in discussions and negotiations about very important legislation that is likely to come before the Senate in the next few days and particularly next week.
I raise with honourable senators the fact that, over the last few years, the number of notices of motion which have been placed before this chamber, declared formal and voted upon has more than trebled. In the last year they have at least doubled. If honourable senators continue to do this, I believe that we will reach a stage where motions which are adopted, decisions made by the Senate, will lose their credibility. I do not believe that that is good for the Senate or the institution itself, nor is it of benefit to those honourable senators and their constituents for whom this procedure is necessary. I believe that we need to do something to bring this to a head. Frankly, from tomorrow onwards I intend to deny leave to any notice of motion that is put forward until such time as some rationality enters this particular area. I do hope that honourable senators realise that it is in our best interests if we come to some sort of understanding and arrangement.
The other thing is that, because of the change in sitting times for the Senate, notices of motion are now put forward in the afternoon. Then there is the whips meeting, and one gets a response from the whips meeting on how the various parties are going to vote on particular matters. There is no time at night to make contact with relevant experts in 
 the field, so as to be properly informed, or to contact the library. Quite often the people are just not available at that time of night. You might say, `Well, there's always the morning.' I do not know about other honourable senators, but I get in here at half past seven in the morning and I find that my day is considerably taken up.
I do apologise to honourable senators, but I am not in a position to do justice to the matters that come before us in this particular fashion. I wonder whether at some stage you could all think about possibly setting aside one afternoon, whether that be Thursday afternoon, to look at them, which would give us plenty of time to consider the ramifications of the notices of motion.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-03-25,"—by leave—I agree with a lot of what Senator Harradine said, but I think notices of motion fall into three categories. One category is those that are given so you can put your views on the record and are never brought up for formality. We have all been through that.
The second lot are those that express an opinion of the Senate that are often executed by sending them to an embassy or somewhere else, and I think this is the nub of Senator Harradine's problem. But I would urge him not to refuse leave to those machinery matters which may extend the time for a report or for a public sitting because they are running out of time. I think they are in a third category. You did say you were going to refuse leave for all, Senator Harradine; I hope you will exempt those.",SENATE,<title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title>,<title>Formal Business</title>,Business,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-03-25,"—by leave—I share with Senator Harradine a prodigious workload, in my case on behalf of the Australian Greens, having to canvass the whole gamut of legislation, questions, notices of motion and so on. That is something that Senator Tambling and others opposite have never had to experience, but it is part of our duties.
What does concern me about Senator Harradine's proposal is that, of tomorrow—and I think it is the second or third time that such a proposal has been flagged here—he 
 will, and can, as a single senator, block formality being granted by a simple vote on the voices or, if necessary, a division on the matter as a protest about that workload. It would be a better solution for an arrangement to be made so that the motions can be dealt with in a more expeditious fashion, if indeed it is available.
Another option is to look to increasing the wherewithal in Senator Harradine's office and those of others who have to deal with this workload. But it is up to each senator and to each party to evaluate for themselves what is important that is happening in this nation, in our states and to the world and to be able to bring forward those issues and have them dealt with as expeditiously as possible.
Simply blocking them as a wholesale act of discontent about that workload is not giving proper weight to the content of those motions, some of which are extremely important and urgent. So I would think that the sensible thing would be to find the alternative solution rather than simply to block the process. Of course, I do know that, if the process is to block, we spend more time in here debating process rather than the issue itself.

I am saying that all honourable senators, including me, particularly those who have a workload, need time to properly and maturely consider their attitudes in respect of the notices of motion. That is what I have been asking. If Senator Brown does not want to take that in good faith, that will be it. It is not a situation where I am just denying leave for the sake of denying leave.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-03-25,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
That the people of Australia are guaranteed that their access to public health services will not be reduced due to the current disagreements over funding between the Federal and State/Territory Governments.
I believe this is an urgent matter. It is one that this chamber does need to discuss. I have worded my motion in such a way that I hope we can get bipartisan support and that we can send a very clear message to the people of Australia that this chamber—and, hopefully, both the government and the opposition—supports the Medicare system and, in particular, supports the public hospital system.
This ongoing funding dispute between federal and state governments is nothing new. I think the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, was quite right yesterday when he suggested that a lot of huffing and puffing goes on whenever we have a Medicare agreement up for negotiation, but I think we all must agree that this time it has gone a lot further than just people taking their own corner, digging themselves into a trench and doing a bit of arguing. What we have got now is a funding deadlock, and what this is doing in all states is undermining the confidence people have in the public health system and, in particular, the confidence they have that, should they need a public hospital bed, one will actually be available for them.
Yes, some of the messages that have been sent out by various states have helped in that undermining process. I am not saying for a moment that it is all the doing of the federal government, but my aim in discussing this motion today is to send a very clear message that we are determined to see this problem 
 sorted out and to get a commitment from this government that it will be involved in the sorting out process.
I am particularly concerned about the longer term. Since this government came into office, its health policies have resulted in a perception that there is a covert agenda to gradually starve the public health system—in particular, the public hospital system—of funds and get it down to the point where people give up and say, `Okay, I'm going to have to get private health insurance and go private.'
I do not want to start pointing the finger at any particular state; that will only take us back to the realm of buck passing and that is what we want to try to avoid. I think I can make a very general statement, though, that all parties have been involved both in cost cutting measures that went far beyond realistic levels and in cost shifting. I put very clearly on notice that all state governments have been involved in this practice of trying to shift costs on to the Commonwealth and also shift costs on to the individual.
I have held the Democrats health portfolio for over six years and, during this period, have been disturbed by the continuing drain of funds—and I go back to the previous Labor government as well as this present government—out of the public health sector. We have seen, for example, the dental health program go altogether, and we now see this difficulty with our public hospitals. Part of the attraction for governments when they see this big pot of money is that they think, `A couple of percentage points here this year, a couple of percentage points there this year and a bit next year won't make much difference.' But that has been going on for so long now that it is making a difference—a considerable difference—and that is why we have reached the impasse.
A number of things have been suggested over the years as we have been moving towards this impasse, and I would say that our public hospital system is now on a precipice. I suggest that not just the minister but a number of government members—if they have the time in the break after Easter—should actually visit several hospitals in their own state, talk to the nurses, doctors and 
 administrators and look particularly at the pressure on beds and at some of the wastage that is occurring, with wards being closed because there is simply not enough funding to keep the hospitals operating properly.
The Democrats on many occasions have proposed a range of what we believe are very practical and responsible positions. In some cases, these were put on hold, and two or three months or maybe two or three years down the track they were revisited and looked at by government. We had a case under the Labor government where they were looking at some of the reasons why people were leaving private health insurance. We are not convinced that people leaving private health insurance is a key factor in the situation public hospitals find themselves in—it is certainly a small factor, but not a key factor—but, if funding levels for public hospitals had been maintained, they would not be where they are.
A major reason for the shift away from private is the out-of-pocket expenses that people find themselves facing. People think, `Hopefully, the day will not come but, if I had to use a private hospital, I do not want to face the extra costs.' The knowledge that the costs are there, the knowledge that others have faced them and the knowledge that two or three months down the track some people are still getting their fourth, fifth and sixth bills from a visit to a private hospital does nothing for confidence in private health insurance.
We could not talk the previous Labor government into seriously considering this, but I am pleased to say that this government is now setting up pilot programs in this area and we at last seem to have doctors interested in this issue and doctors understanding that it is a problem. It has taken five years, but at last we are getting somewhere.
Another example of some of the suggestions we have made—and this one was made in 1997—is a progressive Medicare levy. I believe Australians on higher incomes would be prepared, if they saw the money going into the public hospital system, to pay a little extra. Unfortunately, when the government adopted this in 1997, they did not put the 
 money being raised into the public hospital system at all; it has gone off into general revenue. If they had been looking at a higher levy going into public hospitals, we would have at least another $350 million available.
As we look for a solution to this impasse, we are looking to the Productivity Commission's recommendations for a broad review of the Australian health system. That was made in April 1997 and has been echoed by the South Australian Premier, Mr Olsen. But we heard yesterday that this government is apparently not interested in finding a solution to this impasse. They have now ignored that call and have preferred apparently to leave the average Australian in this situation of uncertainty, where we have an inefficient financing process that leads eventually to insecurity.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-03-25,"—The government will accept the urgency motion moved by the Australian Democrats. It states:
That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:
That the people of Australia are guaranteed that their access to public health services will not be reduced due to the current disagreements over funding between the Federal and State/Territory Governments.
It is the view of the Commonwealth government that the failure of the states to accept a new Commonwealth-state health care agreement should not be at a cost to the public and that the security of the public in relation to public health services should be continued.
One wondered when the premiers walked out of the meeting with the Prime Minister last week, refusing to agree to the Commonwealth's offer in relation to the health care agreement, what their real intention was and exactly what were their tactics. One hopes that their tactics were not that they believed as a result of disagreement over a new agreement and failure to achieve a new agreement that there would be pressure through patients. The Commonwealth, in any event, was certainly not prepared to allow that to occur. Thus the Prime Minister very quickly said that the key parts of the Commonwealth offer would be implemented even without the 
 agreement of the state premiers. Notwithstanding their walkout, and no matter what their motive in doing so, patients will not be allowed to suffer as a result of that particular negotiating tactic.
It is important in this debate to establish the facts because there has been a lot of misinformation out there in the community. One of the facts relates to just how much money the Commonwealth does contribute to health care through the states. In the last five years the Commonwealth has in fact spent $27.3 billion on Commonwealth-state health care agreements. As I said yesterday in answer to a question, the forward estimates show that the funding would rise to $30.3 billion over the next five years. So the government was committed, through its estimates, to increasing public expenditure funded by the Commonwealth through taxes raised by the Commonwealth over and above that which the Commonwealth paid last year—an additional $3 billion. Our intention was therefore to increase the funding to some $30.3 billion.
On top of that it is also important to understand that the Commonwealth has been willing and is prepared to pay even further. It offered to the states an extra $1.5 billion in base funding over the next five years. That is on top of the $30.3 billion. It is prepared and will pay an extra $750 million for funding for veterans being fully treated in public hospitals. It is prepared and will pay an extra $500 million for initiatives in efficiency and effectiveness in hospitals, particularly in the area of information technology. All of this is going to be paid even though the state premiers are not prepared to sign the agreement. That is the security in terms of the motion moved by Senator Meg Lees, that public health services will not be reduced as a result of the premiers' walkout last Friday.
In addition to that, the Commonwealth is also prepared to  pay another $120 million to reduce waiting lists in public hospitals. I want to come back to that in a moment. Therefore, what we are offering above the forward estimates actually adds up to another $2.9 billion of new money. This is a 6.9 per cent increase in the first year of funding, moving 
 towards a 15.4 per cent real increase over the five years of the agreement. With that very substantial real increase—what is being offered is a 6.9 per cent real increase a year over an inflation rate of practically negative levels—it is very difficult to understand what the state premiers are complaining about.
The only complaint one really hears that has some bite is this issue about people leaving the private health sector and therefore putting further pressure on the public health sector and whether in fact that should be compensated in some way. This government, in contrast with the previous Labor government, is prepared to address that as well. We have done so by giving a commitment that if the level of private health insurance coverage drops then we will add another $83 million a year to health care agreements for any one per cent reduction in the number of people covered by that private health insurance.
We of course do not want to see private health coverage reduced any further. It was substantially reduced in the years of Labor—in fact reduced from a figure of almost 70 per cent of Australians having private health in 1983 to 35 per cent at the end of Labor's reign. Labor was basically opposed to private health insurance. We have heard it so often from the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating. He did not believe that it was a necessary part of the health system. In that environment people got out of private health care and that has placed further pressure on the public sector. We do not want to see that continue, but if it does we have provided this extra funding support which should give confidence to the states that they will be able to meet that extra demand.
How we act then to ensure as best we are able that there is not a further reduction is, as we have done, by providing a health insurance rebate of $450 a year for families, which grosses to some $600 million a year. So we have already put in $600 million a year to support the private health cover system. That will be continuing of course on an ongoing basis, except if Labor happen perchance to win the next election. They are opposed to that $600 million, so they will withdraw that, which will place further pressure on the 
 public sector again. As a matter of interest, in passing, they are also opposed—which is really extraordinary—to the surcharge that we placed on the Medicare levy in respect of higher income earners to put more money into the sector.
So what you have from the coalition government is an assurance that we will continue to fund the sector at an increased rate from the past—an extra benefit that we will put in if, unfortunately, the coverage of private health is further reduced—and, as I said, $120 million also to reduce waiting lists in public hospitals.
This is an incentive for the states. Only one state or territory has taken it up so far, and that is the ACT. The ACT is getting significant benefit. In fact, the ACT, having signed an in principle agreement—and that is all we ask of the states—will be able to draw half a million dollars this week which will fund an extra 200 admissions.
One can see what benefits would flow to each of the states—the extent to which they would be able to reduce their waiting lists if they took up our offer of a share of that $120 million. I would have thought that not only is this a generous offer that has been put to the states but also it gives assurance to the public that they will not suffer as a result of the intransigence of the state premiers. On top of that it provides the extra incentive of $120 million to reduce waiting lists very substantially and thus meet this extra pent-up demand which is really a flow-on from the failures of the last Labor government in this sector. I put the offer to state premiers again and urge them to see sense on this issue in the interest of the health of all Australians.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Health Funding</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-03-25,"—There can be few greater responsibilities, I would suggest, on governments in this country, be they federal or state, than to ensure that all Australians have access to health care and particularly hospital care. It is a pity that the minister who has the responsibility in this chamber is not participating in today's debate. I noticed, however, that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) stated that his government has a commitment to ensuring that no Australian 
 will suffer as a result of the current impasse between the states and the Commonwealth on renegotiating the Medicare agreements.
All Australians will note that commitment. This parliament certainly notes that commitment. The test will be whether or not it is delivered. I submit that, on the government's performance so far, in the two years it has been in office, it is unlikely to meet it. I fear that Australians will have reduced access to public health services.
The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has outlined details of the offer that has been made to the states with respect to renegotiating the Medicare agreements. I will come to the figures that have been cited by the minister in a moment. If what Minister Wooldridge was saying, if what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was saying and if what the Leader of the Government in the Senate was saying today was correct, why is it that all the state premiers in this country do not believe the minister for health or the Prime Minister or Senator Hill? Why is it that every single premier and every single state health minister in this country is telling the government that, firstly, its offer does not represent a real increase in health funding when one considers the amounts that have been taken out of the health budget in the last two years by this government and, secondly, it falls way below the amount that is required for the states to deliver an effective public hospital system?
As we know, the states have the responsibility to provide the hospitals, the staff and the infrastructure of public hospitals in this country. But, at the end of the day, the financing of that largely comes from the Commonwealth. Despite all the arguments about cost shifting—when we were in government we were aware of those issues as well—we have a situation where this government has come up short by billions of dollars in respect of what is needed in the public hospital system.
Time is running out. This matter has been on the negotiating table now between the federal minister, Minister Wooldridge, each of the state health ministers and the health ministers of the two territories for well over a year. There is still no agreement across the 
 board. The only agreement that has occurred is with the ACT and it occurred not long before the recent election in the ACT assembly. But each of the state ministers and now the premiers—because this matter was referred to the Premiers Conference last Friday—has told the government that its offer is just insufficient.
Why are they saying that? The current offer from the Commonwealth is of the order of $2.9 billion over five years, but much of what is being offered to the states in that respect is simply a return of money that was slashed out of the health budget by this government in its last two budgets. For instance, $750 million, or 25 per cent, of that amount is for veterans' hospital care. All that is is a transfer of the responsibility. There is no actual increase in funding through Medicare to the states or the territories. It is a shift from the Commonwealth to the states for that responsibility.
Furthermore, $479 million of the Commonwealth offer is already existing money that is in the estimates for palliative care and mental health care. It is not new money. It is not an increase in money over and above what has already been budgeted for.
When you put that beside the fact that this government in its first two budgets took $800 million out of the funding for public hospitals and saved a further $400 million by the abolition of the dental health program which was, of course, available for the most needy, particularly the aged and health cardholders, then a large proportion—almost all—of this supposed generous offer that the government says it is making is the return of money that was already in the system at the time they came into government. That is why the premiers are complaining. That is why Richard Court says that this is a dud deal.
I notice that Senator Eggleston is in the chamber; I would be interested to hear his remarks because the Premier of his own state says that this is a dud, and Senator Lightfoot has actually agreed with that. Jeff Kennett has, of course, attacked the proposal of the government and he, along with all the other premiers, walked out of the Premiers Conference last Friday—an action that the Prime Minister described as kindergarten tactics but 
 which, in reality, was the demonstration of absolute frustration that the states have had with this government because of the amount of time that has been spent on negotiating this agreement and the failure of this government to come up with a responsible offer.
The Leader of the Government referred to the private health insurance incentive scheme which they put into place to try to increase private health insurance coverage. As my colleague Senator Bishop interjected, it has not done that. So far, $650-odd million has been outlaid and a projected $1.7 billion over three years is to be paid as a rebate to encourage people to take out private health insurance. That is what this government has put on the table; that is what it is implementing.
But the level of private health insurance has dropped. It has dropped down now to its lowest level ever of about 31.6 per cent. People are not taking out private health insurance. People are leaving private health insurance. They are doing it because they recognise that, at the moment, given the huge gap that they usually have to pay for medical services in a hospital, it is not worth their while. That is the reality of it. That is why there is a growing crisis in public hospitals and waiting lists in this country.
New South Wales was in a position about a year and a half ago where it had its waiting lists down to some of their lowest levels ever, to manageable levels, after the Carr government came into office. But that problem has now increased again directly as a result of the blow-out in terms of people wanting access to public hospitals and the failure of this government to provide adequate funding.
So there is no doubt that this is a matter of urgency. This is an issue about which all Australians, all state governments and the Northern Territory government are saying to this government, `You have to get off your ideological horse; get down and understand that there is a need for a significant increase in the offer to the states to fund the public hospital systems.' Stop trying to fudge the figures; stop trying to pretend that you are actually increasing the amount available when in fact you are not, when all you are doing is returning back into the equation money that 
 you took out over the first two years.	If you have any commitment to Medicare—and I doubt it, but if you have any—as your Prime Minister said at the last election, then you will listen to your own party colleagues in those states and to the New South Wales Premier; you will sit down and renegotiate this and come up with a better offer than is on the table at the moment.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1998-03-25,"—The whole issue of the need for extra funding for the public hospital system relates to the current situation of overcrowding in our public hospitals. I think we really have to ask: who is responsible for that overcrowding in our public hospitals? The answer is very clear: the previous ALP government.
With the introduction of Medicare, Australia's private health insurance system has all but collapsed. In June 1982, 68 per cent of Australians had private health insurance. If one compares this with December 1997, one will see that the figure was only 32 per cent, and it is now down to just over 31 per cent. Over the past 15 years, private health insurance membership has declined by around 30 per cent. The greatest decline occurred during the years of the Hawke and Keating governments—
—And under Carmen Lawrence.
—And under Carmen Lawrence, sadly, a Western Australian, let me say. That is when the great move to public hospitals occurred, resulting in the current situation where we have overcrowded public hospital outpatient departments and enormous waiting lists in public hospitals, something we never used to see in Australia. But we now have waiting lists of 18 months for hip surgery and two years for many other things like cataracts. That is a legacy of the Labor government.
Today, Australia's private hospital system treats about 30 per cent of Australia's patients, which means that something like 70 per cent now use the public hospital system. As I said, that explains why we have overcrowded public hospitals while the private hospital resources alongside them are 
 underutilised. I have to say that that is a disgrace and a very poor use of existing resources in this community.
Another impact of the drop in private health insurance is going to be on the concept of community rating. Community rating is the unique feature of the Australian private health insurance system and has meant that Australian health insurance companies have operated as mutual funds rather than discriminating against people in premium terms on the basis of their medical history, as is the case in the United States.
What the decline in private health insurance membership and the increase in public hospital utilisation mean is that the concept of community rating is now under great risk. Australians face a situation where health funds will become like the American model. It will no longer be possible for us all to pay the same premium and get covered for whatever is wrong with us. Instead, we will have to pay loaded premiums according to our histories and perhaps some people will be declined private health insurance because of their medical history, as happens in the United States. The blame for the overcrowding and the funding crisis in Australia's public hospitals rests entirely with the ALP.
I turn to the federal government's offer to the states. In the last five years the Commonwealth-state health care agreements have been worth $27.3 billion. The present total offer over and above forward estimates is of an additional $2.5 billion, which is very generous. Within this total, the government is offering $1.5 billion in base funding increased over the next five years; $750 million for veterans' affairs patients; $500 million for efficiency and effectiveness in hospitals, particularly in the area of information technology; and $120 million to address the long waiting lists which, as I have said, are a legacy of the previous government's policies. This is a 6.9 per cent real increase in the first year of funding moving to a 15.4 per cent real increase over the five years of the agreement.
One of the major aims of the new agreement is increased flexibility in the provision of health services. Funding will be able to follow the patient so that care can be provid 
 ed in the most appropriate setting. This will lead to better results for patients because they will be receiving the right treatment in the right place. The Commonwealth is also offering funding of $500 million for projects to improve the health care system in general, particularly integrating care across all sectors. Continued funding of around $500 million will also be offered for mental health care reform and palliative care service delivery. Funding of almost $700 million will be offered to reward quality service providers, all on top, as I have said, of the additional $120 million which is being offered to reduce those long waiting lists which are a result of Labor policies in public hospitals.
Let us look at the achievements of the coalition government versus the failures of the ALP government in the health area. First of all, the Howard government is committed to retaining Medicare. We have increased funding by $2.9 billion in real terms and offered to increase it in this next agreement. We are addressing the shortfalls in private health insurance and cutting waiting lists. By contrast, private health insurance dramatically dropped under Labor.
Australians should realise that, when it comes to health policy, one thing is clear: Kim Beazley wants to abolish the private health insurance rebate which gives families $450 a year to encourage them to go back into private health insurance. Labor will abolish that rebate. I remind the Senate that Labor had 13 years to fix Australia's public hospital system and failed to do so. Why should Australians believe anything the ALP has to say about health when they presided over the biggest fall in private health insurance and caused the current problems? (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Health Funding</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1,speech
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-25,"—I must say it is really a bit much to hear members of the government bemoaning what might happen to the private health insurance rebate when we see what this government is doing to the public health system in Australia and when we see that this very expensive gamble, a gamble that has cost Australians $1.7 billion for a rescue package for large featherbedded health insurance 
 companies, has been an absolute and utter failure.
You might recall that there was a debate at the time that this budget initiative for private health insurance was first announced. Initially, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) assured us that this initiative, the private health insurance rebate, would not only stem the flow in private health insurance but also bring people back to the fold in that more people would be insured with private health insurance. It did not take very long. I think it was a matter of a week when the minister started back-pedalling and saying, `No. I never actually said that people would take up insurance again. What I said was that fewer people would leave health insurance and that in fact the number of people who were in private health insurance would remain steady.'
But that really has not happened, has it? Not only has the flight from private health insurance continued but in fact it has accelerated. So as a country we have been spending $1.7 billion over four years to achieve absolutely zero. If this government thinks that that is good value for money, then I really believe that this government should think again. I do not believe that most of the community thinks that spending $1.7 billion on achieving nothing is very good value for money. But that is not where this government's incompetence ends, but I suppose that is what the debate is about this afternoon.
This Prime Minister, John Howard, and the minister for health have been incapable, through their lack of leadership, of concluding a Medicare agreement with the states. You would have thought that reaching agreement about what is a reasonable amount of money to fund our public hospitals would not be so extraordinarily difficult. You would have thought that someone like Mr John Howard, with his experience in government and the many years that he was able to practise negotiation when he was in opposition, would have some idea of how to make an agreement about what sort of money should be spent on our public hospitals. But last weekend, after an incredibly short period—90 minutes, in 
 fact—the premiers walked out of their meeting with John Howard.
—Order! Senator Neal, use his correct title please.
—Mr Howard.
—The Prime Minister.
—Our esteemed Prime Minister. It is very difficult.
—It really sticks in the craw.
—It really sticks in the craw. You are quite right. You would think that the difficulty might stem from some sort of ideological difference, that in fact the premiers were opposed to concluding the agreement with Mr Howard, our Prime Minister—
—Our esteemed Prime Minister.
—I do not know whether I would go quite that far—because they are of a different ideological bent, because they were members of the Labor Party; but that is not the case. In every state, except New South Wales, there is either a Liberal or a coalition government in power. Even his party brethren and colleagues would not put up with the sort of shenanigans that Mr Howard has been involved in. They will not accept that the amount of money being provided by this government is sufficient to run a reasonable public health system.
In fact, the premiers, no matter what party they belong to, are in agreement about one thing in relation to the Medicare agreement; that is, to run a reasonable and adequate public health system they require an additional $5.5 billion over five years. That is not a small amount of money. The premiers, as a group, had some fairly scathing things to say and expressed a great deal of concern that the level of funding that was being offered by this government would not allow them to properly meet the demands for health treatment within their hospitals. I find a comment made by Mr Kennett—a Liberal premier—quite fascinating. He said:
If you want an illustration of that, particularly those that are elderly will be the first hurt because most of the expenditure on health services goes towards people in the latter days, weeks, months of their lives.
These sentiments were echoed by Mr Carr, Premier of New South Wales, when he said:
People will be hurt, very largely older Australians.
And the Premier of Tasmania, Tony Rundle, said:
The state health systems need an infusion of money. The Australian hospital system is suffering from financial anaemia. It needs an infusion of funds.
You really have to start to believe, where you have a cross-party agreement on funding of health, that maybe the premiers are right and that our Prime Minister and his health minister are wrong. I have noticed that the government is now saying, `There's no problem. We're incapable of concluding an agreement in terms of health funding but we will just forget about all that. Rather than trying to reach a real agreement on a reasonable level of funding for health, we will just send off a cheque. When the agreement expires on 1 June, we'll just put a cheque in the mail and the states can do the best they can with the level of funding that we decide we will provide them with. Whether it is adequate or not, we don't really care.'
What concerns me is the consequences that will flow from a failure to have a Medicare agreement and just to have the funds sent off in the mail. There are a number of very important things that Medicare agreements do to protect the public and to ensure that they are treated fairly and properly in public hospitals. One of the things that the Medicare agreement does is to prevent the states from requiring patients to provide a co-payment when they go into a public hospital. I believe one of the great things about our public hospital system is that, if you are a person in need of treatment, you can go in there and be treated for sometimes quite extensive periods of time and not receive a bill when you leave.
Do you realise, without the signature on a Medicare agreement, that public hospitals are free to require patients to make any contribution that they choose? If you genuinely 
 believe that Mr Kennett, the Victorian Premier, will not feel tempted to say, `Anyone who goes into a public hospital will pay us an extra $100 a day,' or whatever figure he might choose, then I think you do not have the realistic view of Mr Kennett which most of the community have, particularly those who are ill and elderly in the State of Victoria. This Prime Minister is quite happy to see a situation exist where public hospitals in the states may require the sick to contribute when they are being treated in a hospital.
There is another very important provision that, to date, has been contained in the Medicare agreements. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Health Funding</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-03-25,"—Part of the health funding equation that has not received very much attention—and certainly no rigorous scrutiny—is the mismanagement of the vast health budget by the states. Nowhere is this more obvious than in New South Wales. The Commonwealth has made a firm and highly appropriate offer to New South Wales. Under the proposed agreement, New South Wales would get an extra $154.9 million in funding next year. The Commonwealth health minister, Dr Wooldridge, also offered Mr Carr $3.8 million next week if New South Wales agreed to the new agreements. That $3.8 million would have moved 1,425 people off the waiting lists right now; 1,425 people would have had their long and sometimes painful medical conditions attended to. What hypocrisy not to have accepted that.
The offer to New South Wales included a rise of $55.4 million, or 3.76 per cent in base funding, for hospitals to bring it up to the $1.53 billion. Mr Carr was also offered $58.2 million in new funding for veterans health services and $41.3 million to reduce waiting lists, but Mr Carr stomped his feet and said that all this was not enough. In light of the fact that the federal government has stated clearly and on many occasions that the offers are not negotiable, Mr Carr's behaviour can be regarded not only as self-serving, but as selfish and in total disregard of the welfare of the people of New South Wales.
Even with Mr Carr's disregard for the people of New South Wales, the Common 
 wealth government will still be lifting funding for health in New South Wales. Under the 1993-94 to 1997-98 Medicare agreements, funding to all states and territories rose by approximately 5.5 per cent in real terms. In 1997-98, total funding is currently estimated at just under $5 billion, of which New South Wales will receive $1.6 billion. Despite the chorus from Mr Carr and Dr Refshauge that the problems in New South Wales are all due to Commonwealth funding cuts, that represents a real increase of 1.3 per cent. Why don't we hear any of this?
Under the 1993-94 Medicare agreements, funding to New South Wales has increased by about 8.7 per cent. The recent revelation that Mr Carr had managed to get the waiting lists for elective surgery above the 50,000 mark saw him again turn around to the whipping horse of the Commonwealth government, yet again claiming that funds for hospitals had been cut. I wish some electronics company would give a calculator to the New South Wales health minister, Dr Refshauge, and the Premier, Mr Carr, so that they can work out the difference between a rise and a cut. The way it is going, it must be the kindest cut of all—that is all I can say.
The Medicare agreements offer can only be described as generous. It represents a 15 per cent increase in real terms over five years, plus new funds for veterans and to reduce waiting lists. For the first time, the agreement contains an adjustment factor relating to people who may drop out of private health insurance. Are you listening over there? This provides for reimbursement of $83 million a year to the states for any one per cent further reduction in the number of people covered by health insurance.
Senator Forshaw and Senator Neal, who also come from New South Wales, talked about how difficult it is going to be because of problems with private health insurance. We have just fixed it. We have made you an offer of $83 million a year for any one per cent further reduction, and you are still not happy. Dr Refshauge does not seem to be aware of this either. In today's Sydney Morning Herald, he said that the demand on hospitals was caused by falling numbers in private health 
 insurance. He does not seem to realise that he has just been offered $83 million a year to fix that very problem.
The inference is irresistible that the mismanagement of the Carr government is destroying the health system in New South Wales. A clear indication of this is that, according to research released by the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, the New South Wales hospital system is 20 to 30 per cent more expensive per episode than the national average. The available funds are being used on an inefficient and very expensive system which is successfully limiting the services and facilities available to the people of New South Wales, the most populous state. You do not have to be an actuarial genius to see where the health budget blows out.
Mr Carr should examine some of the problems in the health system that his government has caused and which it is therefore incumbent upon him to fix. Trying to pass the blame constantly just does not wash. The list of breakdowns in the health system under Mr Carr is truly frightening. A record number of people are waiting for elective surgery in New South Wales public hospitals. By January this year, the figure had reached 50,778, up from 44,707 in March 1995. More people are waiting longer for surgery. The average waiting time has blown out to 1½ months, from 27 days in 1995. The Carr government has denied any knowledge of an across-the-board 12.5 per cent increase in hospital user charges. Mr Carr has simply blamed this shift on the Director of Health, washed his hands and walked away from it.
The New South Wales health minister, Dr Refshauge, has thrown the Sydney metropolitan health system into such chaos that it hardly bears thinking about. His plan in 1996 was to close a number of established hospitals, including St Vincent's in Darlinghurst, and it was only the outcry of New South Wales residents that saved it. You have to hand it to the Carr government: with its cuts and reductions to the health budget in New South Wales, it has not only hit the patients; it has even hit the people who park in the 
 hospital car parks when they go to visit their relatives.
As a senator for New South Wales, the treatment of people in the state which I represent concerns me greatly. What is most upsetting is that it appears that the Carr government is playing politics. A breakdown of figures for people waiting 12 months or more for elective surgery is a matter of great concern. Of the top six hospitals where the numbers waiting for surgery have risen most, guess what? Four are in areas held by the coalition. I wonder how that happened? The lack of commitment to the health system by the New South Wales Labor government has resulted in the deterioration of services, which is affecting the lives of many people. While Mr Carr and Dr Refshauge indulge in the politics of blame, the system will continue to fall apart.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Health Funding</title>,Matters of Urgency,19,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-03-25,"—I am very pleased to see we have cross-party, all party, support for this motion today. However, I am not pleased with the direction of the debate. Indeed, I think we have heard, particularly from this side, a very good reason why we should listen to the Productivity Commission and have an inquiry into Australia's health system.
Can I take issue with a couple of things, particularly with what Senator Eggleston has said. Senator, on the one hand you claim this government is very keen on Medicare, it supports Medicare and it is a system that you believe in, but on the other hand you are saying we want people to go off into private health insurance. Basically, the inconsistency of that is: Medicare is a universal system and private health insurance is an option that people may like to take if they want a choice of doctor, or they want immediate treatment—in other words, to bypass the waiting lists—and they want a private room. It should not be seen as a core part of the health system.
People have left private health insurance in droves. They have voted with their feet. They do not think it is a good idea. But what does this government do? It puts $1.7 billion back into private health insurance. Ninety per cent of that money at least went to people who 
 already have insurance. It did not encourage any new members. That money stuck to the private health insurance system. It will not find its way out into the public health system.
Imagine what our public hospitals would be like today if when you came into office you put $1.7 billion extra into the public hospitals, into the dental health programs and actually had a real universal system in this country, which is what people want. They want a system where we all pay on the basis of how much we earn—that goes in through the tax system to Medicare—and then we use it on the basis of our need, we know that there is a good public hospital and we do not have to check again to see how much a person earns when they turn up at the public hospital: we are treated on the basis of need.
I do have to take issue, too, with Senator Hill and I think with Senator Coonan when they talk about this new process of linking the Medicare agreement to a drop in private health insurance. That was done in 1992 and I moved those amendments. The problem is that the government chose not to then make up the money. That trigger has been there and it has triggered two reviews—in 1995 and 1996. I want to see when we get to the legislation in 1998 that it is actually tied in so that drops in private health insurance, if there are further drops, will actually get some money into the system—that it is not just going to be a system where there is a trigger, there is a review and then virtually nothing happens.
Minister Newman, the past government took no notice. Senator Hill has now left the chamber, unfortunately. We are going to make sure that, when that agreement appears before the Senate, that trigger is actually going to mean something this time and it is not going to mean just more buck-passing and more words, which is really all we have had today.

"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1998-03-25,"—On behalf of Senator Calvert and the 
 Joint Committee on Public Works, I present the following reports: the 61st General Report and and the first report of 1998 on the HMAS Albatross  Stage 1 Redevelopment, Nowra, NSW.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the reports.
I seek leave to incorporate Senator Calvert's tabling statement in Hansard
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
SIXTY-FIRST GENERAL REPORT
Madam President, the first of the two reports which I have tabled is the committee's sixty-first General Report, covering the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997.
During the year, the committee tabled 13 reports on public works estimated to cost more than $761 million dollars.
Public works examined by the committee ranged from extensions to the International Terminal at Sydney Airport to the further development of facilities at HMAS Stirling  in Western Australia.
Two other proposals examined demonstrate the Commonwealth's commitment to the preservation and display of our maritime and film and sound heritage.
I am speaking of course about the extensions to the National Film and Sound Archive and the National Maritime Museum. Together, these will cost the Commonwealth more than $34 million dollars.
Last year saw the finalisation of a protracted examination of the proposed decontamination of land occupied by the former Albion explosives factory in Melbourne. The proposed decontamination was first examined by the previous committee, chaired by the Honourable Member for Throsby, Mr Hollis.
When initially referred to the committee in 1994, the Department of Defence estimated that the decontamination would cost more than $57 million dollars. The final decontamination project examined by the committee last year involved considerably less expense to the Commonwealth. I am told that the Parliament and all Australian taxpayers have the committee, especially the former chairman, to thank for saving the Commonwealth more than $30 million dollars. It was largely due to the persistence of the Honourable Member for Throsby that the Department of Defence felt compelled to come back to the committee with a proposal which resulted in substantially less cost to the Commonwealth. 

The General Report canvasses a number of other matters raised in the committee's reports during the year, details medium works proposals submitted by Departments, Commonwealth fire safety policy and proposed amendments to the Public Works Committee Act.
Of particular and long standing concern is the restriction on the ability of the committee to undertake inspections and to hold discussions on public works proposals overseas. This has been raised in previous general reports and I raise it again now because of the imminent referral of the Berlin Chancery.
As part of its responsibilities the committee is required to examine public works constructed outside Australia and the external Territories as referred. Such works include embassies and accommodation for Australian embassy staff.
The Act, however, stipulates that the committee has no power to conduct formal investigations outside Australia and must rely on plans, models and evidence taken at public hearings in Australia, although statements may be received from persons who are in or outside Australia.
The committee considers the restriction on its activities to be a serious impediment to its ability to undertake effective scrutiny of overseas works as part of its investigatory functions.
Since 1991, the committee has expressed concern about its inability to inspect locations and sites of proposed overseas facilities and to have informal discussions with local staff and authorities. In many cases, local embassy staff and design and construction personnel have been required to travel to Canberra to appear at the committee's public hearings.
The committee has consistently suggested that it may be more cost effective for a sectional committee to be permitted to travel to countries where new projects are proposed and this concern has been expressed in letters from successive committee Chairmen to the appropriate Minister.
The year under review saw the resignation from the committee of the former Chairman—the Honourable Member for Wakefield upon his elevation to the position of Chief Government Whip. I have to say that the Honourable Member served the Parliament through the committee with dedication and distinction and upheld the long tradition of bipartisanship which has been the hallmark of committee's operations.
I would like to place on the record the committee's appreciation for this. 

HMAS ALBATROSS  STAGE 1 REDEVELOPMENT, NOWRA, NSW
The second report which I have tabled concerns the proposed HMAS Albatross  Stage 1 redevelopment, Nowra, NSW.
Let me begin by noting that the Public Works Committee has been involved in the development of HMAS Albatross  over three decades, and since the Second World War, has approved works costing $112.4 million (at 1997 prices).
The proposal for Stage 1 of the redevelopment of HMAS Albatross  was aimed to provide modern, functional facilities that will improve operational reliability and organisational functionality.
The proposal involves the provision of:
.	 maintenance and storage hangars for Seasprite and Seahawk helicopters;
.	 shelters for fixed-wing fleet and support aircraft;
.	 air traffic control facilities;
.	 explosive ordnance storage facilities;
.	 replacement of airfield lighting;
.	 a new photographic centre;
.	 a training complex; and
.	 engineering services and civil works.
When referred to the committee, the estimated out turn cost of the proposed work was $69.3 million.
The committee concluded that Seahawk and Seasprite helicopters represent substantial capital equipment investments for the Defence Force and are planned to remain in service for the next decade or longer.
The proposed new facilities will therefore provide substantially improved maintenance and storage facilities for these valuable assets and will make substantial contributions towards ensuring that the life of type of both helicopter models is maximised.
The committee agreed that the proposed new air traffic control facility and its location will overcome problems affecting the existing tower and provide improved visibility of aircraft operating areas and approaches to the airfield.
The existing airfield lighting system, which is costly to operate and inefficient will be replaced with a modern system as proposed, and improved flight line shelters for six Skyhawk aircraft will provide environmental protection.
The committee considered buildings currently used for the storage and handling of explosives to be substandard, restricting the ability of HMAS Albatross  to support operations and training activities. These buildings will be replaced with the proposed explosive ordnance storage and handling facilities which will provide enhanced capabilities 
 and reflect current NATO storage and handling standards.
The committee also concluded that facilities used for the training of aviation aircrew, technical and flight deck personnel are currently dispersed, functionally inadequate and have insufficient space to support modern training techniques.
The proposed aviation systems training centre will provide a considerably enhanced capability to support the continuing in-house training requirement of personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of high cost and sophisticated ship-borne helicopters.
Similarly, the new photographic centre will provide an enhanced photographic capability and its location is convenient to a major client.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND THE EXTERNAL TERRITORIES
THE RIGHT TO PROTEST
NOVEMBER 1997


Committee Recommendation
Government Response


1.A permit not be required in order to protest on national land, subject to recommendation 3 dealing with protest structures
The Government supports this recommendation.
2.A broad legislative scheme for non-compulsory prior notification of protests, based on the Queensland  Peaceful Assembly Act 1992 , not be introduced, but instead a cooperative approach to protest management be encouraged by:
The Government supports this recommendation.
 a)identifying in a community liaison section of the Australian Federal Police a contact officer for the coordination of protests on national land who would provide a contact and information point for protest organisers and who would be responsible for liaising with other relevant authorities when a protest is planned for national land: and
(a) The Australian Federal Police have indicated that the ACT Region Planning Team could be the coordination point.
b)producing and making available a public information booklet on protesting in the national capital which would encourage prior notification of protests to a protest coordination officer of the Australian Federal Police and which would provide relevant information and advice on the conduct of protests in the national capital, focussing on national land.
(b) The National Capital Authority will have carriage of the production of the public information booklet.
3.A permit system be introduced for the management of protest structures on national land so that a permit is required from the National Capital Authority for a structure placed on national land as part of or in association with a protest but a permit not be required where the structure:
a)is of a size which would have minimal impact on the land and is used to facilitate the protest, such as sound systems and small stages: and
b)is erected and removed on the same day during daylight hours.
The Government supports this recommendation with the additional proviso that the permit system include vehicles and machinery as well as structures. It is also noted that the  Guidelines for Protests, Demonstrations and Public Assemblies within the Parliamentary Precincts  issued by the Presiding Officers cover the use of sound equipment in the Parliamentary Precincts.
Proposed amendments to the  Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988  will facilitate the permit system.
4.Relevant legislative amendments be introduced to recognise protests as an appropriate use of national land and to enable the National Capital Authority to issue permits for the erection of protest structures.
The Government supports this recommendation. Relevant amendments will be considered as part of the review of legislation recommended by the Committee.
5.The term ""structure"" be defined broadly to ensure that the myriad fixtures, edifices, constructions, vehicles, machinery and fixed display materials which could be used in association with a protests, including tents used for camping, come within the terms of the permit system.
The Government supports a broad definition of structure, provided it is not inconsistent with other legislation e.g. planning or traffic laws. In supporting this recommendation the Government does not wish to imply that camping would normally be permissible.
 6.In determining an application for a permit to erect a protest structure on national land, including the duration of a permit, the National Capital Authority be required to give due consideration to:
a)the public's right to peaceful assembly on national land:
b)issues regarding equality of access to national land:
c)public interest considerations which may require certain limitations to be placed on the erection of structures, including public order, public health and safety, national security, the rights of other persons, and the proper functioning of the Parliament and other national institutions, including their ceremonial functions; and
d)any specific requirements relating to the parliamentary precincts as determined by the Parliament's Presiding Officers, including existing requirements set down in their guidelines for protests in the parliamentary precincts.
The Government supports this recommendation, but would further add that the National Capital Authority, when determining an application to erect a protest structure on national land, give consideration to:
the requirements of  the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1972   and other legislation which relates, among other matters, to Australia's obligations under Article 22 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to prevent any disturbance;
heritage values of any Register of the National Estate place affected, in line with s30 of the  Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 ; and
human rights referred to in the  Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986
7.Guidelines on the erection of protest structures on national land covering issues such as location, duration and public health and safety considerations, be developed by the National Capital Authority and be included in the information booklet proposed at recommendation 2.
The Government supports this recommendation
8.On the basis of advice from the National Capital Authority or the Presiding Officers in relation to the Parliamentary Precincts, the Australian Federal Police be empowered to remove any protest structure on national land for which a permit is required under the system proposed at recommendation 3 but for which a permit has not been issued.
The Government supports the principle that the Australian Federal Police be empowered to remove any protest structures on national land for which a permit is required, but has not been obtained. However the legislation for the permit system should provide for them to act of their own motion, to remove a structure which has been illegally erected.
9.The  Unlawful Assemblies Ordinance 1937  be repealed.
The Government supports this recommendation.
 10.The Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, in consultation with the Australian Capital Territory Attorney-General's Department, review the existing laws which apply to protests on national land to ensure that they are written in plain English and define clearly the powers which are available to relevant authorities in dealing with protests.
The Government supports a review of the legislation and will consult with the ACT Government in determining the best approach.
11.Building on the memorandum of understanding established between the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service, clearly documented procedures for coordination of protests be developed between all relevant authorities involved with the management of protests on national land.
The Government supports this recommendation. The Presiding Officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives have pointed out that the Parliament already has clear procedures in place in relation to the coordination and management of demonstrations in the Parliamentary Precincts. In addition agreed guidelines are being developed between the Minister for the National Capital Authority and the Presiding Officers to ensure consistency of approach in dealing with protest activity in the precincts and in those areas in the Parliamentary Zone adjacent to the Precincts.
An Addendum by Mr Steve Dargavel, MP, makes the statement that the report does not recommend the removal of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, and that the National Capital Authority should not interpret the recommendations of the committee as encouraging the removal of the Tent Embassy.
The Government notes this addendum. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>National Capital and External Territories Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-03-25,"—I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the Prime Minister's recent visit to the Northern Territory. John Howard commenced his visit with a very successful day in Darwin on 26 February. He visited the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. He viewed the East Arm Port Development, which will be a vital part of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway link, with Chief Minister, Shane Stone, and the Northern Territory transport minister, Barry Coulter. He also attended a dinner for 350, hosted by my colleague the federal member for the Northern Territory, the Hon. Nick Dondas.
He then had the honour on Friday, 27 February of visiting several communities in 
 Arnhem Land at the invitation of Mr Gatjil Djerrkura, the Chairman of ATSIC. The Prime Minister visited Galiwinku, Marthakal and Dhambala on Elcho Island and Nhulunbuy and Yirrkala on the Gove Peninsula. At Galiwinku the Prime Minister was briefed on a $1.8 million joint army/ATSIC project. This project involves the building of 10 new homes plus the upgrading of existing power and water supplies. It is expected the project will prove as successful as a similar one at Bulla near the township of Timber Creek where army personnel are a very good example of the different sections of the Australian community establishing personal connections with Aborigines and working on a deeper understanding of each other's culture.
The Prime Minister was similarly accorded the opportunity of enhancing his own understanding of Aboriginal culture at Dhambala on Elcho Island where he, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator John Herron, my colleague Nick Dondas and I were given the very great honour and privilege of participating in a secret men's ceremony with Garrawurra elders. I understand the honour and accept the trust placed in us by the Garrawurra men and realise that it is a privilege extended to very few white Australians. Let me say that the importance and significance of the ceremony and its symbolism and insignia used was not unlike that of a freemason's lodge. The Prime Minister was obviously moved by the ceremony and shortly after said:
I deeply appreciated the honour that was paid to me and I certainly gained from that ceremony an understanding of how much that ritual and that culture and those thousands of years of practice and history mean to the indigenous community.
After visiting another public function with hundreds of elders, women and children from Galiwinku, the Prime Minister and our party left for the town of Nhulunbuy where his first duties were at the Miwatj Aboriginal health centre. It was here that the Prime Minister announced a $4.8 million innovative health package to help combat trachoma in Aboriginal communities.
After addressing a business leaders luncheon celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Nabalco bauxite mine, the Prime Minister 
 visited the home of his host, Gatjil Djerrkura, at the lovely community of Yirrkala. A traditional ceremony of welcome by members of the Djapu clan in full ceremonial dress saw the Prime Minister escorted to the Yirrkala arts centre. This was a spectacular and impressive display particularly by many spear wielding men, women and children singing and dancing in a moving ceremony.
At the Yirrkala arts centre details of sacred Aboriginal paintings were explained to the Prime Minister and he was presented with a special bark painting of cultural significance. We also on that occasion met with senior traditional leaders for another private meeting on important cultural values.
The visit by Mr Howard highlighted for me the fact that there are so many aspects to Aboriginal life and culture that are not given the important publicity they deserve. Some life or death issues, particularly when talking about the maintenance of a culture, deserve much more consideration. A common thread running through the discussions on the day was the need for Aboriginal culture to cross generations, in fact for traditional culture to be handed down from generation to generation and not lost forever.
We must ask the question: are the views of Aboriginal people in the far-flung settlements of outback Australia being listened to, canvassed and voiced by some of the radical Aboriginal leaders that we have in Australia today? I am not convinced that they are. Too many Aboriginal spokesmen in the non-ceremonial or traditional areas have lost the focus and lost the plot.
In my electorate, the Northern Territory, a vast area of 1.3 million square kilometres, with Aborigines making up 25 per cent of the population—a higher percentage than in any other state or territory—there are hundreds of Aboriginal communities, all with many diverse needs and aspirations. As I have travelled the Territory during the past 25 years of my political career, I have heard many concerned voices, particularly by Aboriginal people, on those isolated communities that follow a number of common themes—themes and issues that are not getting much recognition or voice from the 
 Aboriginal leaders living on the east coast of Australia who seem preoccupied with the concept of land ownership and a continuation of welfare support and government dependency. 
There is very little mention being made of the wonderful art and the ancient living Aboriginal culture that is practised still in so many Aboriginal communities and the need to ensure its protection and survival. I seriously ask: where is the discussion, the action and the acceptance from southern Aboriginal leaders of the many other aspects of Aboriginal life and culture that are so important and many other issues that need to be canvassed at a national level, other than native title or land rights?
Where is the recognition that for many Aboriginal people land rights and native title are not major issues? They know their site and their place in the world with far more spirituality than most of us. A unique and splendid way of life is on the brink of extinction. The major issue for many people in remote communities is the loss of culture, the loss of their traditional way of life, the loss for many of their very being, their sense of identity. The preservation of what is unique about themselves and their lives is what is important to so many of my constituents.
The preservation of the hundreds of Aboriginal languages and dialects spoken around Australia is a first step in helping to maintain this identity. Action is being taken in the Northern Territory schools to ensure the survival of Aboriginal languages, but why is there not more of an outcry elsewhere? Surely language is vital to a culture's survival. Our focus on literacy must allow Aborigines to communicate in the two societies in which they must live.
Aboriginal health and nutrition is deplorable. Why not promote the use of bush tucker before the knowledge is lost and a healthy food source lost with it? Again, in the Territory this has been recognised, but why are Aboriginal leaders in other states not promoting it much more strongly and loudly? Closely related to the skills used to find bush tucker are the skills gained over thousands of years, generations living and learning in the 
 most trying conditions to acquire the unique hunting and tracking abilities needed for survival itself. Action must be taken before these skills are lost totally.
The importance of ceremony to Aboriginal people as a part of their culture must also be recognised and steps taken to ensure that its continuation is enshrined. Aboriginal art is finally getting the recognition it deserves but there are still many challenges to be met in this area, particularly in recognising copyright and preservation issues.
The Reverend Djiniyini Gondara spoke recently to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and made several very important points relating to the native title process and the cultural issues I have described that must be addressed. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the recent speech by Djiniyini Gondara.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Address by Rev. DHINIYINI GONDARA to the RECONCILIATION COUNCIL. 11/3/98
Thank you for your welcome Mr. Chairman.
Today we are talking about the Commonwealth Constitution and looking at how it might be changed in the future. I think the best way I can add to this debate is by speaking about my traditional Law—the Madayin of the Yolnu people of North East Arnhem Land. Then we might be able to see how this can help our discussion.
Before I start, it would be good to say that Yolnu are only one group of Aboriginal Clan/Nations within the Northern Territory. However my knowledge of other Aboriginal Clan/Nations across the country is that we each have very similar foundational principles of law.
To me there are three main elements in any good law and this is how it is with Yolnu traditional law.
These three elements come from the  djalkiri  or the foundational source of our law. These three main elements that must be found in all law are;
1. The law must create  Magaya .  That is, the law must create a state of peace, harmony, and tranquillity, with true justice for all the citizens.
2. The law must be  Dhapirrk   That is, the law must be perfectly consistent with all the different levels of law from the source down to the lowest acts of law.
3. The third element of good law is that it must be  Wana Lupthun .  That is the law must be assented to by the citizens in a ceremony that 
 shows that they are all under the discipline, responsibility and protection of the law.
No law and no constitution would be recognised as real law without these foundational principles being included. This is how it is with Yolnu traditional law—the Madayin. I have learnt this from my traditional law.
I have just used the term—Madayin. Madayin is the terns Yolnu use to talk about our law. So you can understand what I am talking about here, I would like to look at what Madayin means.
But before I do, I would like to point out what Justice Blackburn said in 1971. In his judgement and summing up of the Gove Land Rights case he said that he ""could see that a `rule of lava and not a `rule of marl' operated in Yolnu society.""
The Madayin is based on a rule of law not because Justice Blackburn said so but because it is and we have known that for thousands of years.
Lets look at the Madayin, our traditional law.
Madayin  is the name for a complete system of law for the Yolnu (Aboriginal people) of North East Arnhem Land.
It embodies the rights of the owners of the law, or citizens, (rom-watanu walal ) who have the rights and responsibilities for this particular embodiment of law.
This Madayin  includes: all the peoples' law (rom ), the instruments and objects that encode and symbolise the law (Madayin girri ), oral dictates, names and song cycles and the holy, restricted places (dhuyu nungat wana ) that are used in the maintenance, education and development of law.
This law covers the ownership of land and waters, the resources on or within these lands and waters, it regulates and controls; production and trade, the moral, social and religious law including laws for the conservation of, and the farming of, fauna, flora and aquatic life.
The Yolnu of Worth East Arnhem Land believe that if they live out their life according to the Madayin  it is a right and civilised way to live.
The Madayin creates the state of magaya.  Magaya is a state of peace, free from hostilities, true justice for all.
Some of the political structures which are established by the Madayin are:
Bapurru —is the name given to the paternal estate owning clan/nation—who have ownership of the surface of the land and waters of the estate. This includes all the resources on the land and in the water.
Yirralka —the estate of the Bapurru, which is divided into distinct areas for natural forming. 

Ringitj— an alliance of clan/nations with a common constitutional base (as seen in the Dhulmu-mulka bathi ), song cycles, common army, and common practice of law- this alliance has the sub-surface ownership for their estates of land and water. See ARDS Information Paper No. 5
The political representatives of the clan/nation are called Dalkarra  and Djirrikay .
Narra  is a chamber of law and jurisdiction where the leaders are called together by the clap sticks. Secrecy provisions apply creating a type of parliamentary privilege so that the only information to leave the chamber is the publicly viewed objects that encode the law (like the sacred Dilly Bag). The citizens are outside the chamber or the ceremonial place and the law is taken to them.
Wana Lupthun— after a draft law is discussed and by consensus is agreed to by the representatives in the chamber, the objects (like the Dhulmu-mulka bathi— sacred dilly bag) are brought out for the citizens to assent to. In this Ceremony the objects representing the law are held by the political leader of that clan/nation and he, together with all the people of that clan, go under the water to indicate that they are under the discipline, responsibility and protection of the law. No one is above the law!
The principle-""separation of powers ""—is embodied within the concept of Yothu/Yindi.  For Yolnu this is much more than the name of a rock band. The members of the government are from one clan/nation and are called Yindi.  The public servants, including the police and officers of the court are from separate clan/nations and are called Yothu .
If someone breaks our traditional law, we have a process to deal with this at law. Some people who do not know our traditional law have called this ""payback "", but we know it as bayarra . To Yolnu it means to be reconciled at law.
These sanctions are carried out by our ceremonial leaders, who are the authorised officers, according to the dictates of the law.
Bayarra,  reconciliation at law, then occurs.
""Payback"", or an action of revenge without a due legal process, is against Yolnu traditional law.
So you can see, just as Justice Blackburn did, that Yolnu live under a rule of law not a rule of man. We have had this law, our Madayin , since time immemorial and each generation has tried to maintain the three foundational elements that I mentioned at the start of any speech. It is these three elements that all of us must seek to maintain within our Australian Constitution.
Mr. Chairman I thank you for the opportunity to have addressed this Convention.

"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-03-25,"—The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(a) ABARE's estimate of total farm indebtedness to financial institutions, as at 30 June, in each of the three years are as follows:

1994—$17.13 billion; 1995—$17.98 billion; 1996—$19.02 billion.
(b) ABARE will publish a June 1997 estimate in the next issue of Australian Commodities, to be released 24 March 1998. This estimate will be based on Reserve Bank data which indicates a 6 per cent increase in total bank lending to agriculture, fishing and forestry for the year to June 1997.
(c) Farmers have both borrowings and deposits with financial institutions. Levels of both total farm indebtedness and farm businesses' deposits with financial institutions are recorded in ABARE surveys of farms in the broadacre and dairy sectors of agriculture. The sectors include around 72 per cent of Australian farms. The levels of total farm business debt, farm business liquid assets (mostly bank deposits) and the net borrowings (debt) for the broadacre and dairy sector were:
