"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-12-01,"—Yesterday, I was asked a question by by Senator Robert Ray. I seek leave to incorporate the answer to the question in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
The following answers are provided for Senator Robert Ray following his questions to the Minister for Health and Aged Care which were asked in the Senate on 30 November 1998.
How many patients will no longer seek treatment in public hospitals as a result of the 30 per cent rebate?
It is estimated that the level of health insurance participation will go up by approximately 2.5 per cent. These people will then be able to be treated in private hospitals.
What will be the level of patient transfer from the public to the private system?
It is assumed that the rebate will result in an increase in participation of approximately 2.5 per cent to a level of about 33 per cent. This represents approximately 500,000 more people with private cover who will then have the choice to use the private system. For every one of these 500,000 people who do not take out health cover, 322,000 more bed days would be required in the public sector. It would take 3,300 extra hospital beds to 
 accommodate them. That's about 6 more extra public hospitals
What percentage of total government expenditure on health is the rebate expected to be?
In percentage terms the rebate will be about 4 per cent of total Commonwealth health expenditure.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Private Health Insurance: Rebate</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-12-01,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee for inquiry and report by 1 June 1999:
(a)	 the development and implementation of the tendering process followed in the establishment of the privatised Job Network in 1998 and options to improve the process in future tender rounds;
(b)	 the effectiveness of the Flex 3 component of the Job Network in providing skills, training and work experience to the long-term unemployed;
(c)	 options to improve the quality and effectiveness of the delivery of employment services to the long-term unemployed, with particular reference to the young, the middle-aged, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, migrants and ex-offenders;
(d)	 the impact on the quality of the delivery of the Job Network services to all unemployed people by the concentration of Flex 3 services in only four organisations and the implications of concentrating these services among four organisations for future Job Network tenders;
(e)	 the effectiveness of the Job Network in delivering services to regional Australia and other areas of disadvantage and options to improve service delivery in these areas in future tender rounds;
(f)	 the impact on unemployment numbers in both job poor areas and job rich areas of the Government's performance-based strategy; and
(g)	 the effectiveness of the current regulation of the new competitive employment services market, to ensure fairness and quality and options to improve the regulation of the employment services market with the introduction of a new tender round.
This motion essentially seeks to refer aspects of the government's employment services market arrangements to the committee, as outlined in the Notice Paper  today.
The question of the government's employment services market has had a rather chequered career in this place. Senators will recall that when Senator Vanstone was the minister she introduced legislation into the Senate seeking support for the arrangements the government proposed to put into place to replace the CES with its employment services market arrangements. Indeed, that legislation was the subject of an inquiry by this 
 committee's predecessor—the legislation committee, not the references committee.
Following that inquiry, there was a report from the majority government members and a report from the opposition minority members of the committee. Arising from those proceedings, the opposition and the Democrats moved certain amendments in this place to the government's legislation. Upon considering that matter and agreement to, I think, one of those amendments, Senator Vanstone announced that the government would not proceed with the passage of its legislation to underpin the establishment of the new employment services market arrangements but would proceed by administrative action, and proceeded to put into place the arrangements which have caused so much controversy, so much consternation, so much angst and so much disadvantage to the unemployed in the Australian community.
I remind the Senate that one important aspect of the measures put in place was the restriction of the available services—as paid for by the Commonwealth through these new arrangements—to those of the unemployed who are entitled to benefits under the relevant social security act.
So there was a set of arrangements which the government initially sought to put in place by legislative action. When the government could not get precisely the form of legislation that it desired, it told this Senate, the parliament and the Australian people, `We can achieve exactly what we want by putting in place, purely by administrative action, an arrangement relying upon existing laws of the parliament. No other correspondence will be entered into so far as legislative change is concerned.'
It is well known that the arrangements the former minister Senator Vanstone put in place—before she was demoted and her place taken by Dr Kemp of the House of Representatives—have failed. Not only have they failed, they have failed miserably, to the extent that there have been a number of attempts, particularly by Dr Kemp, to patch up the arrangements which are now in place to try and deal with the haemorrhaging of this system, a system which is a matter of public 
 policy. Its failure is so notable, so notorious, that the government has tried on two occasions to rectify what it has done.
Apparently, from what I understand to have been comments by the minister in the other place yesterday, further changes will need to be made to the employment service market area, but they will require legislative change. So, in some way at least, this matter will come back to the Senate at some stage—next year, I suspect. To replace the CES, we have had a marketplace put in place by this government—they have spent in the vicinity of $1.7 billion, I think, of Commonwealth funds—which is a total failure and which has been the subject of notable attempts to rectify it. Again, these have been total failures.
We now see a proposal by the opposition to inquire into the deficiencies of the system. Bear in mind that this, as I indicated, is a very large area of government expenditure. The government's position, as I am advised, is that they oppose the reference of this matter to a committee. Indeed, what they are telling other members of the committee is that they have the numbers to defeat this matter. I will be very interested to see whether that means they have Senator Colston's vote to effectively negate this motion in a tie or whether they claim also to have Senator Harradine's vote. We shall see. It would be very interesting if the government were to succeed in thwarting this request for a Senate references inquiry.
May I say I have heard a number of reasons put by the government as to why we should not proceed at this stage. One of the reasons was that there had been an inquiry into unemployment, that that inquiry had touched upon the question of the employment services market and some questions had been asked. The terms of reference in this proposal, as proposed in my motion, will go far beyond any of the terms of reference which were before the committee which was conducting its work prior to the last election. More importantly, we are looking at a system which has been the subject of constant change and comment, even following the commencement of that inquiry and the conclusion of hearings prior to the last election. We have also heard 
 comments, as I indicated yesterday, which talk of further change.
This, as I said, is an area where an extraordinary amount of public money is being expended and—arguably—wasted. I think the question has to be asked: given that there are many questions which committees of this Senate inquire into, why is the government not prepared to agree that there be an inquiry into what is essentially one of the most critical aspects of public policy affecting a very large number of Australians who are unemployed or may become unemployed in the future and which has been put in place not by legislative action but by the administrative decision of this government?
I think the only matter that would come to the public's mind when they thought of that was that the government was trying to hide the mistakes that it had made, the total shambles it created in the creation of this new employment services market; that it would be trying to hide some of the contractual arrangements it had entered into and that it would purport to hide behind so-called commercial-in-confidence arrangements which had been entered into on its behalf by the agency. Nevertheless, let me say we are persisting with the motion today on the basis that we think that thinking senators will not thwart the work of this place of inquiring into a great disaster implemented not by the Senate, but by this government—in fact, in defiance of this Senate.
Let me remind Senator Harradine of his disgust at the actions of this government when it became clear they could not get their own way on every aspect of the legislative package. They did not pursue the package they put before the Senate: when it was amended, they withdrew it. I remind Senator Harradine that he was extremely critical of the government at that time. I urge Senator Harradine and all non-government senators to support the motion now before the Senate to initiate the inquiry. The timetable allows it to be completed in a period between the end of the so-called GST reference inquiry that this committee will undertake and 30 June. Let me say that if somehow the government succeed in thwarting this proposed inquiry at this 
 stage, the matter will not go away; we will pursue this matter further when the new Senate takes its place after 30 June.
I would have thought it to be pretty clear to the government that the outcome they might secure now will differ then, and it will not differ in terms of what this committee does. I suggest to the government that the appropriate course of action is to agree to this motion, to allow the committee to plan an appropriate way of pursuing this inquiry and of taking into account, as the motion before the Senate allows, any evidence which has been taken by the previous committee, to take any new evidence that is relevant and to bring down a report expeditiously by 30 June. This is a matter which concerns the Australian people and which involves great expenditure of money. This is an area which will be the subject of expenditure into the future.
I call on the government to stop hiding behind their arrangements and allow an inquiry to take place. Perhaps we can assist the government, in a way that we were not allowed to do in relation to the legislation that was before this place, and get at least something good to come out of their shambles of the arrangements for the employment services market. Let me say that there have been other pieces of legislation that this government have brought into this place, for example, the aged care legislation, which have had problems. When we told the government all of the problems that would arise, the government chose to ignore them, used numbers in this place, passed the legislation and then found they had to backtrack. Let's deal with this matter properly. Let's get the inquiry under way, ascertain what the problems are and perhaps we will get them solved in time to help a few people.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,13,1
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-12-01,"—The government will be opposing the proposed inquiry into the Job Network on two basic grounds—one being procedural and the other substantive. The procedural reason for not having an inquiry at this time is that the education committee that would be going to undertake such an inquiry has a number of things in train at the moment. It has a program that will take it through to the 
 end of September next year. Its inquiries include one into Aboriginal education, which is about halfway through; a proposed inquiry into GST aspects of educational services, which will take up a large part of the first part of next year; and the inquiry currently before it into regional employment and unemployment. The terms of reference for that inquiry were put down almost a year ago, and the committee has spent virtually a whole year on it so far and looks like going into another year before it reports.
That inquiry started in 1997 and will report in 1999. Despite Senator O'Brien's assurances, I am not convinced that the inquiry that he is proposing would be in such a narrow time frame as that suggested, given the legislative program next year and given the GST inquiries and Easter. I cannot quite see how you would fit it into such a time frame, particularly given the history of the other inquiry over the past year.
The main procedural reason that it should not proceed at this point is that we are actually currently inquiring into the Job Network. Right around Australia, in all capital cities and in a lot of regional centres, when we undertook inquiries into regional employment and unemployment there was on each occasion—and, as the whole inquiry progressed, even more so—a percentage of time devoted to questions about the Job Network. The reason was that members of the opposition thought that they could have a good bash at the government before the election and could try to highlight issues relating to the Job Network in their local press. This was not a particularly successful strategy, and the Hansard record shows that over that period of time nearly 300 questions were asked by opposition members, in all parts of Australia and to a wide range of witnesses, about the Job Network. We still have not finished that inquiry. We have an inquiry date in a week or two in Canberra, where we will be talking to other groups of people and peak bodies, and then we will report.
One of the problems about how long the whole process has taken is that the Job Network has evolved over that time, and so I am not too sure exactly what we are reporting on. 
 We have actually taken evidence at different points in time as the Job Network system bedded down. So, if we give a historical perspective, some of the problems that people saw in the early part of the inquiry have been fixed by revisions by this government. I suppose that in our next hearing in Canberra we can manage to get an update on the Job Network—where it is up to at that time and what any perceived problems are—and then report in February. I would have thought that that covered the issue of the Job Network to this point in time.
If members of the opposition want to bring the matter back later when the committee has finished its work on Aboriginal education, regional employment and unemployment, and the GST aspects that relate to education—which, as I said, will take us through to September next year—the government would look at it again at that point. But I would suspect that the program we have introduced with the Job Network would have been well and truly bedded down by that time and there would probably not be the need for such an inquiry, particularly as the political imperatives would have disappeared by that point in time.
Senator O'Brien said a number of things about the Job Network, things which I would like to put a government perspective on. He said it was introduced by administrative arrangement and not by legislation. The government did legitimately have the power to do that, although that was not really its preferred course of action. It would have liked to have legislated for it; but, of course, members of the opposition, I would like to make plain, are the ones that prevented that happening. That was the only way that it could be done.
When the system was introduced, it was introduced in place of a failed system known as the CES, the Commonwealth Employment Service, which was not providing properly for the unemployed in this country. Under the old system, about 11 per cent of all jobs were placed through the CES. Most other people made other arrangements for finding employment. The system was set up in a time of low unemployment and it managed to do its job 
 reasonably effectively in times of low unemployment—and I am talking about after it was set up in the late forties, through into the fifties, sixties and early seventies. But it never quite coped with the difficulties created by a larger level of unemployment. So there has been an evolution over the years of governments that have tried with varying degrees of success to grapple with the problem.
Probably the most spectacular failure of the last Labor government was its so-called Working Nation program. Senator O'Brien, in his criticism of Job Network, claimed that the government was wasting money. It is very well documented how much money the last Labor government wasted on Working Nation, where the placement rate was only about one-third. Two-thirds of the people under Working Nation, having gone through various programs at great expense to the taxpayer, ended up back on the unemployment queue, often greatly disillusioned. As a fellow said to us in one of the inquiries, it would have been better to have been left in the gutter than to have been picked up out of it and then dropped back in it again. That was his reaction to it.
We had the situation of churning dole queues, where people were trained but there was no job for them and so they were retrained but there was still no job and so they were retrained again. As a matter of fact, in Wollongong they said they had the best-trained dole queues in the world. It was a program that failed spectacularly, and the Australian people showed their view of that—along with their view of a number of the other failures of the previous Labor government—in 1996, when they threw it out.
A very different approach was needed, and that is what this government has brought in. The community sector has often taken a role in helping the unemployed, sometimes informally and sometimes with government assistance. The business sector—groups like Drake Personnel and others—has always been involved in the employment market and, of course, the government, through the CES, has been involved in the employment market. Under Job Network, this government created a more flexible and more formal arrangement 
 where those various sectors could compete in providing job services.
The broad approach was actually founded on the very sound principle that people who were trying to get people employed were to be funded based on success of placement. The feeling was that this should turn around the rate of success so that it was better than the failed Working Nation program. As the minister at the time, Dr Kemp, said on many occasions, very early on Job Network was outperforming the old CES and had the potential, after some of the teething problems had been solved, to do quite a lot better.
As I mentioned before, the whole system has been bedding down since 1 May this year. It has been in a process of evolution over that time. It has got a particularly bad press, aided and abetted by the ALP, and Senator O'Brien made some rather strange statements today. He talked about `great angst in the community', and `great disaster' was another phrase he used. These things do not become a reality by opposition members constantly saying them. You really have to ask the job providers what their view of it is, and that certainly is not their view at all. The vast majority of them think the system is working quite successfully, and have said so—and in terms of their own operations the vast majority of them are.
A number of providers in the new system had never been in the system before. It is understandable that they would make some commercial mistakes in the way in which they undertook the tendering process, assuming that in the FLEX 1, FLEX 2 and FLEX 3 system they might pick up two of those types of programs and be able to cross-subsidise. Of course, when they picked up only one type, particularly FLEX 1, they did not have that opportunity and a number of them got into some difficulty because of that. We are about to move into the second tendering round, and I think as we move into this process the realities of how this system works will be a lot more apparent to people in business and they will make much wiser judgments this time around in their tendering.
The important thing is that we have a flexible system which has, compared with the 
 old CES, a much wider range of providers and many more locations where people can come and access the service. The very important point that is at the centre of this is that it must work through success of the end product. No matter how much money we put into the support of job services, the key measuring variable at the end of the day is: do people get a job at the end of the process?
The Labor government's approach, despite the enormous amount of money it put into that approach over the years, was demonstrably a failure. This system provides greater flexibility and provides market forces to determine who gets what services, which businesses set up what services and where those services are located. It is a much better opportunity to have a system that is more robust and more successful and, at the end of the day, doing what these work support systems must do, that is, get people through and, finally, place them in a job.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,13,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-01,"—The Democrats will be supporting the motion to refer Job Network to a Senate inquiry for consideration of its operation and design. We have repeatedly called for such a review.
I will tackle a couple of points put forward this afternoon by Senator Tierney on both policy and process grounds. I acknowledge the many terms of reference before Senate committees in this place. I also acknowledge the workload of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee. For those reasons it is sad that the government did not take the initiative and establish an independent and wide-ranging inquiry into the design and operation of Job Network.
On many occasions this government has had the opportunity. In fact, with a new minister in place, a minister specifically responsible for employment services, there was a wonderful opportunity for the government to say, `We acknowledge that there has been a number of faults and flaws in this system.' I do not think anyone in their right mind can deny that there has been confusion and at times administrative chaos in the 
 system and, yes, there will also be examples where it may be working well. It would have been a wonderful opportunity to examine, right across the board, what was going right and what was going wrong for precisely the reason put forward by Senator Tierney: that we are approaching that second tendering round, and let us get it right now. The unemployed in this country, not to mention private providers with a stake in the system and not to mention the government, deserve no less, and that is a system that is functioning well.
Yes, there is a heavy workload on most Senate committees, but this is a matter of urgency. This is a particularly important issue. I am sure many people on the other side of the chamber would join me in suggesting that employment is perhaps one of the most crucial issues—if not the number one issue—facing Australians today. Therefore this government has an incredible responsibility to those Australians—job seekers, Centrelink employees and Job Network providers alike—to get this system functioning well.
Senator Tierney also mentioned the issue of jobs more generally and the role in job creation of making sure that we are not just putting people onto cyclical training schemes or failing to provide job opportunities for Australians. I do not think anyone in this chamber would disagree with that notion, but I suspect that some of us are more conscious than others that we should be looking to create opportunities for employment that are full-time, sustainable, meaningful and ongoing. I have not seen from this government any particular job creation strategies that result in those kinds of job opportunities, not just for young Australians, who I suggest have, in many respects, borne the brunt of structural change in our work force, but right across the board; specifically, the record number of long-term unemployed in our society today. I would like to see some job creation policies coming forward from the government.
I recognise that a plank of theirs is supposedly the Job Network system, so let us get it right. We have an opportunity before the Senate today to get it right. The Democrats understand that this system is not going away. This competitive model has been adopted by 
 the government. I heard in the House yesterday the shadow minister offering bipartisan support, making a plea to get it right. It is not going to change. We are not going to see a radical overhaul of this competitive model. Some of us, the Democrats in particular, are not committed to this competitive model, but we are realistic. It is not going away, so let's get it right. That is why we have called repeatedly for a review of the Job Network. There are some fundamental things that could be done tomorrow to get it right.
There is also a unique opportunity at this stage of its development to call on and consult with some of those key players. I note, unfortunately, that even the new minister with his huge responsibility for employment services has not consulted as widely and as broadly as he should have. I note again with disappointment that I hear Senator Tierney referring to the views of some of the providers. I did not see Senator Tierney, with all due respect, I did not see Dr Kemp, with all due respect, and I did not see the new minister, with all due respect, front up to the National Employment Services Association's meeting of all the private providers who could possibly fit in one room at one time in Melbourne a couple of months ago.
—They didn't invite me.
—I wish they had. Dr Kemp, as I understand, originally accepted the invitation, but the excuse he gave for not turning up was that government was in caretaker mode. Presumably that meant that everything shut down for a couple of weeks while everyone decided their new portfolios—an amazing luxury. Martin Ferguson, the shadow minister, turned up. I was very happy to be there. I think I spoke in Dr Kemp's spot, actually.
—Was he invited?
—He was invited but no-one fronted up. I have made the political point and I have made the procedural point, just to answer the process grounds that Senator Tierney put forward about the role of the committee. Yes, it would have been great if an independent, well resourced committee, at the initiative of the government, not just with bipartisan but with 
 tripartisan support, had been constructed, but that is not happening. This is an urgent issue, so procedurally we must do it in the form of a Senate committee.
Senator Tierney raised some issues on policy grounds. Overwhelmingly, we have seen difficulties in this system since its implementation in May this year. The scheme is not piloted. It is one of the most radical experiments with employment services in the world, if not unprecedented. It was called `a bold gamble' by the government. This gamble has produced widespread confusion as its dividend. Since May this year, my office—and I suggest all offices—with the responsibility of employment and a number of other issues for the Democrats, has been deluged with calls, emails and letters from individuals begging for reform, from job seekers right through to private providers and organisations, some of which have been badly affected, with suggestions as to how it could be improved. The new minister has met with some employment agencies but has not consulted as broadly as he should have. The Democrats have always maintained that Job Network must be subject to a comprehensive and fully inclusive review, and that means everyone. Everyone who is involved in this system must be given an opportunity to point out not just the defects but some of the parts that are working well.
The Democrats will seek to amend the terms of reference put forward by Senator O'Brien. In our amended terms of reference, we would see the inquiry examine all areas of design and operation of the Job Network, from the consequences of delivering employment services on a competitive model to the operation of the job seeker classification instrument. Only in this way do we believe that the problems within the system can be acknowledged, addressed and hopefully fixed by the commencement of the next tender round. I really believe that all the players in this system deserve no less.
Job Network was a bold gamble implemented by government not only in a radical fashion but at a time when agencies like Centrelink were dealing with a number of other so-called bold initiatives—the imple 
 mentation of the common youth allowance, expansion of work for the dole. There have been other stresses and strains on the system—not the least of which have been resources. There have been strains on Centrelink staff when it has come to training and other service provision, not to mention the stresses they are currently experiencing with the threat of 5,000 jobs to be lost by the end of the next financial year.
The Democrats believe, under this competitive model, that Job Network is flawed in its conception, design and indeed in its implementation. Since it was first announced, the Democrats have called for a review just so that we can ensure, if we going to use this system, that we get it right. We believe that the very ideology that underpins this system is wholly inappropriate. I find something quite bizarre in the application of market forces to the provision of employment services for unemployed people. Many of these people have found themselves out of work as a consequence of the very operation of these market services.
We have seen as a consequence of the application of these market forces a fundamentally flawed tendering process. I defy anyone in the chamber to suggest that the tender process was without flaws. I think a flawed process has produced a flawed outcome. Instead of rewarding commitment and proven records of expertise, the government rewarded size and low cost tenders. We saw the closure of long established, dedicated community organisations. This represents an incalculable loss to the community as a whole. The links with local communities and the specialised skill and knowledge which this engendered cannot be replicated by organisations which are new to the area or to the industry altogether.
On 25 August this year, an announcement was made by the minister at the time, Dr David Kemp, who no longer has responsibility for employment. Senator O'Brien referred to his demotion. I am not sure whether it was a demotion or whether it was so that he could focus more on higher education institutions. The notion that he can play full-time with universities, with all due respect, scares me. 
 On 25 August, the minister made an announcement that there should be changes; that there should be an injection of funds into the Job Network. An amount of $55 million was put into the new system and there was a widening of the eligibility criteria.
These are not gestures by a government that is not nervous about the operation of its system. This is not a move by a government that is confident in the lead-up to an election that this system will withstand any criticism. It was clearly a stop-gap pre-election measure designed to stop criticism. In many cases this measure of a widening of the eligibility criteria—long overdue—will increase the strain on agencies. We believe that further reform should have been undertaken at that time and, indeed, now as a matter of urgency.
We have long supported a fully comprehensive investigation into and review of the system. As a result, we would prefer that such a review would analyse all aspects of design and operation, with recommendations coming down in time for inclusion in the 1999 budget, with changes to be implemented at the end of the first contractual term in November 1999.
The changes that the Democrats would seek to make, in the form of our amendments, add in most cases to the terms of reference. We seek to include the competitive model. As I have said, unlike the opposition and the government, the Democrats do not believe we should retain the competitive model of service delivery. We acknowledge that it is most likely to be retained, but it is worth examining some of the concerns of welfare organisations and some providers that the competitive model militates against appropriate service delivery.
We are also keen to examine the issue of fee charging arrangements. I understand that many of these amendments are supported by members of the opposition. The practice of fee charging arrangements continues. We would like to ascertain the extent to which fee charging is occurring and to which it operates as a disincentive to employers to use the Job Network and to create new jobs.
We also want to look at the classes of job seekers. The Democrats would like to broaden 
 the scope of this term to include job seekers with disabilities and those from non-English speaking backgrounds. I understand that is agreeable to Senator O'Brien. Further, we believe that mature age people should be a focus of this inquiry—the mature age unemployed as well as the long-term unemployed.
With reference to the number of organisations, the original tender round actually resulted in the concentration of 66 per cent of the FLEX 3 market in five organisations, with 80 per cent being concentrated in the top 20—another area for examination.
We would also seek to include the examination of the effect of the abolition of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority and look at options for the development of a regulatory process or body to protect consumers, regions and social equity. So we would seek to broaden the terms of reference to include a regional and job seeker oriented focus.
We want to look at some of the guidelines that can be adopted to ensure that all job seekers receive appropriate levels of training to enable them to become work ready. We seek to look at the job seeker classification instrument, which has been criticised for excluding job seekers from assistance which they would have automatically been entitled to under the old system.	Of particular concern are the reports that young people are especially disadvantaged under this new system. And, of course, there is Centrelink: examining the effect of staff and resource cuts, the continued imposition of the efficiency dividend and the anticipated effects of the recently announced Centrelink business plan. These are all crucial issues which not only on policy grounds but also from the process perspective—to use Senator Tierney's terminology—deserve examination as a matter of urgency.
If we had any reason to believe that there were no changes taking place in the area of Job Network that we had further cause to be concerned about, we had only to listen to the comment by the relevant minister, the Minister for Employment Services, Mr Abbott, in the House of Representatives the day before yesterday that the unemployed may be forced to use Job Network or risk 
 losing their income support. I look forward to hearing clarification of that notion in this place because certainly the Australian Democrats found it a contemptible notion. We already acknowledge that unemployed people are subject to quite stringent activity testing arrangements to ensure that they are engaged in some kind of job search activity. If they are currently complying with the criteria by searching through the jobs classifieds or, through their own initiative, investigating work options, why should they be penalised? That was certainly the logical conclusion to be drawn from the minister's comments in the House of Representatives the other day.
We believe that the reason why many of these job seekers and employers at both ends of the spectrum are shunning the new system is that it just simply is not working adequately. So instead of getting angry or penalising people for not utilising the new system, why not examine why they are not using the system in the first place? Again, it is another example by this government of deflecting blame or denying that there may be a crisis in confidence within its own system, that its own system may be flawed in its operation and in its very design. Instead, they say, `Let's move the focus to the unemployed,' and suggest that maybe they should be penalised or treated in some punitive fashion for not using Job Network when they may very well be—and I suspect in most cases—undertaking the necessary investigations for work that they are expected to. It should be remembered that they can get breached under the current criteria and that they are subject to those activity testing arrangements.
Claims by the government, and they have been repeated here today by Senator Tierney, that it is bad publicity are unjustified. The claims that the bad publicity itself is unjustified are extraordinary, because they ignore the very real concerns that have been publicly expressed by a number of groups. This is not just a political point scoring exercise. These concerns have been brought forward by a number of political parties now, but they have also been echoed by those representatives involved in the private provision of employment services—those people who attended 
 that very wide-ranging National Employment Services conference in Melbourne. I cannot say that they were all of one mind. There was a range of groups—welfare organisations, organisations such as Drake Personnel, and new and old private providers—yet they all had some concerns about this system.
So claims that these groups have some kind of axe to grind are completely unfair, because it is in their interest for this system to work well. It is in their interest to ensure that their businesses and their job agencies do not go to the wall—certainly before the end of this year, as has been predicted. We have already seen closures, yet these groups—welfare organisations, unions—have not been able to get a look-in on the minister's so-called current consultations with providers. We believe that the flawed reforms are a result of this lack of consultation and a denial and an unwillingness to recognise that there may be some flaws in the system. The Democrats believe that the government should look first to fixing Job Network rather than placing further burdens on the unemployed.
I seek leave to move the Democrats amendments standing in my name.
Leave granted.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-01,"—I stand to briefly support the referral by Senator O'Brien of matters to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee. There are a number of reasons for this. I am constantly amazed by the fact that representatives of the government will use whatever public statements job providers may or may not have made as an indication of how well they are doing on the issue of job provision.
You only have to look at various aspects of government policy to see what happens when public statements are made by groups which rely on government for funding. For instance, migrant women's groups during the debate on the industrial relations legislation happened to mention that there were problems for migrant women in the changes to industrial relations to deregulate the work force, leaving them without support. What happened to the Australian Youth Policy Alliance when they wanted to engage the government and the public in discussions on youth policy?
Who is going to speak up on these issues? Will private providers speak up? As I said, they may in a closed conference, but when it comes to the public what have they got at stake? I keep thinking of the cartoon, the Wizard of Id. What happens when the peasant says, `The King is a fink'? The King may well be a fink, and the fink might basically suggest that they have policies that are good and would like everyone to continue to say that. But if, as in the Wizard of Id, the peasant says, `The King is a fink,' what happens? The peasant or Sir Rodney find themselves upside down in the torture chamber in shackles. I think that is the image of what we have in this community. It is not valid for the 
 government to ask, `What have these groups said publicly in relation to our policies?' when their very process is to gag or to cut out the tongues—in a theoretical sense—of any groups who dare to speak up.
In Western Australia during the election campaign I am aware that any time there was a forum, whether it was on education, employment, youth or so on, that the coalition representatives who were invited considered to be a `political forum'—and I do not know how this was in other states—they chose not to turn up. There were some that coalition people attended, but in many cases—I attended three or four fora during the election campaign—the coalition representatives chose not to turn up because, they said, it was a political forum. I do not think they wanted to be in a situation where, in public, there were criticisms of government policy and they would be in a situation where they had to respond to them.
It is like the three monkeys: `We can't see, we can't hear and we can't speak about the criticisms of our policy.' That does not make for a strong democracy and it does not make for strong government. It does not allow the government to come into this chamber and say, `Listen, we're not hearing any responses.' They do not want to hear. They are not going to the fora. They were not listening during the election campaign, and they do not want to hear community groups, support groups or lobby groups who have legitimate concerns and who would like to express them. Therefore, I think it is quite proper for the Senate to conduct the inquiry. It is quite proper for the government to have the opportunity to hear from a range of community groups—community providers, private providers, the government sector, unemployed people, and those lobby groups still in existence that have not yet been gagged or destroyed by the government.
It is certainly no way to run the country and no way to run major changes in policy. In the end there will, of course, be ongoing disasters for any government that does not want to hear the truth about the impacts of its policies and does not want to make the changes that are necessary before it is too late.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,13,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1998-12-01,"—In supporting this motion I intend to refer to some of the more recent history about the Job Network debacle, building on the comments of my colleague Senator O'Brien. However, before I do that, I think I should respond to the arguments put forward for the government by Senator Tierney. He dealt with this reference in relation to both procedural and substantive issues. Dealing firstly with the procedural issues: as chair of the new Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Committee—Senator Tierney referred to education, but of course it is much broader than that—I would like to respond to his claims that the current business before the committee would preclude us dealing appropriately with this reference.
With respect to the matters currently before the committee, Senator Tierney referred to the regional employment inquiry, which the committee now plans to conclude before it engages in the GST inquiry. There are two levels of the argument in relation to the regional employment inquiry, but let us just deal with the issue of timing at this stage. Senator Tierney then also mentioned that apart from the GST inquiry there is the indigenous education inquiry, which we plan to continue to conduct up until about September next year.
A general rule of thumb I have been given as a chair of committees—and I expect that after the workplace relations inquiry I am reasonably well-known for a fair degree of stamina; and there was no time blow-out in that one—is that a committee should not deal with more than two inquiries at the one time. The planning we looked at today would allow this committee to deal with this reference during the months of April and May next year. At that stage, by about February, we would have concluded the regional employment inquiry, we would then be conducting the GST inquiry, which would be concluded by the end of March. That would then leave April and May to deal with both this reference and the one which has existed, as Senator Tierney said, for quite some time, in relation to indigenous education. Although, in 
 relation to potential hearings for indigenous education, the times proposed were actually in the break in July, so again that leaves the April and May period fairly much open.
I am surprised that the government does not actually look favourably at this reference as an indicator that the committee has no intention of seeking to blow out the GST inquiry, because if we have any hope of dealing with these issues through April and May, as proposed in this reference, then obviously we are not wanting to be continuing to deal with the GST and would be reporting on time to the select committee on that. But again it is in a planned process that would allow the committee to occupy itself with no more than two inquiries at the one time.
Now I deal with Senator Tierney's comments with respect to the regional employment inquiry and how in its next hearings it might hear more in relation to the Job Network. The evidence collected by the regional employment inquiry relates predominantly to Job Network mark I. We have experienced Job Network mark II, and the one hearing day that is being allowed to wind up the regional employment inquiry and hear from the government department and peak organisations before the end of this year is obviously not going to put us in a position to be focusing on Job Network issues in any substance—certainly not in a position to make any evaluation of the issues with respect to the impact of Job Network mark II. Obviously the committee is definitely not going to be in the position to analyse the effects of Job Network mark III, which will obviously be under investigation by the reference that is proposed here.
Senator Tierney referred to how the Job Network issues have evolved. Of course they have evolved in a much broader sense than just regional employment issues. Were we solely to rely on the regional employment inquiry, it would be pointed out that the scope of that is to focus on regional employment issues and that there are much broader issues and much broader problems that need to be investigated than those which were examined by the regional employment committee. That is not to say that the evidence collected by 
 that committee is not significant. There will probably be about a full chapter in the report relating to Job Network, but again that is the evidence that was collected in the context of an inquiry into regional employment, not in terms of the context of an inquiry into the problems—as Senator Stott Despoja said, the urgent problems—associated with employment and the Job Network. Perhaps that is the time to go back to referring to issues of substance at stake in relation to this reference.
More recent history has been referred to by both Senator O'Brien and Senator Stott Despoja in relation to a motion moved by Senator Stott Despoja highlighting the new proposed changes to deflect attention onto the unemployed by indicating that the government was looking at tightening up access to income support on the basis of whether people had referred themselves to the Job Network. Senator Stott Despoja in this motion rightly points out that not only is this blame shifting but also that the government needs to look at the design and operation flaws in the system—and again that is what this reference is proposing.
But the most recent example of the problems involved in this area came from the minister's response to the issue in question time yesterday. I want to take one point there, because it highlights a fairly large contradiction between what the government or the minister is saying, what the general public seems to understand—or certainly what the media seems to understand—and what the figures seem to highlight. I read a brief section of what Mr Abbot put to the House of Representatives in question time yesterday:
Any idea that this government is scapegoating jobs seekers is completely wrong. This government is determined to ensure that people on newsearch take jobsearch seriously.
That's probably newstart. He says:
A small minority who do not take it seriously taint—
I don't know why we have to use that word with respect to the unemployed but anyway—
a much larger number who do.
Yet in the Australian  today there is a report in relation to the same issue which says that the changes which will be introduced before 
 the end of the year come as more than half of 260,000 short-term unemployed are still refusing to use the Job Network to find work. So we have the minister saying it is a small minority, and we have the Australian  indicating that more than half of the 260,000 short-term unemployed are refusing to use the Job Network.
The language here is very interesting too. The word `refusing', I think, helps us highlight where the real issues actually lie. I went searching on the Centrelink and Job Network home pages today. I have new portfolio responsibilities in this area, and I was astounded by what I found. I found that the home page for the Job Network refers to a number of things in relation to the Job Network. I will read a section from the home page:
When you register for Newstart or Youth Allowance, you will be asked to do a number of things, including: completing a claim form, sign a looking for work from—
that should be `form'; that is an error on the home page—
. . . provide proof of your identity, and make an appointment for an interview. When you are handed to claim—
That should the `the claim'. That is another error on the home page. I hope these are not the people helping people with CVs. To continue:
. . . form you will be advised of all the documents you will need to bring along to the interview to have your claim processed.
The Job Network home page also says:
The new arrangements eliminate duplication—previously job seekers had to go to Department of Social Security offices as well as the CES. Now you will only need to go to your local Centrelink office to register as unemployed, or use the Job Network Access facilities to get information on Job Network Members.
Nowhere here does it recommend to new job seekers that they actually seek to enrol with a Job Network member. So we are shifting blame onto these unemployed people and the information that they are given when they register with Centrelink does not even encourage them to register with one of these providers. So let us look at fixing the system.
But, of course, we have the problems in the system that we were debating in the last sitting week. The original problem of Job Network, particularly with the providers staying viable in business, was the slow Centrelink referrals. We had hoped that that had been fixed. But now we have the extreme Centrelink service and staff cuts, and obvious errors such as this one, which show that when the unemployed turn up to Centrelink they are not even being encouraged, before they are being compelled, to register with Job Network providers. So we have an overreaction by the government, which is saying, `We are going to force these people to do these things,' when they have not even been trying to encourage them. Centrelink does not have the staffing resources to sit down with people and suggest to them properly, on most occasions, that that it is the next obvious step that they should be taking.
The other issue which needs to be highlighted in relation to the real problems of employment services is, as was briefly mentioned by Senator Stott Despoja, the issue of real and fair competition and real diversity in services for the unemployed. One of the issues raised in the estimates hearings some time ago concerned the capacity of the unemployed to make an informed choice. Despite assurances from the minister at the time, there is still no information available to help the unemployed determine whether their choice is overresourced or underresourced or to offer them the assistance they need to make any real value assessments in terms of which agency they choose to provide them with the service. So that deals with the diversity problem at the moment.
The other problem has been alluded to in some of the comments today, and that is in relation to real and fair competition. That is the part of the system that is not really working. That is one of the big parts that we need to investigate by picking up Senator Tierney's point and asking job providers how the system is working. We need to do that in an open consultative forum rather than in the recent new minister's consultations, which have been very closed and have not provided information to help deal with the obvious 
 problems of public confidence in the Job Network system.
Public confidence is a very big issue. You are not going to encourage new job seekers to use the system if everybody they talk to says that it is not working. If the agencies say that the system is not working, you are not going to encourage them. You are not going to encourage them if employers are saying that they will not use the thing, as in the example of Woolworths. So what does this government do? It takes the next step and says, `Now we are going to compel them. The system doesn't work, but we're going to compel the people to use it.' 	This is the most recent example of how ludicrous is the government's plan of dealing with this issue. A real investigation is both procedurally possible and urgently required. We cannot continue with responses such as victim blaming.
Senator Stott Despoja has also indicated the issue of employment generation. We also need to look at the problems involved with FLEX 3 and how well that fits in with permanent employment generation so that people are not being recycled through the system. We have a chronic problem with long-term unemployed. It is a problem that is getting worse. We have a system where many of our employment service providers are focusing more on surviving in the competitive system against the big players than on providing services to the unemployed.
Let me go back to Senator Tierney's comments on the substantive issue that we needed a different approach. Perhaps we did need a different approach—I am not going to concede that point—but we certainly need to review what has gone on in that change of approach. Given the amount of public debate on this issue, the review needs to be much broader than a closed ministerial consideration.
Senator Tierney referred to balancing the community sector, the business sector and the government sector. The community sector is being killed by this system. Not only did we knock out many of the service providers that had been providing valuable services to the unemployed for years—through the debacle of the tender process, to the extent that many 
 of them will not be around for the next tender process—but we also now have the current providers unable to compete with the big business providers. The focus of the big business providers will be on their accounting and their bottom line, not on the unemployed.
We need an inquiry that will not only talk to the Job Network providers but will also talk to the unemployed. It will deal with the various interest groups who are experiencing problems with the system. Consultation by the minister has been relatively limited. It certainly has not been broad enough to encompass all of the problems that continue to come forward, on a day by day basis, with the Job Network. This is not an election inquiry—we are well out from a future election. This is about a cross-partisan approach to fixing the problems being identified with respect to Job Network and the unemployed.
There is no other issue, at this point of time, that should be of more concern to a Senate committee whose purview is employment, workplace relations, small business and education. I cannot think of a more significant issue than the problems being experienced by the unemployed in a system that has completely turned on its head services to the unemployed—and problems are coming up day by day.
I would like to conclude my comments by returning to the point that Senator Tierney raised. As a matter of procedure, this inquiry is certainly possible. As the new chair of the committee, I believe the programming that has been discussed allows, quite feasibly, for this inquiry to be conducted during the months of April and May next year.
If we deal with this reference now, before we conclude this session, then obviously those involved in this sector will have significant time to prepare the information we need to gather and will be in the position to focus on this issue at that time. That is why it is important that we deal with it now. If we delay this until July when the new Senate will commence, the problems will just continue. The potential is there for us to achieve cross-party support to fix this system. Given the government's concern with ensuring that the GST inquiries are concluded by March, I am 
 absolutely astounded that they are not prepared to support an inquiry such as this which would immediately follow those inquiries. They know that the opposition and the other parties are focused on wanting to deal with this issue and we will make sure that we do so.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,13,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-12-01,"—I am indebted to my colleague Senator Collins for outlining the argument against not endorsing this inquiry on the basis that the committee is unable to logistically fit the inquiry's business into its timetable. I might say that I was required to leave the chamber during part of the government's deliberations on this matter, due to a commitment with the Selection of Bills Committee.
It is clear that the committee has the opportunity and the time to give this inquiry proper consideration; to allow members of the public and providers to make their submissions under parliamentary privilege; and to have their submissions considered and a report presented to the Senate—this Senate, as it is now constituted—before 30 June.
Indeed, given that it is self-evident that there is the time, the question must be asked why the government is so vehemently opposed to the conducting of this inquiry. The government has just as much opportunity as anybody else to put a point of view and, in the absence of a unanimous committee position, to present that view of the evidence to the Senate and to the public. The only reason remaining for the government to seek to avoid this inquiry is the fact that it gives members of the public and providers the opportunity to put their view under the protection of parliamentary privilege.
Some mention was made of organisations such as APAC, for example, who found that their funding was removed because they were critical of this government. I cannot think of any group of people who are more at risk in terms of their ongoing viability than the contracted providers who might be looking at being contracted in another round under the so-called Job Network. The ability to present their views, under parliamentary privilege, would ensure that they had some come back if they were not dealt with properly in the 
 second round. Having reflected upon the reason for the government opposing and not wanting this inquiry, it seems to me that that is the only reason that is logically available. The only conclusion is that this government is intent on obscuring from the public all of the warts, all of the pitfalls, and all of the problems of the Job Network system; and that this government is not concerned that there is a possibility we might actually find something which assists in rectifying the problem.
The rectification of the problems is, at least initially, in the hands of the government, this being a system which was established by administrative decision and not by the legislation of this parliament. It is clear, however, that the government will need to legislate in relation to this matter and in relation to some of the announcements which have been made recently.
The amendment proposed by Senator Stott Despoja on behalf of the Democrats will be supported by the opposition. We are happy to broaden, to the extent that the amendment proposes, the scope of the inquiry. Notwithstanding that, we believe it is still possible to complete the inquiry according to the timetable which we have sought. We would not be seeking to deny any relevant person or organisation an opportunity to put their submission to the inquiry. To the extent that the amendment broadens that opportunity, we would support it.
We look forward, when the inquiry is on the road and hearing its evidence, to the presence of Senator Stott Despoja—and also members of the government—to assist us in the conduct of the inquiry around the country. However, if individual members of the committee have doubts about whether they will be available at the times so provided, this matter is so important that I think it is incumbent upon them to arrange for a replacement if they are not available. A number of senators in this place would, I think, look forward to the opportunity to participate in an inquiry of this nature. It is one of the duties of senators to make themselves available to do the business of the Senate in accordance with the timetables laid down by the Senate.
I was disappointed to hear Senator Margetts's comments about the non-attendance of certain members of the committee at hearings during the last election campaign, but we note that it is possible for a committee to continue its business provided a majority of members are present, even though members of the particular parties that constitute—
—That was not about hearings, that was about public meetings.
—It was public meetings, I apologise. Nevertheless, it is possible for the committee to conduct its hearings with a majority of its members, even though members—be they opposition, government or Democrats—choose not to be there. It is possible for the Senate to conduct its business and it is not possible for a single party to frustrate the business of the committee. Having said that, I commend the motion to the Senate. I indicate, as I have previously, that the opposition will be supporting the Democrats amendment and will treat this matter very seriously.
	 Question put:
	 That the amendments (Senator Stott Despoja's ) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,13,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-12-01,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee for inquiry and report by 1 June 1999:
(a)	 the development and implementation of the tendering process followed in the establishment of the privatised Job Network in 1998 and options to improve the process in future tender rounds;
(b)	 the effectiveness of the Flex 3 component of the Job Network in providing skills, training and work experience to the long-term unemployed;
(c)	 options to improve the quality and effectiveness of the delivery of employment services to the long-term unemployed, with particular reference to the young, the middle-aged, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, migrants and ex-offenders;
(d)	 the impact on the quality of the delivery of the Job Network services to all unemployed people by the concentration of Flex 3 services in only four organisations and the implications of concentrating these services among four organisations for future Job Network tenders;
(e)	 the effectiveness of the Job Network in delivering services to regional Australia and other areas of disadvantage and options to improve service delivery in these areas in future tender rounds;
(f)	 the impact on unemployment numbers in both job poor areas and job rich areas of the Government's performance-based strategy; and
(g)	 the effectiveness of the current regulation of the new competitive employment services market, to ensure fairness and quality and options to improve the regulation of the employment services market with the introduction of a new tender round.
This motion essentially seeks to refer aspects of the government's employment services market arrangements to the committee, as outlined in the Notice Paper  today.
The question of the government's employment services market has had a rather chequered career in this place. Senators will recall that when Senator Vanstone was the minister she introduced legislation into the Senate seeking support for the arrangements the government proposed to put into place to replace the CES with its employment services market arrangements. Indeed, that legislation was the subject of an inquiry by this 
 committee's predecessor—the legislation committee, not the references committee.
Following that inquiry, there was a report from the majority government members and a report from the opposition minority members of the committee. Arising from those proceedings, the opposition and the Democrats moved certain amendments in this place to the government's legislation. Upon considering that matter and agreement to, I think, one of those amendments, Senator Vanstone announced that the government would not proceed with the passage of its legislation to underpin the establishment of the new employment services market arrangements but would proceed by administrative action, and proceeded to put into place the arrangements which have caused so much controversy, so much consternation, so much angst and so much disadvantage to the unemployed in the Australian community.
I remind the Senate that one important aspect of the measures put in place was the restriction of the available services—as paid for by the Commonwealth through these new arrangements—to those of the unemployed who are entitled to benefits under the relevant social security act.
So there was a set of arrangements which the government initially sought to put in place by legislative action. When the government could not get precisely the form of legislation that it desired, it told this Senate, the parliament and the Australian people, `We can achieve exactly what we want by putting in place, purely by administrative action, an arrangement relying upon existing laws of the parliament. No other correspondence will be entered into so far as legislative change is concerned.'
It is well known that the arrangements the former minister Senator Vanstone put in place—before she was demoted and her place taken by Dr Kemp of the House of Representatives—have failed. Not only have they failed, they have failed miserably, to the extent that there have been a number of attempts, particularly by Dr Kemp, to patch up the arrangements which are now in place to try and deal with the haemorrhaging of this system, a system which is a matter of public 
 policy. Its failure is so notable, so notorious, that the government has tried on two occasions to rectify what it has done.
Apparently, from what I understand to have been comments by the minister in the other place yesterday, further changes will need to be made to the employment service market area, but they will require legislative change. So, in some way at least, this matter will come back to the Senate at some stage—next year, I suspect. To replace the CES, we have had a marketplace put in place by this government—they have spent in the vicinity of $1.7 billion, I think, of Commonwealth funds—which is a total failure and which has been the subject of notable attempts to rectify it. Again, these have been total failures.
We now see a proposal by the opposition to inquire into the deficiencies of the system. Bear in mind that this, as I indicated, is a very large area of government expenditure. The government's position, as I am advised, is that they oppose the reference of this matter to a committee. Indeed, what they are telling other members of the committee is that they have the numbers to defeat this matter. I will be very interested to see whether that means they have Senator Colston's vote to effectively negate this motion in a tie or whether they claim also to have Senator Harradine's vote. We shall see. It would be very interesting if the government were to succeed in thwarting this request for a Senate references inquiry.
May I say I have heard a number of reasons put by the government as to why we should not proceed at this stage. One of the reasons was that there had been an inquiry into unemployment, that that inquiry had touched upon the question of the employment services market and some questions had been asked. The terms of reference in this proposal, as proposed in my motion, will go far beyond any of the terms of reference which were before the committee which was conducting its work prior to the last election. More importantly, we are looking at a system which has been the subject of constant change and comment, even following the commencement of that inquiry and the conclusion of hearings prior to the last election. We have also heard 
 comments, as I indicated yesterday, which talk of further change.
This, as I said, is an area where an extraordinary amount of public money is being expended and—arguably—wasted. I think the question has to be asked: given that there are many questions which committees of this Senate inquire into, why is the government not prepared to agree that there be an inquiry into what is essentially one of the most critical aspects of public policy affecting a very large number of Australians who are unemployed or may become unemployed in the future and which has been put in place not by legislative action but by the administrative decision of this government?
I think the only matter that would come to the public's mind when they thought of that was that the government was trying to hide the mistakes that it had made, the total shambles it created in the creation of this new employment services market; that it would be trying to hide some of the contractual arrangements it had entered into and that it would purport to hide behind so-called commercial-in-confidence arrangements which had been entered into on its behalf by the agency. Nevertheless, let me say we are persisting with the motion today on the basis that we think that thinking senators will not thwart the work of this place of inquiring into a great disaster implemented not by the Senate, but by this government—in fact, in defiance of this Senate.
Let me remind Senator Harradine of his disgust at the actions of this government when it became clear they could not get their own way on every aspect of the legislative package. They did not pursue the package they put before the Senate: when it was amended, they withdrew it. I remind Senator Harradine that he was extremely critical of the government at that time. I urge Senator Harradine and all non-government senators to support the motion now before the Senate to initiate the inquiry. The timetable allows it to be completed in a period between the end of the so-called GST reference inquiry that this committee will undertake and 30 June. Let me say that if somehow the government succeed in thwarting this proposed inquiry at this 
 stage, the matter will not go away; we will pursue this matter further when the new Senate takes its place after 30 June.
I would have thought it to be pretty clear to the government that the outcome they might secure now will differ then, and it will not differ in terms of what this committee does. I suggest to the government that the appropriate course of action is to agree to this motion, to allow the committee to plan an appropriate way of pursuing this inquiry and of taking into account, as the motion before the Senate allows, any evidence which has been taken by the previous committee, to take any new evidence that is relevant and to bring down a report expeditiously by 30 June. This is a matter which concerns the Australian people and which involves great expenditure of money. This is an area which will be the subject of expenditure into the future.
I call on the government to stop hiding behind their arrangements and allow an inquiry to take place. Perhaps we can assist the government, in a way that we were not allowed to do in relation to the legislation that was before this place, and get at least something good to come out of their shambles of the arrangements for the employment services market. Let me say that there have been other pieces of legislation that this government have brought into this place, for example, the aged care legislation, which have had problems. When we told the government all of the problems that would arise, the government chose to ignore them, used numbers in this place, passed the legislation and then found they had to backtrack. Let's deal with this matter properly. Let's get the inquiry under way, ascertain what the problems are and perhaps we will get them solved in time to help a few people.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Referral</title>,Committees,13,2
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-12-01,"—The government will be opposing the proposed inquiry into the Job Network on two basic grounds—one being procedural and the other substantive. The procedural reason for not having an inquiry at this time is that the education committee that would be going to undertake such an inquiry has a number of things in train at the moment. It has a program that will take it through to the 
 end of September next year. Its inquiries include one into Aboriginal education, which is about halfway through; a proposed inquiry into GST aspects of educational services, which will take up a large part of the first part of next year; and the inquiry currently before it into regional employment and unemployment. The terms of reference for that inquiry were put down almost a year ago, and the committee has spent virtually a whole year on it so far and looks like going into another year before it reports.
That inquiry started in 1997 and will report in 1999. Despite Senator O'Brien's assurances, I am not convinced that the inquiry that he is proposing would be in such a narrow time frame as that suggested, given the legislative program next year and given the GST inquiries and Easter. I cannot quite see how you would fit it into such a time frame, particularly given the history of the other inquiry over the past year.
The main procedural reason that it should not proceed at this point is that we are actually currently inquiring into the Job Network. Right around Australia, in all capital cities and in a lot of regional centres, when we undertook inquiries into regional employment and unemployment there was on each occasion—and, as the whole inquiry progressed, even more so—a percentage of time devoted to questions about the Job Network. The reason was that members of the opposition thought that they could have a good bash at the government before the election and could try to highlight issues relating to the Job Network in their local press. This was not a particularly successful strategy, and the Hansard record shows that over that period of time nearly 300 questions were asked by opposition members, in all parts of Australia and to a wide range of witnesses, about the Job Network. We still have not finished that inquiry. We have an inquiry date in a week or two in Canberra, where we will be talking to other groups of people and peak bodies, and then we will report.
One of the problems about how long the whole process has taken is that the Job Network has evolved over that time, and so I am not too sure exactly what we are reporting on. 
 We have actually taken evidence at different points in time as the Job Network system bedded down. So, if we give a historical perspective, some of the problems that people saw in the early part of the inquiry have been fixed by revisions by this government. I suppose that in our next hearing in Canberra we can manage to get an update on the Job Network—where it is up to at that time and what any perceived problems are—and then report in February. I would have thought that that covered the issue of the Job Network to this point in time.
If members of the opposition want to bring the matter back later when the committee has finished its work on Aboriginal education, regional employment and unemployment, and the GST aspects that relate to education—which, as I said, will take us through to September next year—the government would look at it again at that point. But I would suspect that the program we have introduced with the Job Network would have been well and truly bedded down by that time and there would probably not be the need for such an inquiry, particularly as the political imperatives would have disappeared by that point in time.
Senator O'Brien said a number of things about the Job Network, things which I would like to put a government perspective on. He said it was introduced by administrative arrangement and not by legislation. The government did legitimately have the power to do that, although that was not really its preferred course of action. It would have liked to have legislated for it; but, of course, members of the opposition, I would like to make plain, are the ones that prevented that happening. That was the only way that it could be done.
When the system was introduced, it was introduced in place of a failed system known as the CES, the Commonwealth Employment Service, which was not providing properly for the unemployed in this country. Under the old system, about 11 per cent of all jobs were placed through the CES. Most other people made other arrangements for finding employment. The system was set up in a time of low unemployment and it managed to do its job 
 reasonably effectively in times of low unemployment—and I am talking about after it was set up in the late forties, through into the fifties, sixties and early seventies. But it never quite coped with the difficulties created by a larger level of unemployment. So there has been an evolution over the years of governments that have tried with varying degrees of success to grapple with the problem.
Probably the most spectacular failure of the last Labor government was its so-called Working Nation program. Senator O'Brien, in his criticism of Job Network, claimed that the government was wasting money. It is very well documented how much money the last Labor government wasted on Working Nation, where the placement rate was only about one-third. Two-thirds of the people under Working Nation, having gone through various programs at great expense to the taxpayer, ended up back on the unemployment queue, often greatly disillusioned. As a fellow said to us in one of the inquiries, it would have been better to have been left in the gutter than to have been picked up out of it and then dropped back in it again. That was his reaction to it.
We had the situation of churning dole queues, where people were trained but there was no job for them and so they were retrained but there was still no job and so they were retrained again. As a matter of fact, in Wollongong they said they had the best-trained dole queues in the world. It was a program that failed spectacularly, and the Australian people showed their view of that—along with their view of a number of the other failures of the previous Labor government—in 1996, when they threw it out.
A very different approach was needed, and that is what this government has brought in. The community sector has often taken a role in helping the unemployed, sometimes informally and sometimes with government assistance. The business sector—groups like Drake Personnel and others—has always been involved in the employment market and, of course, the government, through the CES, has been involved in the employment market. Under Job Network, this government created a more flexible and more formal arrangement 
 where those various sectors could compete in providing job services.
The broad approach was actually founded on the very sound principle that people who were trying to get people employed were to be funded based on success of placement. The feeling was that this should turn around the rate of success so that it was better than the failed Working Nation program. As the minister at the time, Dr Kemp, said on many occasions, very early on Job Network was outperforming the old CES and had the potential, after some of the teething problems had been solved, to do quite a lot better.
As I mentioned before, the whole system has been bedding down since 1 May this year. It has been in a process of evolution over that time. It has got a particularly bad press, aided and abetted by the ALP, and Senator O'Brien made some rather strange statements today. He talked about `great angst in the community', and `great disaster' was another phrase he used. These things do not become a reality by opposition members constantly saying them. You really have to ask the job providers what their view of it is, and that certainly is not their view at all. The vast majority of them think the system is working quite successfully, and have said so—and in terms of their own operations the vast majority of them are.
A number of providers in the new system had never been in the system before. It is understandable that they would make some commercial mistakes in the way in which they undertook the tendering process, assuming that in the FLEX 1, FLEX 2 and FLEX 3 system they might pick up two of those types of programs and be able to cross-subsidise. Of course, when they picked up only one type, particularly FLEX 1, they did not have that opportunity and a number of them got into some difficulty because of that. We are about to move into the second tendering round, and I think as we move into this process the realities of how this system works will be a lot more apparent to people in business and they will make much wiser judgments this time around in their tendering.
The important thing is that we have a flexible system which has, compared with the 
 old CES, a much wider range of providers and many more locations where people can come and access the service. The very important point that is at the centre of this is that it must work through success of the end product. No matter how much money we put into the support of job services, the key measuring variable at the end of the day is: do people get a job at the end of the process?
The Labor government's approach, despite the enormous amount of money it put into that approach over the years, was demonstrably a failure. This system provides greater flexibility and provides market forces to determine who gets what services, which businesses set up what services and where those services are located. It is a much better opportunity to have a system that is more robust and more successful and, at the end of the day, doing what these work support systems must do, that is, get people through and, finally, place them in a job.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Referral</title>,Committees,13,2
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-01,"—The Democrats will be supporting the motion to refer Job Network to a Senate inquiry for consideration of its operation and design. We have repeatedly called for such a review.
I will tackle a couple of points put forward this afternoon by Senator Tierney on both policy and process grounds. I acknowledge the many terms of reference before Senate committees in this place. I also acknowledge the workload of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee. For those reasons it is sad that the government did not take the initiative and establish an independent and wide-ranging inquiry into the design and operation of Job Network.
On many occasions this government has had the opportunity. In fact, with a new minister in place, a minister specifically responsible for employment services, there was a wonderful opportunity for the government to say, `We acknowledge that there has been a number of faults and flaws in this system.' I do not think anyone in their right mind can deny that there has been confusion and at times administrative chaos in the 
 system and, yes, there will also be examples where it may be working well. It would have been a wonderful opportunity to examine, right across the board, what was going right and what was going wrong for precisely the reason put forward by Senator Tierney: that we are approaching that second tendering round, and let us get it right now. The unemployed in this country, not to mention private providers with a stake in the system and not to mention the government, deserve no less, and that is a system that is functioning well.
Yes, there is a heavy workload on most Senate committees, but this is a matter of urgency. This is a particularly important issue. I am sure many people on the other side of the chamber would join me in suggesting that employment is perhaps one of the most crucial issues—if not the number one issue—facing Australians today. Therefore this government has an incredible responsibility to those Australians—job seekers, Centrelink employees and Job Network providers alike—to get this system functioning well.
Senator Tierney also mentioned the issue of jobs more generally and the role in job creation of making sure that we are not just putting people onto cyclical training schemes or failing to provide job opportunities for Australians. I do not think anyone in this chamber would disagree with that notion, but I suspect that some of us are more conscious than others that we should be looking to create opportunities for employment that are full-time, sustainable, meaningful and ongoing. I have not seen from this government any particular job creation strategies that result in those kinds of job opportunities, not just for young Australians, who I suggest have, in many respects, borne the brunt of structural change in our work force, but right across the board; specifically, the record number of long-term unemployed in our society today. I would like to see some job creation policies coming forward from the government.
I recognise that a plank of theirs is supposedly the Job Network system, so let us get it right. We have an opportunity before the Senate today to get it right. The Democrats understand that this system is not going away. This competitive model has been adopted by 
 the government. I heard in the House yesterday the shadow minister offering bipartisan support, making a plea to get it right. It is not going to change. We are not going to see a radical overhaul of this competitive model. Some of us, the Democrats in particular, are not committed to this competitive model, but we are realistic. It is not going away, so let's get it right. That is why we have called repeatedly for a review of the Job Network. There are some fundamental things that could be done tomorrow to get it right.
There is also a unique opportunity at this stage of its development to call on and consult with some of those key players. I note, unfortunately, that even the new minister with his huge responsibility for employment services has not consulted as widely and as broadly as he should have. I note again with disappointment that I hear Senator Tierney referring to the views of some of the providers. I did not see Senator Tierney, with all due respect, I did not see Dr Kemp, with all due respect, and I did not see the new minister, with all due respect, front up to the National Employment Services Association's meeting of all the private providers who could possibly fit in one room at one time in Melbourne a couple of months ago.
—They didn't invite me.
—I wish they had. Dr Kemp, as I understand, originally accepted the invitation, but the excuse he gave for not turning up was that government was in caretaker mode. Presumably that meant that everything shut down for a couple of weeks while everyone decided their new portfolios—an amazing luxury. Martin Ferguson, the shadow minister, turned up. I was very happy to be there. I think I spoke in Dr Kemp's spot, actually.
—Was he invited?
—He was invited but no-one fronted up. I have made the political point and I have made the procedural point, just to answer the process grounds that Senator Tierney put forward about the role of the committee. Yes, it would have been great if an independent, well resourced committee, at the initiative of the government, not just with bipartisan but with 
 tripartisan support, had been constructed, but that is not happening. This is an urgent issue, so procedurally we must do it in the form of a Senate committee.
Senator Tierney raised some issues on policy grounds. Overwhelmingly, we have seen difficulties in this system since its implementation in May this year. The scheme is not piloted. It is one of the most radical experiments with employment services in the world, if not unprecedented. It was called `a bold gamble' by the government. This gamble has produced widespread confusion as its dividend. Since May this year, my office—and I suggest all offices—with the responsibility of employment and a number of other issues for the Democrats, has been deluged with calls, emails and letters from individuals begging for reform, from job seekers right through to private providers and organisations, some of which have been badly affected, with suggestions as to how it could be improved. The new minister has met with some employment agencies but has not consulted as broadly as he should have. The Democrats have always maintained that Job Network must be subject to a comprehensive and fully inclusive review, and that means everyone. Everyone who is involved in this system must be given an opportunity to point out not just the defects but some of the parts that are working well.
The Democrats will seek to amend the terms of reference put forward by Senator O'Brien. In our amended terms of reference, we would see the inquiry examine all areas of design and operation of the Job Network, from the consequences of delivering employment services on a competitive model to the operation of the job seeker classification instrument. Only in this way do we believe that the problems within the system can be acknowledged, addressed and hopefully fixed by the commencement of the next tender round. I really believe that all the players in this system deserve no less.
Job Network was a bold gamble implemented by government not only in a radical fashion but at a time when agencies like Centrelink were dealing with a number of other so-called bold initiatives—the imple 
 mentation of the common youth allowance, expansion of work for the dole. There have been other stresses and strains on the system—not the least of which have been resources. There have been strains on Centrelink staff when it has come to training and other service provision, not to mention the stresses they are currently experiencing with the threat of 5,000 jobs to be lost by the end of the next financial year.
The Democrats believe, under this competitive model, that Job Network is flawed in its conception, design and indeed in its implementation. Since it was first announced, the Democrats have called for a review just so that we can ensure, if we going to use this system, that we get it right. We believe that the very ideology that underpins this system is wholly inappropriate. I find something quite bizarre in the application of market forces to the provision of employment services for unemployed people. Many of these people have found themselves out of work as a consequence of the very operation of these market services.
We have seen as a consequence of the application of these market forces a fundamentally flawed tendering process. I defy anyone in the chamber to suggest that the tender process was without flaws. I think a flawed process has produced a flawed outcome. Instead of rewarding commitment and proven records of expertise, the government rewarded size and low cost tenders. We saw the closure of long established, dedicated community organisations. This represents an incalculable loss to the community as a whole. The links with local communities and the specialised skill and knowledge which this engendered cannot be replicated by organisations which are new to the area or to the industry altogether.
On 25 August this year, an announcement was made by the minister at the time, Dr David Kemp, who no longer has responsibility for employment. Senator O'Brien referred to his demotion. I am not sure whether it was a demotion or whether it was so that he could focus more on higher education institutions. The notion that he can play full-time with universities, with all due respect, scares me. 
 On 25 August, the minister made an announcement that there should be changes; that there should be an injection of funds into the Job Network. An amount of $55 million was put into the new system and there was a widening of the eligibility criteria.
These are not gestures by a government that is not nervous about the operation of its system. This is not a move by a government that is confident in the lead-up to an election that this system will withstand any criticism. It was clearly a stop-gap pre-election measure designed to stop criticism. In many cases this measure of a widening of the eligibility criteria—long overdue—will increase the strain on agencies. We believe that further reform should have been undertaken at that time and, indeed, now as a matter of urgency.
We have long supported a fully comprehensive investigation into and review of the system. As a result, we would prefer that such a review would analyse all aspects of design and operation, with recommendations coming down in time for inclusion in the 1999 budget, with changes to be implemented at the end of the first contractual term in November 1999.
The changes that the Democrats would seek to make, in the form of our amendments, add in most cases to the terms of reference. We seek to include the competitive model. As I have said, unlike the opposition and the government, the Democrats do not believe we should retain the competitive model of service delivery. We acknowledge that it is most likely to be retained, but it is worth examining some of the concerns of welfare organisations and some providers that the competitive model militates against appropriate service delivery.
We are also keen to examine the issue of fee charging arrangements. I understand that many of these amendments are supported by members of the opposition. The practice of fee charging arrangements continues. We would like to ascertain the extent to which fee charging is occurring and to which it operates as a disincentive to employers to use the Job Network and to create new jobs.
We also want to look at the classes of job seekers. The Democrats would like to broaden 
 the scope of this term to include job seekers with disabilities and those from non-English speaking backgrounds. I understand that is agreeable to Senator O'Brien. Further, we believe that mature age people should be a focus of this inquiry—the mature age unemployed as well as the long-term unemployed.
With reference to the number of organisations, the original tender round actually resulted in the concentration of 66 per cent of the FLEX 3 market in five organisations, with 80 per cent being concentrated in the top 20—another area for examination.
We would also seek to include the examination of the effect of the abolition of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority and look at options for the development of a regulatory process or body to protect consumers, regions and social equity. So we would seek to broaden the terms of reference to include a regional and job seeker oriented focus.
We want to look at some of the guidelines that can be adopted to ensure that all job seekers receive appropriate levels of training to enable them to become work ready. We seek to look at the job seeker classification instrument, which has been criticised for excluding job seekers from assistance which they would have automatically been entitled to under the old system.	Of particular concern are the reports that young people are especially disadvantaged under this new system. And, of course, there is Centrelink: examining the effect of staff and resource cuts, the continued imposition of the efficiency dividend and the anticipated effects of the recently announced Centrelink business plan. These are all crucial issues which not only on policy grounds but also from the process perspective—to use Senator Tierney's terminology—deserve examination as a matter of urgency.
If we had any reason to believe that there were no changes taking place in the area of Job Network that we had further cause to be concerned about, we had only to listen to the comment by the relevant minister, the Minister for Employment Services, Mr Abbott, in the House of Representatives the day before yesterday that the unemployed may be forced to use Job Network or risk 
 losing their income support. I look forward to hearing clarification of that notion in this place because certainly the Australian Democrats found it a contemptible notion. We already acknowledge that unemployed people are subject to quite stringent activity testing arrangements to ensure that they are engaged in some kind of job search activity. If they are currently complying with the criteria by searching through the jobs classifieds or, through their own initiative, investigating work options, why should they be penalised? That was certainly the logical conclusion to be drawn from the minister's comments in the House of Representatives the other day.
We believe that the reason why many of these job seekers and employers at both ends of the spectrum are shunning the new system is that it just simply is not working adequately. So instead of getting angry or penalising people for not utilising the new system, why not examine why they are not using the system in the first place? Again, it is another example by this government of deflecting blame or denying that there may be a crisis in confidence within its own system, that its own system may be flawed in its operation and in its very design. Instead, they say, `Let's move the focus to the unemployed,' and suggest that maybe they should be penalised or treated in some punitive fashion for not using Job Network when they may very well be—and I suspect in most cases—undertaking the necessary investigations for work that they are expected to. It should be remembered that they can get breached under the current criteria and that they are subject to those activity testing arrangements.
Claims by the government, and they have been repeated here today by Senator Tierney, that it is bad publicity are unjustified. The claims that the bad publicity itself is unjustified are extraordinary, because they ignore the very real concerns that have been publicly expressed by a number of groups. This is not just a political point scoring exercise. These concerns have been brought forward by a number of political parties now, but they have also been echoed by those representatives involved in the private provision of employment services—those people who attended 
 that very wide-ranging National Employment Services conference in Melbourne. I cannot say that they were all of one mind. There was a range of groups—welfare organisations, organisations such as Drake Personnel, and new and old private providers—yet they all had some concerns about this system.
So claims that these groups have some kind of axe to grind are completely unfair, because it is in their interest for this system to work well. It is in their interest to ensure that their businesses and their job agencies do not go to the wall—certainly before the end of this year, as has been predicted. We have already seen closures, yet these groups—welfare organisations, unions—have not been able to get a look-in on the minister's so-called current consultations with providers. We believe that the flawed reforms are a result of this lack of consultation and a denial and an unwillingness to recognise that there may be some flaws in the system. The Democrats believe that the government should look first to fixing Job Network rather than placing further burdens on the unemployed.
I seek leave to move the Democrats amendments standing in my name.
Leave granted.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-01,"—I stand to briefly support the referral by Senator O'Brien of matters to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee. There are a number of reasons for this. I am constantly amazed by the fact that representatives of the government will use whatever public statements job providers may or may not have made as an indication of how well they are doing on the issue of job provision.
You only have to look at various aspects of government policy to see what happens when public statements are made by groups which rely on government for funding. For instance, migrant women's groups during the debate on the industrial relations legislation happened to mention that there were problems for migrant women in the changes to industrial relations to deregulate the work force, leaving them without support. What happened to the Australian Youth Policy Alliance when they wanted to engage the government and the public in discussions on youth policy?
Who is going to speak up on these issues? Will private providers speak up? As I said, they may in a closed conference, but when it comes to the public what have they got at stake? I keep thinking of the cartoon, the Wizard of Id. What happens when the peasant says, `The King is a fink'? The King may well be a fink, and the fink might basically suggest that they have policies that are good and would like everyone to continue to say that. But if, as in the Wizard of Id, the peasant says, `The King is a fink,' what happens? The peasant or Sir Rodney find themselves upside down in the torture chamber in shackles. I think that is the image of what we have in this community. It is not valid for the 
 government to ask, `What have these groups said publicly in relation to our policies?' when their very process is to gag or to cut out the tongues—in a theoretical sense—of any groups who dare to speak up.
In Western Australia during the election campaign I am aware that any time there was a forum, whether it was on education, employment, youth or so on, that the coalition representatives who were invited considered to be a `political forum'—and I do not know how this was in other states—they chose not to turn up. There were some that coalition people attended, but in many cases—I attended three or four fora during the election campaign—the coalition representatives chose not to turn up because, they said, it was a political forum. I do not think they wanted to be in a situation where, in public, there were criticisms of government policy and they would be in a situation where they had to respond to them.
It is like the three monkeys: `We can't see, we can't hear and we can't speak about the criticisms of our policy.' That does not make for a strong democracy and it does not make for strong government. It does not allow the government to come into this chamber and say, `Listen, we're not hearing any responses.' They do not want to hear. They are not going to the fora. They were not listening during the election campaign, and they do not want to hear community groups, support groups or lobby groups who have legitimate concerns and who would like to express them. Therefore, I think it is quite proper for the Senate to conduct the inquiry. It is quite proper for the government to have the opportunity to hear from a range of community groups—community providers, private providers, the government sector, unemployed people, and those lobby groups still in existence that have not yet been gagged or destroyed by the government.
It is certainly no way to run the country and no way to run major changes in policy. In the end there will, of course, be ongoing disasters for any government that does not want to hear the truth about the impacts of its policies and does not want to make the changes that are necessary before it is too late.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Referral</title>,Committees,13,2
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1998-12-01,"—In supporting this motion I intend to refer to some of the more recent history about the Job Network debacle, building on the comments of my colleague Senator O'Brien. However, before I do that, I think I should respond to the arguments put forward for the government by Senator Tierney. He dealt with this reference in relation to both procedural and substantive issues. Dealing firstly with the procedural issues: as chair of the new Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Committee—Senator Tierney referred to education, but of course it is much broader than that—I would like to respond to his claims that the current business before the committee would preclude us dealing appropriately with this reference.
With respect to the matters currently before the committee, Senator Tierney referred to the regional employment inquiry, which the committee now plans to conclude before it engages in the GST inquiry. There are two levels of the argument in relation to the regional employment inquiry, but let us just deal with the issue of timing at this stage. Senator Tierney then also mentioned that apart from the GST inquiry there is the indigenous education inquiry, which we plan to continue to conduct up until about September next year.
A general rule of thumb I have been given as a chair of committees—and I expect that after the workplace relations inquiry I am reasonably well-known for a fair degree of stamina; and there was no time blow-out in that one—is that a committee should not deal with more than two inquiries at the one time. The planning we looked at today would allow this committee to deal with this reference during the months of April and May next year. At that stage, by about February, we would have concluded the regional employment inquiry, we would then be conducting the GST inquiry, which would be concluded by the end of March. That would then leave April and May to deal with both this reference and the one which has existed, as Senator Tierney said, for quite some time, in relation to indigenous education. Although, in 
 relation to potential hearings for indigenous education, the times proposed were actually in the break in July, so again that leaves the April and May period fairly much open.
I am surprised that the government does not actually look favourably at this reference as an indicator that the committee has no intention of seeking to blow out the GST inquiry, because if we have any hope of dealing with these issues through April and May, as proposed in this reference, then obviously we are not wanting to be continuing to deal with the GST and would be reporting on time to the select committee on that. But again it is in a planned process that would allow the committee to occupy itself with no more than two inquiries at the one time.
Now I deal with Senator Tierney's comments with respect to the regional employment inquiry and how in its next hearings it might hear more in relation to the Job Network. The evidence collected by the regional employment inquiry relates predominantly to Job Network mark I. We have experienced Job Network mark II, and the one hearing day that is being allowed to wind up the regional employment inquiry and hear from the government department and peak organisations before the end of this year is obviously not going to put us in a position to be focusing on Job Network issues in any substance—certainly not in a position to make any evaluation of the issues with respect to the impact of Job Network mark II. Obviously the committee is definitely not going to be in the position to analyse the effects of Job Network mark III, which will obviously be under investigation by the reference that is proposed here.
Senator Tierney referred to how the Job Network issues have evolved. Of course they have evolved in a much broader sense than just regional employment issues. Were we solely to rely on the regional employment inquiry, it would be pointed out that the scope of that is to focus on regional employment issues and that there are much broader issues and much broader problems that need to be investigated than those which were examined by the regional employment committee. That is not to say that the evidence collected by 
 that committee is not significant. There will probably be about a full chapter in the report relating to Job Network, but again that is the evidence that was collected in the context of an inquiry into regional employment, not in terms of the context of an inquiry into the problems—as Senator Stott Despoja said, the urgent problems—associated with employment and the Job Network. Perhaps that is the time to go back to referring to issues of substance at stake in relation to this reference.
More recent history has been referred to by both Senator O'Brien and Senator Stott Despoja in relation to a motion moved by Senator Stott Despoja highlighting the new proposed changes to deflect attention onto the unemployed by indicating that the government was looking at tightening up access to income support on the basis of whether people had referred themselves to the Job Network. Senator Stott Despoja in this motion rightly points out that not only is this blame shifting but also that the government needs to look at the design and operation flaws in the system—and again that is what this reference is proposing.
But the most recent example of the problems involved in this area came from the minister's response to the issue in question time yesterday. I want to take one point there, because it highlights a fairly large contradiction between what the government or the minister is saying, what the general public seems to understand—or certainly what the media seems to understand—and what the figures seem to highlight. I read a brief section of what Mr Abbot put to the House of Representatives in question time yesterday:
Any idea that this government is scapegoating jobs seekers is completely wrong. This government is determined to ensure that people on newsearch take jobsearch seriously.
That's probably newstart. He says:
A small minority who do not take it seriously taint—
I don't know why we have to use that word with respect to the unemployed but anyway—
a much larger number who do.
Yet in the Australian  today there is a report in relation to the same issue which says that the changes which will be introduced before 
 the end of the year come as more than half of 260,000 short-term unemployed are still refusing to use the Job Network to find work. So we have the minister saying it is a small minority, and we have the Australian  indicating that more than half of the 260,000 short-term unemployed are refusing to use the Job Network.
The language here is very interesting too. The word `refusing', I think, helps us highlight where the real issues actually lie. I went searching on the Centrelink and Job Network home pages today. I have new portfolio responsibilities in this area, and I was astounded by what I found. I found that the home page for the Job Network refers to a number of things in relation to the Job Network. I will read a section from the home page:
When you register for Newstart or Youth Allowance, you will be asked to do a number of things, including: completing a claim form, sign a looking for work from—
that should be `form'; that is an error on the home page—
. . . provide proof of your identity, and make an appointment for an interview. When you are handed to claim—
That should the `the claim'. That is another error on the home page. I hope these are not the people helping people with CVs. To continue:
. . . form you will be advised of all the documents you will need to bring along to the interview to have your claim processed.
The Job Network home page also says:
The new arrangements eliminate duplication—previously job seekers had to go to Department of Social Security offices as well as the CES. Now you will only need to go to your local Centrelink office to register as unemployed, or use the Job Network Access facilities to get information on Job Network Members.
Nowhere here does it recommend to new job seekers that they actually seek to enrol with a Job Network member. So we are shifting blame onto these unemployed people and the information that they are given when they register with Centrelink does not even encourage them to register with one of these providers. So let us look at fixing the system.
But, of course, we have the problems in the system that we were debating in the last sitting week. The original problem of Job Network, particularly with the providers staying viable in business, was the slow Centrelink referrals. We had hoped that that had been fixed. But now we have the extreme Centrelink service and staff cuts, and obvious errors such as this one, which show that when the unemployed turn up to Centrelink they are not even being encouraged, before they are being compelled, to register with Job Network providers. So we have an overreaction by the government, which is saying, `We are going to force these people to do these things,' when they have not even been trying to encourage them. Centrelink does not have the staffing resources to sit down with people and suggest to them properly, on most occasions, that that it is the next obvious step that they should be taking.
The other issue which needs to be highlighted in relation to the real problems of employment services is, as was briefly mentioned by Senator Stott Despoja, the issue of real and fair competition and real diversity in services for the unemployed. One of the issues raised in the estimates hearings some time ago concerned the capacity of the unemployed to make an informed choice. Despite assurances from the minister at the time, there is still no information available to help the unemployed determine whether their choice is overresourced or underresourced or to offer them the assistance they need to make any real value assessments in terms of which agency they choose to provide them with the service. So that deals with the diversity problem at the moment.
The other problem has been alluded to in some of the comments today, and that is in relation to real and fair competition. That is the part of the system that is not really working. That is one of the big parts that we need to investigate by picking up Senator Tierney's point and asking job providers how the system is working. We need to do that in an open consultative forum rather than in the recent new minister's consultations, which have been very closed and have not provided information to help deal with the obvious 
 problems of public confidence in the Job Network system.
Public confidence is a very big issue. You are not going to encourage new job seekers to use the system if everybody they talk to says that it is not working. If the agencies say that the system is not working, you are not going to encourage them. You are not going to encourage them if employers are saying that they will not use the thing, as in the example of Woolworths. So what does this government do? It takes the next step and says, `Now we are going to compel them. The system doesn't work, but we're going to compel the people to use it.' 	This is the most recent example of how ludicrous is the government's plan of dealing with this issue. A real investigation is both procedurally possible and urgently required. We cannot continue with responses such as victim blaming.
Senator Stott Despoja has also indicated the issue of employment generation. We also need to look at the problems involved with FLEX 3 and how well that fits in with permanent employment generation so that people are not being recycled through the system. We have a chronic problem with long-term unemployed. It is a problem that is getting worse. We have a system where many of our employment service providers are focusing more on surviving in the competitive system against the big players than on providing services to the unemployed.
Let me go back to Senator Tierney's comments on the substantive issue that we needed a different approach. Perhaps we did need a different approach—I am not going to concede that point—but we certainly need to review what has gone on in that change of approach. Given the amount of public debate on this issue, the review needs to be much broader than a closed ministerial consideration.
Senator Tierney referred to balancing the community sector, the business sector and the government sector. The community sector is being killed by this system. Not only did we knock out many of the service providers that had been providing valuable services to the unemployed for years—through the debacle of the tender process, to the extent that many 
 of them will not be around for the next tender process—but we also now have the current providers unable to compete with the big business providers. The focus of the big business providers will be on their accounting and their bottom line, not on the unemployed.
We need an inquiry that will not only talk to the Job Network providers but will also talk to the unemployed. It will deal with the various interest groups who are experiencing problems with the system. Consultation by the minister has been relatively limited. It certainly has not been broad enough to encompass all of the problems that continue to come forward, on a day by day basis, with the Job Network. This is not an election inquiry—we are well out from a future election. This is about a cross-partisan approach to fixing the problems being identified with respect to Job Network and the unemployed.
There is no other issue, at this point of time, that should be of more concern to a Senate committee whose purview is employment, workplace relations, small business and education. I cannot think of a more significant issue than the problems being experienced by the unemployed in a system that has completely turned on its head services to the unemployed—and problems are coming up day by day.
I would like to conclude my comments by returning to the point that Senator Tierney raised. As a matter of procedure, this inquiry is certainly possible. As the new chair of the committee, I believe the programming that has been discussed allows, quite feasibly, for this inquiry to be conducted during the months of April and May next year.
If we deal with this reference now, before we conclude this session, then obviously those involved in this sector will have significant time to prepare the information we need to gather and will be in the position to focus on this issue at that time. That is why it is important that we deal with it now. If we delay this until July when the new Senate will commence, the problems will just continue. The potential is there for us to achieve cross-party support to fix this system. Given the government's concern with ensuring that the GST inquiries are concluded by March, I am 
 absolutely astounded that they are not prepared to support an inquiry such as this which would immediately follow those inquiries. They know that the opposition and the other parties are focused on wanting to deal with this issue and we will make sure that we do so.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Referral</title>,Committees,13,2
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-12-01,"—I am indebted to my colleague Senator Collins for outlining the argument against not endorsing this inquiry on the basis that the committee is unable to logistically fit the inquiry's business into its timetable. I might say that I was required to leave the chamber during part of the government's deliberations on this matter, due to a commitment with the Selection of Bills Committee.
It is clear that the committee has the opportunity and the time to give this inquiry proper consideration; to allow members of the public and providers to make their submissions under parliamentary privilege; and to have their submissions considered and a report presented to the Senate—this Senate, as it is now constituted—before 30 June.
Indeed, given that it is self-evident that there is the time, the question must be asked why the government is so vehemently opposed to the conducting of this inquiry. The government has just as much opportunity as anybody else to put a point of view and, in the absence of a unanimous committee position, to present that view of the evidence to the Senate and to the public. The only reason remaining for the government to seek to avoid this inquiry is the fact that it gives members of the public and providers the opportunity to put their view under the protection of parliamentary privilege.
Some mention was made of organisations such as APAC, for example, who found that their funding was removed because they were critical of this government. I cannot think of any group of people who are more at risk in terms of their ongoing viability than the contracted providers who might be looking at being contracted in another round under the so-called Job Network. The ability to present their views, under parliamentary privilege, would ensure that they had some come back if they were not dealt with properly in the 
 second round. Having reflected upon the reason for the government opposing and not wanting this inquiry, it seems to me that that is the only reason that is logically available. The only conclusion is that this government is intent on obscuring from the public all of the warts, all of the pitfalls, and all of the problems of the Job Network system; and that this government is not concerned that there is a possibility we might actually find something which assists in rectifying the problem.
The rectification of the problems is, at least initially, in the hands of the government, this being a system which was established by administrative decision and not by the legislation of this parliament. It is clear, however, that the government will need to legislate in relation to this matter and in relation to some of the announcements which have been made recently.
The amendment proposed by Senator Stott Despoja on behalf of the Democrats will be supported by the opposition. We are happy to broaden, to the extent that the amendment proposes, the scope of the inquiry. Notwithstanding that, we believe it is still possible to complete the inquiry according to the timetable which we have sought. We would not be seeking to deny any relevant person or organisation an opportunity to put their submission to the inquiry. To the extent that the amendment broadens that opportunity, we would support it.
We look forward, when the inquiry is on the road and hearing its evidence, to the presence of Senator Stott Despoja—and also members of the government—to assist us in the conduct of the inquiry around the country. However, if individual members of the committee have doubts about whether they will be available at the times so provided, this matter is so important that I think it is incumbent upon them to arrange for a replacement if they are not available. A number of senators in this place would, I think, look forward to the opportunity to participate in an inquiry of this nature. It is one of the duties of senators to make themselves available to do the business of the Senate in accordance with the timetables laid down by the Senate.
I was disappointed to hear Senator Margetts's comments about the non-attendance of certain members of the committee at hearings during the last election campaign, but we note that it is possible for a committee to continue its business provided a majority of members are present, even though members of the particular parties that constitute—
—That was not about hearings, that was about public meetings.
—It was public meetings, I apologise. Nevertheless, it is possible for the committee to conduct its hearings with a majority of its members, even though members—be they opposition, government or Democrats—choose not to be there. It is possible for the Senate to conduct its business and it is not possible for a single party to frustrate the business of the committee. Having said that, I commend the motion to the Senate. I indicate, as I have previously, that the opposition will be supporting the Democrats amendment and will treat this matter very seriously.
	 Question put:
	 That the amendments (Senator Stott Despoja's ) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Referral</title>,Committees,13,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-12-01,"—I move:
That regulation 7.6 of the Migration Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1998 No. 210 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.
For the benefit of those listening to the debate, this regulation imposes a mandatory condition on bridging visas granted to applicants for judicial review or persons seeking ministerial intervention in a decision of a review officer, the Immigration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that the holder of that bridging visa must not engage in employment in Australia.
Before addressing why I believe this regulation should be disallowed, I would like to address one technical matter first. A number of people in the community have raised concerns with me about whether or not it is valid to disallow regulation 7.6, and I have sought a range of advice on this. For the benefit of the Senate, I seek leave to table written advice from the Clerk on this matter, which 
 says that it is as certain as anything can be that the disallowance motion would be effective if passed.
Leave granted.
—Whilst not wanting in any way to imply that the Clerk or any of his advisers might ever be wrong on any matter such as this, given the way the law is, it was also suggested that it might be appropriate to seek a commitment from the minister that, if the disallowance motion were passed, the government would accept it as valid. I have had a number of conversations with the minister and his office to that effect and they have given that assurance. Given that a similar disallowance has occurred in the past, it is not surprising but, to ensure that there is absolutely no confusion, I record that commitment from the minister. If the minister's representative is able to acknowledge that in their comments, that would be of assistance.
Moving on to the substance of why I think it would be a good thing for this to be disallowed, I acknowledge at the start that matters such as these are difficult matters. The job of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs would be one of the more difficult in government, and I do not envy him his job in trying to wrestle with the very real and different competing issues. Basically, the government's argument about why it is necessary to prevent people from being able to work whilst they are on bridging visas seeking appeal or consideration of their case is that too many people are abusing the existing law to delay deportation. Whilst I do not doubt that there are some who are abusing the current circumstances, it is fairly debatable whether that is a majority of people. I would also suggest that one of the important aspects of good law-making or good regulation-making is ensuring as much as is humanly and legally possible that innocent people are not also punished via mechanisms that aim to catch people that are abusing the system or abusing the law, and I think very clearly that this is a case where that is occurring.
It is important to emphasise that the situation prior to this regulation coming into effect was not that of an automatic right to work. 
 People were granted the right to work as part of their bridging visa conditions only at the discretion of the minister or the department on grounds of need. It is important at a time when refugees and migrants have been under attack—especially from, but not limited to, the One Nation party and by others in the community in recent times—that we do look at the signals that we send out to the community about how we treat and how we perceive people who are seeking to get humanitarian visas or are seeking to migrate here. This is an issue where I believe some unfortunate signals are being sent.
However, far more important than signals is the real effect and the real impact on many people—people who are not rorters but who are simply trying to exercise their rights. It is worth emphasising again that people who seek to get access to a humanitarian visa may well be asylum seekers who might not fit the criteria—the criteria is not exactly the broadest criteria that you can think of—but that does not mean that because they are unsuccessful they are automatically trying to rort the system.
This regulation has been in effect since 1 July this year, so some of the impacts are already clear. We can already see what the effect is; it is not just speculation. I am sure that those senators who are participating in the debate today would have heard and received representations from a number of organisations who work on the ground—out in the community—on a daily basis with people who are seeking asylum. I would suggest, without wanting to speak on behalf of those groups, that they as much as anyone would like to see people who are abusing the system weeded out, because they have scarce resources. They know the difficulty and the time delays in getting applications determined, and they would be as keen as anyone to explore and to assist in the development of mechanisms that would weed out people who are abusing the system.
It seems to me—and it is the message I have been getting from those groups—that prior to these regulations being brought in there was very little consultation with those groups by the minister or by his department. 
 Perhaps some other mechanisms, which may have as much effect in discouraging people who are trying to abuse the system, could have been developed which would not have had the side effects or the collateral damage of affecting those people who were just seeking their legitimate rights.
The National Immigration Forum, a coalition of organisations which aims to promote just and accountable immigration law and policy for Australia, stated that the regulations were made without any consultation with organisations that represent asylum seekers. I think that is unfortunate. The effects of the new regulations are many. Many people are waiting determination of their appeals and they are going to be, or already are being, forced into destitution. Already they are not eligible for any social security, so being able to work is the only mechanism they have to try to support themselves and their families.
A further burden is going to be put on charities and community organisations, which, it is widely acknowledged, are already under a fair bit of stress, particularly in this sort of area. People who lose their right to work, their right to pay taxes and their access to the Medicare system will lose their access to health care as well. This can have major effects on the health of people who often, because of past experiences, are not in the best of health already. This impact is being compounded.
Many asylum seekers have been part of the Australian community for some time. They have Australian citizen children or are married to Australians. In many cases the applicant, regardless of whether they are married to an Australian or not, is the breadwinner of the family. Removing any opportunity for these people to work often affects not just the person but their family, forcing them into poverty. There is also the danger of people being forced into the black economy to support themselves and their families, obviously exposing them to exploitation by unscrupulous employers and to less favourable consideration of their applications if they are detected by the department of immigration. All those impacts are already occurring as a result of this regulation.
As well as outlining some of the theoretical or policy reasons why the Democrats believe this measure is not a good one, it is also important to look at some of the case studies, some of the actual impacts that are already occurring that have been identified by organisations that work with people out in the real world. I will mention a few of the case studies that have been provided by the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre.
One case is that of an asylum seeker who arrived in Australia in March 1995. He claimed refugee status from Iran on the basis of persecution he had suffered due to his political activities and religious beliefs. He alleges that in Iran he had been detained and severely tortured on three occasions. When this person arrived in Australia, not surprisingly he was somewhat distrustful and suspicious of people in authority. He did not disclose the totality of the mistreatment he had suffered in Iran and his case therefore was not believed and was rejected.
The Refugee Review Tribunal also rejected his case, basically disbelieving it. He is now awaiting the outcome of a request for the minister to intervene on humanitarian grounds. He has developed quite severe mental illness, which has been diagnosed as severe depression, and he has symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder. This person is on a bridging visa and is caught by the new provisions. He has no income and no eligibility for Medicare and hence is not able to afford the medication he requires for his mental illness. The hospital he attends has exhausted its ability to continue providing him for free with the necessary medication.
This person basically survives through the ad hoc provision of food parcels, food vouchers and transport tickets he obtains from a variety of welfare organisations. He is currently eating only one meal a day because he cannot afford to eat more regularly and, due to his mental illness and inability to afford transport, finds it difficult to access soup kitchens and some of the other limited assistance available. Whether or not that person's application is legitimate is something for the minister or the courts to determine, but I 
 suggest that it would be very unlikely that that person is simply someone trying to rort the system.
Another case is of a woman in Australia seeking asylum from persecution on the basis of her ethnicity in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Refugee Review Tribunal agreed that this woman's case presented very strong humanitarian reasons. However, it was unable to find that she faced treatment amounting to persecution for a convention reason. Hence, her refugee case was rejected quite legitimately, one assumes, on legal grounds. This person then sought humanitarian intervention from the minister and in July was granted a bridging visa without work rights, in accordance with this new regulation. She was thus forced to resign from her job. She faced complete destitution whilst awaiting the minister's response to her request.
After a month of struggle in early August the person returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina because she was unable to survive or support herself without permission to work. Again, if one is to go on the findings of the refugee tribunal, this person, who does have strong humanitarian reasons backing their case—regardless of whether or not it was a situation in which the minister may have found it appropriate to exercise his discretion on humanitarian grounds—has basically been forced back to their country of origin purely because they could not afford to survive here.
I will cite just one more case out of many; I will not go through too long a litany. A person arrived in Australia nearly 10 years ago and sought asylum in Australia from ethnic discrimination he suffered at home in Sri Lanka. He has since married an Australian citizen and the couple now have three children. His protection visa application was refused and by that stage he was barred by a section of the act from applying for a spouse visa. He had asked the minister to grant him a visa on humanitarian and public interest grounds and had, until this regulation changed, been the sole breadwinner for his family. Two of his children also suffer from chronic illness, requiring daily monitoring and medication. His wife also has serious health problems rendering her unable to work. This 
 man has had to cease work since his latest bridging visa expired, plunging the family into financial crisis.
My purpose is not to read out a litany of heart-rending cases, but simply to give a real picture of the situation that some families are facing. Those families and those people, it would seem to me, are very unlikely to be people who are simply trying to rort the system.
One other organisation that works with asylum seekers in my home state of Queensland, particularly in the Brisbane area, is the Asylum Seekers Centre. I think it is significant in terms of the perceptions they have—going back to what I said earlier about the signals and the messages that we are sending out to the broader community—that I draw attention to a briefing done by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid on the treatment of refugees in Australia in general.
The briefing identifies the increasing prevalence of restrictive measures and practices against asylum seekers as an issue of ongoing concern. Over the last three years, the rights and entitlements of asylum seekers have been significantly eroded. This has placed an increasing burden on community welfare and legal agencies to provide assistance for which they are not compensated. Perhaps one of those most worth noting is the 45-day limit for granting work permission, which was the subject of an unsuccessful disallowance motion in this place over 12 months ago.
I emphasise again that asylum seekers are denied access to most mainstream social services, including employment assistance and income support, English language classes, and health and education services. Often their ability to participate in community life in general is limited as a result of long periods of uncertainty about their status and, in many cases, because of regulations such as these which deny them permission to work.
I will briefly highlight why it should not be an automatic assumption that people are appealing just to delay things. Often the argument is put forward that the various appeals are very unlikely to be successful and that therefore it is just a delaying mechanism. Again, I am not denying that that is the case 
 in some circumstances, but to tar everyone with that brush is, I believe, most unjust.
Only a small proportion of refugee cases are appealed to the higher courts. Since July 1993—according to figures provided to me—7.5 per cent of tribunal decisions have been appealed to the courts. Whilst the government may claim that such appeals have no merit, Refugee Review Tribunal decisions were set aside in a significant 18 per cent of cases; 81 per cent of these were remitted, by consent, to the RRT for reconsideration and the remainder were determined by the court, that is, in almost one-fifth of appeals to the Federal Court the court or the parties agreed that the RRT's decisions were unlawfully made or needed to be revisited. Given the high stakes in refugee decisions—let us not forget that this is a major thing for the people involved in terms of the direction of their entire lives—these figures demonstrate how essential it is that the safeguard of judicial review remains.
I would also like to mention an article by Fiona Carruthers in the Australian on 23 November of this year which highlighted concerns about what is called `compassion fatigue', with members of the five-year-old Refugee Review Tribunal placing increasing pressure on applicants to prove their cases. The tribunal itself is also under pressure from the government to speed up the amount of time it spends assessing appeals. Last financial year, according to the article, the department granted protection visas to 52 per cent of Iraqi asylum seekers. However, on appeal, the RRT found that 93 per cent of Iraqi asylum seekers were refugees. Again, this demonstrates that just because a person has their case knocked back—at whatever level in the process—it does not automatically mean that there is no validity to their case or that they are somehow or other deliberately rorting the system.
I think it is probably illustrative to also look at the Prime Minister's recent insistence on once again pursuing the unconscionable mechanism of the privative clause, which the government tried to put through last year via Migration Amendment Bill (No. 5), which aims to remove the Federal Court's jurisdiction to review refugee and immigration 
 decisions. Certainly, I would suggest it is not unreasonable to put a construction on this particular regulation—in the absence of that privative clause going through the Senate, which I suggest is unlikely—that this rule is just another backdoor attempt to make it difficult or impossible for applicants to exercise review rights, because they cannot survive during the appeal process. It basically has the effect, if not the intent, of trying to starve people out.
In conclusion, I urge all senators to give support to this motion. I acknowledge that refugee law in particular is not easy but there has to be a better way than permitting—indeed, in this case, almost ensuring—that such hardship occurs.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-01,"—I rise on behalf of the opposition to indicate that we will be supporting the motion by Senator Bartlett that regulation 7.6 of the Migration Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1998 No. 210 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed. We will do so because we believe this is an unjustifiable and unnecessary change to procedures which in the end, if allowed to go through, are more likely to create injustice and exacerbate the possibility for injustices to be perpetrated against people in Australia applying for or waiting for their application for review to be considered by the appropriate bodies.
In the last week or so in this parliament, the opposition have supported the government. Only yesterday we supported them in Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 , which was previously called Migration Bill No. 4. It was passed yesterday with the opposition support. It dealt with changing and restructuring the judicial review processes so that they are speeded up and so that there is one review process rather than two committees, et cetera.
We took in good faith that, on balance, what the government was proposing was a reasonable process to support. We did not automatically believe it would solve all the problems. I do not think any process in this area will be perfectly agreeable or will work perfectly; there are too many variables and 
 too many occasions—on either side of the fence—for dispute. Matters of judgment, et cetera, will always have to be relied upon, no matter how carefully you structure these review processes.
But yesterday we gave the benefit of the doubt to the government and we supported that legislation. I took the opportunity to make a positive comment about the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock. He has a long history of support for human rights in this parliament, both as a member of the Parliamentary Amnesty International Group and in his role outside the parliament in supporting Amnesty International. I have to say that, on some occasions, he has been a very small minority in the Liberal Party in promoting those views over many years.
But one thing you would have to say is that Mr Ruddock has been a consistent supporter of human rights, without equivocation and without fear or favour. Some people are in favour of human rights only in those countries that have regimes that they are ideologically opposed to. They may go a bit soft on human rights in a regime that they think might be a bit more romantically attached to their view. Phil Ruddock is one of those who, without fear or favour in the past, has consistently argued that, no matter where you are, if it is a totalitarian regime of the left or of the right abusing human rights, that regime is to be tackled and argued against.
I would give Phil Ruddock the benefit of the doubt in many of these cases, but not on this one. This is a try-on that is just too rich to support. I do not know whether he got rolled in cabinet or whether the demons in the Department of Finance and Administration or in Treasury decided to try and find a way of reducing costs and said, `This is one way we are going to do it.' I would not put it past the Treasury officials and Finance officials to put this sort of thing on and have the cabinet direct the minister accordingly, because it does not fit with Phil Ruddock's long history of supporting human rights and refugee issues in this country and worldwide. I am a little surprised that the bill has his name as minister on it.
I have been thinking about some of the issues involved in this government proposing changes to supposedly tighten up and make more efficient the provisions of judicial review, applications for refugee status et cetera. I wonder if, unfortunately, some elements of the present coalition government are pushing these as a way to curry favour with the supporters of One Nation, people that have drifted away from the coalition to One Nation particularly in rural areas. We know what One Nation has been on about: they have been attacking migration, immigration levels and migrants—including refugees. If I remember correctly, the former leader of the One Nation Party made some comment before the last election about people who had been granted refugee status. It was said that once the particular problem had been resolved in their country the refugees, although they had been granted refugee status and had become citizens of Australia, would have to be sent back. That is a ludicrous proposition, but that is the level of thinking in One Nation.
I just hope that the coalition cabinet has not been cynically working out ways in which they can show that they have been rather tougher on refugees, migration, immigrants and migration intake levels so as to curry favour with some of those former coalition voters and supporters and get them back. I am not saying that did happen, but one cannot help but be a little cynical. Some of the material before us is unusual for someone with Phil Ruddock's long history to be proposing.
—Senator Schacht, it would be appropriate if you would refer to the minister by his proper name or as the minister.
—Phil Ruddock is his proper name, as I understood it.
—He is still Minister Ruddock.
—I have known him as Phil Ruddock so I don't think he'd be offended by my calling him Phil Ruddock. I wasn't bagging him. I wasn't calling him `desperate' or `a dope'—the usual phrases I use for my political enemies. Anyway, so it 
 is the honourable minister for immigration et cetera, Phil Ruddock. Is that okay?
—Please proceed, Senator Schacht.
—I am sure that, if we had proposed this when in government, the honourable minister would have been leading the charge publicly to attack us, saying that this was an attack on the human rights of people appealing et cetera. We would have been given by him and others a fair belting around the head. So all I can say is that we will oppose this.
Senator Bartlett has eloquently explained the details and has given eloquence to examples where people would be disadvantaged—and are being disadvantaged—if this regulation were allowed to stand. If only two or three of the examples that he gave stand, it is still disadvantaging innocent people. If it is true that someone has to go back to Bosnia to make a living, that is an appalling outcome. We might say that Bosnia has calmed down a bit. But the atrocities that have gone on in Bosnia over the last half-decade would indicate that, if someone has been forced back to Bosnia before their appeal has been completed because they cannot afford to live in Australia, that is appalling.
What happens if, unfortunately, there is an outbreak of fighting again—ethnic cleansing, communal fighting—and that person loses their life or suffers injury? What do we say? Do we say, `Oops, sorry, posthumously we will give your application approval and give you a nice wreath at the local cemetery'? What will the minister do then? I say that it is better for a hundred guilty people to go free than for one innocent person to go to gaol. I think we have always got to balance that in a democracy. Even if a couple of people rort the system and get away with it, I will put up with that if it means that we give the benefit of the doubt to a person who would otherwise have to go back to Bosnia to live—and earn a living—and run the risk of losing their life.
We are not asking that such people be given permanent residence in Australia. All we are asking is that, until the appeal process is completed, they have the right to work. They are not eligible for any social security 
 payment while they are here. We have knocked that off them—they cannot have that. So what are they going to do waiting for the appeal?
If the bureaucracy is slow or the minister does not want to deal with it and shuffles it off his desk or asks for more information, this could go on for weeks, months or years. What are they supposed to do? Borrow money from some crook moneylenders, or put themselves at the mercy of some charity,  charities already being overextended? That is just unfair. In a human society with some quality of life and civilisation about it, you would say that this example is unreasonable.
We believe that this regulation should be rejected strongly by the Senate and by the Australian parliament, therefore giving the government a very strong message. The legislation carried only a day or so ago makes the review process more expeditious and efficient. We have given the government an opportunity to reduce the time, to make it more efficient. Therefore, we do not think we need this regulation. If we do need it, give us more examples.
I do not know how many examples have been given of people who have been rorting. You can make the assertion that they are rorting, but let us get some examples on the record. We have had examples from Senator Bartlett of people who have, in our view and in his view, been unnecessarily and harshly treated and maybe have had their life put at risk. The phrase applicable to refugee status is `a justifiable fear of persecution'. That phrase, to me, always has a ring about it. It has a sting in it and should not be treated lightly. Just the same, in our country I think we would want to say that we have not been forcing people back. I know there will be some people who claim it, wrongly. They are probably economic refugees rather than political refugees, and we will have that debate as well.
Mr Acting Deputy President, knowing your knowledge in this area, I think that this Senate should strongly reject this regulation. The opposition will be voting that way. Until the government can come back with a much more detailed explanation of apparently why 
 the system is being rorted—so far they have not—this should be rejected. I commend Senator Bartlett's motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-01,"—Subregulation 7.6 has been introduced as a way of discouraging certain people from abusing the protection visa system in order to stay in Australia as long as possible with `permission to work' stamped in their passport, people who are lodging applications for appeal, knowing full well that they have no valid claim to stay in Australia permanently but relishing the opportunity to make money while they are here. I cannot deny these concerns. Australians already face enough difficulty finding employment without having to compete with individuals who have no legitimate right to be working in Australia.
The problem with subregulation 7.6 is that, in the process of deterring non-genuine applicants, the department is also deterring those who are genuine and in real need of an income while they await a decision. It is asylum seekers who are primarily affected by these changes. Asylum seekers with a valid case for residency will be stretched to the financial and emotional limit in order to survive in this country without an income, a legal one that is.
I heard Senator Schacht's good character reference for Minister Ruddock, but I wish his concerns in relation to fairness had also been here the other day when we dealt with character tests. We heard examples of people who are imprisoned as a means of torture and as a means of creating political pressure in their society. We would automatically have to argue that they have good character. We have already dealt with asylum seekers who have had their situation made more difficult even before they made their application for asylum in Australia.
What does this regulation look like for someone on the receiving end? It means that they are immediately placed in a bind. Either they pursue their legal right for review and suffer the consequences of not being able to support themselves or their family, in which case, they will have to rely instead on already overburdened charities just to meet their basic needs, or they may choose to work illegally, 
 despite all of the incumbent risks—exploitation by employers, possible cancellation of their bridging visa and mandatory detention by the department. Can you imagine the black mark saying `This person has broken the rules.' It could be used against them again and again to stop them accessing justice. Also, they could abandon their legal rights, regardless of the strength of their case. Senator Bartlett gave an example of a person who went back to Bosnia-Herzegovina basically because she had no ability to stay here any more. Is that the kind of country we aspire to?
It seems that somewhere along the way in these two scenarios basic human rights and justice have been lost. We do not have to hypothesise either that these scenarios, both of which act to the detriment of asylum seekers, will be the eventual outcome of subregulation 7.6. Those who deal with applicants on a daily basis are already seeing the heartache and destitution that is being caused right now. This is not a hypothetical argument.
The reality is that these changes do not affect only those who are denied the right to work; they affect members of the Australian community who will be forced to support those applicants. They affect charitable organisations, community groups, church groups, family members and compassionate individuals who recognise that, without any form of income, these people will become destitute. Perhaps part of the purpose is to try to deter the community from taking action on basic human rights issues.
The reality also is that the majority of asylum seekers have enormous difficulties finding work anyway. Even if work permission were granted to all asylum seekers, this would mean an income for only a minority. It should be remembered that only a bit more than a year ago, on 1 July 1997, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs introduced harsh new regulations in this area. These regulations denied work permission to asylum seekers who had not lodged their application for a protection visa within 45 days of arriving in Australia. We know that there are a number of reasons why people do 
 not feel comfortable in the system. They do not feel confident enough to give the truthful reason why they had to come to Australia.
Already, a large number of those with bridging visas are denied the right to work during the departmental and tribunal stages of their case. If permission to work is going to be denied for the entirety of the decision making process, one wonders how any applicant could survive.
To work in Australia is not a luxury for genuine refugee applicants. It is not a luxury that they can take or leave. Being ineligible for social security, asylum seekers and others in possession of a bridging visa E depend on the opportunity to work in order to survive, to meet their basic needs until a final decision is made on their application. We cannot categorically deny them this right because opportunistic applicants may choose to ride the system. But as has been mentioned by other speakers, we have not had overwhelming evidence from the department that what is happening is opportunistic.
All of this is not to deny the numerous responsibilities we have to these applicants under international agreements—responsibilities which, we believe, are being severely compromised by the proposed subregulation. The provision of a basic standard of living is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol confer an obligation on the Australian government to ensure that asylum seekers, in particular, enjoy a basic standard of living whilst waiting for a decision on their application.
Subregulation 7.6 is already proving a cruel and widespread contravention of these basic principles in the daily lives of asylum seekers. How could we continue with legislation that is so blatantly unjust? In how many other areas is Australia prepared to act as the international pariah in human rights?
So what is an alternative to introducing this non- discriminating and unjust regulation? An alternative is to retain what the department had before 1 July 1998, which was to keep 
 open the possibility of applicants being able to work based on their individual circumstances; to leave discretionary power in the hands of departmental officers, to grant work permission on a needs basis. This has proven an effective means so far of identifying and dealing with those considered to be non-genuine applicants in their search for money making.	The National Immigration Forum, in its submission of 14 July 1998, concluded:
The removal of the discretion to grant permission to work is inhumane and does not appear to meet any legitimate policy objective. Rather, it will operate to deter people from pursuing a course of action (""ministerial appeals"") which the Minister himself encourages people to use as an alternative to judicial review.
I add that it would also deter people from pursuing their legal right to appeal through the courts. If a person is genuinely fearing the prospect of returning to their country, it is understandable that they will exhaust all avenues for remaining in Australia. We should not be placing insurmountable barriers to their efforts to do this. I urge the Senate to support Senator Bartlett's motion. I commend him for putting it to the Senate and I would like the government to rethink this unfair and unjust regulation.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-12-01,"—I rise to indicate that the government opposes the motion to disallow regulation 7.6 of Statutory Rules 1998 No. 210. Before these changes came into effect on 1 July 1998, a bridging visa E included a permission to work entitlement for those people who had an unfinalised request for ministerial intervention or application for judicial review.
This regulation is trying to overcome the problem of an entitlement to work encouraging abuse of the protection visa and ministerial intervention processes. It is not a small problem. Requests for ministerial intervention are averaging about 400 cases a month, whilst there may be as many as 30 or more judicial review applications made each week.
The government believes that some of these applicants simply want to delay their departure for as long as possible in order to maximise their opportunity to work here. They 
 seem to expect that they should continue to be allowed to work in order to fund their litigation against the Australian government, which itself is instigated only to delay their departure.
—Some; what about the others?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I sat in absolute silence while Senator Margetts was speaking. It is important to recognise that by the time people reach the stage of seeking ministerial intervention or judicial review, applicants will already have had their claims thoroughly considered three times.
Some of the speakers today intimated that they are concerned that these people are being denied merits review. That is not the case. People will have had their claims thoroughly considered three times. The department will have considered their substantive visa application, an independent review tribunal will have considered their application for review and the department will have again considered whether any special circumstances exist that could justify ministerial intervention. This is done whether or not the applicant requests the minister's intervention.
I repeat: there are three processes. The people affected by these changes will have failed to demonstrate the merits of their claims at all of these three stages. I point out to the Senate that this is not a small problem. In the last financial year, there were over 8,000 applications for protection visas. About 90 per cent of those 8,000 applications were unsuccessful at both the primary and the review stages. The government is therefore assessing and addressing a very significant issue with these regulations. We are saying to these applicants, `By all means pursue your cases on their merits,' but at the same time we are attempting to reduce the incentive for abuse of the system.
I will comment on two of the things that Senator Schacht said when he talked again about Minister Ruddock's commitment to human rights. Every time we discuss these issues—this is the third time in the last two sitting weeks—we discuss the merits of the individual against Australian society or the 
 merits of individual against individual. We must always remember that there are tens of thousands of legitimate refugees who have been identified by the UNHCR as eligible for resettlement, including refugees from Iran, whom Senator Bartlett mentioned. We take 4,000 refugees out of a total humanitarian program of 10,000.
Every person who comes via this method, who is not legitimate, denies a person who is legitimately applying as a UNHCR-assessed refugee. Again, we have the problem that Senator Schacht referred to before of balancing one right against another. In this case, it is the rights of one individual against those of another. Senator Bartlett referred to a case of someone having been here for 10 years. Yes, there are cases of people who have overstayed a visitor's visa and have had a family here. I do not know the details of the case that Senator Bartlett was referring to, but if a person has overstayed a visa and may be an illegal resident, what rights do they have compared with the rights of someone who is legitimately in a UNHCR queue? They are some of the decisions that have to be made. I also found incredibly offensive, appalling and disgraceful Senator Schacht's imputation that this was an attempt to curry favour with One Nation voters. That was totally unacceptable and uncalled for, and it does not need any more comment.
The government believes that many people who seek judicial review of migration decisions are simply abusing the judicial process. This is evidenced by the large number of people who withdraw from, or discontinue, their court applications. Over the last few years, the rate at which applicants have withdrawn from immigration cases prior to a substantive hearing has been over 30 per cent. At times that number has been almost 50 per cent. A smaller number simply failed to appear before the court. The effect of this is that people with legitimate grievances are disadvantaged by the growing queue of cases to be heard in the courts. Again there is this balance between the rights of those who are legitimately applying for review and those who are using it as a mechanism to stay in Australia longer.
In addition the large number of frivolous judicial review applications also delays the ability of the minister to intervene in meritorious cases. These amendments are about removing some of the main incentives for people to use judicial review and requests for ministerial intervention merely as devices to prolong their stay in Australia. Of course the government does recognise that there are legitimate entitlements for individuals to take their grievances before the courts; however, we also know that there is a growing and lucrative business for some legal practitioners.
The most recent development in migration law has been the launching of class actions in the Federal Court. These are becoming an increasingly attractive and relatively inexpensive avenue for people determined to stay here by any means. The minister described one of the latest scams during question time in the House of Representatives on 11 November. The scams involve solicitors and migration agents signing up individuals to a class action for a small fee and encouraging those people to lodge repeat section 417 requests for ministerial intervention. So you find them putting in repeat after repeat section 417 requests. These people are then able to remain lawful on a bridging visa until such time as the court proceedings are finalised. In one class action 670 people paid $500 each to legal advisers, which amounts to $300,000 to pursue one legal case over a couple of days in court. The department is aware of six immigration class actions involving a total of about 5,000 people. If each of these people is being charged a similar amount, then millions of dollars are involved.
If Senator Bartlett's motion is successful, the organisers of these scams and their not-so-innocent clients will be given a very encouraging message. To address these abuses of process, these amendments introduce the `no-work condition' for bridging visa Es granted to people seeking judicial review or ministerial intervention. This also leads to a loss of access to medicare benefits in most instances. Despite the loss of medicare benefits, there is no prospect of state hospitals refusing treatment in emergency cases. Payment for the cost of such treatment would be 
 a private matter between the person and the hospital involved.
This amendment therefore removes both of the main incentives for people to try to rort the system merely to prolong their stay in Australia. As I said before, if this regulation is disallowed, the Senate will be sending an encouraging message to those people who want to abuse the system by, for example, organising or joining class actions with little or no legal merit. Again I make the point that these bridging visa holders have already had three bites of the cherry. They have had three processes of review. They are people who have had their cases assessed on a merit basis on at least three occasions.
A further point is that the vast majority of these people came to Australia on tourist visas with the no-work condition. Seventy-seven per cent of these people arrived as visitors, six per cent arrived as students and the rest were other means. A significant number had already overstayed their visas before they even bothered to seek permission to remain in this country. Thirteen per cent were overstayers at the time of original application and nearly a quarter had overstayed for more than 12 months. These people really should have no expectation that work or Medicare entitlements will be available to them in Australia, particularly after the merits of their case have been considered three times.
On a final note, these regulations have now been in force for close on six months. Only a small number of complaints about the mandatory imposition of the no-work condition were received initially, and very few complaints are now being received. If there were a large number of very genuine cases I would imagine that, given the hundreds we are dealing with, there would have been more. I have been advised that regional offices of the department that have a ministerial intervention caseload initially reported dissatisfaction about the amendments from clients and employers. However, when the regulations were explained there was a general acceptance of the government's position. If the community has a problem with these amendments, it would appear to be one more of perception 
 than of reality. I urge all senators not to support Senator Bartlett's motion.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1998-12-01,"—It is probably worth while making the point at this juncture in the debate that the Senate is not discussing the merits review procedures for people seeking protection in Australia or seeking the advantage of a ministerial discretion. We are actually looking at something much narrower than that, but I will address my remarks to both aspects, because both aspects have been raised by various speakers in the debate—not the least of whom was the parliamentary secretary who just concluded.
We are discussing a motion of Senator Bartlett relating to:
the disallowance of regulation 7.6 of the migration regulations amendment as contained in statutory rules 1998 No. 210 and made under the Migration Act 1958.
It is a very narrow aspect of the whole debate on the humanitarian entry of people into this country and of the ability of people to remain in this country. It is really the matter of whether or not an individual who is awaiting a decision on their application for protection in Australia—be it from the judiciary or from the exercise of a ministerial discretion—ought to be able to work. And I join with my colleague Senator Schacht who outlined the opposition's case when he spoke this afternoon to support the motion by Senator Bartlett.
I think this is another indication of where the government has gone too far in the regulations. The parliamentary secretary raised the very recent two debates that we have had on migration in this parliament—yesterday and on Wednesday last week when we discussed conduct and character. At the time the minister announced what was going to happen on character and conduct, we said, `You are going too far.' It was proved here on Wednesday of last week when the government themselves admitted they were going too far by adopting the proposition that had been put forward by the opposition. They had acted in opposition to what their own committee members had put forward in the Senate committee report. That procedure was repeat 
 ed here again yesterday. I am saying to the Senate that there are times when the government can get it wrong. There are times when even a minister, Minister Philip Ruddock, can get it wrong, as was proved on two occasions. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I put it to the parliament, that we are actually going too far on this regulation.
I accept—and I think the opposition accepts—that there is a difficulty and a problem. There are those who seek to enter our community who seek to exploit our generosity. More importantly, there are those who seek to exploit people who are vulnerable in our community. The parliamentary secretary mentioned the matter of the class actions that are going on. I am not going to talk about the merits of the class actions; it is for another body to discuss whether or not they are valid. But if there is a difficulty with the class actions and the behaviour of lawyers in that process, there are legal bodies whom we ought to take that matter up with: the law societies around this country. We should be addressing them if the lawyers are behaving inappropriately. We do not crack the nut with a sledgehammer. Let us address the issue. If it is migration agents that are the problem in the class actions, if they are behaving inappropriately, if they are breaking, stretching, or abusing the law, we have set up an authority to deal with them too: MARA, the Migration Agents Regulation Authority. And that is where that one should go to.
In speaking to this disallowance motion this evening, my objection is not the fact that people who are seeking to exploit our generosity ought to be given automatic work rights; I think that there ought to be the ability for some individuals to have the right to work in genuine cases.
I have confidence in the decision making process within the department and within the tribunals—be it the IRT or the Refugee Review Tribunal. In saying that I have confidence in those decision makers, I also accept that sometimes they get it wrong. I do that on a professional basis where, as a public representative, as a member of parliament, I assist clients to take cases before the various tribunals. Sometimes one offers them advice that 
 they need to contact a lawyer if they are taking a case to the judiciary. Sometimes the department makes mistakes and the review body overturns those decisions. It does not happen very often—Senator Patterson has just outlined the statistic to us. I think 10 per cent was a success rate in the tribunals.
But even with the 90 per cent that are set aside, some go on for the minister to exercise his discretion. I know, I am sure the parliamentary secretary knows, I am sure the departmental representatives know—that there are occasions when the minister accepts the case being put before him and exercises his discretion to overturn previous cases, be it for new information or whatever reason the case came forward. What concerns me, as my colleague Senator Schacht outlined earlier in the debate, is what is happening to the genuine people who are in the process. What is happening to them if this regulation is allowed to stand? There is no social security available to them. In many cases, they do not have family members whom they can rely on for support. In some instances, with some of the newer communities in Australia, there is no community support, or very little community support, as was outlined in one of the cases histories that Senator Bartlett put to the chamber.
One thing they have been able to do in the past—and that is up until July this year—is to work. And that will enable some of them to keep body and soul together. When we are talking about work, we are not talking about them moving into the top professional jobs at $100,000 a year or whatever; generally it is menial manual labour that the people have been involved in, and probably even exploited in as well. It is a discretionary thing that is available to them. If their case is not seen to be genuine, they do not have an automatic entitlement, as I understand—and I may be corrected on that—to be granted a work visa, to be granted the $30 visa. That is where I think we need to address the problem. We need to have the ability—and I think our decision makers, whom I have great confidence in, ought to have the ability—to make a discretionary decision as to whether or not an individual should have the right to work if 
 there is no other means by which they can support themselves.
I say that for a number of reasons—I have outlined the reasons for the individual. But I say it also for the sake of our community. What happens to an individual when they are starving? One of the inherent human traits is that we all wish to survive. If someone is not eating they will resort to other means in order to be able to eat. Senator Schacht referred to the black economy and there are proven instances where people have moved into that area. But there are others who might be encouraged to move into a life of crime. And that crime will be against lawful Australian citizens. We should not be pushing people that far. I have faith in the discretion and the expertise of the officers in the department and the various tribunals. We can work this through in a different way for the protection of everybody.
It is a problem but we can correct the problem. Let us look directly at the problem. If the problem is people abusing the system, let us take steps to avoid the abuse. Let us tackle it directly. I do not think we need to take a sledgehammer, as I said before, to crack the nut. This is going too far. We do need to be cognisant of the difficulties that individuals are faced with in our community.
I do agree with the comments of the parliamentary secretary when she said that we should be looking out for the genuine asylum seeker. I know, and this parliament knows, that there have been people in the past who have sought to exploit our generosity in this area. That is unforgivable. It is how you measure it. A merits review system in which we have faith is the way to go. That is the track to go down in order to resolve the problem. If there are people who seek to exploit it, let us have a go at them. Let us get the MIRA operating. Let it examine what some migration agents are doing. Let us make a formal complaint to the law councils of Australia about lawyers encouraging individuals to take part in migration scams in this country. I have seen the adverts, as well.
If there are scams let us directly attack them. Let us not hide behind them and perhaps force individuals and dependants of 
 individuals into lives of destitution or possibly even crime in this country. This is not a good regulation. It is going too far and I hope that the Senate, when it votes on this matter very shortly, will disallow it.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,14,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-12-01,"—in reply—I thank all senators for their contributions. I do recognise most of the problems and concerns that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs outlined in her contribution as issues that the government is trying to address by this regulation. But I do say again that surely there must be a better way of addressing those problems than through this regulation.
It is worth repeating, to remind the Senate and those listening, that under the set-up that applied prior to 1 July when this regulation came into force people did not have the automatic right to work when they were on bridging visas. They could only work on bridging visas at the discretion of the minister or the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. This operated and was applied only to those who could demonstrate a compelling need to work—which basically meant financial hardship. So it was not an open door or an open slather operation.
It is also worth emphasising again that, even under the previous situation, that did not apply to everybody. There is already a number of asylum seekers without any income or access to health care, and that will not change if this motion to disallow is supported. Protection visa applicants who do not apply within 45 days of arrival already have the no-work condition automatically imposed whatever kind of bridging visa they have.
Whilst the parliamentary secretary drew attention to that as a way of saying that people come here on tourist visas and just cannot be bothered to apply for 45 days or more—and I do not want to revisit the debate the Senate had on this over 12 months ago—there are clearly circumstances in individual situations where there are quite legitimate reasons why people do not apply within those first 45 days. Nonetheless, the point I make is that, in the absence of this regulation, there is no open door or automatic right for people 
 to get work rights and access to Medicare just by applying for refugee status, seeking to appeal to the courts or seeking ministerial discretion. Surely the existing set-up provided some scope for the minister to minimise abuse of the system.
Amongst other things, this measure is against the spirit, if not the legality, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child because it clearly denies basic health care to a number of children who, through no fault of their own, are put in a situation where they are not able to access basic health care or their family is not able to afford basic health care or even in some cases adequate nutrition.
Returning to the issue of balance and the sorts of things that all of us have to wrestle with in trying to act as responsible members of parliament, it is somewhat ironic that this motion seeks to protect the rights of the individual, which are clearly being significantly reduced by this measure, and it is a Liberal government that is seeking to reduce the rights of the individual and justify it as being necessary for society as a whole. Be that as it may, clearly the evidence that has been produced already from the community is that a number of those individuals are being very severely impacted and quite unjustly so.
It is true, of course, that in this difficult area we cannot simply take a bleeding heart approach. Given the number of potential legitimate refugees around the globe, we cannot simply open our doors to every single person who may be legitimate. People may often be in a situation where they do have to go back to Bosnia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Iran or wherever—often in circumstances of great hardship and great sadness. These are very hard decisions which often have to be made. The very least that those people should be able to expect is that they can exercise their legal rights, as they apply, in Australia.
If the government wants to remove or alter those rights, then surely they should introduce direct legislation to alter those rights, rather than a back door method such as this. Those rights exist under current legislation that the parliament has agreed to, which was put forward by whatever government of the day. If this government wants to alter those rights, 
 they should do so via the direct route of introducing legislation and allowing the parliament to consider it.
In many ways, this legislation subverts the intention of the parliament when it developed the existing rights under the Migration Act 1958 and related acts. If, as the parliamentary secretary said, the government is happy to allow all people to appeal and exercise their legal rights, I ask why the Prime Minister is saying that he will once again seek to reintroduce legislation which—assuming that it is constitutionally valid—will dramatically remove the rights of many people to appeal their case to the court.
As the parliamentary secretary said, when people get to the stage of appealing to the court or seeking ministerial discretion, it is already after a number of reviews have been conducted—three bites of the cherry, as she said. But clearly the fact is that a not insignificant number of people do succeed on appeal to the courts—or, for that matter, in asking the minister to exercise his discretion—so it is not just a futile process. Clearly, there are a number of people—not 100 per cent of those who appeal; far from it—whose exercise of those rights is successful and who are legally entitled to stay in Australia. Those people were obviously very wise to pursue their legal rights and entitlements because they were proven right in the end. I repeat that the use of a back door measure of this kind to prevent people exercising their rights—whether by simply starving them out of the country or by denying them access to adequate resources—discriminates against poorer people and is clearly inappropriate.
The parliamentary secretary made the point that most asylum seekers originally come to Australia on visitor visas. It is true that many do. But for most genuine asylum seekers, as well as those who are seeking to rort the system, a visitor visa is the only way that they can get into Australia to apply for asylum. To suggest that somehow the use of that mechanism is an indication of ill intent or illegitimacy of their asylum claim is, I think, a bit mistaken.
As Senator Patterson said, this regulation is aimed at trying to overcome the problem of 
 abuse. I do not doubt that, at least to a large extent, it is a genuine intent of the government and the minister in this regard. But, surely, given all the ability, talent and resources available in the government and the department, and—I remind the minister and the government—the great degree of talented people out in the community as well who work with asylum seekers and who would also be very keen to have the system rid of people who are trying to rort it, there must be a better way of trying to address this problem.
Senator Patterson also said that some applicants want to delay their departure via these means simply so they can get work. That is clearly the case and no-one denies it. But, again, surely an equal—if not much larger—number of people are not delaying their departure for that purpose; they are delaying their departure—if we must use that phrase—because they are trying to pursue their legal rights to seek asylum in Australia.
Regardless of the outcome of this motion, I would urge the government to consult with groups out in the community more widely than, perhaps, may have occurred in this case; to try to work with them a bit more to meet that common aim we all have of reducing misuse of the system; but to try to minimise the hardship of innocent individuals in that process.
There is much about life that is random chance. I think all of us in Australia, and particularly those of us in this parliament, have had a pretty good roll of the dice in life compared to a lot of other people in many other parts of the world. Not being satisfied with that, this parliament often seeks to rewrite the rule book even further in our favour.
In the case of this regulation, we are not even satisfied with doing that—we want to give the losers even fewer avenues and rights of appeal. We need to keep that in mind when we are looking at balancing rights and opportunities. Perhaps we need to try to err a little on the side of humanity in the balance we give to the rights and entitlements of various people.
In conclusion, I once again urge all senators to support this motion. I recognise that the 
 government is seeking to address a real problem. It is an issue of balance but I think, clearly, in this case they have got the balance wrong.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-12-01,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This second report of the Medical Training Review Panel deals with the situation that has occurred since legislation was passed in this place stopping certain medical practitioners from obtaining their provider numbers. The idea was that they had to have more training before they were provided with those numbers. So they can still practise, but they have to undertake further training before they are recognised as medical practitioners of such skill as to entitle them to have provider numbers.
Senator Eggleston would know all about this. I think he is going to speak on this report. The report tells the public how many places are open for training. On page 19, at table 1, it sets out the current number of recognised vocational training positions/programs and likely numbers of vocational training places to be offered for commencement in 1999 by discipline in a medical college. It goes down the various colleges, including the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. What worries me is that the numbers that are provided for seem to be quite moderate, given the fact that there is a shortage of doctors, particularly in rural Australia. In another part of the report you can see the number of female doctors who are advanced surgical trainees, and it sets out numbers by surgical specialty. I notice that in cardiothoracic surgery, for example, there are 29 trainees and one of those is a female trainee.
The interesting thing about these numbers is that they are simply put forward as numbers that describe a situation without there being any analysis of what all this means in terms of the medical treatment given to Australians. What I would like to have seen, and I am sure people around Australia would 
 like to have seen, from this report is some analysis as to whether or not the needs that Australians have for medical practitioners are being met, particularly in the country. For example, Tasmania, your state, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, is one of the great states of this Commonwealth. It is often neglected, but it was one of the early states to be settled and is one of the outstanding states of this Commonwealth. It would be interesting to know whether Tasmanian people are well provided for in terms of doctors in the country—down the west coast, for example. Again, are there enough doctors in the Northern Territory, particularly in the regions away from the main cities? Even in Victoria, the state that I represent, are there enough doctors around the various parts of that state, in the north-west, in the south-east down through Gippsland or in the Mallee?
That is what this report should be talking about. Though it has set out tables, it has not set them out in such a way as to enable us as a Senate and to enable the people of Australia to see whether or not all parts of Australia have been properly provided with doctors. When we have the third report next year, let us hope that the panel gives us a greater analysis than it has on this occasion.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Medical Training Review Panel</title>,Documents,15,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1998-12-01,"—I am interested in this report because the Medical Training Review Panel came out of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry at the end of 1996 into Medicare provider code numbers. Some of the senators on that committee found it very difficult to determine exactly the number of people in training. There were all sorts of vague ideas but nobody really seemed to have any hard data. One of the motivations for establishing this Medical Training Review Panel was the view of some members of the Community Affairs Committee that there was a need for there to be a Commonwealth body which had a supervisory or overview role on medical training in Australia so that some estimation could be made of whether or not the medical manpower needs of Australia were being met. Senator Cooney has referred to whether or not there are enough doctors in training in various specialties, and in general 
 practice, to meet the medical needs of Australia.
I am very pleased to see that this Medical Training Review Panel is progressing in the way that it has. As Senator Cooney says, it does provide very accurate data on the number of people in training, especially in specialties. It had been a problem to determine the number of people in specialist training. Specialist training tends to be a responsibility of the states through the state hospital systems, whereas general practitioner training has been very much an area that the federal government has an interest in through funding the Family Medicine program.
It is now possible, by looking at the data in this report, to see how many people are being trained and where they are being trained. That provides, as I said, very important information in terms of medical manpower requirements around Australia. Compared with other countries like the United Kingdom and European countries, Australia has for some time lacked the kind of data which those countries have had as a matter of course on medical manpower needs. I think it is very important that we do address the requirement to place specialists in various areas according to need and population requirement rather than proceeding in the rather ad hoc fashion that we have in the past.
One of the other functions of the Medical Training Review Panel is to provide an appeal mechanism for people who have reason to feel some disquiet or concern about their non-inclusion in specialist training programs or about being dropped from specialist training programs—after doing several years of specialist training—and not being able to complete their training. There had been some suggestion that some of these specialist colleges, which are the examining bodies, acted to some extent as closed shops and that they restricted the number of people who came through the system. It is interesting that a chapter in the report is concerned with appeals from people who are undergoing training in the Australian training system run by the royal colleges.
It is interesting that in the United States, while people may train under, say, the Ameri 
 can college of physicians or surgeons or gynaecologists or dermatologists, they do State Board exams in specialties as well as National Board exams, and these exams are conducted independently of the colleges concerned. This means that there is an independent body providing accreditation and examinations for persons to qualify as specialists in the United States. There had been some discussion in some quarters that a system like that might be a good thing in Australia. Our tradition has been to work through these royal colleges, but it is probably appropriate that those colleges and their examination systems be subject to review by this Medical Review Training Panel.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,1998-12-01,"—I rise tonight to speak about one of Australia's great industries, one that embodies the colourful history of Australia and some of its great characters. I am talking about the wool industry and I would like to tell the chamber tonight about a meeting that took place in the small New South Wales town of Goulburn yesterday, where 1,600 wool growers voted for a new beginning for their industry. They voted to reclaim their industry and their future.
The debate was energetic and at times quite colourful. As you would expect, it was a good-natured debate. Farmers are almost always very polite. But there was no doubt about why the hundreds of men and women had driven thousands of kilometres from all around Australia and had gathered at Goulburn. They wanted to take part in the vote to put their industry into the 21st century. And they did, by overwhelmingly passing a motion of no confidence in the board of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, known as AWRAP. The board has now stood aside and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr Vaile) will soon make new appointments.
The wool industry today is at a crucial crossroad, and the fresh start that growers 
 have voted for may indeed be the last chance for this great industry. The no-confidence motion resulted from a widespread view by growers that their wool tax funds had been squandered and that the board lacked the vision and the long-term strategy to be able to stem the decline in the wool market and to provide a new vision to increase demand and therefore price. Growers at the meeting repeatedly said they wanted to give agriculture minister Mark Vaile a clean sheet to begin planning for a new approach to the industry and to the development and, importantly, the promotion of wool.
A South Australian wool grower, Mr Peter Morgan, put the situation simply and quite colourfully when he said the industry had unsuccessfully tried to make a silk commercial purse from a bureaucratic sow's ear, where producers were at the wrong end of the market chain to promote wool. Wool promotion was, he argued, as much the responsibility of the manufacturer as it was of the growers.
Growers speaking in favour of the no-confidence motion claimed that AWRAP had spent too much time on promoting itself and not enough on promoting the product. They argued that there needed to be a report of the organisation's activities to determine where wool growers could improve their returns. They recognised that wool needed to be promoted more effectively.
They naturally feel frustrated that in the last 28 years $8 billion has been spent on wool promotion and yet wool is almost at one of the lowest prices of recent years and market share for wool growers is declining. They rejected the argument put by some that the no-confidence motion would reduce consumer confidence or that it would pose a financial risk to growers.
Wool growers did not come to this decision overnight. The seeds of this discontent were sown in the aftermath of the collapse of the reserve price scheme at the start of this decade and over the recent years of roller-coaster price fluctuations. So why did the growers feel such a sense of anger and frustration at this Goulburn meeting? I believe it was that frustration that led to growers decid 
 ing that they would not even question the chairman of the board or the chief executive of AWRAP on the financial documents or the annual report presented. They came to debate the motion of no confidence and they simply wanted to get on with it.
Since the 1990s, the wool industry has been managing the reduction of a wool stockpile from 4.7 million bales and a debt of $2.7 billion. The official stockpile has now fallen to just over one million bales but there are, of course, around 850,000 more bales of wool in the woolsheds of Australia. Growers are also under increasing pressure as a result of the Asian crisis and the weakening European demand which has further pushed down wool prices. In fact, demand for wool has fallen in the past eight years from about 1,900 million kilograms a year to just over 1,500 million kilograms a year. Wool has never regained the 870c per kilo set in the dying days of the reserve price scheme and, as we all know, in recent weeks it has fallen to below 500c a kilo.
So where to now for the industry? It seems that new arrangements for the industry must contain at least three important principles. Firstly, there must be a performance audit of the board's activities to ensure that growers can see where Woolmark has succeeded, and where it has failed, and how growers have benefited from the research and development in dollar terms.
Secondly, the change process must be managed effectively. There must be a truly independent task force at arm's length from the retiring board. The chair must be clearly committed to change in the industry structure and culture, with a team comprising a careful mix of those with a knowledge of business and, of course, the wool industry itself. Thirdly, and most importantly, the process must be customer focused; business like in its approach, with clear and concise links between producer and customer; and with grower controls of levies and contestability of funding.
The minister for agriculture has undertaken to appoint a new chairman for AWRAP within 30 days and to establish a future directions task force for the wool industry. I 
 am optimistic that wool growers can move forward with renewed confidence that there will be increased grower participation in the future decisions taken by the new AWRAP board and its industry activities. The aim will be to build on and sustain wool demand and to improve wool grower productivity. These are key challenges that the industry faces and they will ensure a long-term and more profitable future for the industry.
Yesterday's vote was a milestone in the democratic processes of the wool industry. For me it was a historic day and I am sure it also was for those hundreds of families who travelled from all around Australia to attend the Goulburn meeting. I was honoured to attend that meeting and to be part of the proceedings. Growers, in taking responsibility for their industry's future directions and for its reform, have made a courageous decision to look boldly to the future of one of Australia's most important agricultural industries, one which embodies some of our nation's greatest characters.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Wool Industry</title>,Adjournment,16,1
