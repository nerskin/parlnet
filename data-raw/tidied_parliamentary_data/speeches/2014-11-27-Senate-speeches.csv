Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (09:33):  The government will not be supporting the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014. I will go through first broadly what the bill does and also the Greens' proposed amendment, which we will not be supporting either. I will go through some of the reasons why we take a different approach on this issue.


The bill amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to repeal a sunset provision and enable the minister to establish an independent expert panel to conduct an assessment of the potential environmental impacts of a declared commercial fishing activity and to prohibit the declared fishing activity while the assessment is undertaken. On the Greens' proposed amendment, I will quote from Senator Whish-Wilson:


The Greens have put up an amendment to ban supertrawlers and vessels with freezing capacity over 2,000 tonnes. That is a globally recognised tonnage of fish that is being looked at by groups right around the world.


He goes on:


We consider that we need separate legislation for any size over that.


He goes on:


We would ask that Labor, through Senator Ludwig, who brought this forward, consider a proper amendment that will ban this type of fishing activity in this country once and for all. This is what millions of rec—


recreational—


fishermen across this country want—


apparently, according to Senator Whish-Wilson.


We do not agree with the Greens and we do not agree with the Labor Party on this issue. The reason the government opposes this bill as well as the amendments is that the amendments will have no effect on the recently expired or current declaration made under the now lapsed legislation. We support commercial, recreational and Indigenous fishers and are committed to the continuation of Australia's well-managed fisheries. The coalition has confidence in the sustainability of Australian fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. We will make any decisions regarding fisheries management based on the science. We will not be rushed. We will consider the expert panel report in its entirety and make appropriate decisions.


The government is aware of the concern among a range of groups, including recreational fishers, about the potential impact of supertrawlers on Australia's marine environment, protected species and local fish stocks. We intend to build public confidence in the fishery and fisheries management more generally. Commercial fishing has to be both environmentally and economically sustainable.


Agreeing to this bill would mean that the Minister for the Environment could declare any fishing activity at any time, and who knows what a future environment minister might do with that? For instance, he or she, in future, might consider that there is uncertainty associated with small rowboats and declare them, which would then mean that an expert panel would be established to investigate the matter, all at the cost of the taxpayer. Senator Ludwig is only bringing this back now, we believe, to play cheap wedge politics, and the Greens, not surprisingly, are jumping on the bandwagon.


Now I want to go back to Labor's record on this issue and their hypocrisy on this issue. It was Tony Burke, in his role as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who created this issue by inviting these types of vessels as part of his 2009 Small Pelagic Fishery Harvest Strategy. I quote:


… there are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels.


That is from page 2 of the Small Pelagic Fishery Harvest Strategy, from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority in 2009. Indeed, the former minister proudly trumpeted:


This is the first time a trawler with a storage capacity of 2000 tonne or more is likely to operate in an Australian fishery …


Then, as the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke completely bungled the development and introduction of the declared fishing activities bill in September 2012. This legislation was so bad that it needed amendment within hours of introduction. Labor clearly did not understand fisheries or fisheries management. Their bill initially banned recreational charter vessels. The declared fishing activities amendment was so bad that there was a 12-month sunset clause to kill it off.


As I said earlier, Senator Ludwig is bringing this back now to play cheap politics, notwithstanding that appalling history of mismanagement of this issue by the Labor Party and particularly by the former minister. But we know, in fact, that Senator Ludwig did once stand up for Australian fisheries. I quote from then Minister Ludwig in August 2012, responding to a Greens motion:


This disallowance motion is a message that the Greens political party do not support sustainable catch limits based on science.


Agreed. He continued:


It is a message that says the Greens want fisheries managed by politics, not qualified fisheries managers.


Well, we agree. He continued:


And it says that the Greens do not support the commercial operators who fish in some of the world's best managed fisheries.


He went on:


That message should be well understood, because I have no doubt that the same disregard for the science and management of our commercial fisheries will be extended to the legitimate pursuit of recreational fishing. As minister for fisheries—


this was Senator Ludwig saying this at the time—


I will not allow the emotive politics of the Greens political party to run fisheries management policy in this country. We will ensure that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is independent, that it makes independent decisions based on the science through its expert commissioners and on the facts that are presented to them. They will continue to make decisions based on sound judgement to ensure that fisheries are sustainable and meet all the ecological requirements—and, moreover, predicated on the precautionary principle so often espoused by the Greens.


He went on:


Why? Because AFMA will continue to apply sound policy to ensure that we will have sustainable fisheries now and into the future. For those reasons, the government oppose this motion.


That was a reasonably succinct position put by the then minister as to why we should reject these kinds of moves, why we should reject this Greens view of the world, which is not based on science. It is based on their version of cheap politics. It is based on their aversion really to any economic activity using our natural resources.


We know what the Greens are on about, but unfortunately the Labor Party in opposition has moved far closer to the Greens than we would like to see and, I am sure, much closer than many Labor senators would like the Labor Party to be. Many senators, I am sure, would be concerned about the Labor Party pandering to the Greens.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  That's why they're doing so well in the polls and you're doing so crap.




Senator SESELJA:
  All right. That is an interesting interjection there from Senator Whish-Wilson that the reason the Labor Party have had a spike in the polls is that they have gone closer to the Greens agenda. That is interesting. I wonder what Sam Dastyari might think about that when he is asked about whether or not it is good politics and good policy for the Labor Party to be following the Greens. But there is some truth in what Senator Whish-Wilson says, in that the Labor Party are following the Greens. I think Senator Whish-Wilson and I can agree on that. I think that for the Labor Party, if they do want to be back on the government benches at some point in the future, that is not the best strategy, because a party—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  Well, we will all have a different take on that, but Senator Whish-Wilson's position now is half right: the Labor Party are following the Greens, but I would disagree with the idea that the Labor Party following the Greens and moving further to the left on any policy, be it on fisheries management or anything else, is somehow going to be a winning formula, and I am sure that there would be many Labor senators—and I will not name names, but we know who they are—who would be horrified by that prospect.




Senator Lines:
  I think Labor is much better at getting the politics right than you are—




Senator SESELJA:
  Well, it is interesting, isn't it? The Labor government were obsessed with the politics. You are right, Senator Lines. You are absolutely right. The Labor Party in government were obsessed with the politics. They were obsessed with opinion polls. And that is one of the reasons they were such a shocking government, such an absolutely shocking government. In the end, their obsession with those things—instead of being good managers, instead of actually looking after the country, instead of showing good leadership—their obsession with those internal matters and their obsession with focus groups and opinion polls did not help them to be a good government and did not help them to maintain the support of the Australian people. So I thank Senator Lines for her contribution. She is absolutely right. They were obsessed with those kinds of things rather than good policy.



Senator Lines interjecting—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  I am very much enjoying this because I enjoy any time we can get political advice from the Greens party, because the Greens party, with their eight per cent of the vote—their eight per cent of the vote that they consistently attract—show just how much they represent mainstream Australia.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  Sorry, what was that? I missed that from the eight per cent party. I could not quite hear. But, unlike the Labor Party, we will not take our policy advice or our political advice from the Greens.


That is at the heart of this issue. What Senator Ludwig said when he was in government was right: we should rely on the science; we should not go for cheap politics on this issue; and the way we have managed our fisheries over a long period of time is world's best practice. It is world's best practice. You could look at instances where we have gotten things wrong, of course, but, if you compare our record to that of most nations around the world, we do a great job of maintaining a sustainable industry, of feeding millions of people right around the world through our fisheries and of having the highest environmental standards. Ask yourself. I often think about this when we discuss the issue of fisheries. We saw attempts by the former government to really scale back the amount of fishing that could take place in our waters. You often say to yourself: well, we are still going to be getting fish, but if we are not getting it from Australian waters, if we are not doing it with the best environmental standards here in Australia, we will be getting it from other places that have far lower environmental standards than we do in this country. I think we fundamentally have to ask ourselves the question about what would happen if we were to take the Greens view of the world and part of the Labor Party view of the world and say, 'Look, we're just going to ban it more and more and make it more and more restrictive for commercial fishing.'


We understand the need for balance. We absolutely support recreational fishing and we know that, if you overfish, that is negative in the long term for commercial fishing, it is negative for recreational fishing and it is not sustainable. So we have always taken a scientific approach to this, but you ask yourself: if you ban it more and more, it will happen in other places where there will not be the same kinds of environmental standards. We will not have the jobs in this country that flow from the industry. We will not have the ability to feed not just ourselves but the world, as we should. What will happen is that we will be importing more and more of the stuff, with no real knowledge of the environmental standards that apply in other places. That, to me, is the fundamental when we look at these issues.


Regarding this bill, let us go to the expert panel report. The independent expert scientific panel has completed its assessment of the potential impacts of supertrawlers, boats greater than 130 metres, on our marine environment. The panel focused on assessing the potential impact of supertrawlers on the marine environment and protected species, including seals, dolphins and seabirds, and the potential for localised depletion of target species. The panel provided the Minister for the Environment with a report on its findings in mid-October, which was published on the Department of the Environment's website on 19 November. The report gave a big tick to the existing risk based fisheries management framework used in Australian fisheries management. It is this framework that has resulted in Australia's fisheries being recognised as among the best managed anywhere in the world. This risk based management framework is already in action in the Small Pelagic Fishery. The harvest strategy exceeds internationally recommended standards such as those made by the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force in the report Little Fish, Big Impact. The report also highlighted that there are risks from the proposed fishing operation, as there are with all fishing, be that commercial or recreational. The government believes that scientific evidence must continue to underpin the management of our fisheries.


That sums up our objections here to what is being driven, and is consistently driven, by the Greens—and that is that we will do it in a scientific way, not in an emotive way and not based on whatever scare might be out there at the time. It is based on the best scientific evidence around how we can continue to have a vibrant fishing industry, which we on this side of the parliament certainly want to see. We want to see a commercial fishing industry in this country that is viable, creates jobs, feeds Australians and creates an export market. That is a great thing for Australia. We also want to manage threatened species. We also want to make sure that it is commercially sustainable, which means that overfishing is not only bad for the environment; it is not commercially sustainable in the long term. We also want to see strong Indigenous recreational fishing opportunities.


All of those things do operate in this country. In large part, they operate quite well. We believe in taking a scientific approach, accepting the expert advice, rather than having this ad hoc approach that we are seeing in this kind of legislation. For all of those reasons, the coalition will not be supporting the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:48):  I rise today to speak in support of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014. The debate about supertrawlers is an ongoing issue of concern, particularly in my home state of Tasmania, but I do know that many senators have received emails on this issue regardless of which state or territory they represent. There is concern throughout Australia about the operation of supertrawlers in our waters.


Only this week, the Mercury newspaper, based in the southern part of Tasmania, reported on the findings of the report from the Expert Panel on a Declared Commercial Fishing Activity, the Final (Small Pelagic Fishery) Declaration 2012. Now that the government has been given the expert panel's report, it must make a decision and end uncertainty for Tasmanian fishers.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  They have been very silent on that point too, Senator Brown.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Absolutely, but that is not something that we would be surprised about, Senator Whish-Wilson. On page 302, the report concludes:


… direct interactions with protected species and localised depletion, as defined by the panel, will occur under the DCFA—


declared commercial fishing activity—


The panel’s assessment has confirmed that there are considerable uncertainties relating to the extent of those impacts and the level of impact that would create adverse environmental outcomes.


As in other fisheries facing similar uncertainties, a precautionary and adaptive, risk-based approach to management of the potential impacts of the DCFA is required. 


It is clear that Tasmania's fisheries, including protected species, will be depleted if supertrawlers are allowed to operate. Dolphin and seal numbers may also be affected.


We know that the Final (Small Pelagic Fishery) Declaration 2012 ended at midnight on 18 November this year. The Final (Small Pelagic Fishery) Declaration (No.2) 2013 will end at midnight on 24 April next year. We must act now to protect our environment and our fisheries. The factory fishing boat Meridian 1 has had approval to trawl Tasmanian waters. It will be the largest freezer trawler to fish in Australia. The Meridian 1 is expected to operate for only a few months to catch its quota of blue grenadier.


In Tasmania, news of the return of a large factory freezer trawler a few months ago put the issue of supertrawlers firmly back in the news and raised fears among the fishing industry. I want to refer to an editorial on 6 June in Hobart's Mercury newspaper on this Ukrainian owned trawler. The editorial states: 


The operators of these types of trawlers that can stay at sea for long periods of time, catch enormous amounts of fish, and process their catch while at sea would do well to keep the community properly informed. Fear of the unknown brings an instant and predictable reaction.


The Mercury editorial goes on to suggest that the operators of the Meridian 1 should tell the public of their plans. It is possible that this trawler will not pose a possible risk. However, it is obvious that Tasmanian waters are attractive to large trawlers, and I believe we need to be always on our guard. It also is apparent that we need legislative protections against these supertrawlers.


At the heart of this bill is the government's inaction. In the face of the government's failure to act to protect our fisheries, stand up for recreation fishers or provide the community and industry with certainty, Labor is again taking action. Federal Labor is committed to the sustainable management of Australia's marine resources and, when in government, we were strong defenders and managers of our oceans and those who use them.


Australia's fisheries are among the most sustainable and best managed in the world. Labor is committed to ensure that this remains the case. This bill restores a power to the environment and fisheries ministers to declare particular fishing activities that have not previously been used in Australian waters and require up to two years of additional scientific review where uncertainty exists. This will enable the government of the day to review fishing methods and vessels such as supertrawlers that have not been used in Australia before.


When these powers were introduced by Labor, we put in a sunset clause of 12 months to allow a fisheries review to be implemented. To ensure that Australia's waters were adequately protected from the risks associated with the use of supertrawlers, the Labor government amended the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in September 2012 to include these powers. The power was used once by Labor in government to declare a type of fishing activity that matched the specifications of a supertrawler. At the time this picked up the vessel the FV Abel Tasman, which was formerly known as the Margiris. In April 2013, we extended these restrictions, which means that these supertrawlers cannot operate in Australian waters until at least April 2015. At that time we also established an independent expert panel, which I referred to earlier, to provide an objective impact assessment of the environmental impacts of this activity. 


The use of supertrawlers in Australian waters has been a long-running issue that has generated passionate debate and high levels of concern within the community around the country. It has seen Tasmanians take to the street in large numbers to protest about supertrawlers. Tasmanians who would not normally attend public meetings have taken part in protest action. It is an issue that a large number of constituents regularly raise with me and many others, I am sure. Concerns have been raised about the bycatch of other fish, birds and marine mammals, particularly dolphins and seals. Communities need confidence that the environmental controls in place are reflective of their expectations. Re-establishing the power of the minister to establish an expert panel that will be able to assess the science is important in ensuring that communities can have this confidence.


Another concern often raised by my constituents in Tasmania, particularly those who are recreational fishers, has been the potential for localised depletion of fishing stock. In fact, Tasmanians were the first to raise their concerns about the impact of supertrawlers in our waters, at rallies and public meetings across the state. That is why I, along with my colleagues—and, I know, many others in the Senate—the member for Franklin, Julie Collins MP, and former Labor senator, Lin Thorp, lobbied the former Labor government to stop the supertrawler FV Abel Tasman from operating in Tasmanian waters in 2012.


Labor listened to the concerns and amended the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to ensure Australia's waters were adequately protected from risks associated with the use of supertrawlers. It was Labor that put a stop to the Abel Tasman, with a ban which turned the supertrawler around before it had started trawling Australia's oceans. However, the threat of other supertrawlers has not gone away and it is up to Labor, again, to take action.


In September 2012 when the powers were originally introduced, the Liberal and National parties opposed the amendments. Then opposition members used every reason under the sun to oppose the bill, but none of those reasons were very convincing. Senator Abetz said it was a 'very dangerous precedent that it sets'. And Senator Scullion stated, 'science of the specific fishery in question didn't require additional reviews'.


In September 2013, when asked whether the new government would lift the ban, Senator Colbeck said that the government would 'consider it, based on the science'. This statement contrasts with Senator Colbeck's previously definitive position on the ban. In September 2012, Senator Colbeck called banning the supertrawler a 'serious embarrassment'. Then in June 2013 he said actions against the trawler were a 'dishonest campaign'.


However, when the now Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, was questioned on March 4 2014 about the supertrawler he said:


It was banned with the support of members on this side of the House. It was banned; it will stay banned.


I welcome those statements and I welcome the support of the Prime Minister, albeit belatedly. I would suggest that the Prime Minister and Senator Abetz, who supported the Prime Minister's statement when asked about it in this place, refresh their memories by reviewing the Hansard records.


For the record I can quote from the Hansard of 6 March 2014, when Senator Abetz said:


The answer the Prime Minister gave was very clear. The supertrawler was banned, it remains banned and, as I understand it, the company involved has no interest in bringing its supertrawler back to Australia.


But then, of course, we know that the Liberal and National parties voted against the ban in both houses of parliament. They did not think that any more science or research was needed and they did not want to stop the supertrawler. We have to be very clear here, because the Prime Minister appears to be rewriting history: they did not want any more science or research and they did not want to stop the supertrawler. The Liberals voted against banning supertrawlers when they were in opposition, and now they are in government they have failed to take any action to protect our environment and our fisheries. 


This bill will force the government to choose whether to honour the Prime Minister's own words and the actions of the government when in opposition. This bill will make the government put their money where their mouth is. The government is yet to do even the most basic work required to implement sensible root-and-branch reform of fisheries management, as recommended by the Borthwick review and responded to by Labor in March 2013.


As the government refuses to act to protect our fisheries, stand up for recreational fishers or provide industry with any certainty, it is up to Labor to act. In government Labor supported strong powers to protect the environment, to respect the rights of recreational fishers and to provide certainty to business. Under the bill we consider here today, new supertrawlers will have to face the same tough response faced by the original supertrawler. The amendments give the government of the day the power to declare a particular type of fishing activity prohibited. This declaration will be made where the activity has not been used in Australia and some uncertainty exists around it. The prohibition will allow proper and thorough expert scientific work to be conducted.


The bill restores the powers to enable the environment minister, with the agreement of the Commonwealth fisheries minister, to make an interim declaration that a fishing activity is a prohibited 'declared commercial fishing activity' while an expert panel assesses the potential environmental impacts of the activity. The bill also restores the power of the environment minister—again with the agreement of the Commonwealth fisheries minister—to make a final declaration, for a period no longer than 24 months, that a fishing activity is a prohibited 'declared commercial fishing activity'. Further to this, the bill provides for the establishment of an expert panel in the case of the making of a final declaration. The bill also specifies the terms of reference of the panel and arrangements for reporting, with a requirement that a copy of the panel report be made publicly available. 


The former Labor government has a strong record when it comes to supporting our fisheries and making them healthier, sustainable and more resilient. Labor understands that Australia's fisheries are a valuable natural resource and that we all have a role in ensuring the future of an industry that contributes more than $2 billion to our economy each year. It was the previous Labor government that announced the first major review of Australian fisheries policy and legislation in over 20 years. In fact, it was Senator Ludwig, whose bill we discuss here today, who as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, commissioned an independent review of the policy and legislation governing the Commonwealth's fisheries management system in September 2012. The fisheries management review examined a range of issues to identify any improvements needed to ensure community and industry expectations of the Australian fisheries management regime can be met into the future.


In March last year the previous government released the report Review of Commonwealth fisheries: legislation, policy and management, also known as the Borthwick review. The findings of the review highlighted current management strengths and identified potential improvements to make Commonwealth fisheries more sustainable and to meet industry and community expectations into the future. On releasing the report, then Minister Ludwig stated:


The Borthwick Review concluded that greater transparency, a broader policy framework, and the clarification of objectives and roles could build on what is already a very effective system.


Senator Ludwig also indicated that the government's response to this report was to accept the direction of all 15 recommendations. The Labor government committed to engage with industry, recreational fishers, supply chain participants, environmental organisations, consumers and the general public on how best to implement the findings of the review.


Since coming to government, those opposite have done nothing to act on the findings of this review—nothing. The government is yet to do even the most basic work required to implement sensible root-and-branch reform of fisheries management Those opposite, under the leadership of Mr Abbott, have had over 12 months to do something to stop future supertrawlers and protect our oceans—but they have failed; they have failed to do anything. It should come as no surprise to anyone on this side of the chamber that they have not acted; in fact, it should not come as a surprise to anyone in the community who may be listening to this debate. 


We know that those opposite have no interest in protecting our fisheries and oceans. They proved this when they rolled back marine protection around the country. We on this side are proud to have delivered the world's largest marine reserve network. In government we added 2.3 million square kilometres to the system of Commonwealth marine reserves, expanding the overall size of the Commonwealth marine reserve estate to some 3.1 million square kilometres. Under Labor the number of marine reserves expanded from 27 to 60, covering more than a third of Commonwealth waters. However, the Abbott government has scrapped the comprehensive management plans that would have secured the long-term conservation and sustainable use of Australia's precious oceans. It scrapped them without parliamentary scrutiny, against expert scientific advice and in spite of extensive public consultation and the accumulation of more than 20 years of work which began under the Keating government. However, Labor will continue to take action to ensure that we protect Australia's ecosystems and fishing stock.


Our decisions must be based on evidence. As there is uncertainty about the impacts of fishing vessels and the size of super trawlers, it is appropriate that we pass this bill to ensure that appropriate restrictions and assessments are undertaken. We must also act today to ensure that we have viable fishing for tomorrow's generations. The Abbott government have shown no care about our fisheries and our oceans but Labor have. Today I stand by the comments I made when I spoke on the 2012 bill in this place, and I repeat those words: marine environments once wrecked take generations to recover, if they ever do. A precautionary approach is not only good policy but also the only decent option.


As the government refuses to act to protect our oceans and our fisheries, to stand up for recreational fishers or to provide local businesses with any certainty, it is again up to Labor to act. We know that only Labor will ensure that sustainable action is taken for the ongoing health and integrity of Australia's marine areas. I will end with a quote from Senator Ludwig's speech:


Australia has some of the best managed fisheries in the world. There is, however, a gap in the system in considering the powers of the environment and fisheries ministers to consider new commercial fishing vessels before they arrive and begin to fish. Given the government has failed to act, it is sensible for these powers to be restored. Labor is standing up for the oceans, recreational fishers and local businesses.


I commend this bill to the chamber. I urge all senators to support it, and I urge the government senators to support the Prime Minister's statement that super trawlers are banned and will remain banned. This will determine whether you are supporting your Prime Minister—or will you turn your backs on the statements he makes? We know that he tends to shoot from the hip, but it is now up to you to say whether or not you support your Prime Minister's words. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2014-11-27,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (10:08):  I rise to speak against the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014, despite the appeals from Senator Brown on the other side. Her closing remarks, where she tried to illustrate the position of the Prime Minister, were somewhat mischievous. I know that the Prime Minister is a great supporter of commercial and recreational fishing in this country, and we have some of the most well-managed fisheries for recreational and commercial shell and fin fishers in the world. 


In speaking against this bill, I am highlighting the fact that this issue continues to be a gross Labor hypocrisy. As a senator for the state of South Australia and a strong supporter of a well-managed fisheries industry, I oppose the cheap wedge politics being peddled by Senator Ludwig. As we know, Senator Ludwig had a very low point in his ministerial career, when in June 2011 he put an overnight ban on the export of live cattle. We are still feeling the reverberations economically and socially of that knee-jerk, ill-considered decision of that time. This again is populist. I suspect that the CEO of GetUp! is often on the phone telling Senator Ludwig that the funding of his next campaign is probably in peril if he does not put this back on the map. I assume Senator Ludwig is a very good industrial union lawyer and I am sure he was in the past, but in matters of primary industries and fishing he gets an 'E'. 


Remember the mess Tony Burke created around the Abel Tasman and supertrawlers in the Small Pelagic Fishery Harvest Strategy? I recall there were four amendments in four days to his declared fishing activities bill. The Labor government response to the Abel Tasman—which I have been on and have toured; I will come to that later—which our party opposed at the time, has made us an international laughing stock. It has effectively tarnished the reputations of leading scientific and industry figures who have been acting in the interests of sustainability and good management of our marine natural resources.


But you do not have to take my word for it; you can read articles with headlines such as 'World mocks ban on trawler' by Philip Heyward in the Mercury, or 'Expert labels trawler ban ""embarrassing""' on the ABC, or 'Opposition to the Margiris ""super trawler"" not evidence based' by Bob Kearney in The Conversation. Then-Minister Burke's commercial fishing policy was more shambolic than a set of tangled crab nets, and Senator Ludwig needs to withdraw this bill for fear of getting caught in the same trap. He needs to allow the correct bodies to administer fishing activities in Australia. The issue is much bigger than just the trawler; it is about how we do business in Australia and how we manage a resource in a sustainable and profitable manner.


The Labor-Green approach is dangerous to the fisheries industry, an industry which, I might add, is worth over $2 billion annually. It employs around 11,600 people—7,300 directly and 4,300 indirectly—according to figures of just a few years ago, and we know that the industry has had growth since then.


The coalition government has confidence in the Australian Fisheries Management Authority regarding the management and sustainability of fisheries. Actions taken by AFMA have already led to a reduction in bycatch and sustainable ecosystems. Catch limits based on appropriate biomass percentages mean that the fisheries industry is already appropriately managed without any unnecessary ministerial intervention.


Currently, small pelagic fishery is productive and environmentally stable. In fact during July in my home of Adelaide the Small Pelagic Fisheries Workshop, a technical workshop and stakeholder forum, was hosted by the South Australian Research and Development Institute. The forum determined that Australian fisheries science and management was the world benchmark, with policies and practices for other nations to aspire to. Dr Patrick Hone, Executive Director of the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, said at the forum:


A key finding was that the science underpinning Australian fisheries management was robust and that our harvest strategy and rules were clearly precautionary and very much in line with the best practice guidelines put forward by the Lenfest Working Group and the Marine Stewardship Council.


The harvest strategies which Dr Hone speaks of started in 2007 under Minister Abetz as Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation. These strategies outline management actions needed to achieve biological and economic objectives. With the harvest strategies in place and operating uninterrupted, the fishing industry can work with greater confidence and management decisions can be made with transparency and forewarning.


Only this government, not Labor and certainly not the Greens, understands the main factor in commercial fishing management—that the industry be economically viable as well as environmentally sustainable. Removing the sunset clause, as Senator Ludwig is attempting to do, would allow the environment minister to declare any fishing activity, requiring the establishment of an expert panel to investigate each declaration. This is dangerous to the industry and, given our best-in-practice policies, completely unnecessary for the purpose of fisheries management.


The coalition continues to do what it said it would do during the election campaign regarding commercial fishing. Our commitments were to: make decisions based on science; wait for the expert panel report on declared fishing activities before making a decision on the declaration of larger vessels; and seek more data to address criticisms regarding the age of data used to establish fish stocks. Further to that, in late October, Minister Colbeck welcomed the ABARES fishery status reports, which showed that, for the first time in eight years, no Commonwealth managed fisheries were subject to overfishing. In fact, under this coalition government, fisheries stocks are on the improve.


To return now to marine parks and a sensitive matter in my home state, I note worriedly that Labor has introduced 19 marine parks with 80 no-take zones within South Australia. These laws came into effect on 1 October this year and impact commercial and recreational anglers alike. Not only will this affect the enjoyment of our marine areas but it will hurt the fragile economy of our regions. If it were not already obvious that Labor do not understand the science behind fisheries management, it is even more evident that they do not understand their own policy. South Australian Labor spent $1.8 million filming and promoting an awareness campaign for their unwanted marine parks. In these ads, a family is seen crabbing on the Port Noarlunga jetty. If the Labor Party had half a clue, they would have known that the area depicted in that advertisement has already banned crabbing. How ironic and cruel is that?




Senator Back:
  Breaking the law.




Senator EDWARDS:
  To add insult to injury, Senator Back—I note your interest in this matter—the South Australian environment minister, Minister Hunter, proved he was nowhere near being across his brief on ABC breakfast radio on 1 October, the same day as these new laws came into effect, when he could not indicate what sanctions existed in the highly controversial Port Wakefield zone. By contrast, my state Liberal counterparts introduced an amendment bill, which sensibly proposed the reintroduction of access to 12 of those zones. The policy was supported by the commercial and recreational fishing industries and provides a sustainable base from which to fish. Just remember that none of these fishing zones is under any pressure.


The bill was defeated by one vote, the vote cast by the so-called minister for regions, Mr Geoff Brock, the member for Frome. There is a famous YouTube video of the independent member for Frome, Mr Geoff Brock, telling recreational fishers just one month prior to the March state election, 'I'm here to fight for you guys.' What a turncoat he turned out to be. He has sold his independence—he is supposed to be an independent—and his word to his electorate for a shot at the ministry which he now holds, and I think he is yet to realise the damage that he has done to the state, let alone to his career and to all those in the political environment.


South Australian fishing and aquaculture industries are worth $217 million annually and South Australia is a very big employer, with some 6,000 people in the seafood industry. If you look at all those numbers I gave you earlier, South Australia's industry represents a very large percentage of the Australian seafood output. All of this hangs in the balance with the introduction of Labor's unnecessary, overregulating policies. We have confidence in the sustainability of Australian fisheries, currently managed by AFMA and recognised as some of the best practice in the world. To reiterate, policy must be driven by sound scientific advice and not knee-jerk reactions.


I said I would refer to the time when I visited what was then known as the Abel Tasman and went on to become known as the Margiris. Some people call it the supertrawler. I visited this ship—I was invited to go and have a look at it and I did so when it was located in Port Lincoln and subjected to that controversial ban. I took up the invitation and, I must say, that ship and its equipment are world-class. Senator Back, as you well know, to put to sea on an ocean-going global fishing boat you have to be highly technically trained, and the crew were. All of the equipment was first-rate, up-to-the-minute technology. The fisheries that they were to fish are already being fished. These were not extra fish being taken; these fish are already fished by numerous other, smaller boats. Imagine 24—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  Oh, and now we hear from the Greens. All of a sudden, we hear from the Greens. They do not want to hear the truth. They just want to perpetuate all their lies. These fish cannot be taken outside of quotas. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, if Senator Whish-Wilson wants to make a contribution to this, he can refute my claim. Are you suggesting that all the fish taken by any supertrawler are illegally taken, outside of a quota? All of these fish are taken within quotas. Imagine 24 small boats being put to sea with 24 crews taking the same fish that one boat would possibly take. The nets have escape hatches. Dolphins and seals can escape and do escape. This myth that all the sea is going to be vacuumed clean of all fish is hysteria peddled by those on the other side, who want to go and live in caves with no power and just wear bearskin rugs.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  The coalition loves supertrawlers.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, if you are not going to protect me from this barrage of nonsense that is coming from the Greens—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Dastyari
):  Order! The Senate will come to order!




Senator EDWARDS:
  This is an economical way in which to fish. It is an environmentally sensitive way in which to fish. People think that these fish are extra fish. They are not extra fish—they are already being fished. And do you know what? When they are fished by the 24 boats that put to sea, they have not got refrigeration. So that fish—the brown-fleshed fish, the pelagics—all go into a hold and do you know what they are used for? Fertiliser. Do you know what happens to the fish that are caught with these large harvest vessels? They get snap frozen and they are food grade, and they feed the nations of Africa. Mr Acting Deputy President, the Greens and Senator Whish-Wilson over there will not tell you that—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  Yes, that's what they turn it into.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Whish-Wilson, the senator will be heard in silence.




Senator EDWARDS:
  That is what you have when you put to sea with 24 boats fishing for the same fish. But what happens is that we turn it into food grade—if we were to allow this. We are going to turn it into fish for human consumption. We are going to try to feed the world. We do not want to feed the cats of the world; we do not want to fertilise the gardens of the world. We want to turn this into food grade fish. If you do it on a ship of the likes of the Abel Tasman or the Margiris, because they are big enough and have freezers, you snap freeze it and it is food grade. The Greens would deny the African nations a food source, a protein source. That is okay if you live in the leafy suburbs down there in Tasmania and you drink your lattes and have your sponge cakes on a Saturday morning after a nice pleasant week in the Senate. It is nonsense. 


This is not about environmental sustainability. This is about taking fish that is already taken and, quickly and efficiently, turning it into food grade. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will be very interested to hear Senator Whish-Wilson's contribution and to hear how he can refute my claims of this efficient way of gathering.


Senator Ludwig's bill is just another intervention into everybody's lives. It is an absolute irony. In South Australia we have got these protected zones now. And when you question government officials about why they are doing it, they say, 'because they are pristine environments.' What? We are putting in marine parks because they are pristine environments? Do you know why? Because they are well managed already. Recreational fishers and commercial fishers abide by the laws. But no, the dead hand of bureaucracy has to come in and lay itself over the fishing industry. Here we are: once again the Labor Party just wants to pull back all of that and get hold of it again. Just put that uncertainty into it so that the banks will not invest. You can have your livelihood taken—like you did with the live cattle export. You can have your livelihood taken away from you overnight. If you let this bill pass in this place, that is exactly what will happen. You will have another layer of uncertainty. I conclude: I support sustainable fishing industries in South Australia and I do so today by opposing this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-11-27,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:28):  We have just heard the coalition arguing and denigrating, instead of being able to address the science. They are denigrating the arguments by having a go at people, calling people 'latte sippers'—the usual silly attacks that the coalition make when they cannot actually argue the point. The point here is that super trawlers around the world have actually broken our oceans and broken our fisheries. The reason we are getting better at managing our fisheries now is because we are in fact putting in rules and enforcing them for effective management of our fisheries. When we did not have that, we had our oceans being overfished.


As for this ludicrous argument that we will be feeding Africa, this supertrawler has been in the seas and oceans off Africa and has raped those oceans of fish for fertiliser, the very thing he has just said that we support. That is what they have been doing with supertrawlers—taking away the fish from Africa. Now he is saying that a supertrawler has to fish in our waters so that we can feed Africa when those very same supertrawlers have been taking the fish out of the oceans and depopulating those oceans. That is a ridiculous argument to make, just so he can make people feel sorry for the Africans, when he should be arguing for better regulation of supertrawlers there too, so that African people can feed themselves from their ocean supplies, not have fish stripped out of their oceans and taken elsewhere simply for the superprofits of the supertrawlers. I might add that supertrawlers also get well subsidised and try to access every subsidy they can get around the world.


This legislation is a step, but it would not ban supertrawlers as the ALP would like to suggest, as when they brought in legislation regarding supertrawlers when they were in government. It is fallacious, as is being implied, that this legislation bans supertrawlers. This is why Senator Whish-Wilson proposes an amendment that would ban supertrawlers with a freezer capacity of over 2,000 tonnes. His amendment would actually ban those supertrawlers and strengthen and give backbone to this legislation to achieve what the ALP claim that this legislation does. This legislation was introduced by Senator Ludwig, a former minister for fisheries. The original bill that was brought in by the previous government allowed the minister to declare a prohibited fishing activity, but it had a sunset clause of 12 months.


The aim of the legislation that we are currently debating is to remove that sunset clause, meaning the environment minister's powers to respond to new fishing operations would remain in place. Of course, we are hearing that people want to have another go at letting the supertrawler slip through so it can start fishing in our waters. Currently, the government does not have powers to declare a prohibited fishing vessel and implement a review. As I said, the clauses of this legislation do not ban supertrawlers, and that is why we need to amend the bill—so that we do have the capacity to fight industrial-scale fishing, because that is what it is. This is industrial-scale fishing. There are significant problems with this legislation in that, as I have said, it does not ban the introduction of industrial-scale factory-freezer trawlers, the so-called supertrawlers, into our SPF. Labor's proposed legislation puts the discretionary powers in the hands of the Liberal-National ministers, instead of the people having a say through their representatives in parliament.


In fact, the Greens pointed out this failure to Labor in 2012, while they were in government and were claiming to be dealing with the threat of supertrawlers to our fisheries and ecosystems—because supertrawlers not only threaten our fisheries; they threaten our ecosystems. Yet Labor did not take on board our amendments when we very clearly pointed out the holes in the legislation. While Labor are now trying to fix this failure, it is misleading to say, as they have been claiming to constituents, that they are banning supertrawlers. This legislation clearly does not, unfortunately. They did not do it while they were in government and they are not doing it with this legislation—again, that is why we need the amendments that Senator Whish-Wilson has proposed, which actually do deal with it by banning trawlers with a freezer capacity of over 2,000 tonnes.


All parties at various stages have said that they support a ban on supertrawlers. Well, this is the opportunity to prove it. This is the opportunity to prove that you do actually want to ban supertrawlers, by supporting the amendments that we are putting, which fill that hole in the legislation.


Labor justified the sunset clause at the time by stating that, because the Borthwick inquiry—the so-called root-and-branch inquiry into fisheries legislation processes—was underway, it was appropriate to have a sunset clause. Senator Ludwig at the time quoted Minister Burke as saying in his speech on this bill:


By that time the root-and-branch review of the fisheries management processes should be in place, but we will have this legislation to be able to fill that gap in the interim. 


Now we have the Borthwick review, a root-and-branch review, which has made a number of recommendations. The government need to implement these recommendations. They do not seem to have done anything with it. A particularly important point is that the Borthwick review has recommended a new third pillar to the legislation and management of Australia's fisheries, and that is one that directly addresses ecosystem impacts in the fisheries context. They say that for this ecosystem approach with a goal of minimising the impact of fishing effort on ecosystems, the government needs to address the balance between funding for private industry research and research for the public benefit of conserving the common and related ecosystem values. In other words, we need to include that in our legislation, and we do not at the moment and we have not seen a sign from the government of what they are going to do about it. That root-and-branch review showed that we have not quite got things right here. We do need to look at the impact on our ecosystems and at ecosystem science.


With this bill the ALP are trying to make people think that we are banning supertrawlers. As I said, supertrawlers will not be banned by this bill. While the opposition calls this tough legislation, it is not tough enough and it needs toughening up. We have heard a number of people quoting the expert panel review of the processes put in place under the previous legislation, introduced by the ALP when they were in government. I find it fascinating that the government has been quoting that review to justify their opposition to this legislation. It is really quite bizarre. 


The review actually vindicates the position that the Greens, recreational fishers, environment groups and the broader Tasmanian community took when the supertrawler first appeared on our horizon a couple of years ago. The report found that, even if protective measures were put in place, the supertrawler would impact on protected species like seals, dolphins and seabirds and would potentially lead to localised depletion of fish stocks. As my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson said recently in response to the release of the expert  report, the Greens have long argued that the science on the wider impacts were too uncertain for the minister to make a call on allowing this gigantic floating factory into our waters—in other words, to allow that industrial-scale fishing. We are still a long way from the point where we would be confident that industrial-scale fishing from a supertrawler would not have these impacts. That is one of the reasons that we need to amend the private member's bill before us—because we know that we need to do further work to ensure that industrial-scale fishing is not impacting on our marine ecosystems.


It is time that we acknowledged that supertrawlers are not the way to manage our oceans. The Greens have long been concerned about fisheries management. People from the government will claim that it is because we do not support fishing. That is absolute bunkum. It is simply not true. We want sustainable fisheries management because we want fish in our oceans for the future. Not only are they a critical part of our ecosystem; we know that many communities rely on fishing. But we do not want to see our oceans in a state where whole ecosystems have collapsed and we are no longer able to fish, because fisheries have collapsed. 


Australia does have a proud record of good fisheries management—better than most other places in the world—but that does not say that we have it perfect. Quite clearly, the Borthwick review and the expert report show that we have not got it perfect. The Borthwick review shows that we need to change our legislation so that we do incorporate better science on ecosystems. We do need to understand the impact of fisheries better, and we do need to keep ensuring that Commonwealth managed fisheries do not go backwards. It has taken quite a lot of effort to ensure that those fisheries do not go backwards. When I first started working on fisheries management many years ago, the Commonwealth could not claim that some of those Commonwealth fisheries were not going backwards, and it has been a lot of work to get them to the point where they are starting to improve. That is not to say that we should rest on our laurels; that means that we need to keep working to make sure those fisheries are protected.


Supertrawlers have broken our oceans around the planet. We should not be supporting supertrawlers. We support legislation that bans supertrawlers so that we do not have to keep fighting this issue every couple of years. If this private member's bill is not amended along the lines proposed by Senator Whish-Wilson, we will have to keep fighting this issue every couple of years, every time a supertrawler wants to sail over our horizons to start fishing on an industrial scale in our waters. It is simply not appropriate to compare numbers of boats to a supertrawler. A supertrawler can stay out at sea for a very long time. That is why we are proposing the limit of 2,000 tonnes—so that supertrawlers cannot stay out for weeks and weeks depopulating our oceans. 


One of my passions is marine protection. There have been decades of work done on the need for better marine protection. The way that the Abbott government essentially got rid of the world's leading marine parks and reserves system in this country, after over a decade of work that did all the science, was disgusting. It did all the science, it did the consultation and it put in place that world-leading system of marine protected areas. We have just had the World Parks Congress in this country, and I am so disappointed that I missed it. It only happens once every 10 years. All the leading experts on nature conservation from around the world come to one place and talk about protected areas, national parks and nature reserves around the world. I was so embarrassed that we no longer had what was, for a short length of time, the world's leading system of marine protected areas, which not only ensured biodiversity protection and ecosystem protection but fishing into the future. The science is there about the roles that marine protected areas play in protecting fish stocks and ensuring that they are there for the future. And what does this Luddite government do? One of their first actions on coming into government was to wipe that system off the face of our maps. They took away the management plans, which essentially means that now all you have is a system of lines on a map. Now the government are spending millions of dollars doing their review, when it is quite clear that the science was done and that the consultation was carried out. Because they are bowing to some of their noisy constituents who want to do whatever they want in the marine environment, they have got rid of those areas. 


The support for marine protection in this country is very high. In my home state of Western Australia, surveys show that over 70 per cent of people consistently support marine protection. Those areas need to be restored. The government talks about wasting money and red tape. Well, the government are wasting money in their review of those protected areas. They are simply doing it so that they can find an excuse to wipe out those areas permanently. It is a disgrace, and how the government could show itself at that World Park Congress and pretend it is doing something about marine protection is a complete joke.


This bill needs to be strengthened. Supertrawlers will be yet another impact on our marine environment, a marine environment that is under pressure from overfishing, from extraction, from run-off from land-based sources of pollution and from climate change. We are already seeing the impact of climate change on our marine environment, and, in particular, in some of those colder water temperate marine environments that are getting warmer. This is disturbing the ecosystems around Australia, in particular, in some of the southern areas, with some of the waters warming.


You are seeing, in my home state of Western Australia, marine species turning up much further south than they have ever been before. As I have said in this place before, that means that we need to change the way we are managing our marine environment and managing our fisheries because we are getting species that have not been there before. You are seeing invasive species that have never been seen before. They are taking off and invading marine environments and having an impact there that we have not seen before. That adds to the pressures on our marine environment.


What this government obviously wants now is to enable supertrawlers to come in and add another impact to that marine environment. The science that they were using to justify the supertrawler previously—the Abel Tasman or the Margiris, whichever name you want to call it—was not done on that specific pelagic fishery. It was not done on those species. It was done on jack mackerel, and marine scientists have shown the flaws in that science. The expert panel says that there is a great degree of uncertainty there and that we should be using the precautionary principle. The Borthwick review says that we need a third arm to the research that we do, looking at ecosystem science.


It is time that we took marine protection seriously. We have a short window of time to get this right. We need a series of marine protected areas. Just restore it. The work is done. Just restore those marine parks. Change the legislation so we can have a genuine, quality look at ecosystem science when we are doing fisheries management. Build on our international reputation for good fisheries science. We are some of the world leaders in our fisheries management. We do not want to see that go backwards. We want to keep progressing. It is another area where we can help regionally as we build our scientific marine expertise on the already excellent science that we have got here and the quality of our scientists. It is excellent. We need to build on that, and we can be helping the regions.


I know some of that has been done. But as the climate impacts on our marine environment we need to make sure that we are building that science and also helping regionally because the oceans are that key thing that link us all together. So we need to be making sure that we are getting that right, that we have our science up-to-date and that we have our processes in place that protect and sustain our marine environment. The supertrawlers do not do that. They have broken the oceans elsewhere. We will not stand by and let them break our oceans. We believe this legislation needs to be improved. It needs to genuinely ban supertrawlers because it does not do that. Once this amendment is in place we would be able to support this legislation.


Debate adjourned.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-11-27,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (09:33):  The government will not be supporting the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014. I will go through first broadly what the bill does and also the Greens' proposed amendment, which we will not be supporting either. I will go through some of the reasons why we take a different approach on this issue.


The bill amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to repeal a sunset provision and enable the minister to establish an independent expert panel to conduct an assessment of the potential environmental impacts of a declared commercial fishing activity and to prohibit the declared fishing activity while the assessment is undertaken. On the Greens' proposed amendment, I will quote from Senator Whish-Wilson:


The Greens have put up an amendment to ban supertrawlers and vessels with freezing capacity over 2,000 tonnes. That is a globally recognised tonnage of fish that is being looked at by groups right around the world.


He goes on:


We consider that we need separate legislation for any size over that.


He goes on:


We would ask that Labor, through Senator Ludwig, who brought this forward, consider a proper amendment that will ban this type of fishing activity in this country once and for all. This is what millions of rec—


recreational—


fishermen across this country want—


apparently, according to Senator Whish-Wilson.


We do not agree with the Greens and we do not agree with the Labor Party on this issue. The reason the government opposes this bill as well as the amendments is that the amendments will have no effect on the recently expired or current declaration made under the now lapsed legislation. We support commercial, recreational and Indigenous fishers and are committed to the continuation of Australia's well-managed fisheries. The coalition has confidence in the sustainability of Australian fisheries managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. We will make any decisions regarding fisheries management based on the science. We will not be rushed. We will consider the expert panel report in its entirety and make appropriate decisions.


The government is aware of the concern among a range of groups, including recreational fishers, about the potential impact of supertrawlers on Australia's marine environment, protected species and local fish stocks. We intend to build public confidence in the fishery and fisheries management more generally. Commercial fishing has to be both environmentally and economically sustainable.


Agreeing to this bill would mean that the Minister for the Environment could declare any fishing activity at any time, and who knows what a future environment minister might do with that? For instance, he or she, in future, might consider that there is uncertainty associated with small rowboats and declare them, which would then mean that an expert panel would be established to investigate the matter, all at the cost of the taxpayer. Senator Ludwig is only bringing this back now, we believe, to play cheap wedge politics, and the Greens, not surprisingly, are jumping on the bandwagon.


Now I want to go back to Labor's record on this issue and their hypocrisy on this issue. It was Tony Burke, in his role as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who created this issue by inviting these types of vessels as part of his 2009 Small Pelagic Fishery Harvest Strategy. I quote:


… there are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels.


That is from page 2 of the Small Pelagic Fishery Harvest Strategy, from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority in 2009. Indeed, the former minister proudly trumpeted:


This is the first time a trawler with a storage capacity of 2000 tonne or more is likely to operate in an Australian fishery …


Then, as the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke completely bungled the development and introduction of the declared fishing activities bill in September 2012. This legislation was so bad that it needed amendment within hours of introduction. Labor clearly did not understand fisheries or fisheries management. Their bill initially banned recreational charter vessels. The declared fishing activities amendment was so bad that there was a 12-month sunset clause to kill it off.


As I said earlier, Senator Ludwig is bringing this back now to play cheap politics, notwithstanding that appalling history of mismanagement of this issue by the Labor Party and particularly by the former minister. But we know, in fact, that Senator Ludwig did once stand up for Australian fisheries. I quote from then Minister Ludwig in August 2012, responding to a Greens motion:


This disallowance motion is a message that the Greens political party do not support sustainable catch limits based on science.


Agreed. He continued:


It is a message that says the Greens want fisheries managed by politics, not qualified fisheries managers.


Well, we agree. He continued:


And it says that the Greens do not support the commercial operators who fish in some of the world's best managed fisheries.


He went on:


That message should be well understood, because I have no doubt that the same disregard for the science and management of our commercial fisheries will be extended to the legitimate pursuit of recreational fishing. As minister for fisheries—


this was Senator Ludwig saying this at the time—


I will not allow the emotive politics of the Greens political party to run fisheries management policy in this country. We will ensure that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is independent, that it makes independent decisions based on the science through its expert commissioners and on the facts that are presented to them. They will continue to make decisions based on sound judgement to ensure that fisheries are sustainable and meet all the ecological requirements—and, moreover, predicated on the precautionary principle so often espoused by the Greens.


He went on:


Why? Because AFMA will continue to apply sound policy to ensure that we will have sustainable fisheries now and into the future. For those reasons, the government oppose this motion.


That was a reasonably succinct position put by the then minister as to why we should reject these kinds of moves, why we should reject this Greens view of the world, which is not based on science. It is based on their version of cheap politics. It is based on their aversion really to any economic activity using our natural resources.


We know what the Greens are on about, but unfortunately the Labor Party in opposition has moved far closer to the Greens than we would like to see and, I am sure, much closer than many Labor senators would like the Labor Party to be. Many senators, I am sure, would be concerned about the Labor Party pandering to the Greens.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  That's why they're doing so well in the polls and you're doing so crap.




Senator SESELJA:
  All right. That is an interesting interjection there from Senator Whish-Wilson that the reason the Labor Party have had a spike in the polls is that they have gone closer to the Greens agenda. That is interesting. I wonder what Sam Dastyari might think about that when he is asked about whether or not it is good politics and good policy for the Labor Party to be following the Greens. But there is some truth in what Senator Whish-Wilson says, in that the Labor Party are following the Greens. I think Senator Whish-Wilson and I can agree on that. I think that for the Labor Party, if they do want to be back on the government benches at some point in the future, that is not the best strategy, because a party—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  Well, we will all have a different take on that, but Senator Whish-Wilson's position now is half right: the Labor Party are following the Greens, but I would disagree with the idea that the Labor Party following the Greens and moving further to the left on any policy, be it on fisheries management or anything else, is somehow going to be a winning formula, and I am sure that there would be many Labor senators—and I will not name names, but we know who they are—who would be horrified by that prospect.




Senator Lines:
  I think Labor is much better at getting the politics right than you are—




Senator SESELJA:
  Well, it is interesting, isn't it? The Labor government were obsessed with the politics. You are right, Senator Lines. You are absolutely right. The Labor Party in government were obsessed with the politics. They were obsessed with opinion polls. And that is one of the reasons they were such a shocking government, such an absolutely shocking government. In the end, their obsession with those things—instead of being good managers, instead of actually looking after the country, instead of showing good leadership—their obsession with those internal matters and their obsession with focus groups and opinion polls did not help them to be a good government and did not help them to maintain the support of the Australian people. So I thank Senator Lines for her contribution. She is absolutely right. They were obsessed with those kinds of things rather than good policy.



Senator Lines interjecting—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  I am very much enjoying this because I enjoy any time we can get political advice from the Greens party, because the Greens party, with their eight per cent of the vote—their eight per cent of the vote that they consistently attract—show just how much they represent mainstream Australia.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  Sorry, what was that? I missed that from the eight per cent party. I could not quite hear. But, unlike the Labor Party, we will not take our policy advice or our political advice from the Greens.


That is at the heart of this issue. What Senator Ludwig said when he was in government was right: we should rely on the science; we should not go for cheap politics on this issue; and the way we have managed our fisheries over a long period of time is world's best practice. It is world's best practice. You could look at instances where we have gotten things wrong, of course, but, if you compare our record to that of most nations around the world, we do a great job of maintaining a sustainable industry, of feeding millions of people right around the world through our fisheries and of having the highest environmental standards. Ask yourself. I often think about this when we discuss the issue of fisheries. We saw attempts by the former government to really scale back the amount of fishing that could take place in our waters. You often say to yourself: well, we are still going to be getting fish, but if we are not getting it from Australian waters, if we are not doing it with the best environmental standards here in Australia, we will be getting it from other places that have far lower environmental standards than we do in this country. I think we fundamentally have to ask ourselves the question about what would happen if we were to take the Greens view of the world and part of the Labor Party view of the world and say, 'Look, we're just going to ban it more and more and make it more and more restrictive for commercial fishing.'


We understand the need for balance. We absolutely support recreational fishing and we know that, if you overfish, that is negative in the long term for commercial fishing, it is negative for recreational fishing and it is not sustainable. So we have always taken a scientific approach to this, but you ask yourself: if you ban it more and more, it will happen in other places where there will not be the same kinds of environmental standards. We will not have the jobs in this country that flow from the industry. We will not have the ability to feed not just ourselves but the world, as we should. What will happen is that we will be importing more and more of the stuff, with no real knowledge of the environmental standards that apply in other places. That, to me, is the fundamental when we look at these issues.


Regarding this bill, let us go to the expert panel report. The independent expert scientific panel has completed its assessment of the potential impacts of supertrawlers, boats greater than 130 metres, on our marine environment. The panel focused on assessing the potential impact of supertrawlers on the marine environment and protected species, including seals, dolphins and seabirds, and the potential for localised depletion of target species. The panel provided the Minister for the Environment with a report on its findings in mid-October, which was published on the Department of the Environment's website on 19 November. The report gave a big tick to the existing risk based fisheries management framework used in Australian fisheries management. It is this framework that has resulted in Australia's fisheries being recognised as among the best managed anywhere in the world. This risk based management framework is already in action in the Small Pelagic Fishery. The harvest strategy exceeds internationally recommended standards such as those made by the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force in the report Little Fish, Big Impact. The report also highlighted that there are risks from the proposed fishing operation, as there are with all fishing, be that commercial or recreational. The government believes that scientific evidence must continue to underpin the management of our fisheries.


That sums up our objections here to what is being driven, and is consistently driven, by the Greens—and that is that we will do it in a scientific way, not in an emotive way and not based on whatever scare might be out there at the time. It is based on the best scientific evidence around how we can continue to have a vibrant fishing industry, which we on this side of the parliament certainly want to see. We want to see a commercial fishing industry in this country that is viable, creates jobs, feeds Australians and creates an export market. That is a great thing for Australia. We also want to manage threatened species. We also want to make sure that it is commercially sustainable, which means that overfishing is not only bad for the environment; it is not commercially sustainable in the long term. We also want to see strong Indigenous recreational fishing opportunities.


All of those things do operate in this country. In large part, they operate quite well. We believe in taking a scientific approach, accepting the expert advice, rather than having this ad hoc approach that we are seeing in this kind of legislation. For all of those reasons, the coalition will not be supporting the bill.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:48):  I rise today to speak in support of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014. The debate about supertrawlers is an ongoing issue of concern, particularly in my home state of Tasmania, but I do know that many senators have received emails on this issue regardless of which state or territory they represent. There is concern throughout Australia about the operation of supertrawlers in our waters.


Only this week, the Mercury newspaper, based in the southern part of Tasmania, reported on the findings of the report from the Expert Panel on a Declared Commercial Fishing Activity, the Final (Small Pelagic Fishery) Declaration 2012. Now that the government has been given the expert panel's report, it must make a decision and end uncertainty for Tasmanian fishers.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  They have been very silent on that point too, Senator Brown.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Absolutely, but that is not something that we would be surprised about, Senator Whish-Wilson. On page 302, the report concludes:


… direct interactions with protected species and localised depletion, as defined by the panel, will occur under the DCFA—


declared commercial fishing activity—


The panel’s assessment has confirmed that there are considerable uncertainties relating to the extent of those impacts and the level of impact that would create adverse environmental outcomes.


As in other fisheries facing similar uncertainties, a precautionary and adaptive, risk-based approach to management of the potential impacts of the DCFA is required. 


It is clear that Tasmania's fisheries, including protected species, will be depleted if supertrawlers are allowed to operate. Dolphin and seal numbers may also be affected.


We know that the Final (Small Pelagic Fishery) Declaration 2012 ended at midnight on 18 November this year. The Final (Small Pelagic Fishery) Declaration (No.2) 2013 will end at midnight on 24 April next year. We must act now to protect our environment and our fisheries. The factory fishing boat Meridian 1 has had approval to trawl Tasmanian waters. It will be the largest freezer trawler to fish in Australia. The Meridian 1 is expected to operate for only a few months to catch its quota of blue grenadier.


In Tasmania, news of the return of a large factory freezer trawler a few months ago put the issue of supertrawlers firmly back in the news and raised fears among the fishing industry. I want to refer to an editorial on 6 June in Hobart's Mercury newspaper on this Ukrainian owned trawler. The editorial states: 


The operators of these types of trawlers that can stay at sea for long periods of time, catch enormous amounts of fish, and process their catch while at sea would do well to keep the community properly informed. Fear of the unknown brings an instant and predictable reaction.


The Mercury editorial goes on to suggest that the operators of the Meridian 1 should tell the public of their plans. It is possible that this trawler will not pose a possible risk. However, it is obvious that Tasmanian waters are attractive to large trawlers, and I believe we need to be always on our guard. It also is apparent that we need legislative protections against these supertrawlers.


At the heart of this bill is the government's inaction. In the face of the government's failure to act to protect our fisheries, stand up for recreation fishers or provide the community and industry with certainty, Labor is again taking action. Federal Labor is committed to the sustainable management of Australia's marine resources and, when in government, we were strong defenders and managers of our oceans and those who use them.


Australia's fisheries are among the most sustainable and best managed in the world. Labor is committed to ensure that this remains the case. This bill restores a power to the environment and fisheries ministers to declare particular fishing activities that have not previously been used in Australian waters and require up to two years of additional scientific review where uncertainty exists. This will enable the government of the day to review fishing methods and vessels such as supertrawlers that have not been used in Australia before.


When these powers were introduced by Labor, we put in a sunset clause of 12 months to allow a fisheries review to be implemented. To ensure that Australia's waters were adequately protected from the risks associated with the use of supertrawlers, the Labor government amended the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in September 2012 to include these powers. The power was used once by Labor in government to declare a type of fishing activity that matched the specifications of a supertrawler. At the time this picked up the vessel the FV Abel Tasman, which was formerly known as the Margiris. In April 2013, we extended these restrictions, which means that these supertrawlers cannot operate in Australian waters until at least April 2015. At that time we also established an independent expert panel, which I referred to earlier, to provide an objective impact assessment of the environmental impacts of this activity. 


The use of supertrawlers in Australian waters has been a long-running issue that has generated passionate debate and high levels of concern within the community around the country. It has seen Tasmanians take to the street in large numbers to protest about supertrawlers. Tasmanians who would not normally attend public meetings have taken part in protest action. It is an issue that a large number of constituents regularly raise with me and many others, I am sure. Concerns have been raised about the bycatch of other fish, birds and marine mammals, particularly dolphins and seals. Communities need confidence that the environmental controls in place are reflective of their expectations. Re-establishing the power of the minister to establish an expert panel that will be able to assess the science is important in ensuring that communities can have this confidence.


Another concern often raised by my constituents in Tasmania, particularly those who are recreational fishers, has been the potential for localised depletion of fishing stock. In fact, Tasmanians were the first to raise their concerns about the impact of supertrawlers in our waters, at rallies and public meetings across the state. That is why I, along with my colleagues—and, I know, many others in the Senate—the member for Franklin, Julie Collins MP, and former Labor senator, Lin Thorp, lobbied the former Labor government to stop the supertrawler FV Abel Tasman from operating in Tasmanian waters in 2012.


Labor listened to the concerns and amended the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to ensure Australia's waters were adequately protected from risks associated with the use of supertrawlers. It was Labor that put a stop to the Abel Tasman, with a ban which turned the supertrawler around before it had started trawling Australia's oceans. However, the threat of other supertrawlers has not gone away and it is up to Labor, again, to take action.


In September 2012 when the powers were originally introduced, the Liberal and National parties opposed the amendments. Then opposition members used every reason under the sun to oppose the bill, but none of those reasons were very convincing. Senator Abetz said it was a 'very dangerous precedent that it sets'. And Senator Scullion stated, 'science of the specific fishery in question didn't require additional reviews'.


In September 2013, when asked whether the new government would lift the ban, Senator Colbeck said that the government would 'consider it, based on the science'. This statement contrasts with Senator Colbeck's previously definitive position on the ban. In September 2012, Senator Colbeck called banning the supertrawler a 'serious embarrassment'. Then in June 2013 he said actions against the trawler were a 'dishonest campaign'.


However, when the now Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, was questioned on March 4 2014 about the supertrawler he said:


It was banned with the support of members on this side of the House. It was banned; it will stay banned.


I welcome those statements and I welcome the support of the Prime Minister, albeit belatedly. I would suggest that the Prime Minister and Senator Abetz, who supported the Prime Minister's statement when asked about it in this place, refresh their memories by reviewing the Hansard records.


For the record I can quote from the Hansard of 6 March 2014, when Senator Abetz said:


The answer the Prime Minister gave was very clear. The supertrawler was banned, it remains banned and, as I understand it, the company involved has no interest in bringing its supertrawler back to Australia.


But then, of course, we know that the Liberal and National parties voted against the ban in both houses of parliament. They did not think that any more science or research was needed and they did not want to stop the supertrawler. We have to be very clear here, because the Prime Minister appears to be rewriting history: they did not want any more science or research and they did not want to stop the supertrawler. The Liberals voted against banning supertrawlers when they were in opposition, and now they are in government they have failed to take any action to protect our environment and our fisheries. 


This bill will force the government to choose whether to honour the Prime Minister's own words and the actions of the government when in opposition. This bill will make the government put their money where their mouth is. The government is yet to do even the most basic work required to implement sensible root-and-branch reform of fisheries management, as recommended by the Borthwick review and responded to by Labor in March 2013.


As the government refuses to act to protect our fisheries, stand up for recreational fishers or provide industry with any certainty, it is up to Labor to act. In government Labor supported strong powers to protect the environment, to respect the rights of recreational fishers and to provide certainty to business. Under the bill we consider here today, new supertrawlers will have to face the same tough response faced by the original supertrawler. The amendments give the government of the day the power to declare a particular type of fishing activity prohibited. This declaration will be made where the activity has not been used in Australia and some uncertainty exists around it. The prohibition will allow proper and thorough expert scientific work to be conducted.


The bill restores the powers to enable the environment minister, with the agreement of the Commonwealth fisheries minister, to make an interim declaration that a fishing activity is a prohibited 'declared commercial fishing activity' while an expert panel assesses the potential environmental impacts of the activity. The bill also restores the power of the environment minister—again with the agreement of the Commonwealth fisheries minister—to make a final declaration, for a period no longer than 24 months, that a fishing activity is a prohibited 'declared commercial fishing activity'. Further to this, the bill provides for the establishment of an expert panel in the case of the making of a final declaration. The bill also specifies the terms of reference of the panel and arrangements for reporting, with a requirement that a copy of the panel report be made publicly available. 


The former Labor government has a strong record when it comes to supporting our fisheries and making them healthier, sustainable and more resilient. Labor understands that Australia's fisheries are a valuable natural resource and that we all have a role in ensuring the future of an industry that contributes more than $2 billion to our economy each year. It was the previous Labor government that announced the first major review of Australian fisheries policy and legislation in over 20 years. In fact, it was Senator Ludwig, whose bill we discuss here today, who as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, commissioned an independent review of the policy and legislation governing the Commonwealth's fisheries management system in September 2012. The fisheries management review examined a range of issues to identify any improvements needed to ensure community and industry expectations of the Australian fisheries management regime can be met into the future.


In March last year the previous government released the report Review of Commonwealth fisheries: legislation, policy and management, also known as the Borthwick review. The findings of the review highlighted current management strengths and identified potential improvements to make Commonwealth fisheries more sustainable and to meet industry and community expectations into the future. On releasing the report, then Minister Ludwig stated:


The Borthwick Review concluded that greater transparency, a broader policy framework, and the clarification of objectives and roles could build on what is already a very effective system.


Senator Ludwig also indicated that the government's response to this report was to accept the direction of all 15 recommendations. The Labor government committed to engage with industry, recreational fishers, supply chain participants, environmental organisations, consumers and the general public on how best to implement the findings of the review.


Since coming to government, those opposite have done nothing to act on the findings of this review—nothing. The government is yet to do even the most basic work required to implement sensible root-and-branch reform of fisheries management Those opposite, under the leadership of Mr Abbott, have had over 12 months to do something to stop future supertrawlers and protect our oceans—but they have failed; they have failed to do anything. It should come as no surprise to anyone on this side of the chamber that they have not acted; in fact, it should not come as a surprise to anyone in the community who may be listening to this debate. 


We know that those opposite have no interest in protecting our fisheries and oceans. They proved this when they rolled back marine protection around the country. We on this side are proud to have delivered the world's largest marine reserve network. In government we added 2.3 million square kilometres to the system of Commonwealth marine reserves, expanding the overall size of the Commonwealth marine reserve estate to some 3.1 million square kilometres. Under Labor the number of marine reserves expanded from 27 to 60, covering more than a third of Commonwealth waters. However, the Abbott government has scrapped the comprehensive management plans that would have secured the long-term conservation and sustainable use of Australia's precious oceans. It scrapped them without parliamentary scrutiny, against expert scientific advice and in spite of extensive public consultation and the accumulation of more than 20 years of work which began under the Keating government. However, Labor will continue to take action to ensure that we protect Australia's ecosystems and fishing stock.


Our decisions must be based on evidence. As there is uncertainty about the impacts of fishing vessels and the size of super trawlers, it is appropriate that we pass this bill to ensure that appropriate restrictions and assessments are undertaken. We must also act today to ensure that we have viable fishing for tomorrow's generations. The Abbott government have shown no care about our fisheries and our oceans but Labor have. Today I stand by the comments I made when I spoke on the 2012 bill in this place, and I repeat those words: marine environments once wrecked take generations to recover, if they ever do. A precautionary approach is not only good policy but also the only decent option.


As the government refuses to act to protect our oceans and our fisheries, to stand up for recreational fishers or to provide local businesses with any certainty, it is again up to Labor to act. We know that only Labor will ensure that sustainable action is taken for the ongoing health and integrity of Australia's marine areas. I will end with a quote from Senator Ludwig's speech:


Australia has some of the best managed fisheries in the world. There is, however, a gap in the system in considering the powers of the environment and fisheries ministers to consider new commercial fishing vessels before they arrive and begin to fish. Given the government has failed to act, it is sensible for these powers to be restored. Labor is standing up for the oceans, recreational fishers and local businesses.


I commend this bill to the chamber. I urge all senators to support it, and I urge the government senators to support the Prime Minister's statement that super trawlers are banned and will remain banned. This will determine whether you are supporting your Prime Minister—or will you turn your backs on the statements he makes? We know that he tends to shoot from the hip, but it is now up to you to say whether or not you support your Prime Minister's words. (Time expired)

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2014-11-27,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (10:08):  I rise to speak against the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014, despite the appeals from Senator Brown on the other side. Her closing remarks, where she tried to illustrate the position of the Prime Minister, were somewhat mischievous. I know that the Prime Minister is a great supporter of commercial and recreational fishing in this country, and we have some of the most well-managed fisheries for recreational and commercial shell and fin fishers in the world. 


In speaking against this bill, I am highlighting the fact that this issue continues to be a gross Labor hypocrisy. As a senator for the state of South Australia and a strong supporter of a well-managed fisheries industry, I oppose the cheap wedge politics being peddled by Senator Ludwig. As we know, Senator Ludwig had a very low point in his ministerial career, when in June 2011 he put an overnight ban on the export of live cattle. We are still feeling the reverberations economically and socially of that knee-jerk, ill-considered decision of that time. This again is populist. I suspect that the CEO of GetUp! is often on the phone telling Senator Ludwig that the funding of his next campaign is probably in peril if he does not put this back on the map. I assume Senator Ludwig is a very good industrial union lawyer and I am sure he was in the past, but in matters of primary industries and fishing he gets an 'E'. 


Remember the mess Tony Burke created around the Abel Tasman and supertrawlers in the Small Pelagic Fishery Harvest Strategy? I recall there were four amendments in four days to his declared fishing activities bill. The Labor government response to the Abel Tasman—which I have been on and have toured; I will come to that later—which our party opposed at the time, has made us an international laughing stock. It has effectively tarnished the reputations of leading scientific and industry figures who have been acting in the interests of sustainability and good management of our marine natural resources.


But you do not have to take my word for it; you can read articles with headlines such as 'World mocks ban on trawler' by Philip Heyward in the Mercury, or 'Expert labels trawler ban ""embarrassing""' on the ABC, or 'Opposition to the Margiris ""super trawler"" not evidence based' by Bob Kearney in The Conversation. Then-Minister Burke's commercial fishing policy was more shambolic than a set of tangled crab nets, and Senator Ludwig needs to withdraw this bill for fear of getting caught in the same trap. He needs to allow the correct bodies to administer fishing activities in Australia. The issue is much bigger than just the trawler; it is about how we do business in Australia and how we manage a resource in a sustainable and profitable manner.


The Labor-Green approach is dangerous to the fisheries industry, an industry which, I might add, is worth over $2 billion annually. It employs around 11,600 people—7,300 directly and 4,300 indirectly—according to figures of just a few years ago, and we know that the industry has had growth since then.


The coalition government has confidence in the Australian Fisheries Management Authority regarding the management and sustainability of fisheries. Actions taken by AFMA have already led to a reduction in bycatch and sustainable ecosystems. Catch limits based on appropriate biomass percentages mean that the fisheries industry is already appropriately managed without any unnecessary ministerial intervention.


Currently, small pelagic fishery is productive and environmentally stable. In fact during July in my home of Adelaide the Small Pelagic Fisheries Workshop, a technical workshop and stakeholder forum, was hosted by the South Australian Research and Development Institute. The forum determined that Australian fisheries science and management was the world benchmark, with policies and practices for other nations to aspire to. Dr Patrick Hone, Executive Director of the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, said at the forum:


A key finding was that the science underpinning Australian fisheries management was robust and that our harvest strategy and rules were clearly precautionary and very much in line with the best practice guidelines put forward by the Lenfest Working Group and the Marine Stewardship Council.


The harvest strategies which Dr Hone speaks of started in 2007 under Minister Abetz as Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation. These strategies outline management actions needed to achieve biological and economic objectives. With the harvest strategies in place and operating uninterrupted, the fishing industry can work with greater confidence and management decisions can be made with transparency and forewarning.


Only this government, not Labor and certainly not the Greens, understands the main factor in commercial fishing management—that the industry be economically viable as well as environmentally sustainable. Removing the sunset clause, as Senator Ludwig is attempting to do, would allow the environment minister to declare any fishing activity, requiring the establishment of an expert panel to investigate each declaration. This is dangerous to the industry and, given our best-in-practice policies, completely unnecessary for the purpose of fisheries management.


The coalition continues to do what it said it would do during the election campaign regarding commercial fishing. Our commitments were to: make decisions based on science; wait for the expert panel report on declared fishing activities before making a decision on the declaration of larger vessels; and seek more data to address criticisms regarding the age of data used to establish fish stocks. Further to that, in late October, Minister Colbeck welcomed the ABARES fishery status reports, which showed that, for the first time in eight years, no Commonwealth managed fisheries were subject to overfishing. In fact, under this coalition government, fisheries stocks are on the improve.


To return now to marine parks and a sensitive matter in my home state, I note worriedly that Labor has introduced 19 marine parks with 80 no-take zones within South Australia. These laws came into effect on 1 October this year and impact commercial and recreational anglers alike. Not only will this affect the enjoyment of our marine areas but it will hurt the fragile economy of our regions. If it were not already obvious that Labor do not understand the science behind fisheries management, it is even more evident that they do not understand their own policy. South Australian Labor spent $1.8 million filming and promoting an awareness campaign for their unwanted marine parks. In these ads, a family is seen crabbing on the Port Noarlunga jetty. If the Labor Party had half a clue, they would have known that the area depicted in that advertisement has already banned crabbing. How ironic and cruel is that?




Senator Back:
  Breaking the law.




Senator EDWARDS:
  To add insult to injury, Senator Back—I note your interest in this matter—the South Australian environment minister, Minister Hunter, proved he was nowhere near being across his brief on ABC breakfast radio on 1 October, the same day as these new laws came into effect, when he could not indicate what sanctions existed in the highly controversial Port Wakefield zone. By contrast, my state Liberal counterparts introduced an amendment bill, which sensibly proposed the reintroduction of access to 12 of those zones. The policy was supported by the commercial and recreational fishing industries and provides a sustainable base from which to fish. Just remember that none of these fishing zones is under any pressure.


The bill was defeated by one vote, the vote cast by the so-called minister for regions, Mr Geoff Brock, the member for Frome. There is a famous YouTube video of the independent member for Frome, Mr Geoff Brock, telling recreational fishers just one month prior to the March state election, 'I'm here to fight for you guys.' What a turncoat he turned out to be. He has sold his independence—he is supposed to be an independent—and his word to his electorate for a shot at the ministry which he now holds, and I think he is yet to realise the damage that he has done to the state, let alone to his career and to all those in the political environment.


South Australian fishing and aquaculture industries are worth $217 million annually and South Australia is a very big employer, with some 6,000 people in the seafood industry. If you look at all those numbers I gave you earlier, South Australia's industry represents a very large percentage of the Australian seafood output. All of this hangs in the balance with the introduction of Labor's unnecessary, overregulating policies. We have confidence in the sustainability of Australian fisheries, currently managed by AFMA and recognised as some of the best practice in the world. To reiterate, policy must be driven by sound scientific advice and not knee-jerk reactions.


I said I would refer to the time when I visited what was then known as the Abel Tasman and went on to become known as the Margiris. Some people call it the supertrawler. I visited this ship—I was invited to go and have a look at it and I did so when it was located in Port Lincoln and subjected to that controversial ban. I took up the invitation and, I must say, that ship and its equipment are world-class. Senator Back, as you well know, to put to sea on an ocean-going global fishing boat you have to be highly technically trained, and the crew were. All of the equipment was first-rate, up-to-the-minute technology. The fisheries that they were to fish are already being fished. These were not extra fish being taken; these fish are already fished by numerous other, smaller boats. Imagine 24—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  Oh, and now we hear from the Greens. All of a sudden, we hear from the Greens. They do not want to hear the truth. They just want to perpetuate all their lies. These fish cannot be taken outside of quotas. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, if Senator Whish-Wilson wants to make a contribution to this, he can refute my claim. Are you suggesting that all the fish taken by any supertrawler are illegally taken, outside of a quota? All of these fish are taken within quotas. Imagine 24 small boats being put to sea with 24 crews taking the same fish that one boat would possibly take. The nets have escape hatches. Dolphins and seals can escape and do escape. This myth that all the sea is going to be vacuumed clean of all fish is hysteria peddled by those on the other side, who want to go and live in caves with no power and just wear bearskin rugs.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  The coalition loves supertrawlers.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, if you are not going to protect me from this barrage of nonsense that is coming from the Greens—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Dastyari
):  Order! The Senate will come to order!




Senator EDWARDS:
  This is an economical way in which to fish. It is an environmentally sensitive way in which to fish. People think that these fish are extra fish. They are not extra fish—they are already being fished. And do you know what? When they are fished by the 24 boats that put to sea, they have not got refrigeration. So that fish—the brown-fleshed fish, the pelagics—all go into a hold and do you know what they are used for? Fertiliser. Do you know what happens to the fish that are caught with these large harvest vessels? They get snap frozen and they are food grade, and they feed the nations of Africa. Mr Acting Deputy President, the Greens and Senator Whish-Wilson over there will not tell you that—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  Yes, that's what they turn it into.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Whish-Wilson, the senator will be heard in silence.




Senator EDWARDS:
  That is what you have when you put to sea with 24 boats fishing for the same fish. But what happens is that we turn it into food grade—if we were to allow this. We are going to turn it into fish for human consumption. We are going to try to feed the world. We do not want to feed the cats of the world; we do not want to fertilise the gardens of the world. We want to turn this into food grade fish. If you do it on a ship of the likes of the Abel Tasman or the Margiris, because they are big enough and have freezers, you snap freeze it and it is food grade. The Greens would deny the African nations a food source, a protein source. That is okay if you live in the leafy suburbs down there in Tasmania and you drink your lattes and have your sponge cakes on a Saturday morning after a nice pleasant week in the Senate. It is nonsense. 


This is not about environmental sustainability. This is about taking fish that is already taken and, quickly and efficiently, turning it into food grade. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will be very interested to hear Senator Whish-Wilson's contribution and to hear how he can refute my claims of this efficient way of gathering.


Senator Ludwig's bill is just another intervention into everybody's lives. It is an absolute irony. In South Australia we have got these protected zones now. And when you question government officials about why they are doing it, they say, 'because they are pristine environments.' What? We are putting in marine parks because they are pristine environments? Do you know why? Because they are well managed already. Recreational fishers and commercial fishers abide by the laws. But no, the dead hand of bureaucracy has to come in and lay itself over the fishing industry. Here we are: once again the Labor Party just wants to pull back all of that and get hold of it again. Just put that uncertainty into it so that the banks will not invest. You can have your livelihood taken—like you did with the live cattle export. You can have your livelihood taken away from you overnight. If you let this bill pass in this place, that is exactly what will happen. You will have another layer of uncertainty. I conclude: I support sustainable fishing industries in South Australia and I do so today by opposing this bill.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-11-27,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:28):  We have just heard the coalition arguing and denigrating, instead of being able to address the science. They are denigrating the arguments by having a go at people, calling people 'latte sippers'—the usual silly attacks that the coalition make when they cannot actually argue the point. The point here is that super trawlers around the world have actually broken our oceans and broken our fisheries. The reason we are getting better at managing our fisheries now is because we are in fact putting in rules and enforcing them for effective management of our fisheries. When we did not have that, we had our oceans being overfished.


As for this ludicrous argument that we will be feeding Africa, this supertrawler has been in the seas and oceans off Africa and has raped those oceans of fish for fertiliser, the very thing he has just said that we support. That is what they have been doing with supertrawlers—taking away the fish from Africa. Now he is saying that a supertrawler has to fish in our waters so that we can feed Africa when those very same supertrawlers have been taking the fish out of the oceans and depopulating those oceans. That is a ridiculous argument to make, just so he can make people feel sorry for the Africans, when he should be arguing for better regulation of supertrawlers there too, so that African people can feed themselves from their ocean supplies, not have fish stripped out of their oceans and taken elsewhere simply for the superprofits of the supertrawlers. I might add that supertrawlers also get well subsidised and try to access every subsidy they can get around the world.


This legislation is a step, but it would not ban supertrawlers as the ALP would like to suggest, as when they brought in legislation regarding supertrawlers when they were in government. It is fallacious, as is being implied, that this legislation bans supertrawlers. This is why Senator Whish-Wilson proposes an amendment that would ban supertrawlers with a freezer capacity of over 2,000 tonnes. His amendment would actually ban those supertrawlers and strengthen and give backbone to this legislation to achieve what the ALP claim that this legislation does. This legislation was introduced by Senator Ludwig, a former minister for fisheries. The original bill that was brought in by the previous government allowed the minister to declare a prohibited fishing activity, but it had a sunset clause of 12 months.


The aim of the legislation that we are currently debating is to remove that sunset clause, meaning the environment minister's powers to respond to new fishing operations would remain in place. Of course, we are hearing that people want to have another go at letting the supertrawler slip through so it can start fishing in our waters. Currently, the government does not have powers to declare a prohibited fishing vessel and implement a review. As I said, the clauses of this legislation do not ban supertrawlers, and that is why we need to amend the bill—so that we do have the capacity to fight industrial-scale fishing, because that is what it is. This is industrial-scale fishing. There are significant problems with this legislation in that, as I have said, it does not ban the introduction of industrial-scale factory-freezer trawlers, the so-called supertrawlers, into our SPF. Labor's proposed legislation puts the discretionary powers in the hands of the Liberal-National ministers, instead of the people having a say through their representatives in parliament.


In fact, the Greens pointed out this failure to Labor in 2012, while they were in government and were claiming to be dealing with the threat of supertrawlers to our fisheries and ecosystems—because supertrawlers not only threaten our fisheries; they threaten our ecosystems. Yet Labor did not take on board our amendments when we very clearly pointed out the holes in the legislation. While Labor are now trying to fix this failure, it is misleading to say, as they have been claiming to constituents, that they are banning supertrawlers. This legislation clearly does not, unfortunately. They did not do it while they were in government and they are not doing it with this legislation—again, that is why we need the amendments that Senator Whish-Wilson has proposed, which actually do deal with it by banning trawlers with a freezer capacity of over 2,000 tonnes.


All parties at various stages have said that they support a ban on supertrawlers. Well, this is the opportunity to prove it. This is the opportunity to prove that you do actually want to ban supertrawlers, by supporting the amendments that we are putting, which fill that hole in the legislation.


Labor justified the sunset clause at the time by stating that, because the Borthwick inquiry—the so-called root-and-branch inquiry into fisheries legislation processes—was underway, it was appropriate to have a sunset clause. Senator Ludwig at the time quoted Minister Burke as saying in his speech on this bill:


By that time the root-and-branch review of the fisheries management processes should be in place, but we will have this legislation to be able to fill that gap in the interim. 


Now we have the Borthwick review, a root-and-branch review, which has made a number of recommendations. The government need to implement these recommendations. They do not seem to have done anything with it. A particularly important point is that the Borthwick review has recommended a new third pillar to the legislation and management of Australia's fisheries, and that is one that directly addresses ecosystem impacts in the fisheries context. They say that for this ecosystem approach with a goal of minimising the impact of fishing effort on ecosystems, the government needs to address the balance between funding for private industry research and research for the public benefit of conserving the common and related ecosystem values. In other words, we need to include that in our legislation, and we do not at the moment and we have not seen a sign from the government of what they are going to do about it. That root-and-branch review showed that we have not quite got things right here. We do need to look at the impact on our ecosystems and at ecosystem science.


With this bill the ALP are trying to make people think that we are banning supertrawlers. As I said, supertrawlers will not be banned by this bill. While the opposition calls this tough legislation, it is not tough enough and it needs toughening up. We have heard a number of people quoting the expert panel review of the processes put in place under the previous legislation, introduced by the ALP when they were in government. I find it fascinating that the government has been quoting that review to justify their opposition to this legislation. It is really quite bizarre. 


The review actually vindicates the position that the Greens, recreational fishers, environment groups and the broader Tasmanian community took when the supertrawler first appeared on our horizon a couple of years ago. The report found that, even if protective measures were put in place, the supertrawler would impact on protected species like seals, dolphins and seabirds and would potentially lead to localised depletion of fish stocks. As my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson said recently in response to the release of the expert  report, the Greens have long argued that the science on the wider impacts were too uncertain for the minister to make a call on allowing this gigantic floating factory into our waters—in other words, to allow that industrial-scale fishing. We are still a long way from the point where we would be confident that industrial-scale fishing from a supertrawler would not have these impacts. That is one of the reasons that we need to amend the private member's bill before us—because we know that we need to do further work to ensure that industrial-scale fishing is not impacting on our marine ecosystems.


It is time that we acknowledged that supertrawlers are not the way to manage our oceans. The Greens have long been concerned about fisheries management. People from the government will claim that it is because we do not support fishing. That is absolute bunkum. It is simply not true. We want sustainable fisheries management because we want fish in our oceans for the future. Not only are they a critical part of our ecosystem; we know that many communities rely on fishing. But we do not want to see our oceans in a state where whole ecosystems have collapsed and we are no longer able to fish, because fisheries have collapsed. 


Australia does have a proud record of good fisheries management—better than most other places in the world—but that does not say that we have it perfect. Quite clearly, the Borthwick review and the expert report show that we have not got it perfect. The Borthwick review shows that we need to change our legislation so that we do incorporate better science on ecosystems. We do need to understand the impact of fisheries better, and we do need to keep ensuring that Commonwealth managed fisheries do not go backwards. It has taken quite a lot of effort to ensure that those fisheries do not go backwards. When I first started working on fisheries management many years ago, the Commonwealth could not claim that some of those Commonwealth fisheries were not going backwards, and it has been a lot of work to get them to the point where they are starting to improve. That is not to say that we should rest on our laurels; that means that we need to keep working to make sure those fisheries are protected.


Supertrawlers have broken our oceans around the planet. We should not be supporting supertrawlers. We support legislation that bans supertrawlers so that we do not have to keep fighting this issue every couple of years. If this private member's bill is not amended along the lines proposed by Senator Whish-Wilson, we will have to keep fighting this issue every couple of years, every time a supertrawler wants to sail over our horizons to start fishing on an industrial scale in our waters. It is simply not appropriate to compare numbers of boats to a supertrawler. A supertrawler can stay out at sea for a very long time. That is why we are proposing the limit of 2,000 tonnes—so that supertrawlers cannot stay out for weeks and weeks depopulating our oceans. 


One of my passions is marine protection. There have been decades of work done on the need for better marine protection. The way that the Abbott government essentially got rid of the world's leading marine parks and reserves system in this country, after over a decade of work that did all the science, was disgusting. It did all the science, it did the consultation and it put in place that world-leading system of marine protected areas. We have just had the World Parks Congress in this country, and I am so disappointed that I missed it. It only happens once every 10 years. All the leading experts on nature conservation from around the world come to one place and talk about protected areas, national parks and nature reserves around the world. I was so embarrassed that we no longer had what was, for a short length of time, the world's leading system of marine protected areas, which not only ensured biodiversity protection and ecosystem protection but fishing into the future. The science is there about the roles that marine protected areas play in protecting fish stocks and ensuring that they are there for the future. And what does this Luddite government do? One of their first actions on coming into government was to wipe that system off the face of our maps. They took away the management plans, which essentially means that now all you have is a system of lines on a map. Now the government are spending millions of dollars doing their review, when it is quite clear that the science was done and that the consultation was carried out. Because they are bowing to some of their noisy constituents who want to do whatever they want in the marine environment, they have got rid of those areas. 


The support for marine protection in this country is very high. In my home state of Western Australia, surveys show that over 70 per cent of people consistently support marine protection. Those areas need to be restored. The government talks about wasting money and red tape. Well, the government are wasting money in their review of those protected areas. They are simply doing it so that they can find an excuse to wipe out those areas permanently. It is a disgrace, and how the government could show itself at that World Park Congress and pretend it is doing something about marine protection is a complete joke.


This bill needs to be strengthened. Supertrawlers will be yet another impact on our marine environment, a marine environment that is under pressure from overfishing, from extraction, from run-off from land-based sources of pollution and from climate change. We are already seeing the impact of climate change on our marine environment, and, in particular, in some of those colder water temperate marine environments that are getting warmer. This is disturbing the ecosystems around Australia, in particular, in some of the southern areas, with some of the waters warming.


You are seeing, in my home state of Western Australia, marine species turning up much further south than they have ever been before. As I have said in this place before, that means that we need to change the way we are managing our marine environment and managing our fisheries because we are getting species that have not been there before. You are seeing invasive species that have never been seen before. They are taking off and invading marine environments and having an impact there that we have not seen before. That adds to the pressures on our marine environment.


What this government obviously wants now is to enable supertrawlers to come in and add another impact to that marine environment. The science that they were using to justify the supertrawler previously—the Abel Tasman or the Margiris, whichever name you want to call it—was not done on that specific pelagic fishery. It was not done on those species. It was done on jack mackerel, and marine scientists have shown the flaws in that science. The expert panel says that there is a great degree of uncertainty there and that we should be using the precautionary principle. The Borthwick review says that we need a third arm to the research that we do, looking at ecosystem science.


It is time that we took marine protection seriously. We have a short window of time to get this right. We need a series of marine protected areas. Just restore it. The work is done. Just restore those marine parks. Change the legislation so we can have a genuine, quality look at ecosystem science when we are doing fisheries management. Build on our international reputation for good fisheries science. We are some of the world leaders in our fisheries management. We do not want to see that go backwards. We want to keep progressing. It is another area where we can help regionally as we build our scientific marine expertise on the already excellent science that we have got here and the quality of our scientists. It is excellent. We need to build on that, and we can be helping the regions.


I know some of that has been done. But as the climate impacts on our marine environment we need to make sure that we are building that science and also helping regionally because the oceans are that key thing that link us all together. So we need to be making sure that we are getting that right, that we have our science up-to-date and that we have our processes in place that protect and sustain our marine environment. The supertrawlers do not do that. They have broken the oceans elsewhere. We will not stand by and let them break our oceans. We believe this legislation needs to be improved. It needs to genuinely ban supertrawlers because it does not do that. Once this amendment is in place we would be able to support this legislation.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Family Tax Benefit (Tighter Income Test) Bill 2014 will, if enacted, reduce payments of Family Tax Benefit Part A payments for days on and after 1 July 2015.


This will reduce government spending by more than $800 million by June 2018, with spending cuts to continue in subsequent years. Such a reduction of government spending improves the Budget position, improves the sustainability of social security, and reduces the long term taxation burden.


The reduction in government spending will include a reduction in departmental costs, reflecting lower processing costs for the Department of Human Services as fewer families would be in receipt of Family Tax Benefit Part A.


The Bill reduces Family Tax Benefit Part A payments for around 15 per cent of recipient families, while preserving payments for families with the least income.


The Bill only changes one number in the law—it sets the 'higher income free area' to zero.


Families with no income and families in receipt of certain income support payments are unaffected by this change. For other families, their Family Tax Benefit Part A will continue to be reduced by 20 per cent of any family income over the (current) $50,151 threshold. However, this reduction will not stop when the base rate is reached. Instead, the reduction will continue until the payment reaches zero.


No family with an income below $50,151 will be affected.


For families with incomes between $50,151 and $66,084, adverse impacts can only arise for those in receipt of substantial child maintenance payments. This is the case because, under current law, the Family Tax Benefit Part A payments for such families can be reduced to the base rate, irrespective of income levels. As such, once incomes exceed $50,151 and the income test commences, it will be possible, under this Bill, for the Family Tax Benefit Part A payment to fall below the base rate. The Parliamentary Budget Office estimate that 5,530 families may fall into this category.


For other families, adverse impacts can only arise for families with incomes in excess of $66,084. The majority of families who will incur an adverse impact will be families with incomes over $90,000.


Tax-welfare-churn is where people pay tax then get some of it back in welfare payments, only after the bureaucracy takes its cut, and only after taxpayers expend considerable effort to apply for the welfare payments on offer. Only through spending cuts such as those proposed in this Bill will tax-welfare-churn fall.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:03):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator MILNE:
  Senators Macdonald, Bernardi and Williams have made some basic factual errors that a simple Internet search would have identified. Dr Bob Brown is no longer Chair of Sea Shepherd and was not chair when the incident occurred. The Cairns court magistrate said that the 100-litre spill was minor and no environmental damage occurred because an absorbent boom was deployed immediately. Sea Shepherd issued a statement indicating that it was neither wilful nor reckless and that Sea Shepherd itself responded by notifying authorities of the spill. This is a poor attempt by the senators to attack the outstanding work of Sea Shepherd, which has tackled illegal whaling in our waters and this year will focus on illegal tooth fish hauls and continue its campaign against Western Australia's indiscriminate killing of sharks.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  What Senator Milne has just said is completely incorrect, as are most of the things the Greens say in this parliament. The discharge of the oil was noted by a passer-by and reported to the authorities.




Senator Siewert:
  Doesn't mean the Sea Shepherd didn't do it—didn't report it.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It was reported by Sea Shepherd after it had been reported by the authorities. So the importance of this motion is that there was some damage to the Great Barrier Reef that the Greens political party have never mentioned. Yet when anything else is remotely related to the Great Barrier Reef they are in this chamber shouting from the rooftop. Where were you when this happened? Where were you when this reckless and wilful discharge of oil into the Great Barrier Reef occurred? Nowhere, because it is an organisation associated with your former leader and involves the Sea Shepherd group. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that general business notice of motion No. 545 be agreed to.

 (Victoria) (12:22):  I present the explanatory memoranda and I move:

The speech read as follows—



REGULATOR OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS BILL 2014


Cannabis is an ancient plant that has been used for thousands of years to alleviate pain and treat certain medical conditions. It has been used to relieve some distressing symptoms, especially when front-line treatments have failed to work.


The anecdotal evidence from those who have used medicinal cannabis has been corroborated by international studies and trials, and there is a growing body of evidence appearing in peer reviewed and reputable medical and scientific journals supporting the use of medicinal cannabis under strict regulations.



That is why I am introducing a Bill to establish a Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis.



The Regulator will be responsible for licensing the production, manufacture, supply, use, research and import and export of medicinal cannabis. 


The Regulator's role will be to approve medicinal cannabis products for inclusion in a register. This system of regulating medicinal cannabis will operate separately from the Therapeutic Goods Administration. 


The establishment of the Regulator would not prevent pharmaceutical companies applying to the TGA instead of using the scheme established by this Bill. They will effectively have a choice about which system to use. So too will the States and Territories, who under this Bill can elect to be part of a regulated system for the cultivation, supply, research and use of medicinal cannabis. 


This Bill has been drafted so that it is consistent with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and ensures that cannabis used in ways not authorised or licenced by the Regulator will be subject to state and territory criminal sanctions. 


The Bill is divided into five parts, each setting out the functions and operations of the Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis. The Regulator will provide a national system for licencing the cultivation and manufacture of cannabis for medicinal purposes; it will authorise people to obtain and use medicinal cannabis and it will facilitate research into cannabis for medicinal purposes.


The Regulator will also maintain a number of confidential registers encompassing people granted licences to be authorised cultivators, producers, users, researchers and importers and exporters. Additionally, the Regulator will create and maintain a register of regulated medicinal cannabis products. To be included on the register, the Regulator must be satisfied that the cannabis is suitable for medicinal use, that it meets the appropriate standards, and that all designated requirements are met. The register is modelled on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. 


The registration process and the register will have a number of rules prescribed for those people applying to be included on the register and the Regulator will have the power to remove or vary registration. 


In this way, the Bill will ensure that medicinal cannabis is manufactured, supplied and used in a safe, consistent and controlled way. The licensing scheme ensures that all standards and regulations are complied with and the product will have to meet certain standards. Those authorised to use medicinal cannabis will likewise be required to meet strict criteria.


It is important to note that State and Territory criminal sanctions relating to illegal substances and drug use will still apply to anyone who misuses medicinal cannabis or fails to comply with the intent of this Bill. For example, if an authorised cultivator or manufacturer was to sell medicinal cannabis in any way not prescribed by the Regulator, or an authorised user was to sell or supply medicinal cannabis, they would be subject to the criminal sanctions that apply in the relevant State or Territory the offence was committed in. 


The principle purpose of this Bill is to create a scheme whereby authorised patients, their carer or their medical practitioner can access specific medicinal cannabis products for medical use.


The Bill is intended to operate in conjunction with medical practitioners, who can apply to the Regulator on behalf of a patient or carer. 


Research and development of medicinal cannabis is a growing field of science. It is important that research into types and strains of cannabinoids and medicinal cannabis be encouraged and furthered by the Regulator. The experimental cannabis licensing scheme, which will be operated by the Regulator, will allow authorised persons to develop, evaluate, test and improve cannabis products for medicinal purposes. The Regulator will also be responsible for issuing licences and prescribing a scheme for research and experiments with medicinal cannabis. 


The on-going research into medicinal cannabis is an exciting field and Australia can play a lead role in improving methods of cultivation, evaluating efficacy and safety, improving delivery methods – such as how medicinal cannabis can be consumed by an authorised patient – and performing other clinical trials. This will further our understanding of cannabis as a medicinal product.


The Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis will be a listed entity with codified functions and powers, such as a Board, Chief Executive Officer and staff. The Minister will appoint the Chair and qualified members. The authorisation to cultivate or use medicinal cannabis necessitates expertise in a number of areas, such as plant cultivation, pharmacy, medicine, legal implications and criminality, so membership of the Regulator will include people with expertise in one of the following fields: Medicine, Pharmacology, Palliative Care, Botany, Horticulture, Law and Law enforcement or patient advocacy. 


The membership must include at least one medical practitioner, one member of the Australia Federal Police and one person representing patients and users. This provides a balance of interests. 


Finally, this Bill recognises that cannabis is a drug that is not legal in Australian states and territories. As with the Australian poppy industry, cannabis can be used for medicinal purposes as well as being a drug that is not legally available and carries criminal sanctions for cultivation, possession and trafficking. It is necessary that sanctions and penalties apply to any authorised person who abuses or misuses their obligations to the Regulator to provide, supply or use cannabis for medicinal purposes.


Both the public and law enforcement agencies must be confident that there are strict provisions in place so that only those authorised have access to medicinal cannabis and that manufacture and use is conducted under strict guidelines. 


The monitoring and investigative powers in the Bill apply only to people authorised by the Regulator to cultivate, supply, use or experiment with medicinal cannabis. A person or persons applying to the Regulator for a licence will be advised of the monitoring and investigative powers.


This Bill establishes a strict and controlled Regulator to licence every aspect of medicinal cannabis, from cultivation through to end users. It will allow authorised people to use a medicinal cannabis product where front-line treatments have failed or where it can alleviate pain or other symptoms.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This bill, the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2014, amends the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to provide that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, be a member of the Security Management Board. Alternatively, in place of the commissioner, a deputy commissioner or senior executive AFP employee, may be a member of the Security Management Board for Parliament House upon nomination by the presiding officers. The bill also amends the existing functions of the board to include the operation of security measures.


As President of the Senate, my primary concern is for the safety of Parliament House, but more importantly its occupants, and to ensure that people may go about their business in a safe and secure environment. As senators will be aware, the existing security arrangements for Parliament House have been enhanced and strengthened over the past weeks, following the national terrorism public alert level being raised from medium to high. Security arrangements in the parliamentary precincts are under continual and careful assessment, and I am working closely with a range of departments including security and intelligence agencies, in carrying out the necessary security works within the parliamentary precinct.


Together with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, we have already implemented additional measures here at Parliament House, including enhanced perimeter controls, changed access arrangements for the public and private areas of Parliament House, and an armed response capability. We have also increased the armed presence guarding our parliament, which now includes long armed weapons. Whilst we have taken the necessary steps on security early, building occupants will notice significant building security works being undertaken in the weeks and months ahead.


As part of the physical security enhancements, we have been reviewing the governance arrangements for security matters within Parliament House. This bill seeks to further strengthen those governance arrangements in two important areas.


Firstly, this bill will enable a representative of the Australian Federal Police to be a full member of the Security Management Board, a board which is established under section 65A of the Parliamentary Service Act 1999. This board provides advice to the presiding officers as required, on security policy and the management of security measures, for Parliament House.


Other members of the board include representatives from the Department of the Senate, the Department of the House of Representatives, and the Department of Parliamentary Services. The function of the board is to provide advice to the presiding officers on a range of security measures, and having the Australian Federal Police as a member of the board will boost the board's capability and reach on security matters.


Secondly, this bill will amend the remit of the board, which is set out in subsection 65A(5) of the Act, to allow the board to provide advice to the presiding officers on the management or operation of security measures for Parliament House. This will mean that the board may provide a wide range of advice to the presiding officers on both short-term and long-term security matters.


Accordingly, I commend the bill.

The speeches read as follows—




CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL 2014


The Customs Amendment Bill 2014 is an omnibus bill that proposes a number of minor changes to the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act). 


Firstly, the bill will amend the Customs Act to extend Customs powers of examination to the baggage of domestic travellers on international flights and voyages, and to domestic cargo that is carried on an international flight or voyage. Domestic travellers and their personal effects and domestic cargo are often carried on domestic legs of international flights or voyages between Australian ports or airports and places other than proclaimed ports and airports by approved ships and aircraft.


There is a serious vulnerability that dutiable or prohibited goods will be transferred where domestic travellers on international flights can access the sterile areas of airports and mix with international travellers during embarkation and disembarkation processing. The intermingling of domestic cargo and imported goods (or goods for export) also presents risks for diversion of cargo from one stream to the other.


The amendment will ensure that Customs control and powers of examination are provided for the goods of domestic travellers and of domestic cargo on international flights or voyages equal to the powers to examine the goods of international travellers and international cargo. This will close the gap in the treatment of identified border risks and reduce the advantage taken by criminal entities where domestic and international interactions can occur.


This bill will also extend Customs control to those places at which ships and aircraft often arrive in Australia that are not proclaimed ports or airports and where government agencies do not have a strong presence. International ships or aircraft may seek permission to bring a ship or aircraft to a place other than a proclaimed port or airport. For instance, the cruise ship industry regularly seeks permission to visit non-proclaimed areas of the Australian coastline. Industries involved in offshore resource activities do not utilise traditional port facilities and often seek permission to bring vessels direct to an offshore installation. The master of a ship or pilot of an aircraft may also bring the ship or aircraft to a place other than a port or airport due to stress of weather or other reasonable cause. 


It is in these instances that vulnerabilities exist when ships or aircraft brought to non-proclaimed places as part of an international journey may also be involved in disembarking travellers or unloading goods in those locations. Extending Customs control and examination powers to these non-proclaimed places will minimise the risks that these activities may pose.


This bill will improve, and make consistent with other parts of the Customs Act, the application processes for permissions to load and unload ships' and aircraft's stores, permissions to transfer goods between certain vessels and applications for a certificate of clearance. These amendments will also support initiatives to enable online applications for industry to seek these permissions.


The bill will also provide greater flexibility in relation to the reporting of the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia and reporting stores and prohibited goods on such ships and aircraft. These changes will allow earlier assessment and the planning of resources required if the stores or prohibited goods reported present risks, including the management of firearms, weapons and narcotics. 


The bill will also correct a technical error in relation to the interaction of Customs and Border Protection's Infringement Notice Scheme and claims process for seized goods under the Customs Act.


Finally, the bill will also improve the administration of the appointment of authorised officers by class under the Customs Act.


 


SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2014


Employers operating in multiple states deal with different workers' compensation schemes and work health and safety regulations in each jurisdiction around Australia. This increases red tape for employers and is confusing for workers who are subject to different regulation and benefits depending on which state or territory they are employed in.


While in the past, certain private sector corporations have been able to self-insure for workers' compensation coverage through the Commonwealth's Comcare scheme, a moratorium on new corporations entering the Comcare scheme was imposed in 2007 by Labor. This was despite evidence from the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry into National Workers' Compensation and Occupational Health and Safety Frameworks which found that the cost for multistate employers of complying with multiple state workers' compensation arrangements was considerable. Those costs could have been used more effectively to create new jobs and improve the safety standards within the enterprise. The Howard government responded to the Productivity Commission inquiry recommendations by allowing eligible private corporations that operated in multiple states to apply for a self-insurance license with the Comcare scheme. 


There are currently 30 licenced corporations who are benefiting from the reduced red tape and cost by having one set of workers' compensation arrangements for their national workforce. Ten of these are current or former Commonwealth authorities such as Australia Post and Telstra. The remaining twenty are private corporations such as Optus, TNT, the National Australia Bank and John Holland Corporation. The work health and safety performance of these companies since joining the Comcare scheme has been strong and in most cases has been better than it was under multiple state schemes. These companies have the benefit of significantly reduced red tape, cost and bureaucracy which frees them up to work more effectively with their employees to improve work health and safety in their organisations.


Following a campaign from the union bosses, the previous Labor government banned multistate companies from joining the Comcare scheme. Labor refused to lift the ban despite a 2012 review of the Comcare scheme commissioned by Labor led by Dr Allan Hawke AC, which recommended lifting the moratorium preventing multistate employers from joining the Comcare scheme, finding the requirement to insure in multiple states and territories to be inefficient and costly. The Leader of the Opposition sat on his hands and did not enact any recommendations of the report as workplace relations minister.


On 2 December 2013, the Coalition government lifted the moratorium so that multistate employers, which meet rigorous financial and governance criteria and demonstrate suitable work health and safety performance, can apply for a license to self-insure in the Comcare scheme, rather than through multiple schemes. It is the government's intention to also allow the multistate employers who choose to apply to self-insure for workers' compensation arrangements with Comcare, to also have one set of work, health and safety regulation rather than be subject to multiple state requirements and regulators.


This bill seeks to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (the SRC Act) and the 11 to expand the eligibility of corporations to self-insure through the Commonwealth's Comcare scheme.


The amendments:


remove the need for the minister to declare eligibility to apply for a self-insurance licence while maintaining the ability for the minister to issue directions to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. This will streamline the current two-stage approval process;


remove the outdated requirement that a corporation must be in competition with a Commonwealth authority, or former Commonwealth authority, to enter the Comcare scheme; and


broaden the range of corporations that are eligible for a licence to self-insure under the Comcare scheme to 'national employers' defined as an employer that is required to meet workers' compensation obligations under the laws of two or more states or territories.


This approach will reduce red tape while ensuring a strong and robust approval process by the independent Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission.


These important productivity reforms are critical for multistate employers. They will give these employers the option of continuing to operate under multilayered worker's compensation and work health and safety regimes, or to apply to have one set of national arrangements. 


It is anticipated that the reduction in red tape and significant savings that could be realised for business could be spent on creating jobs and reinvesting in the economy. 



Group licences



Currently, corporations applying to be covered under the Comcare scheme must be assessed individually for eligibility. A feature that business has been seeking for some time is the introduction of group licences to the SRC Act.


The bill provides for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to grant a licence to an eligible group of corporations that are owned by the same holding company, in line with the state schemes and the commercial reality of modern multicompany corporate structures.


Introduction of group licences will reduce red tape and costs for corporations as it recognises that groups of interrelated corporations often share return-to-work and work health and safety systems within the group. It will also recognise that each entity that forms part of a group does not individually need to meet the definition of a national employer.



This reform will be better for businesses, better for workers and better for the economy.




Serious and wilful misconduct



Currently under the SRC Act, workers' compensation can be claimed by a worker who is injured while involved in payable employment where an injury caused by the serious and wilful misconduct of the employee results in death or serious and permanent impairment. 


The bill removes access to compensation where any injury sustained by an employee is caused by their own serious and wilful misconduct.


While claims in this category are rare, the Australian public rightly expects that employees should take personal responsibility for their actions. The government believes that the workers' compensation scheme should be geared towards people acting in a proper and safe manner and not include a safety net for people who break the rules and put at risk not just themselves but other employees as well.



Offsite recess breaks



Currently workers' compensation is payable for injuries that occur during recess breaks, even if the employee is not at the place of work when the injury occurs, contrary to the position in South Australia and Tasmania.


The SRC Act as originally drafted provided compensation coverage for employees who were injured while absent from their place of work during an ordinary recess. This provision was removed by the coalition government in 2007, and then reintroduced by the Labor government in 2011.


The effect of the previous government's change to the Act is that workers' compensation could be payable, for example, where an employee sustains an injury while shopping, at a restaurant or playing sport away from the employee's place of employment during a lunch break. This is despite the employer having no control over the activities of the employee or the environment in which the employee engages in such activities. The proper avenue for people to seek recompense for injuries under such circumstances is through the owner of the premises where an injury occurred, not through their employer who has no control over the matter.


This bill addresses this unfair arrangement. Workers who are injured at work, even while having a recess or lunch break, will remain fully covered. Injuries that occur while the worker is away from the workplace undertaking activities associated with the employee's employment or at the request or direction of the employer will also still be covered.



Conclusion



This bill will reduce red tape and help to build a stronger and more prosperous economy. The real savings to business that will be realised under this bill can be reinvested in jobs and in the economy.

 (South Australia) (15:07):  I move:




That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.





Senator Abetz:
  Off you go!




Senator GALLACHER:
  Thank you, Leader of the Government. I will take that invitation. Yesterday, between the 'rhetorical flourish' and the deadpan non-committal answers given by the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston, there was a great contribution from Senator Faulkner. Without any malice—I got the sense that he did not take any great enjoyment out of it—he analytically, dispassionately and systematically demolished all of the arguments that the Minister for Defence put up in defence of his position.


But I want to take a slightly different tack The Opposition Whip, Senator McEwen, put it very succinctly today when she said there are lots of groups in the community that rely on certainty and confidence in our economy. One of those groups is the very valuable and highly skilled workforce at the Australian Submarine Corporation, and another, sitting alongside it, is the small business community that relies on those people having confidence to make a decision to buy a car, a house, some insurance, a holiday and all the normal things that workers in the economy do. There are a number of very large companies and a number of quite disparate sectors who look at the manufacturing base, which is collected in South Australia around defence; and see the potential from possibly the greatest investment that this nation will make in defence procurement; and make long, careful, deliberate decisions in respect of that. Those companies have had that confidence blown away by a completely callous statement that the ASC 'could not be trusted to build a canoe'.


This is so serious for the state of South Australia. We had the decisions in the automotive industry. The next largest manufacturing sector is the defence sector. The Minister for Defence stood in the people's Senate and said, 'I wouldn't trust them to build a canoe'. He did not suffer any penalty for that despite the fact that there are workers going home to their families and considering whether they can move to a bigger house, buy a new car or take a holiday. The uncertainty that was expressed in this chamber the other day is widely held, deeply felt and repugnant to many South Australians. We are not just talking about Labor or Liberal here; probably 90 per cent of South Australian electors find the statement of the minister completely repugnant. It impugns the reputation of the ASC workers. It impugns the reputation of South Australia as a whole. It is completely unacceptable to simply say, 'I had a rhetorical flourish.' It is completely unacceptable. Senator Faulkner said that if a reasonable person could find a predisposition to bias in the defence procurement process then that comment was totally out of order. No penalty has been paid. The Prime Minister has come out and tried to salvage things a bit. All of the South Australian members of parliament that I have anything to do with have tried to salvage things a bit. There will be an adjudication on this—and it may well come on 6 December at the by-election in South Australia.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator GALLACHER:
  Senator Macdonald is yawning from across the chamber; it will be very interesting to see whether voters and electors in South Australia go to sleep like Senator Macdonald or actually stand up and make a decision based on the treatment of their state by a very callous minister who in my view has gone beyond the pale in castigating, denigrating and impugning not only South Australian submarine workers but South Australia as a whole. This is a widely-held and deeply-felt issue—and we will get an adjudication. Senator Macdonald will be able to read the paper, the same as I do. After the Victorian election, there will be a South Australian election and people will make a decision based on the character of this government. This government will basically have an adjudication on what it has done and said about South Australia in the manufacturing sector in particular. It is an absolute travesty that this minister has not fallen on his sword and taken responsibility for denigrating hardworking people. (Time expired)

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:12):  Haven't we seen a contrast today and yesterday in this place between the highly competent, measured, focused and hardworking Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston, and those shrieking disgraceful attacks that have been visited upon him by Senator Wong and Senator Conroy! What a contrast it has been. Why would people make such attacks? We know that the best form of defence is attack. What is the best way of covering your own failure? Attack your successor and deflect attention from yourself. Haven't these two exhibited both of those traits of trying to deflect attention from themselves! In the time available to me today, I am going to refocus attention on them.


It is interesting that Senator Gallacher speaks about the biggest investments in defence in Australia's history when in fact the former Labor government, led from South Australia by the then finance minister, Senator Wong, a South Australian, oversaw the delay of 119 defence contracts, the reduction of 43 and the complete cancellation of eight. This was a finance minister who failed to stand up for South Australia, who failed to stand up for South Australian jobs in the defence sector. She now stands here holier than thou and tries to bring down the very person who is succeeding in filling the disgraceful gap that was left by the Labor government This was the finance minister at the time who inherited a surplus and who inherited a country with no net debt. Then, the lamentable circumstance of $200 billion of deficit, borrowing $1 billion a month, $33 million a day, two new primary schools every day, seven days a week, is what the failed then finance minister, Senator Wong, left us with. Does she apologise? No.


The other point of apology that Senator Wong has been very silent on is the second of the persecutors and that is Senator Conroy. When did she, as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, stand up and say to Senator Conroy, 'You will come in here and you will apologise for the disgraceful performance that you visited upon General Campbell during Senate estimates'? Our Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Abetz, gave advice to Senator Johnston that he did overstep the mark. His hyperbole in the excitement of the moment was too much. And didn't we see the contrast of the two, Senator Abetz, through you, Deputy President? Didn't we see Senator Johnston come in here and say, 'Yes, I do apologise for the words I used'?


Before I get on to Senator Conroy—and it is a shame I only have a minute and 54 seconds left—what Senator Johnston was doing was firing a shot, not across the bows of workers at ASC, he was saying to the management of the Australian Submarine Corporation, 'Lift your game'. That is who he was talking about. How often do we hear Senator Cameron going on about poor leadership or poor management in this country and the fact that the workers of this country are held back by the management and the leadership. Yes, Senator Johnston may have overstepped the mark, yes, he may have use those words that he now regrets, but what he was doing was saying to the management of that company, 'Lift your game so that you will once again be credible, so that you will once again be able to ensure your workforce has work'. That is what I heard.


In the minute that I have left let's talk about Senator Conroy. It is not just that he rudely criticised a distinguished general of the Australian Army, it is that what General Campbell was referring to was the fact that he and this government were repairing the shocking demise that had been visited by the last Labor government in terms of the protection of our borders. It was General Campbell who was referring to the success of Operation Sovereign Borders, and Senator Conroy could not stand it. He could not sit there and hear how this man, led and guided by Minister Morrison, was actually redoing what Labor had undone. That is what that was all about, and when he refused to apologise his words were, 'I'll come into the chamber'. Well, we have been waiting nine months for him to come into the chamber. We saw Senator Johnston yesterday, a distinguished minister, stand up and apologise. I wait and I challenge Senator Conroy to come in here now and redress that imbalance. (Time expired)

Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:17):  Yesterday, for the first time since 2005, a cabinet minister was censured by the Senate. Today, Labor senators and members have called on the Prime Minister to request the Minister for Defence resign. We are not the only ones asking the minister to do the right thing and resign. Even The Advertiser, the bastion of the conservative press in South Australia, is calling on the Minister for Defence to resign. We know that his fellow coalition members and senators are hoping he will do the right thing and resign. The minister's grip on his ministry was already tenuous when, on Tuesday this week during question time, in an attempt to provide cover for the fact he was about to renege on his pre-election promise to build the future submarines in South Australia, the minister made his now infamous and outrageous comment about the women and men of the Australian Submarine Corporation in Adelaide. He said that he would not trust them to build a canoe.


The reaction in Adelaide was instantaneous. How dare the Minister for Defence say that when everyone knows that Australian Submarine Corporation workers are some of the most skilled, dedicated and innovative in this country. How dare he use those workers as cover for his government's decision to break the promise about building the future submarines in South Australia. What damage has he done to the future of manufacturing and shipbuilding in this country with a comment like that which was immediately picked up by the international media? What signal did that message send to the rest of the world about Australia's naval capability? He has compromised our standing in the world, and that is a truly irresponsible thing for a cabinet minister to do. All Minister Johnston's weasel words, his half-hearted apology, his ludicrous explanation of a 'rhetorical flourish' and his utterly pathetic attempts to back track, ever since Tuesday's outrageous comment, have not worked. Business, workers, the media, even his own colleagues know that there is no climbing out of the hole that the minister has dug for himself.


Last Tuesday night I received an email from a constituent in South Australia, Mr Brenton Westell, regarding Senator Johnston's comments. He had sent it to the minister but he also sent me a copy. I am going to read this email out, because it captures exactly the outrage that South Australians felt on Tuesday—and are still feeling today. The email, addressed to Senator Johnston, said:


Dear Senator,


I have just viewed your remarks regarding ASC on the floor of the senate, and party politics aside, I am personally insulted by these comments.


My 23 year old son is a graduate engineer at ASC, having graduated with honours last year from Adelaide University. Four years at uni, studying harder than most people will ever know, after achieving straight A's in year 12, to have a Federal Senator tell him you wouldn't trust him to build a canoe.


You may have an agenda to push, but this does not give you carte blanche to denigrate the ""lifters"" your treasurer keeps wanting us all to be.


I doubt you will even read this, but on the off chance someone does, it is my view that a heartfelt apology in the senate is the only redress to the insult I feel on the part of a fine young man who actually deserves your respect rather than your spite.


Brenton Westell


I know that Mr Westell has followed up his email with a call to the Prime Minister's office calling on the Minister for Defence to resign. I look forward to hearing what response Mr Westell gets from the Minister for Defence and from the Prime Minister. There are, of course, other South Australians calling on the Minister for Defence to resign. South Australian state Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, was unforgiving of the minister's comments. He said of Senator Johnston:


Unless he can rebuild some connection, some rapport, some confidence within the industry, then I don't think he has any alternative (but to resign). 


South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill has also publicly slammed the minister for his remarks, saying that he has 'demonstrated that he will not be objective or impartial' and that his 'position is no longer tenable and he must resign.' The calls for the minister to resign are coming from all sides of politics. (Time expired)

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2014-11-27,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (15:22):  When I sit here and listen to the arguments of the other side in this debate and during question time, I am reminded of that great American children's TV show Sesame Street. The children up in the gallery are perhaps more recent viewers of that show than I am, but I remember that there is a great song in Sesame Street called One of These Things is not Like the Other. The reason I think of that song when I hear their debate is that we have now spent two days in the Senate—quite a long time yesterday afternoon—arguing about censoring a senator. That is a very serious motion and a very serious act of this parliament—about a sentence that he spoke, about an analogy that he made that was slightly mangled and that he came in and apologised for later. And we have wasted hours upon hours of our time to make this censure motion. This song came to me, because yesterday when I was hearing this debate, I thought: I am only new to this place. What other acts and behaviours have we censured in this place in the past? We have over 100 years of history so presumably there is some kind of precedent here for censure motions. What acts actually constitute the need for a parliament to censure someone ? If you go to Odgers, it says on page 461:


Ministers have been censured for matters as varied as: misleading the Senate, failing to answer questions on notice within the stipulated time limit, maladministration of a department, attempting to interfere in the justice system of another country, failing to declare an interest in a matter, for “contemptuous abuse” of the Senate, and for refusing to produce documents in compliance with an order of the Senate.


These are all very serious matters. When we come to do the next edition of Odgers, unfortunately—and the Clerk is here—the Clerk is going to have to add a little phrase to say 'and someone was also censured for mangling an analogy and subsequently apologising for it'. One of those things is not like the other. I do not know which one. There are about 10 serious acts there and another one which is not like the others. Yesterday, though, we had this faux outrage from the other side about this. I think it is appropriate that we do think of Sesame Streetwhen we talk about the Labor Party's approach to defence policy in this nation, because it is as if their defence policy is written by muppets. Kermit the frog would do a better job than these guys are doing right now writing defence policy. 


I walk around this place, and people put stickers in their windows all the time about what is going on. I saw a humorous one in Senator Cameron's office earlier—it was quite good. But I keep seeing bumper stickers in Labor Senators' offices saying, 'Build, design and maintain here'. And there is a picture of a submarine. I looked at the Senate report that Labor senators just signed off on, in the Senate Economics References Committee, and nowhere in that report do they make a recommendation to build, designed or maintain ships here. So they are putting these bumper stickers presumably on their cars as they are driving around the electorates and they put them in their offices, but they did not make that recommendation in the report. Why didn't they make that recommendation in the report? Because no-one made that recommendation to the Senate Economics References Committee. No-one! Not one expert said that we should build, design or maintain submarines here. Everybody knows that we are not going to build, design or maintain ships here. We may do a component of the work here, and the government is still considering how much that might be. But we are not going to design submarines here. We are not going to be able to do all of that work here. All of the ships we are currently building, which were approved and contracted for under the Labor Party, were all done with substantial amounts of work from overseas. The previous submarines that we had built were the Collins Class, which the Labor Party held up as a template for the future. Much of the work on those submarines, and much of the equipment, comes from European submarine companies. The weapons systems come from American submarine companies. So these guys over there are not producing a proper defence policy. They are producing something that cannot be attained that even they do not want to put their name to.


The other interesting thing, when you read through the Labor senators' report that they released a couple of weeks ago, is that they say that what they want is an open and transparent tendering process. They want it to be open and transparent and they want it to be competitive and open to everybody, except on the one page of the report they say, 'The Japanese can't apply'. So it is open and competitive, but we cannot have Japanese ships.




Senator Abetz:
  What!




Senator CANAVAN:
  That is right, Senator Abetz. I wish I had the words. I have the words of another debate here but I do not have the report on the me. There is a sentence in that report that says we should not go ahead with a Japanese submarine right now. Why? If we are going to have an open and competitive tender process, what have you got against Japanese submarines? What is against it? The reason they doing this is because they are running a political campaign and not a defence policy. It is not a policy to defend the future of our nation. This government is focused on making sure that our policy is put in place for the best interests to defend our nation. Over there, they are wanting to get grabs for late night TV.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:28):  I rise to take note of Senator Cormann's answer to my question about his broken promise to the victims of the Trio Capital collapse, specifically the association of the ARP Growth Fund. The senator tries to run away from the promises he made in opposition. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I say to the minister: he may well run but he cannot hide. At least not now with the eyes of the Senate watching him on this matter. Running away from reality, running away from his promises, breaking his word—but it is clear today that his word, like the word of the Prime Minister, simply means nothing. Indeed, his words mean less than nothing. His words have been constructed to deceive. 


Let us be clear about the facts that underpin my question to the minister today. The facts are these: before the election, at a number of conferences and forums and on the public record, the minister gave indications of support for compensation. On 7 May last year he said:


… we do believe that there is a case for the government to look more closely as to whether there would be some justification for a level of compensation, if not for the full amount of the loss, but at least a level of compensation.


In a press release dated 2 July 2013, a matter of weeks before the election, the minister advocated the need to:


… explore whether unique circumstances surrounding the Trio collapse justify at least a level of compensation to victims so far left out in the cold. 


These are his words on the public record. So why, now he is in government and he has had responsibility for this matter for the whole year, has he not met once with the people to whom he held out such promise?


I will go through the critical moments in the time line for this particular group, who communicate with many other groups around the country and should have had wind of something. If the minister had such good news to tell them, he certainly has not communicated it. This is what happened. The election of the Abbott government happened on 7 September. There followed, shortly after, a meeting with the member for Bradfield, Paul Fletcher. Shortly after that, there were two more meetings, with Senator Williams. Then there was a letter to the Assistant Treasurer at the time, Senator Sinodinos, setting out a course of action to have the matter advanced: to instruct the department to form a working group to investigate the issue or to set up an independent review. This was followed by a meeting on 16 December with Mr Paul Giles, the chief of staff to Senator Arthur Sinodinos, where the Association of ARP Unitholders put forward a submission to the Assistant Treasurer. Then silence.


Then there was the elevation of Senator Cormann to Assistant Treasurer. Hopes were raised again—and the previously fierce fighter for this cause remained silent. Surely Senator Cormann would honour his promises now that he was in a position to do so, they thought. Then there was a short phone conversation with Mr Giles in March, saying things were on track. Then again the deafening silence, a silence that has lasted all year. It is now nearly a year since that meeting on 16 December. What do the minister's answers today mean? We will see what they mean. If it goes the way of all other promises of the government, it will end up in a broken promise. This group certainly deserves to be treated with respect, but all we see, once again, is that the government, which said anything to get elected, now that they are in government, are doing the complete opposite.


The minister needs to deliver on his promise of compensation. He might try to crab-walk away from it, but that is what he promised. He needs to admit that he is simply ignoring this group and hoping they might go away. The whole issue may just be an inconvenience for Senator Cormann now that he is a minister, but 18 months ago it was an issue he claimed to care about and an issue he said he would fight for. People took the senator at his word and trusted him to help. People have been putting forward victim impact statements with regard to the impact on them of this terrible decision of the government not to support them: 'For the past few years, we've felt helpless and alone as our calls for assistance in resolving this matter have been drawn out—to this point fruitless. There has been no support. The most significant and heart-wrenching impact has been watching the dramatic decline of my wife's health. Not long after the Trio collapse unfolded, my wife's health declined suddenly and rapidly, and it ended up with a medical condition resulting in strokes.' This is the sort of story that is happening while the government is twiddling its thumbs. Clearly the minister has a real responsibility to honour his words before the election. He made a promise of compensation. He cannot walk away from it now.

 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (15:39):  I present the government’s response to the 137th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, treaty referred on 15 January 2014. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.


Leave granted.


The documents read as follows—Australian Government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' report:


Report 137 Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United Arab Emirates on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (Abu Dhabi, 31 July 2012)


August 2014




Government Response to





Report 137 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties: Australia-UAE Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.



The Government thanks the Committee for its consideration of the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United Arab Emirates on Cooperation in the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy, done at Abu Dhabi on 31 July 2012 (""the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement""), which was tabled on 18 March 2014. Binding treaty action was completed on 14 April 2014 in Abu Dhabi. The Government provides the following responses to the Committee's recommendations.




Recommendation 1




The Committee recommends that, prior to ratification of the proposed Treaty, the IAEA undertake physical inspections of UAE facilities that will handle Australian obligated nuclear materials.


The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol on strengthened safeguards in force with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). These two agreements provide the IAEA with reporting and access to facilities necessary to verify the UAE's compliance with its commitment to use nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes. Under these two agreements all nuclear material and facilities will be subject to IAEA safeguards verification.


The IAEA will have early and thorough inspection oversight at nuclear power plants in the UAE well before any Australian uranium is potentially supplied. However, given the construction of the first nuclear power plant at Barakah has not yet reached a stage where design features relevant to IAEA safeguards are installed the IAEA has not yet commenced inspections. The Barakah Nuclear Power Plant is scheduled for completion in 2017 and the first IAEA inspections will likely commence in 2015 or 2016. In the meantime the IAEA is receiving good cooperation from the UAE national regulator in preparing for inspections. The following summarises current and planned activities in the UAE in relation to nuclear regulation:


The UAE has received the following IAEA review and appraisal missions:


Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review in January 2011


Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) in December 2011.


The UAE has committed to the following further review and appraisal missions:


International SSAC (state systems of nuclear accountancy and control) Advisory Service in May 2014


IRRS Follow-up Mission in February 2015


Emergency Preparedness Review Service in March 2015.


with IAEA for the period 2013-2017, under which are arranged expert missions and training workshops in safety, security and safeguards.


The Government is satisfied that the IAEA inspection regime will be sufficient to provide assurances on the peaceful use of Australian uranium, and nuclear material derived from its use. The UAE has displayed a high level of transparency and cooperation with the IAEA, and has entered into binding treaty commitments with regard to nuclear safeguards and security.




Recommendation 2





The Committee recommends that the Government report to the Parliament on what action it has taken to implement the recommendations of the United Nations System Wide Study on the Implications of the Accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
.



The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) has considered the UN System-Wide Study on the Implications of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and is supportive of its recommendations. Australian approaches to nuclear safety are consistent with the recommendations of the report in relation to the protection of people and the environment.


The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) has taken a number of actions in the area of nuclear safety and emergency preparedness in response to post­Fukushima accident analysis. ANSTO has submitted to ARPANSA a preliminary assessment of the implications of the Fukushima accident for the Open Pool Australian Lightwater (OPAL) reactor. The OPAL post-Fukushima safety and emergency preparedness action plan is currently being evaluated by ARPANSA.


ANSTO is currently finalising a Safety Reassessment of OPAL in the light of the Fukushima Daiichi Accident, which is based on the IAEA guidance contained in Safety Reports Series No.80: Safety Reassessment for Research Reactors in the light of the Accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which was published earlier this year.


ARPANSA, ANSTO and local and national emergency organisations routinely review and exercise emergency preparedness and response arrangements for adverse events for the OPAL reactor, including relevant scenarios drawn from the Fukushima accident.




Recommendation 3





The Committee recommends that the Government explore and report to Parliament on mechanisms to strengthen the resourcing of the IAEA.



In recognition of the IAEA's crucial role in verifying state compliance with safeguards commitments in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and facilitating nuclear cooperation, Australia has always worked in support of an IAEA which is appropriately funded and which has the full cooperation of all States.


Australia has a track record of strong engagement with the IAEA. As a long-standing member of the Board of Governors, Australia supports the Director-General's and Board's efforts continually to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of IAEA safeguards and its other programs.


Australia has always paid its assessed contribution, and provides additional extra-budgetary contributions and in-kind support. We pay our Technical Cooperation Fund (TCF) contribution, and encourage other States to do the same. In addition, Australia continues to provide specialists from our nuclear-related agencies to the IAEA and to hold a range of meetings with regional counterparts, as part of bilateral cooperative agreements and IAEA projects.


Australia recently provided an extra-budgetary contribution of $2 million in support of the P5+1/Iran Joint Plan of Action which is seeking to resolve international concerns about Iran's nuclear activities. At the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Julie Bishop MP, also announced a contribution of $1 million to the IAEA's Nuclear Security Fund—specifically for activities focused in Australia's region.


Given the above, Australia, as one of the IAEA's most active members, will continue to work closely and cooperatively with the IAEA and other like-minded member States, including in regard to helping ensure the agency has the necessary resources and support in order to undertake effectively its nuclear non-proliferation, safeguards and security activities.




Recommendation 4





Subject to the above recommendations, the Committee supports the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United Arab Emirates on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.



In light of the strong IAEA oversight and cooperation outlined in the response to Recommendation 1, the Government made the decision to bring the Agreement into force before the first IAEA inspections take place. Binding treaty action was completed on 14 April 2014 in Abu Dhabi when the Minister for Trade and Investment, the Hon Andrew Robb MP, provided written notice to the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, HH Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, that the Australian Government had completed the necessary domestic procedures for the Agreement to enter into force. The Agreement has value for the bilateral relationship, and provides certainty to Australian uranium producers who operate in a competitive international environment.

Subject to the above recommendations, the Committee supports the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United Arab Emirates on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.



In light of the strong IAEA oversight and cooperation outlined in the response to Recommendation 1, the Government made the decision to bring the Agreement into force before the first IAEA inspections take place. Binding treaty action was completed on 14 April 2014 in Abu Dhabi when the Minister for Trade and Investment, the Hon Andrew Robb MP, provided written notice to the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, HH Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, that the Australian Government had completed the necessary domestic procedures for the Agreement to enter into force. The Agreement has value for the bilateral relationship, and provides certainty to Australian uranium producers who operate in a competitive international environment.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (15:40):  I, and also on behalf of Senator Day, move:


That the Senate acknowledges that it has a responsibility to propose and discuss options to cut government spending.


My hope for this general business debate is for senators from across the chamber to outline spending cuts they would support. My hope is that we uncover some spending cuts where a good number of senators agree with each other. And my hope is that the government has the gumption to adopt any such spending cuts. But my wishful thinking does not stop there.


I hope that we do not get diverted into discussions on revenue-raising. Proponents of revenue-raising are free to devote a general business debate to that issue. But this is a debate on options to cut government spending. I will resist the urge to discuss whether revenue should go up or down, and I ask others to do the same. I also hope that each senator proposes more spending cuts than they oppose. It is inevitable that senators will speak against various spending cuts. But surely this should be balanced by alternative suggestions.


To kick off this debate, I want to indicate my support for spending cuts mooted by others in this place. My co-sponsor in this motion, Senator Day, will outline his spending cuts shortly, and I anticipate that I would support each of them. I have avoided stealing his thunder by not mentioning them now, but he is not the only crossbencher willing to propose spending cuts.


Senator Madigan has called for MPs to travel in economy class by default, to abandon junkets overseas and to leave their spouses behind when they travel. I agree and consider that the same approach should apply across the public service.


Senator Lambie has made comments about cutting foreign aid. I also think it should be cut. In fact, I believe that we should abolish government provided foreign aid other than short-term humanitarian responses to natural disasters, including the Ebola outbreak.


Government provided foreign aid does not show how generous Australians are; it shows how generous some people are with other people's money. A true indication of the generosity of Australians would be to leave decisions on foreign aid to individuals. I cannot say what this would do to the level of foreign aid leaving our shores but I am confident that the money would be directed to organisations and causes that Australians have faith in. And, on a value-for-money basis, it would absolutely leave government foreign aid for dead. If we really want to help people in other countries, promoting free trade across the board would have much greater benefit.


In amongst their calls to increase revenue, the Australian Greens have proposed some cuts to spending, such as spending on industry assistance. I agree with these spending cuts. Our industries would be better off if they could focus on satisfying customers rather than bureaucrats who hand out grants.


I support ending what people normally think of as industry assistance, like spending on agriculture, tourism, mining, manufacturing, and construction industries. But industry assistance goes beyond that: it includes funding for the arts industry, the sports industry and the communications industry, including the ABC and SBS. Corporate welfare does not stop being corporate welfare when the corporation is government owned or when the corporation is one you like, such as a renewable energy business.


The Australian Greens have also mooted cuts to defence. I agree that responsible spending cuts are possible in defence. Our permanent military should be limited, but should be able to quickly expand if required. Our permanent military should be focussed on long-distance force projection, requiring a strategic strike capability, an effective submarine fleet and a rapid reaction, air mobile expeditionary force including special forces. This implies less of a need for other aspects of our current military, like most of the Navy's surface fleet. Achieving our military goals in a cost-effective way also requires procuring the most suitable items from the best suppliers around the world. On that can I also say that I think the Australian Submarine Corporation could build a canoe, but only one and it would be very late and horribly expensive.


I also acknowledge that Labor has supported spending cuts in recent times. For instance, just prior to the last election Labor cut spending on the Public Service, foreign aid, subsidies to landowners to support biodiversity, subsidies to employers for taking on apprentices and subsidies for clean technology and carbon capture and storage. I support spending cuts in each of these areas. Since the election the coalition has proposed a range of spending cuts, including cuts to higher education and the Australian Research Council, cuts to Medicare rebates for GPs and the private health insurance rebate, cuts to welfare payments for individuals and corporate welfare and cuts to the ABC and SBS. I support all of these cuts. In fact, I think the only coalition proposal for spending cuts that troubles me is the periodic removal of Newstart for young unemployed people. This strikes me as an odd thing to do given that we actively stop employers from taking on young people because of our insistence on a prohibitively high minimum wage.


This brief scan of the Senate gives me hope that there is a will in this Senate to cut government spending. We just need to open our eyes and look for the common ground. I would like to add a couple of spending cut suggestions to the mix from the party platform of the Liberal Democrats. Let me start with a spend that represents a quarter of the Commonwealth government's spending—that is Commonwealth payments to the states, territories and local governments. These payments should be abolished. Abolition would prompt the states to means test access to public hospitals and schools and to put tolls on arterial roads and highways. Even if they reacted by increasing taxes, which I would not encourage, we should remember that the states have access to substantial tax bases, many of them more efficient than the Commonwealth's income tax. The abolition of Commonwealth payments to states would increase the autonomy and accountability of the states and allow greater competition and experimentation between the states. The abolition would also serve to end horizontal fiscal equalisation—a welfare system whereby funds are effectively taken from rich state governments and given to poor state governments. This system discourages state governments from removing impediments to economic growth and from reducing dependency on government services. It also targets assistance more poorly than welfare to individuals.


Billions of dollars are taken from Australian workers every year and then given back to the same families in the form of government handouts or subsidies. This is wasteful, inefficient and unnecessary. We need to bring back a central support role for family and community, we need to focus tax paid support on the least well off and we need to get rid of middle-class welfare and indeed upper-class welfare. While we hear complaints about dole bludgers, the truth is that spending on family payments is more than three times larger than spending on unemployment payments and spending on aged pensions is six times larger.


We need to dust off the Commission of Audit report, which suggested the removal of the schoolkids bonus and family tax benefit part B. We need to target family tax benefit part A to families with the least income. Today I have introduced a bill that would do just that. We need to include the family home in the assets test for the aged pension. So long as only the home's value above a high threshold is taken into account and so long as there is always access to a pension equivalent payment through a reverse mortgage or something similar, there is no reason for the family home to be excluded.


Finally, we can appreciate public servants while at the same time believe they are overpaid. The typical wage across the entire Australian workforce is around $62,000, but that is roughly what a Public Service graduate gets at the start of their career. By the time they have worked for a few years many are on around $100,000 per year. The various layers of management regularly get between $150,000 and $300,000, while top bureaucrats get up to $700,000 per year. A cut to Public Service budgets totalling $2 billion could prompt salary cuts of around 10 per cent. This would reset public sector wages, which have grown faster than private sector wages over the last decade, and it would still leave public sector wages at a very healthy level.


After accounting for inflation, Commonwealth government spending per person has increased by more than a third since the introduction of the GST. Commonwealth government spending is more than a quarter of GDP, which is well above the post GST average. It is time for the denial to end. Our government has a spending problem and it is time for an intervention. I look forward to the contributions to this debate from my fellow senators.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2014-11-27,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (15:52):  I would like to congratulate senators Leyonhjelm and Day for proposing this motion today. Senators Leyonhjelm and Day have demonstrated that they are committed to taking a positive and constructive approach to resolving the fiscal challenges that we are facing as a nation today.


Of course, it is a matter of public record that when we came into government in September last year we inherited a weakening economy, rising unemployment, low consumer confidence, business investment which had plateaued, a rapidly deteriorating budget position and one of the steepest debt growth and spending growth trajectories in the world. The previous, Labor government, back in 2007, inherited a strong economy and a strong budget. They inherited a budget with no government net debt, a $20 billion surplus, and about $70 billion in net Commonwealth assets. Indeed, the previous, Labor government inherited a situation where, back in 2007, the Commonwealth was collecting more than $1 billion in interest payments a year on the back of a positive net asset position.


At that time—back in 2007—federal government spending as a share of GDP was at about 23.1 per cent. Labor will say that we have had the GFC and all these issues and that that is why the whole thing turned into such a mess so quickly. I argue that that is not actually true. Labor did rapidly increase spending in their first two years in government—by 17 per cent in real terms, in fact. It was an extraordinary spike in spending in Labor's first two years in government. And that became the new base from which future spending increases kept happening, from year to year.


Even worse, in the period beyond the published budget forward estimates at the time of the last election Labor locked in a whole lot of structural spending increases in various areas of government that were never properly funded. They locked in spending growth that was taking us to spending as a share of GDP of 26.5 per cent. Why is that of concern? Why is spending at 26.5 per cent as a share of GDP of concern? If you accept the proposition, as we do—and as, I believe, Leyonhjelm and Day do—that as a government and as a country we should be living within our means, that we should not be living at the expense of our children and grandchildren and that we should not be borrowing from our children and grandchildren in order to fund a significant proportion of our living expenses today, then our revenue has to cover our expenditure. 


It is a pretty basic proposition. Every family, every business across Australia, understands that unless your revenue covers your expenditure over time you keep adding to you debt and to your debt interest. At some point that will have to be paid back. If we do not pay our own way then what we are asking our children and grandchildren to do is to pay it back for us with interest, which means that they have to pay higher taxes or accept deeper spending cuts in order to make up the ground that we have lost for them. That is the fundamental unfairness of the parliament or the Senate not dealing with some of the structural challenges that we have inherited.


The problem here is that instead of spending as a share of GDP being 23.1 per cent—which it was in the last year of the Howard government—the previous, Labor government put Australia on a trajectory where spending as a share of GDP was heading for 26.5 per cent by 2023-24—and rising beyond that. Why is that a problem? If you look at tax revenue as a share of GDP over the last 20 years, you find that it averaged at about 22.4 per cent. With spending at 26.5 per cent as a share of the economy, and revenue at 22.4 per cent as a share of the economy, you will see that there is a big gap. And that gap, essentially, is what we are adding to our debt every week, every month and every year—and forcing our children and grandchildren to deal with down the track, unless we get it under control now.


To be a bit more generous in terms of the average tax take as a share of GDP, in the period between the introduction of the GST and the global financial crisis, tax revenue as a share of GDP was at 23.9 per cent. But even at 23.9 per cent there is still a significant gap between the level of revenue and the level of expenditure that the previous government has structurally locked in, on top of various spending growth pressures that we are facing in any event. Not all of it is Labor's responsibility. I readily admit that. We are, as a nation, facing some structural challenges that are the result of things like the ageing of the population. The ageing of the population means that we have falling workforce participation rates. That has an impact on our capacity to grow the economy as strongly as we might with higher participation rates. 


Obviously, with the ageing of the population also comes higher levels of expenditure in health and social services, in particular. The other structural challenge that we face as a nation—it is a challenge that is particularly acute now—is that, as an economy with a relatively small population for the size of our continent and for the size of our economy, and with a very significant part of our economy being export oriented or trade exposed in terms of imports coming in, the level of commodity prices matter to us. 


Now, over five of the six years of the Labor government they had the best terms of trade in 140 years. Between 2008 and 2012 we had the best prices for our iron ore exports, for our coal exports and for a number of other key exports. What would normally happen in countries like Australia, where there is that level of exposure to global fluctuations in commodities prices and the like, is that when prices are very high you put away savings and resources for a rainy day. The previous government did the exact opposite. When we were getting record prices for our commodities—when our economy was growing strongly on the back of record terms of trade—the previous government was exposing us to unsustainable levels of expenditure. 


Now that the situation is turning around, now that commodity prices are coming down much faster and much deeper than had been anticipated by anyone, we are too exposed. Do not take my word for it. A couple of months ago we had a visit to Australia by a gentleman called Pascal Lamy, a former French Socialist finance minister and former head of the World Trade Organisation. None other than Pascal Lamy made the point that Australia cannot sustain the levels of debt that certain countries in Europe have incurred. Why? Because our economy is inherently more risky because of our exposure to global markets. That is, of course, exactly right.




Senator Conroy:
  Are you back to destroying business confidence?




Senator CORMANN:
  Senator Conroy is here interjecting, but the truth is that Labor put Australia on an unsustainable spending growth trajectory, recklessly and irresponsibly, and of course Senator Conroy is not able to look ahead to where the trajectory they have put Australia on is taking us. The trajectory that Labor put Australia on is taking us to a situation where consistently, as far as the eye can see, spending would exceed our revenue. That needs to be addressed by being realistic about what is likely to happen to our revenue collection in the years ahead.


There is absolutely no question that Labor put us on a spending growth trajectory to 26.5 per cent of spending as a share of GDP. If Labor, as Mr Shorten has indicated, is committed to a surplus and is not prepared to support spending cuts, what that necessarily means is that Labor would have to increase taxes as a share of GDP to 26.5 per cent in order to balance the books. That is the mathematical reality. If Mr Shorten is not prepared to bring the spending growth trajectory down, then the only way he can balance the books is by massively increasing the tax growth trajectory as a share of GDP and that of course would hurt our economy and would hurt jobs. It would cost jobs because it would make our economy fundamentally uncompetitive internationally. These are the challenges we have been facing as a government.


About 85 per cent of Commonwealth spending at a Commonwealth government level is essentially a transfer of payments through the welfare system, through the health system and payments to the states. Only a very small part of the expenditure of the Commonwealth is, unlike in the states, paid on wages for public servants. Most of it, essentially, is taking money out of taxpayers' pockets and handing it out to somebody else, whether that is through the welfare system, whether that is through the Medicare benefits system, whether that is through the pharmaceutical benefits system, whether it is through payments to the states. You name it: we are essentially just taking money from here and handing it over there. We have to do that in a way that is affordable for the country. 


If we do not do this, if we continue to go down Labor's path where we are putting a significant chunk of our day-to-day living expenses on our national credit card, without ever paying any of it off, we would be in the situation where we would have to hand over that credit card to our children and grandchildren down the track for them to pay it back. Every parent knows that that would be a completely unreasonable and unfair expectation. No parent in Australia would put a chunk of their grocery bill on their credit card every week and every month and, at the end of their life, say to their kids, 'Thank you very much, Son, thank you very much, Daughter. And I now want you to pay these off.'




Senator Conroy:
  No, but they might buy a house and put a mortgage on it!




Senator CORMANN:
   'They might buy a house and put a mortgage on it'! Well guess what? That is not the situation that Labor has put us in. Labor has not exposed the country to good debt; Labor has exposed the country to bad debt. Not even your borrowing for the NBN was a good investment. You made a complete mess of— I was going to say something unparliamentary but I stopped myself in time. You were wasting money left, right and centre on something which, quite frankly, was not value for taxpayers' money. But the real problem we have in Australia as a result of the decisions that were made by the previous Labor government, combined with the structural pressures we are facing in any event in the context of the ageing of the population and our exposure to global markets, means we are in a situation where we are borrowing to fund a large proportion of our recurrent expenditure year in, year out. The longer we do this, the longer we add to our debt in an expectation that our kids will pay tomorrow to fund other living standards today—the Labor Party can yell and scream as much as they like but that is the situation that Labor put the country in. They are wanting to force our children and grandchildren to pay higher taxes or accept deeper spending cuts down the track in order to pay for our expenditure today.


There is never an easy way to reduce government spending because the truth is, once you lock in government spending decisions, there is somebody at the other end of that spending who enjoys a benefit they do not readily want to give up. If you are able to get something for free and then somebody says, 'We want you to make a small contribution in order to help us ensure that the service you are accessing is going to be available for everyone over the medium to long term', that is not necessarily spontaneously going to be popular. 


Let us talk about health for a moment. Expenditure in health has continued to grow faster than the economy for some time and will continue to grow faster than the economy for the foreseeable future, in particular and on the back of the growing demand as a result of the ageing of the population. So what do we do? Our responsibility as members of parliament, our responsibility as representatives of the people of Australia is to ensure that we put our health care system on a sustainable foundation for the future. When you have growing and potentially unlimited demand and unlimited resources, however high they are, you need to ensure that those resources are deployed in the most efficient and effective way. You need to ensure that the resources you have available are spread as far and wide as possible.


And what is our policy challenge in health? Our policy challenge in health is to ensure that all Australians can have affordable and timely access to high-quality health care in a way that is also affordable for the taxpayer. So the question becomes: when I access a medical service, should the taxpayer cover 100 per cent of the cost of that service or should I be asked to make a small contribution to accessing that service? Labor thought that it was appropriate for the patient accessing a service to pay a small co-payment when it came to accessing pharmaceuticals. So why is it not appropriate when accessing a GP service? The principle is exactly the same. We know, of course, that in tempore non suspecto, as the Romans would say, before this whole issue became political the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Leigh, held that exact same view. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Leigh, who does know a bit about economics, actually made the point that a small co-payment is the absolutely appropriate way to go when it comes to ensuring we maximise the efficient allocation of limited resources to a growing demand for healthcare services and that a price signal is a proven way to achieve that.


There are, of course, a whole series of structural reforms that we have put forward in the budget—not because we enjoy hurting people or imposing pain on people but because we want to ensure that the important services of government—social services, healthcare services and all the things that governments do—continue to be affordable over the medium to long term. To those Australians who ask why the government is doing this, I would say consider what is happening to our revenue now. In December last year, the Labor Party would say, the Treasurer and I were overly pessimistic in our revenue assumptions—that the assumptions underpinning our revenue forecasts were supposedly deliberately pessimistic in order to make the budget numbers in Labor's last budget look worse than what they were. That is not what we did. We were committed to being realistic. As it turns out, we were being too optimistic. And today Labor is saying that we exaggerated the revenue that we were expecting to collect. So you cannot have it every which way. The truth is that nobody expected commodity prices to fall as much as they did. But we are responsible and we are continuing to work to fix the mess that Labor left behind.


On a final point, Mr Shorten says he is not only going to deliver a surplus but deliver it sooner than the coalition. Given that he is opposing most of our savings measures, given that he is not able to convince Labor to support their own saving measures and given that he is starting from way behind, I want to hear from Mr Shorten where he is going to cut and where he is going to cut deeper. Where is he going to increase taxes in order to not only deliver a surplus but deliver it sooner? Right now, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, not only wants to have his cake and eat it too; he wants to sell the cake that he wants to have and eat. That is something that is just not practically possible. He will have to put his money where his mouth is, sooner or later. In the lead-up to the next election, if he does not support the savings measures that we have put forward in order to get our budget situation back under control, if he does not want to add to the deficit and if he wants to get back to surplus more quickly, he will have to say where he is going to cut and where he is going to increase taxes—in particular, because he is starting from way behind.


The coalition, of course, looks forward to more constructive suggestions in the spirit of the motion put forward by Senators Leyonhjelm and Day. We look forward to productive and positive suggestions by the Labor Party, because, in the end, we are all in this together. We cannot expose future generations of Australians to the lowering of opportunity that would follow from the continuous level of debt and deficit that are the direct result of the spending and debt growth trajectory that Labor has put Australia on. I encourage all Australians to reflect very carefully about the trajectory that we are on at present. We should all be committed to stronger growth and repairing the budget.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (16:12):  I am very pleased to support this general business notice of motion and to take up the Minister for Finance's generous offer to listen and consider some constructive suggestions as to spending priorities. Labor understands that there are tough decisions necessary for every budget. Every developed country around the world has pressures on their budget. With pressures on health budgets and pressures on demographic change, of course that is the case. But budgets are always about priorities and values. Here we have a government which is based on twisted priorities and broken promises. On the one hand they say we can afford to do a range of things but on the other hand they are saying they cannot make the bottom line any better. So there are a number of issues that I would like to draw the Minister for Finance's attention to. Of course, we have some constructive suggestions.


Firstly, let us look at the fact that this government introduced a massive new entitlement scheme in paid parental leave, which is non-means tested, effectively paying millionaires welfare to have children. Secondly, the government is giving tax breaks to high-income earners on superannuation. Thirdly, it is reversing Labor's proposed changes to multinational tax evasion and letting money needlessly flow offshore. Fourthly, it is spending billions on paying polluters through its thoroughly discredited and laughably titled Direct Action scheme. There are four initiatives right there which are making—or would make—the budget bottom line worse, not better. Budgets are about priorities and values. We will have a range of policies at the next election based on our values and priorities, but we will seek a mandate for them—unlike this government, which based its entire election campaign on a series of promises it had no intention of honouring.


Proper reform means bringing the community with you, challenging vested interests and making a case for changing the status quo. Proper reform means not doing a dump-and-run with this budget of broken promises. Proper reform means not just bumping up the nearest regressive tax you can get your hands on, or ramming through new taxes by regulation.


So let us just recap on those broken promises. The quote again, from our now Prime Minister: 'There will be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.' And what did we see? We saw, on education, the scrapping of the fifth and sixth years of the previously bipartisan Gonski reforms; on health, $50 billion cut from public hospitals; on pensions, the raising of the pension age to 70, the slashing of their indexation and the cutting of concessions; on the GST, comments yesterday about wanting to broaden the tax and raise the tax. And, as to 'no cuts to the ABC or SBS', we saw a massive backflip last week, crippling an Australian icon.


These cuts will hit Queensland hard, and, as Australia's most decentralised state, the cuts will hit those regions of Queensland outside the capital especially hard. That is all we get from this government; we do not get sensible economic reform and we do not get structural changes that will help long-term budget sustainability. Even worse, many of their alleged reforms are merely cost shifting—robbing Peter to pay Paul.


Local councils in Queensland are being asked to get by on less grant money from the federal government, as Greg Hallam from the Local Government Association of Queensland said in May:


We're deeply concerned that councils in Queensland have had their grants frozen for the next three years. That's around about $200 million over the next three years that won't go to important community projects. For the smaller rural and remote Indigenous councils, they're heavily reliant on these grants. They make up the bulk of their funding. It does come down to projects or staff and this is a tough time going forward.


So there is an improvement to the bottom line, for sure. But the money does not come out of thin air—councils will have to reduce services or raise rates because of this nasty government's dodgy cost shifting.


But let me quote from a Queensland politician on this issue, and we will see if you can guess which progressive figure, someone with an obvious axe to grind against our Prime Minister, this is, and I will inform you at the end of the quote. This figure was quoted as saying:


""You cannot just throw the health and education issues on the states and not give them the money to deal with the problem.


""This will not go away. 


""It is not going to be taken lying down and the states and territories will be pursuing this matter.""


""This whole thing seems like a wedge to get the states to ask for the GST to be raised,"" he said.


…   …   …


""The issue is that a fair share of the income tax that Queensland families pay should come back to pay for their hospitals and schools.


""The Federal Government is making the states do the heavy lifting, make the tough decisions in relation to health and education, and they are doing it in a non-transparent and non-upfront way.""


So who is this anti-government crusader, this spear-thrower for the left? Actually, it was none other than Campbell Newman, LNP Premier of Queensland. With friends like that, who needs enemies?


'And what do the Liberals spend these cuts on?' you might ask. Well, they certainly do not spend them on the regions, as I am sure the National Party would agree.


Let us ask the IMF about this government's spending. I quote from an article in The Sydney Morning Herald here:


Australia's most needlessly wasteful spending took place under the John Howard-led Coalition government rather than under the Whitlam, Rudd or Gillard … governments, an international study has found.


The International Monetary Fund examined 200 years of government financial records across 55 leading economies.


It identifies only two periods of Australian ""fiscal profligacy"" in recent years, both during John Howard's term in office—in 2003 at the start of the mining boom and during his final years in office between 2005 and 2007.


The article continues:


The Rudd government's stimulus spending during the financial crisis doesn't rate as profligate because the measure makes allowance for spending needed to stabilise the economy.


So there you have it: Labor spends to save us from economic recession; the Liberals pay millionaires to have children.


The Treasurer's budget is damaging the economy. This government completely misread the state of the economy when handing down its first budget. The government's first budget smashed confidence. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment is down 13 per cent since the election. Company directors around the country, whose decisions drive the continued growth of our economy, are finding it that bit tougher thanks to this unfair budget. The Australian Institute of Company Directors' November survey of company directors found that almost half of directors are claiming the government's performance is affecting their business decision-making negatively, and the majority of directors believe the federal government's performance is negatively affecting consumer confidence, while around half of directors would rate the government's first year in office as 'poor' or 'very poor'. Directors' sentiment regarding the current federal government's understanding of business has declined, with more directors disagreeing than agreeing that the government understands business.


In just 15 months since the election, Australia's economy has fallen rapidly from eighth to 14th in the world, based on GDP per capita. The government's first budget is making it harder for people to find work. Since the budget, more than 40,000 Australians have joined the jobs queue.


The Liberals have no plan or vision for our future; their only plan is to cut and to put more of the burden on states, councils and ordinary Australians.

"Day, Sen Bob",FFP,2014-11-27,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (16:21):  Every teenager, every family, every business and every government in the world that gets into financial difficulties says the same thing: 'If I could just get a little bit more income, I'd be fine.' Well, I am sorry to break the news but it never works. When you are in financial difficulty and your spending exceeds your income, the only solution is to shrink to viability and then regrow from there.


First, let me say from the outset that I understand the government's predicament. I have been in the government's position. I have experienced industry slumps where the market drops by something like 40 per cent, leading to a 40 per cent drop in revenue. It is painful; it is disruptive. The structures, the systems, the staffing and the resources that have been put in place to handle X level of activity are suddenly confronted with the chill winds of economic reality. The government is experiencing what thousands of business owners experience. Welcome to their world.


Employment levels are falling, our terms of trade are falling, home ownership levels are falling. At the same time, our national debt is rising, interest payments on our debt are rising, government spending on a whole range of areas is also rising. Something has to give. Not only that, pretty soon a person on average ordinary full-time earnings will move into the country's second highest tax bracket. With five levels in our tax system, the idea that someone on average weekly earnings would be on the second highest tax bracket should give serious pause for thought. High tax rates undermine enterprise and destroy the will to work. The prospect of giving up nearly half your earnings leads people to decide that it is simply not worth it. Taxation at these levels starts to produce gross inefficiencies as people stop working as much or as hard as they have been and governments find that taxes are not producing the revenue they expected.


Similarly, many on welfare benefits decline opportunities to work because of the punitive effect small earnings and high tax rates have on the security of their welfare benefits and the value of extra work. People on very low incomes fare worst of all for, as they increase their earnings, higher rates of income tax combined with the loss of means-tested benefits deprive them of up to 80c of every extra dollar they earn. If we are to extricate ourselves from this dysfunctional system, the goodwill of the public needs to be restored by getting tax levels back to something that most people would see as reasonable.


Australia will get nowhere with tax rates like these. Bosses are not ripping off workers, it is the government that is ripping off workers. Senator Leyonhjelm and I have moved this motion today out of concern that when it comes to getting the budget in order, when it comes to relieving the tax burden on Australian families, the government seems to adopt the teenager's plea for more money rather than reducing its spending. The Australian government is simply too big, and has for too long been captive of the discredited Keynesian theory of economics, where governments are looked to for so-called economic leadership to stimulate the economy by injecting money into it. Far from solving the nation's economic problems, they just make them worse. This is because, simply put, governments—that is, politicians and government bureaucrats who make the decisions on these things—do not know enough to make the right decisions. If they did, like Bert Kelly once said, 'They would not be here in Canberra; they would be sitting in the south of France with their feet in a bucket of champagne'. This applies to everything, from trying to solve an alleged global problem with carbon dioxide emissions to the most miniscule local issues that neighbours or communities could very easily sort out themselves.


My home state of South Australia is a classic example of failed Keynesian thinking. The state government there thinks it can spend its way out of an economic slump. It has gambled South Australian taxpayers' money and lost it, and all South Australia has to show for it is record debt and record deficit. But, as always, Keynesians never, ever admit they are wrong. They are like the gambler who goes to the racetrack or the casino, thinking that if he keeps doubling his bet each time, then eventually he will back a winner and get all his money back. And all that happens is he runs out of money. And there is nothing more certain than the South Australian state government will run out of money.


I co-sponsored this motion today because I started to think very carefully about this topic when the Prime Minister urged the crossbench to think of savings measures if we were inclined to oppose other government measures. At the time the Prime Minister first made that request, I pointed out three easy savings areas. The first is a measure that you heard me outline in my first speech in this place, and I will keep saying it until I am blue in the face and perhaps even after that—that is, allow people to escape from the industrial regulation prison. It gets them off the dole and will improve the budget position by billions of dollars. For every one per cent of people who get off the dole, the government saves $100 million. We spend $145 billion—more than one-third of the budget—on social security and welfare, and that will grow over the next three years to $169 billion or 33 per cent of the budget, subject to what has passed or might pass the Senate since July. We pay these benefits to a cohort of people who could otherwise be working and be financially independent.


The second saving area that I explained to the government is to end the duplication of health and education bureaucracies. Together they comprised $94 billion last year, and are on track to cost $106 billion by 2017-18. These bureaucracies cost and spend billions, yet they do not run a single hospital or a single school. The health and education budget lines in the budget papers are the second and third individual portfolio areas with the largest cost to Commonwealth taxpayers. Yet section 51 of the Constitution makes it clear what federal responsibilities are: foreign affairs, trade, commerce, tax, communications, the military, quarantine, currency, copyright, marriage and family law, pensions and, of course, corporations. There is no mention of hospitals, schools, disability services, pink batts, carbon dioxide emissions or many of the other things that the federal government decides from time to time that it wants to spend our money on. Or, more to the point, borrow money against the common wealth to use taxpayers' money to pay interest on that debt.


Family First strongly believes in federalism and, as such, in having a Commonwealth government that sticks to its own constitutional responsibilities and leaves the rest to the states and territories. If it is not about trade, tax, troops or the family then do not ask us to raise taxes for it and do not ask us to spend on it. Health and education are state responsibilities, so the states should fund them. Those who spend the money should raise the money. At present, the Commonwealth raises the money and the states spend it, and we all know what happens when people spend money raised by someone else.


To go further on this duplication argument, I agree with my colleague Senator Leyonhjelm: there is no need for any government to run a single school. There is sufficient know-how and capacity in our community for schools to be run by non-government bodies. Fund students directly and let their families decide where the student funding is spent. Get out of the business of running schools.


The third saving suggestion I gave in July is a simple question of running things more efficiently by eliminating some of the ridiculous costs of office fit outs and other wastes of money that we see and hear about all the time in this place. It is $10,000 here and $50,000 there; it all adds up. Not only that, it develops a culture of disregard for the person who worked in a factory, or on a hospital ward, or in a classroom or on the land and their hard earned taxes that pay for it all.


I was elected on a platform of 'every family: a job and a house'. On housing, I have told the government they can save at least $600 million a year by reducing grants to those states which engage in price-gouging of residential land holdings through their land management corporations. The Commonwealth government could also immediately sell off its own surplus land to address housing affordability. The benefits from the sale of this land would create a multiplier effect: more housing activity, more employment, more income tax raised, more building materials made and sold, more whitegoods and appliances, more soft furnishings and, of course, more GST. I estimate the states are missing out on $2 billion of GST a year due to their own land restriction policies.


On this point of housing, I note the Commonwealth is planning to lift spending on housing from $4.8 billion this year to $5.1 billion in 2017-18. If state governments woke up to the fact that their urban planning policies were based on myth and misinformation, the Commonwealth could save all that money. I defy any state government to substantiate its urban densification and urban consolidation claims. They are wrong; they are misguided. Claims that urban densification is good for the environment, that it stems the loss of agricultural land, that it encourages people onto public transport, that it saves water, that it leads to a reduction in motor vehicle use and that it saves on infrastructure costs for government are false. Urban consolidation and densification is an idea that has failed all over the world, whether it be traffic congestion, air pollution, the destruction of biodiversity or the unsustainable pressure on electricity, water, sewerage or stormwater infrastructure, urban densification has been a disaster.


Urban consolidation is not good for the environment. It does not save water, it does not lead to a reduction in motor vehicle use, it does not result in nicer neighbourhoods, it does not stem the loss of agricultural land and it does not save on infrastructure costs for government and, worst of all, it puts home ownership out of the reach of those on low and middle incomes.


On the jobs front: quite aside from the savings from letting people escape the industrial regulation prison, there are substantial savings to be made in what is called 'labour market assistance to job seekers and industry'. As we know, some people have become very wealthy in the job seeker assistance market which, in the current budget papers, grows from $1.46 billion to $1.5 billion per annum. Job seekers know where to find jobs on terms and conditions which suit them. But the government will not let them take them. There are massive savings to be made there.


I have also made the point during the recent carbon-farming debate that the $2.5 billion allocated to so-called Direct Action is totally unnecessary. I see no need to repeat my arguments here, but the saving opportunity there is massive and clear. I hasten to add that I agree with Senator Lambie from Tasmania in including hydroelectricity in the renewable energy target. A review of the RET would see a further saving to government to make it reflect far better Australia's actual renewable energy achievements.


Then there is the ABC. There is definitely a case to be made now for reviewing the scope of public broadcasting. These services were set up in a different era, before private sector—that is non-taxpayer funded—media organisations were developed. It is a very different world now. There are numerous areas where the private sector is ready, willing and able to provide media services but cannot compete with the deep pockets of the public broadcaster. As James Paterson in the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday rightly points out:


… the ABC's charter also requires that it ""take account of ... the broadcasting services provided by the commercial and community sectors of the Australian broadcasting system"", and it's this part of the charter the management has most openly flouted.


Instead, Mr Paterson points out correctly that the ABC has established competitors to a pre-existing 24-hour news service in Sky News and:


… private fact-checking initiatives, such as PolitiFact, …


and, as Mr Paterson calls it:


… the cornucopia of free online opinion when it launched The Drum opinion website in 2009.


The ABC is investing more in these areas where it competes against its charter with commercial enterprises. Conversely, their rural and regional services, including those in my home state of South Australia, exist in an under-serviced market. These services are the true identity of the ABC—covering droughts, floods, bushfires and iconic stories that have defined the Australian national identity. The government should perhaps create a country broadcasting corporation, which only has a charter to cover country areas, and then sell off the ABC.


We also need a national debate on families—family lifestyle choice and caring responsibilities in this nation. We fund childcare—$5.6 billion last financial year, rising to a whopping $8 billion in 2017-18. Yet if you asked most families, one of the parents—mum or dad—would rather stay home and care for their own children or, failing that, one of the grandparents would be very happy to look after those children for nothing, or at a fraction of what childcare costs the taxpayer. Industry assistance—there is no place for industry assistance. If an industry itself wants to create a spending program from its own members it can do that, but there is no role for government in giving taxpayers' money to industries or to certain companies. We South Australians know all too well from experience where all the money went to keep Mitsubishi in our home state—the money went back to Japan, never to be seen again. We have to stop governments from pretending that they know anything about business or which industries might be successful. It fails wherever it is tried—nowhere more obviously than in my home state. Meanwhile, families and communities suffer greatly.


I welcome the government's announcements that it will review the tax system and our Federation. These two items, in tandem, will help us address the problems we have with social needs and the ability of states and territories to raise the revenue needed for their constitutional responsibilities. We debated aged care recently in this place. It is a classic example of where the Commonwealth has stepped in to fund a rapidly growing sector. We need to clarify who is responsible for what and ensure that whoever bears the responsibility has the revenue to do so—not blank cheques in the form of new or higher taxes that can be raised at whim, but revenue to meet the responsible spending needs of government. Not the myriad of wasteful and excessive spending that we see across all levels today. The savings measures I have proposed have merit in their own right, but have further merit as well. Massive spending reductions will help address the Commonwealth public debt interest which grows and grows from $13.4 billion last year to $17.9 billion in 2017—a $4.5 billion increase in interest payments. Imagine the benefit if we paid no interest on our public debt. Every family—a job and a house. It is what Family First is about. We are a conservative party and we understand the fundamental importance to taxpayers' families and to the national interest of reducing Commonwealth spending.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Government Spending</title>,MOTIONS,33,1
"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2014-11-27,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (16:41):  It is a pleasure to get up in this debate, and I take the opportunity to commend Senators Leyonhjelm and Day for framing the issue in the way that they have. The Senate does have a responsibility to the Australian people to propose and discuss options to cut government spending. I would go further and say that we have, as an institution, a responsibility to assess the overall macro level of government spending and its economic impact. While it is open to senators to vote for or against individual spending measures, every time we reject such savings measures we make the task of getting the budget into shape that much harder, and it potentially results in more tax debt and deficits.


I would like perhaps dispel some misperceptions about the coalition. We are not the enemy of appropriately targeted public spending. This is not an exercise where we seek to reduce public spending to zero—that is not what this is all about. We believe in providing the resources necessary for the peace, order and good government of the country—along the lines that Senator Day referred to when he talked about the constitutional responsibilities of the Commonwealth. That includes a sound legal framework to underpin the property rights that provide confidence in the operation of our market system. We believe in a strong social safety net for those who cannot look after themselves, and I believe there is sufficient compassion on all sides of politics to be able to assess who genuinely needs looking after and who does not. We believe in government as a catalyst in some circumstances for infrastructure and for desirable social ends that markets cannot provide because we are a complex society and there are private activities that can have social costs and benefits. And governments, as the ultimate democratic expression of our society, have the responsibility to address those desirable social costs and benefits.


But we do not believe in public spending as a substitute for what we can do for ourselves, or a spending burden that results in unfair, inefficient and unnecessarily high taxes. Let me build on something that Senator Day said. Government spending is not a free lunch. There is an opportunity cost—if I can introduce an economic term into this hallowed chamber—in terms of the output that we forgo through the taxes that we have to levy to pay for that spending or the debt that we incur. That debt, of course, leads to higher taxes on future generations. This is the nub of it—the money comes from somewhere. The aim always should be to minimise the economic cost of providing such spending. As a small, open economy—we are one of the largest economies in the world, we are in the G20, but we are relatively small—we cannot accumulate too much debt.


It is inappropriate for us to think that, if Europe can get to certain debt levels, that gives us plenty of headroom and we can just keep growing the debt. As we see in Europe, the costs of dealing with that debt escalate as it gets larger. The people who pay the price for that—to return to Senator Bilyk's interjection—are ultimately the poor and those most vulnerable in the community. That is the tragedy of what is happening in Europe. The tragedy in Europe is that there is a lost generation of young people locked out of the labour market through various rigidities in that labour market. The budget spending that has occurred in Europe has not saved their jobs but has led to increased debt. My forebears come from a country which has been at the forefront of the economic adjustment in that process where GDP has fallen below where it was before the global financial crisis and is still to exceed those levels. That is the tragedy when you allow these issues to get out of control, so we cannot be complacent.


Just hark back to 2007 and the Howard-Costello legacy of surpluses which served us well during the global financial crisis. It gave us a shock absorber which actually made it easier to deal with the global financial crisis. It gave confidence to the community. We must always be ready for a rainy day with a strong savings culture. I was in Singapore a couple of weeks ago and a strong savings culture has given them the capacity to determine their own economic fate and to punch way above their economic weight and, Senator Di Natale, to afford all sorts of social goods, because you can afford them when you are economically strong and you have control of your own economic destiny.


We recognise, as a coalition and as a government, that the budget balance will be affected by, and influences, the state of the economy. Our spending and tax changes have been calibrated to support economic growth, and the stance of fiscal policy is taken into account by the Reserve Bank in its interest rate settings. So, when we go too hard and too fast on spending we can actually make the job of the Reserve Bank harder, not easier. When we had to deal with the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998 it was largely dealt with through the market system, the exchange rate and the flexibility which had been built into the economy over the 20 years before that. That is how we dealt with it—not by having a huge splurge of spending or by raising rates to defend the currency, as some people were suggesting. We let the currency go and we counselled the Reserve Bank accordingly, and that helped the economy adjust.


Do not underestimate the adjustment mechanisms in the economy. Do not think that it has to be just up to public spending to provide that adjustment. There will be circumstances, such as in the initial phases of the global financial crisis, where measures were necessary to restore confidence because we did not know what we were dealing with. We did not know the impact of capital markets freezing overnight. That is a different world to the world that we are now in in the sense that we must look at the state of the budget in the context of where the Australian economy is now and where the Australian economy is going.


On coming to government the coalition took on the challenge of transitioning our economy from a strong reliance on record levels of mining investment. Two to three per cent of GDP mining investment traditionally, historically, went up to something like eight per cent of GDP—a huge jump. We are transitioning from that to be empowered by growth in the non-mining parts of the economy. That transition was never going to be smooth or seamless. The budget must play its role in transferring resources to new, more productive activities and to promoting structural reforms in the structure and competitiveness of our markets that will lift of potential rate of growth. If we lift our potential rate of growth, if we grow from a trend rate of growth of, let's say, 3¼ to four per cent we can run the economy harder without igniting more inflation. Higher economic growth brings with it more jobs and lower unemployment payments. Tony Blair, when he was Prime Minister of Great Britain said that fairness in the workplace starts with the prospect of a job. That is the best welfare system—creating a strong economy that creates jobs, and looking after, through the social security system, those that cannot look after themselves.


On coming to government we were briefed by the Treasury on the situation we faced with the terms of trade. We cannot rely, as we have been doing for the last few years, on continuously increasing terms of trade. National income and budget revenue is now being depressed by falling terms of trade. It has whipped around. Export prices were going up relative to import prices for quite a while over the last few years, now it has flipped and it is going the other way. Commodity prices continue to ease. We have seen, in recent times, iron ore prices going down, which is depressing growth in national income, which feeds through to budget revenue. We have had a 22 per cent fall in the terms of trade from its peak, as my good friend Senator Cormann mentioned, in 2011 to June 2014 with falls since then. The answer to that is not to say that because the terms of trade are against us it is getting harder to do things on the budget, the answer is to say that, if we are to achieve the same average growth in our national output per capita and our national income, we need to double our productivity growth in the period ahead.


Senator Day is looking sceptical. We need measures to double the rate of productivity growth. That is an arithmetic certainty. We may do it or we may not do it, but what we are talking about is the challenge to falling terms of trade. The challenge to raising our national income over the next few years is to raise our productivity. We need a more competitive, less regulated and more innovative economy if we are to get sustained growth in productivity.


According to the Parliamentary Budget Office in a report released yesterday on their analysis of how sensitive the budget is to various parameters, a fall to one per cent in annual productivity growth would lower our GDP, our national output, by 1.1 per cent in a decade.


Net debt would be five per cent higher. So you are talking about net debt going to $15 billion, $30 billion at least and the interest payment consequences of that. We need, in these circumstances, to be increasing our productivity. That means that when we look at the budget, the budget has got to make its contribution to that productivity task. The budget priority should reflect this productivity imperative as well as the demographic imperative that we face, because over the medium term we need more workers to offset the ageing of the population. With respect to the point that Senator Day made, whether it is about the labour market or about the rules around labour force participation, we need older workers to stay longer in work by tackling the economic and social barriers, which can include, of course, discrimination against older workers—and as I get older, I am becoming more sensitive to that—and we need to get more women back into the workforce, because our rate of labour-force participation by women is below the OECD averages. We need to do more to encourage more women back into the workforce. 


Some people do not like our paid parental leave plan, but that is Tony Abbott's response to that major imperative. Ultimately, it will also include measures which will make it easier for women coming back into the workforce to keep more of their income when they are in work. Because what happens is, because of our tax and transfer system, the benefits you lose when you go back into work mean that often if you are the second income earner in a household you are penalised when you try and go back to work, and too much of your income is taken by a combination of tax and the withdrawal of benefits.


We also need to keep working on creating more entry-level jobs and more training opportunities to get young people on the ladder of opportunity. This was alluded to by Senator Day in his contribution, and I also quote the President of the Business Council of Australia—and she is now the Chairwoman of Telstra as well—Catherine Livingstone, who said that the great tragedy of Europe, as I alluded to earlier, is the loss of jobs for young people, because if they do not get on the ladder of opportunity early, that affects their income prospects and career prospects for the rest of their lives. So this is an imperative. What I am saying is that the structure of the budget, the priorities we put into the budget, have to reflect, as we have sought to do, those measures that encourage greater labour force participation. For me these are fairness as well have efficiency measures, because they spread economic opportunity through the community.


Senator Day mentioned this earlier in the day, and I was happy that he took it up in his contribution this afternoon. We talk about more spending being a recipe for higher taxes, but where does that leave us when it comes to issues like bracket creep? The opposition have opposed $28 billion of potential savings, including over $5 billion that they themselves had proposed. Based on the spending measures that we put into the 2014-15 budget, which incorporated these particular savings, the government has built in future tax relief through an assumed tax cap of 23.9 per cent of GDP, which was the average tax ratio of 2001 to 2008.




Senator Conroy:
  So you are increasing taxes.




Senator SINODINOS:
  No, we are cutting taxes if we can get our spending cuts through, because we are seeking to reduce the bracket creep that would otherwise be there if your opposition spending measure—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  Order please!



Senator Conroy interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Conroy!




Senator SINODINOS:
  Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President: the opposition of some in this chamber to spending measures means taxes are going to be higher than they would otherwise be, because we have budgeted to reduce bracket creep in the years ahead. 


The tax cut that we have incorporated into our budget projections will relieve low- and middle-income earners from bracket creep as inflation pushes workers into higher tax brackets. Those higher taxes reduce the incentives to work, to save and invest. While I am on the topic of tax, let me deal with this issue about tax during the Howard years. The tax cuts during the Howard years were not a waste. The tax cuts during the Howard years were all about improving the incentives to work, to save and to invest. And the Treasury, year after year, when those tax cuts were being provided, measured the impact on labour force participation of those reforms. And they were reforms. We took the opportunity to cut tax where we could. I am disappointed, in a sense, that we did not get more opportunity to do that.


When we talk about tax reform and returning bracket creep, we are not talking about the big end of town. We are talking about our fellow Australians, about the people who largely pay tax, who are the wage and salary earners, who are the decent backbone of the country and who may want to work a few more hours, but they realise that over the next few years—as was alluded to in question time by Senator Cormann in response to a question—the average tax rate would be going up over the next few years for middle-income earners. So it is the people up there; it is the people in the gallery. It does not matter about us and the salaries we are on, but it is you up there. You pay the price when there is too much government spending. You know that because your taxes go up. Your taxes are feeding that. We want to cut your taxes—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Sinodinos, through the chair please. I have given you a fair leeway. Please address your remarks through the chair. Thank you.




Senator SINODINOS:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, the exuberance of being in your presence caused me to look over there, but I apologise.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Just obey the rules and we will all be happy. 



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Conroy, thank you.




Senator SINODINOS:
  May I conclude by again commending Senators Day and Leyonhjelm for taking the initiative to bring this debate on. We have had an opportunity—and this includes the contribution by Senator Ketter and others—to kick some of the ideas around in a way that we do not normally do. And that is very important. If one of the benefits of having crossbenchers in this chamber is that it will force both sides of politics to engage more seriously in explaining the rationale for the measures that we seek to take, that will be to the benefit not only of this chamber but also of the Australian people. 

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Government Spending</title>,MOTIONS,33,1
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:58):  I rise to speak on this notice of motion that reads 'that the Senate acknowledges that it has a responsibility to propose and discuss options to cut government spending. Can I just say: it is really lovely to hear from Senator Sinodinos again. We have missed his dulcet tones on this side. He has been quiet for a very long time over there, so welcome back to the fray, Senator Sinodinos. I do not always agree with what you say but it is nice to hear you—




Senator Conroy:
  Have a quality contribution.




Senator BILYK:
  That is right: to have a quality contribution and to hear your quality contribution from over there. 


It is very important that we bring this motion on for debate, because what we have opposite is a government whose priorities are all wrong. This government's budget strategy is a shambles. This arrogant and out-of-touch government is trying to tell the Senate, and trying to convince the Australian people, that its cruel and unfair budget is some bitter economic pill that everybody needs to swallow; that there are no options but to cut pensions, cut income support for job seekers and families, cut the schoolkids bonus, cut health care and education to the tune of $80 billion, cut ABC and SBS, cut tax concessions for small business and raise taxes for low-income superannuants; and that there is no option but to charge a $7 GP tax every time you visit your doctor. Well, that might be on the cards; it might be off the cards. We could not get a clear answer in question time about that today, so we are not sure where that is going. But I doubt that it has been buried forever. We all know that the $7 GP tax was one which all the evidence has shown would lead to more illness and chronic disease and cost the health system more in the long run. And the Treasurer tries to justify this government's unfair petrol tax, which will see motorists pay another $19 billion more for petrol over the next decade. And what was his claim? That poor people do not drive cars! Wow. The truth is that the poorest 20 per cent of households in Australia spend three times the proportion of their income on petrol that the wealthiest 20 per cent spend.


I agree with Senator Sinodinos that the money needs to come from somewhere. What I do not agree with is that it should be Australia's poorest and most vulnerable who should shoulder the load. While the government is telling ordinary Australians they need to tighten their belts, this same government is giving a tax break to billionaire miners, to big polluters and to people with million-dollar superannuation balances. And, as if this government's priorities were not sick and twisted enough, it wants to spend a massive $20 billion on a paid parental leave scheme that gives $50,000 to millionaires. 


So of course the Senate has a responsibility to propose and discuss options to cut government spending, because this government's inflexible head-in-the-sand take-it-or-leave-it approach shows that it is blind to the clear options in front of it—options such as giving tax concessions to small business instead of tax breaks to billionaire miners; options such as restoring the low-income superannuation contribution for 3.6 million Australian workers instead of cutting it to fund a tax break for Australia's wealthiest superannuants; options such as investing in health promotion, prevention and early intervention instead of cutting hospitals and taxing access to primary health care; and options such as investing in services instead of providing profligate wage subsidies to millionaire mums.


There is no better reason for the government to revisit its budget strategy than the damage it has done to the Australian economy. Morgan Stanley has issued a damning assessment of the Abbott government, warning:


The alarmist Budget narrative has damaged animal spirits and the consumer's willingness to dip into high savings, thus missing the opportunity for animal spirits to springboard from the strong housing cycle.


Morgan Stanley has estimated that economic growth will fall below two per cent and that unemployment will reach almost seven per cent next year. Morgan Stanley's report shows that not only is the Abbott government's budget cruel and unfair; it is also damaging to Australia's economy. 


The government has launched an attack on household budgets at a time when consumer confidence needs to be strong. This is demonstrated by the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment, which has dropped 13 per cent since the 2013 federal election. In fact, in just 15 months, the Australian economy has fallen from eighth place to 14th place in the world based on per capita gross domestic product. We have a government that promised to create one million new jobs in five years and two million jobs in 10 years.




Senator Conroy:
  Geniuses!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Senator Conroy, interjections are disorderly. I hope you learn that soon. 




Senator BILYK:
  I am happy to accept them, Senator Conroy, even though they are disorderly.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am not.




Senator BILYK:
  Instead, 40,000 Australians have joined the jobs queue since the budget, and young people are finding it more and more difficult to find work than at any time since the 1990s.


The Liberal Party like to regard themselves as the party of business, but let us have a look at what business thinks of this government's economic performance so far. The Australian Institute of Company Directors' November survey of company directors found that almost half of directors are claiming the government's performance is affecting their business decision making negatively. The majority of directors believe the government's performance is negatively affecting consumer confidence, while around half of directors would rate the government's first year in office as 'poor' or 'very poor'. Director sentiment has declined by 7.1 points since the last survey, to continue a downward trend since the election in the second half of 2013. Directors have become more pessimistic about the future health of the Australian economy. For the first time in the survey's history, sentiment has become negative regarding the ASX All Ordinaries index, with more directors expecting a fall in the index than expecting a rise. Directors' sentiment regarding the government's understanding of business has declined, with more directors disagreeing than agreeing that the government understands business. A majority of directors claim the abolition of the carbon tax has not affected their business. Thirty-five per cent of directors believe the level of red tape has increased in the last 12 months, while more than a quarter of directors expect an increase in the coming year.


There is definitely a role for the Senate to propose and discuss options for spending cuts, because, when it comes to making decisions about savings, this government needs all the help it can get. After all, despite all this government's rhetoric about Labor's record, it should recognise that we made $250 billion in savings. We made those savings without gutting health and education in the way that this government proposes to do. We did it without taxing people who visit the doctor or forcing young job seekers to go six months without income. 


Those opposite constantly accuse us of being obstructionist, of not being willing to play a constructive role. But this is absolute hypocrisy from a government which doubled the deficit immediately after coming to office and continues to engage in waste and throwing money away, while forcing Australia's most vulnerable and disadvantaged to pick up the tab. If you want to see examples of this waste, I will just give you a few. Let us consider the $117,000 that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and his assistant minister paid for media analysis, transcription and clipping services. Let us consider the $45,000 the Minister for Industry paid for an international meeting of industry ministers in a luxury Mexican resort, supposedly connected to the G20 which was held in Brisbane thousands of miles away.


How about the $80,000 that the government spent on rent for an unused ministerial office for the stood-aside Assistant Treasurer? And there are plenty of much bigger examples such as the $8 billion gift they gave to the Reserve Bank, against the advice of their own Treasury department. If they wanted to say 'Happy Christmas' to the Reserve Bank, surely a Christmas card would have done?


There is no better example of wasteful spending than the government's $20 billion paid parental leave scheme, which gives $50,000 per child to millionaires and which the Productivity Commission said would have 'few incremental benefits'.


If this government wants constructive suggestions about alternative savings measures to their cruel and unfair budget, Labor has plenty. But this government needs to stop using economic arguments to take away money from the poor and the vulnerable and to treat those less well-off as commodities that can be put on the scrap heap. How anyone could ever believe that you could live on six months with no salary is absolutely beyond me. It is one of the worst polices I have heard of in my whole life—and I am over half a century old.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-11-27,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (17:08):  I do not disagree with the proposition that the Senate has a responsibility to propose and discuss options to cut government spending—and I will get onto that in a moment. I think it is the wrong question. There is a question that come before that, and it is: what is the purpose of government spending; what is it that we expect from our governments; what is it that the community expects from governments; and how best do we as a community fund those services that people expect? 


When we look at how we collect and distribute revenue for services like health and education, law enforcements, and ensuring that we have got roads and public transport, there is an understanding—and we can talk about this in more detail—that those services are best funded collectively. The question presupposes that we should be implementing cuts to government spending simply for the sake of it. It does not help us tease out: what is the purpose of government spending? What is it that we should be doing with that revenue? 


The notion that we should be simply cutting government spending for the sake of cutting it is an ideological belief. It is no different from any religious, faith-based assertion. The idea that we should be aspiring to small government, low taxes and low government spending is no different to any other religious or fundamentalist belief. It is not based on evidence; it is an aspiration based on an ideological world view. I am quite happy to talk about the proposition around cuts to government spending but I think we need to tease out why we are having this debate right now.


I understand that on some issues I will, for example, agree with my colleague Senator Leyonhjelm. But this proposition that the aspiration of any government should simply be to reduce government spending for the sake of it is not based on science. For somebody who is trained in a scientific discipline, I like looking at the evidence for some of these assertions. 


I am not for increased government spending or reduced government spending; I am for government spending that achieves the aims we want to achieve. I am not for big government or small government; I just want good government. I am not for high or low taxes; we need to recognise that taxation is part of the price we pay for civilised society. We need to collect it fairly, and distribute it fairly and efficiently. 


Europe is a good example—and I heard Senator Sinodinos talk about Europe—because in some countries there is wasteful government spending; he is absolutely right about his country of origin, no question about it, and it needs to be reduced. Some European countries have large public sector spending where rates of economic growth have been over and above many other European countries with much lower public sector spending. 


The size of government, the size of taxation and the size of government spending has got no correlation to economic growth or how prosperous and wealthy a society is. What is much more likely to correlate with economic growth and achieving quality of life as a consequence of that is whether there is good government spending. 


The idea that Australia sits somewhere near the top when it comes to government debt and expenditure is a fabrication. I was fortunate enough to chair the inquiry into the Commission of Audit where we heard from a range of academics, businesspeople and union representatives. We heard time and time again that we are relatively efficient by world standards in terms of taxation. We have lower than average taxation by OECD standards. Government spending is again lower than average by OECD standards, and the debt crisis is a fabrication. 


The evidence does not back up the idea that we should be cutting government spending simply for the sake of it. What does the community want? What is it that the community seeks from government? This government is in so much trouble, because it is completely out of sync with where the community sits on this issue. The community wants the government to spend, but it wants it in the areas that they think are important. Medicare is a good example of that. We had a debate about the way health care should be funded through the 1970s and 1980s and the consensus emerged that we believed that collectively pooling our individual revenue to fund universal health care was a fair way of ensuring that everybody got access to good medical care.


What is interesting about that is it is actually a very efficient way of funding health care as well. It marries those two sometimes competing objectives of equity and fairness and economic efficiency. You only need to look at comparable health systems to see that having universal coverage funded through progressive taxation is a very efficient mechanism for funding the delivery of health care. The government is in trouble with its proposed co-payment proposal because the community recognise that what we have got is precious, works well and should not be tampered with.


Let us look at the National Disability Insurance Scheme. What was most interesting about that for me was that that was funded through a proposal to increase the Medicare levy. There was no debate about it, there was no controversy about it, there was bipartisanship and the community were pleased that we had a government and an opposition who recognised that it was important that those people with disabilities got access to the appropriate supports and they were prepared to increase the level of taxation that they pay to fund it. Similarly, when you ask people about the Greens' proposal for universal dental coverage so dental care is funded through Medicare in the same way as health care is funded, the community say they would be prepared to pay an increased Medicare levy to fund it.


So this ideological view that we have to cut government spending simply for the sake of it is out of step with where mainstream public opinion is, and the government are paying for it at the moment. The government are suffering so badly in terms of their perception within the Australian community because the Australian community do not buy that argument. It is not backed up by the evidence and it is certainly not backed up by mainstream public opinion. That is part of the reason we are having this manufactured debate around an artificial debt crisis. If you do not create fear and panic around the state of the nation's finances then the community just simply will not come at the idea that we have to attack health, education, public broadcasters, income support and so on. They just will not come at that. That is not to say that I do not believe that some people on the other side have convinced themselves that we in fact do have a debt crisis. That is just natural human psychology—you found an opinion based on nothing other than a belief rather than based on evidence and you look for a way to rationalise that, and the rationalisation that they have given themselves is this idea that Australia is facing some sort of debt crisis.


We do have some challenges. I do not deny that for a moment. We have some long-term challenges we need to meet. We have some challenges around productivity. Senator Sinodinos again articulated the productivity challenge that confronts us. Of course we have to deal with that, but the way to deal with that is not by slashing investment in education, not by slashing investment in research and development and not by slashing investment in science. If we do think that we do indeed have a productivity challenge to deal with, rather than look for again an ideological view that it is all about labour market flexibility let us look at it investing in those things—in our human capital—to ensure we are placed through this century to be able to meet that productivity challenge.


Of course we have an ageing population and a number of other things that we have to deal with. When you look at it in that context of course part of the equation is to look at government spending and look at where we are wasting some of the revenue we collect from the Australian community and see if there are savings that can be made there. It is for that reason that the Greens do have a range of proposals to reduce government spending. 


When you look at the tax expenditures that Australia gives to a range of industries, we in fact have one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. With those tax expenditures—or tax concessions, as they are sometimes referred to—we rank right up near the top of the list when it comes to the money we give to a range of industries and sectors, so why don't we start there. We provide concessions in the order of $10 billion over the forward estimates to the fossil fuel industries. We have this ridiculous handout that goes to mining industries in the form of the diesel fuel rebate—cheap petrol. When the price of petrol goes up we all pay for it—but not those in the mining industry; they get a whopping big tax concession that allows them to pay less for their diesel.


There are other areas we could be looking at as well. Superannuation is one. We provide enormous superannuation tax concessions that disproportionately favour the wealthiest people in our community. Superannuation was designed to try to relieve the pressure on our welfare system, on effectively the government's ability to be able to pay a pension for people once they hit a certain age. The tax concessions we currently provide, particularly to high-income earners, do not serve that purpose. They effectively serve as an investment vehicle for people on higher incomes, and that is not what they were designed to do. So there is an area where there are rich pickings. Let us have a look at superannuation tax concessions and whether there are some opportunities to reduce government spending in that area.


There are other areas in the property market. Negative gearing may be another thing the government chooses to look at. Negative gearing basically allows property to become an investment vehicle, again largely for people on higher incomes. What is the purpose of that tax concession? Some people argue it is necessary in order to drive investment in the housing market 


If we were serious about that we would be restricting negative gearing to new properties in order to drive housing construction, but that is not how the current system works. So we have one area of government spending—perhaps an area of government spending that Senator Day is not inclined to support—that is a form of tax expenditure and it should be looked at alongside many of the other areas of government spending that have been discussed.


It is not just government spending that we should be looking at. Why not look at the issue of revenue as well? We have some enormous opportunities. If we are to meet some of those challenges in terms of providing the services the people want we could be looking at areas of revenue—for example, a decent mining tax. Why on earth would we have this debate about cutting government spending and have a government prepared to look at introducing so-called price signals in health, when at the same time the government has effectively cut a source of revenue that most of the Australian community thought was fair and would have worked? It would have brought in income, over time, to a hugely profitable industry.


There are other opportunities as well, such as a levy on the big four banks. We guarantee—we effectively underwrite—our banks so that, should they face a challenge through something like another financial crisis, it is the taxpayer that underwrites their security. The banks are not responsible for paying, in any way, for that guarantee that we as taxpayers provide them. Why not have a very modest levy, in effect in return for the government underwriting the security of our big four banks?


I do not shy away at all from a debate on government spending. I think it is imperative that each of us here in this place takes a responsible look at areas of waste and mismanagement and ensures that collected hard-earned taxpayer revenue is used wisely. Of course we should be doing that, but let's not talk about cutting government spending for the sake of cutting government spending, because if we are going to do that we might as well have a debate about fairies in the sky or about any other area that is not based on reason or evidence.


The evidence is very clear. Government spending, in and of itself, can be a good thing or a bad thing. The aim of this place is to ensure that we maximise the public good and we minimise those harms associated with the collection of revenue when it is unnecessary and wasteful. For those reasons the Greens have put forward some sensible proposals to cut government spending alongside some revenue measures that will allow us to pay for the sort of society that each of us wants—one where health care is delivered in a fair and equitable way, where you can access a doctor regardless of whether you are unlucky enough to have been born in the wrong postcode, whether you can get a decent education and whether you live in a regional community or in the middle of a city, whether you are down on your luck and are unable to find a job, and knowing that you will be supported by other members of the Australian community. That is the sort of society that most us want to live in.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2014-11-27,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (17:26):  Firstly, this afternoon I would like to commend Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Day on their motion. When we see such a practical and sensible motion being brought forward to the Senate it is important that we recognise that that has been done.


The motion that we are discussing today is that 'the Senate acknowledges that it has a responsibility to propose and discuss options to cut government spending'. What a common sense and sensible proposal to bring forward to the Senate this afternoon! There is absolutely no doubt that that is something that needs to be done. And the Australian people understand that.


For the future of our nation we need to cut government spending. It is simple. People out there in the community understand this because they look at their own lives—they look at what they are doing in their own communities—and when they look at their own household budgets they know that if they do not keep their spending to a level that allows them to appropriately move forward through their lives they are going to go backwards—they are going to go out the door. They know that. They understand that it takes work to balance a household budget—that you cannot always do just what you want to do. You actually have to put thought into how that is going to work. They understand it.


People out there in small businesses—I know Senator Ruston would understand this very well—understand that they have to balance the books. They understand that they cannot spend more than they earn. They understand that they have to manage their businesses appropriately so that they can be sustainable. People out there in those communities right across Australia understand that. It is a shame that the previous, Labor government—and indeed Labor governments before them—simply did not understand that you have to balance the books and that you cannot spend more than you earn. They do not understand that you cannot borrow—and keep borrowing and borrowing—and expect that you are going to have a financially sustainable future. It is simply not possible. Those on the other side of the chamber do not understand that.


The reason it is so important that we debate this today is that it affects the future of the nation. We only have to look at the current financial figures to know what a difficult financial situation we are in and why it is important for this coalition government to take the difficult, necessary steps to ensure that we get some financial sustainability into the economy.


The previous, Labor government left this coalition government with a projected trajectory of debt to $667 billion—not millions; $667 billion! That figure is almost too big for people out there in our communities to comprehend; it is just a number. But it is a trajectory that this government would not allow to continue. We cannot allow our children and our children's children to be saddled with debt of around $25,000 a year each. We cannot allow them to be saddled with debt. This coalition government will not do that. 


We are not going to do that to the future generations of this nation because it is not right. The previous Labor government might have been prepared to do that but this coalition government is not. And the interest we are paying on that debt is money that the government does not have, to allow us to do the things the Australian people are asking us to do. We are paying over $1 billion monthly in interest—over $1 billion a month! When I look at the people who come to me every day, and I know who go to you as well Acting Deputy President Williams, talking about their local communities, wanting to get things in place which they see as benefiting their local communities, we have to say no because there is no money, that we are paying $1 billion a month interest on the bill racked up by the previous Labor government. That is what we have to tell them. 


When we on this side of the chamber look at those figures, we realise what a difficult task is ahead. We are paying $38 million a day, $1.6 million of hour, $27,000 a minute and $450 a second in interest on the previous Labor government's debt. And people wonder why the government is having to make tough decisions. That is exactly why—because we are going to be responsible and sensible, to ensure that this government gets this nation back on the financial track on which it needs to be.


What was it like previously under our coalition government? How did we leave the state of the finances for the previous Labor government? There was zero debt, none, and not only that, there were $50 billion in the bank. In six short years, the Labor Party managed in government to leave us the trajectory to a debt of $667 billion. It is no wonder people out in the community say, 'How was that even possible? How do they manage to do that?' It is because Labor simply have no ability whatsoever to manage the nation's finances. 


There is a track record of it, too. In 1996, when the coalition came to government the debt we had to repay was $96 billion. It took us 10 hard years to pay off that debt. Here we see it again—it is a pattern of behaviour. When coalition governments come in, we have to clean up Labor messes, to make sure we do everything we can to get the nation back on an economically sustainable footing. And we will do that.


How did we get to this point? We got to this economic mess through the previous Labor government's waste and mismanagement. We only have to look at a list of the types of things the previous Labor government was prepared to spend money on that got us into this mess, things that actually did not do any good for the nation. They borrowed money, spent money and applied it to things that did not do anything good for the nation. This is only some of the list. Under Labor we saw—who can forget these?—Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch, nearly $30 million spent setting them up and then what? They were dumped. They introduced—this one I am sure people will remember—a $429 million 'cash for clunkers' program. That was ditched by the previous Labor government. There was the Home Insulation Program, the pink batts, $2½ billion dollars mismanaged. Computers in schools was a $1.4 billion blow-out. The next one I think really encapsulates the level of mismanagement that we saw from the previous Labor government. As many senators would know, we used to have some billiard tables in this building. The previous Labor government sold them to $6,000, but then what happened? The previous Labor government decided to spend $102,000 determining whether or not they got value for money. Those are the types of actions we saw from the previous Labor government. That type of waste and mismanagement by the previous Labor government has led us to the economic circumstances we are in today. The solar panels program was an $815 million blow-out. The set-top box program—at an average of $350 a home but Harvey Norman was offering the same deal for $168. They simply had no idea how to manage the nation's finances, how to get the country on a sustainable financial trajectory. That has left us in this economic mess. 


This motion is so important today because the Senate has a responsibility to ensure that this government, elected by the Australian people to clean up the mess we were left by the previous government, can put in place what we need to ensure economic sustainability and part of that is cutting spending. As I said when I started, the Australian people understand that because they do it every day. We expect them to balance their budgets. We expect them to manage their livelihoods and they do. There is no bucket of money under Parliament House, as we all know. All of the dollars we spend are so much attributed to hardworking Australian taxpayers' dollars. The previous Labor government might have been quite happy to fritter that away but this coalition government is not. 


When we look at all this waste and mismanagement, we see that so much of it is sheeted home to the former failed finance minister. On Senator Wong's watch as finance minister, government net debt tripled. Net debt was $42 billion in 2009-10 and rose to $153 billion in 2012-13. Labor's debt interest bill rose from $4 billion in 2009-10 to $12 billion in 2013—$12 billion! That was all on the former failed finance minister Senator Wong's watch. 


We are having to fix up the previous Labor government's economic mess and that means from time to time this government has to take hard decisions. We are not going to govern the way the previous Labor government did—in a populist way, doing policy on the run, getting appalling outcomes for the Australian people, with absolutely no view to the nation's future. We are not going to fritter away money as did the previous Labor government. 


I turn to when Senator Wong was in a slightly different role as climate change minister. Some of the decisions that the then minister, Senator Wong, took when it came to water were quite breathtaking. You would understand this very well, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams. Bear in mind that we are talking about taxpayers' dollars. We are talking about hardworking Australian taxpayers' dollars. What did we see the former failed finance minister and the former failed climate change minister spend money on? You would assume that it would be things that would take the nation forward. Let me just give you a couple of examples. In the first one that I will refer to from under Senator Wong's watch, she spent $300 million—a third of a billion dollars—buying back water from Twynam Pastoral. The only thing was that the water licences that she bought were either general or supplementary. As those who understand water know, as I know you do, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, along with my good colleagues behind me, Senator Canavan and Senator McKenzie, water is not always available. She was buying water for the environment that was not actually going to be there when she needed it. A third of a billion dollars! And people wonder why we are in the economic mess that we are. And it went on. When we look at the mismanagement, it continued.


Senator Wong, in her role looking after climate change, water and the environment, and those sort of things, also spent $34 million on a property called Tandou. The interesting thing was, in terms of the water licence that she bought with $34 million of taxpayers' money, it was for supplementary water to go to the environment, as the minister at the time said. Supplementary water only exists in a flood. Thirty-four million dollars wasted for water that did not even exist. Senator Wong, the minister at the time, purchased a property called Toorale out near Bourke. You may well remember this one, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams. Nearly $24 million was spent on purchasing this property by Senator Wong, the minister at the time, to go towards the environment. The really interesting is: did the minister at the time, Senator Wong, go and have a look at Toorale? No, she did not. You would automatically assume, wouldn't you, that somebody from the department or somebody from her office would have gone and had a look. Not a single person went to have a look at that property.




Senator Canavan interjecting
—





Senator NASH:
  I will take that interjection, Senator Canavan. No, I do not think they even spoke to a real estate agent, but I stand to be corrected. The minister at the time, Senator Wong, spent $23.7 million on a property that neither she, her office or the department went to have a look at. As if that is not bad enough, unfortunately for Senator Wong, it was incredibly overvalued.



Senator Back interjecting—




Senator Back:
  No, it wasn't!




Senator NASH:
  It was, indeed, Senator Back. I will take that interjection. It was overvalued. What would have been funny if it was not so sad was that the people out there in the community were laughing themselves silly. Senator Wong was a joke; she was a joke. They knew that the government had spent all of this taxpayer money on a property that they had paid way too much for. She could have sold a Wet'n'Wild and she would not have even known; nobody went to have a look. That is indicative of how the previous Labor government operated when it came to the future financial situation in this country. That is what they did. That is how they operated.


It is no wonder that people around this country look at the performance of the previous Labor government and shake their heads. When it comes to financial management, the previous Labor government had absolutely no idea. They had six years to show the Australian people that they could manage the nation's finances. They had six years to show the Australian people that they had a vision for the future and that they did have a plan to ensure the future prosperity of the nation, and they failed. The Australian people recognised that. That is why they put the coalition government in—to fix Labor's economic mess, to have a government that would look to the future, to have a government that would take the tough decisions to ensure that our children, our grandchildren and their children have a strong and prosperous future in this nation, because that is what we all want. Unfortunately, it is just not something that the Labor Party can deliver. And we know—




Senator McKenzie:
  It is not in their DNA.




Senator NASH:
 I will take that interjection. Thank you, Senator McKenzie. It is not in their DNA, because we have seen it happen time and time again. On this side of the chamber we know what we have to do to ensure a sustainable and prosperous future. We know that it is not always going to be easy. We know we are going to have to take hard decisions and we know we are going to have to do what Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Day are proposing today, which is to consider cutting government spending. We have to do it; we have to do it because it is the responsible thing to do. It is the responsible thing for any government to do—to look at the future, to make sure that we are living within our means, to make sure that we have those policies in place that are going to ensure long-term prosperity when it comes to health, education, the environment and agriculture. There is so much that agriculture has to offer in terms of our long-term prosperity, but that will have to be a speech for another day.


We understand that on this side of the chamber. The coalition government is absolutely prepared to take the tough decisions to make sure that we have a prosperous nation not only for us but, as I said, for our children and for their children as well, because it is our responsibility to do that. It is our responsibility to get it right. We will make those tough decisions. It is not always going to be easy and it is not always going to be popular, but it is going to be the right thing to do. We all sit in this place and we know that those on the other side had their six years; they had their chance to prove that they could do it; they had their chance to prove that we could see from them some plan for the future. They had their chance—and they blew it. They had their chance and they failed. And now this coalition government has to fix the previous Labor government's mess. And we will do that. As I said, it is not always going to be easy; it is not always going to be popular. But I would say to the Australian people: always, always keep in mind that the coalition government will do this for the right reasons. The difficult decisions will be taken for the right reasons, and the right reasons are: ensuring that we have those policies in place to give our children and our grandchildren a prosperous future in this nation.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:45):  The question before the chamber at the moment is:


That the Senate acknowledges that it has a responsibility to propose and discuss options to cut government spending.


The proposition of course is one that all governments at some point or another in their time do have to consider. But there are many others that have to be considered as well in that context, and the concern that I have about such a statement is of course that it misrepresents the complexities of the way in which public finances have to be administered, and it underplays the importance that parliament has in terms of maintaining public confidence in the direction of the country.


It is one thing to talk about responsible economic management, and all governments of course do use that frame, but it is another thing entirely to go to an election and tell a pack of lies—to go to an election and say: 'We can undertake certain courses of action without cutting the budget.' That is exactly what this government has done. It went to the last election and explicitly said that, whatever programs it had, there would be no cuts to education, there would be no cuts to health and there would be no cuts to the ABC, and a range of other commitments were made. Apart from the fact that governments that do that sort of thing invariably get caught out as being liars—



Senator Back interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  There is no doubt about it—there is just absolutely no doubt about what this government has done: it has betrayed the Australian people, and the betrayal is real enough. But there is a more fundamental problem, and that is that, within this country—and I think this is common in many other countries as well, so it is not just confined to this country—there is a drop in public confidence in the authority of government, of the state; there is an undermining of the legitimacy of the democratic process; there is a capacity to turn people away from the political process itself. That, to me, undermines some fundamental democratic principles. It undermines the capacity of governments to actually talk to people about issues that are facing the country. It undermines the capacity of politicians to be trusted.


This Prime Minister we have now, Mr Abbott, made a great virtue of the issue of trust, in the last parliament. It was a central point in his assault upon the previous Labor government. And there were some very, very derogatory things said about the leadership of the last Labor government.




Senator Birmingham:
  Which one?




Senator KIM CARR:
  Well, it would not really matter, because you were quite indiscriminate when it came to your approach, and quite indiscriminate in your assault upon the integrity of Prime Minister Gillard and of Prime Minister Rudd—it did not really matter to you; you made a similar point.



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  Well, you took the view—



Government senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order on my right!




Senator KIM CARR:
  that anything goes; you took the view that it did not matter, so you could then go to an election and say, 'Trust us: we will not have any cuts to education, we will not have any cuts to health and we will not have any cuts to the ABC.' This is a government that is now characterised by its capacity to even lie about its lies. So the question of the democratic deficit that arises in these circumstances—




Senator Canavan:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question, I believe, before the Senate is about government expenditure, and nothing in the last minute or so related to that—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Canavan, there is no point of order. We have had wide terms in many of these debates. Continue, Senator Carr.




Senator KIM CARR:
  So this is a government that is now characterised by its duplicity, by the web of deceit that runs right through this government—a government that went to the election and said that there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no cuts to the ABC—



Government senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my right!

  So what do we find? In my particular areas of direct responsibility, we see the cuts to education: $5.8 billion—

  $5.8 billion to higher education and university research; nearly $3 billion in terms of the attempts to impose crippling debts on students, through increasing real rates of interest; $1.9 billion in reductions to government course subsidies; $200 million in cuts to the indexation arrangements for universities; $172 million in cuts to the promotion and reward funding for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds; $173 million in cuts to the training of Australian research students; $75 million in cuts to the Australian Research Council; and $31 million in cuts to the regulator.


And we now have a situation where a government wishes to give universities the right to print debt. It will mean a lifetime of debt, and a situation where the $100,000 degree will be commonplace in this country. It will mean a situation where people will be denied—



Senator McKenzie interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Carr, resume your seat, please.



Senator McKenzie interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator McKenzie, interjections are disorderly, and you are not even in your seat—in fact, you are in my seat, where interjections rarely, if ever, come from! So I ask you, on my right, to be quiet, please. Continue, Senator Carr.




Senator KIM CARR:
  You see the government does not like to hear this, but this is the truth. This is a government that is characterised by its lies and its deceit, a government that is characterised by the duplicity—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKenzie, you have a point of order?




Senator McKenzie:
  Senator Carr is actually misleading the Senate with his claims that $100,000 degrees will be all over—




Senator Bilyk:
  Ask Tas Uni!




Senator McKenzie:
  That is not the case. The Regional Universities Network put out a statement today stating—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKenzie, there is no point of order. Continue, Senator Carr.




Senator KIM CARR:
  The prospect of $100,000 degrees will be widespread in this country if the sycophants from the National Party get their way!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKenzie, you have a point of order?




Senator McKenzie:
  On behalf of the three Nats in the chamber, we thoroughly reject—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The point of order?




Senator McKenzie:
  The point of order is: I would like Senator Carr to withdraw his statement that the National Party are sycophants.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator McKenzie. Continue, Senator Carr.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. We do know that the doormats in that corner are only too happy to go along with any device—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKenzie, on a point of order?




Senator McKenzie:
  Well, I would like Senator Carr, if he is not going to withdraw his claim of 'sycophant' against the National Party, to withdraw calling the National Party 'doormats'.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Just this week I watched a program on the ABC that talked about the once great Country Party and people like Mr Sinclair. It showed many Nationals who actually stood up for rural and regional Australia, but not this crew now. They are sycophants, they are doormats, they are obsessed with brownnosing their way into ministerial office. They will do whatever they can, but they will not stand up for rural and regional students. They will not stand up to stop $100,000 degrees being imposed in this country.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Point of order, Senator Nash?




Senator Nash:
  You may have been distracted, but can I have your ruling on the fact that the phrase 'brownnosing' may not be parliamentary?




Senator Back:
  Make a decision, Acting Deputy President; it is not parliamentary. I am sure Senator Carr would be happy to withdraw it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  In fact—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! In fact, I was talking to the clerk and I did not hear it, I am sorry.




Senator Nash:
  If I could assist: the senator clearly used the phrase 'brownnosing'. I am keen to get your ruling on whether or not that phrase is unparliamentary. And if you do rule it as unparliamentary, I would ask you to ask the senator to withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Carr, would you like to rephrase that, or did you indeed say that?




Senator KIM CARR:
  I will. What we have are obsequious, supine and absolutely craven groups of people who refuse to defend rural and regional students and who have allowed, as a result of the duplicity of this government, a process where $100,000 degrees will be imposed upon students in rural and regional areas, and where cuts of up to $5.8 billion will be imposed upon universities and university students.


We know the great tradition of this country is a commitment to a fair go and the idea that if you are bright enough and you work hard, then you can get a quality education. But under this government rural and regional students in particular will be denied that opportunity. And the cowardly behaviour of the National Party, the unbelievably supine attitude of the National Party, highlights the point that regional and rural students in this country will be seriously undermined in their capacity to enjoy the great Australian gift of a fair go. So $100,000 degrees will be common; crippling debts will be the order of the day. There is a $5.8 billion cut to the university system, in complete contrast to what the Prime Minister said before the last election.


There is a real issue of trust here. We cannot trust the National Party to defend the interests of rural and regional students. We cannot possibly imagine the circumstances under this current regime where the National Party will stand up to ensure that courses will not be closed in rural areas, that campuses will not be closed. In fact, I would suggest to you there may well be universities themselves that will face acute pressure and may well be faced with crippling circumstances. We have already seen the Auditor-General in Victoria pointing out the consequences of the failed policies we have seen in that state, where budget cuts have led to the extraordinary destruction of public education through the TAFE system. We know the circumstances here: a government that went to the election making clear, unequivocal promises that there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no cuts to the ABC then brought in one of the most draconian budgets this country has ever seen.


We know these are the circumstances. We know that in the industry department similar sets of actions have followed whereby the government has sought to undermine jobs by destroying the automotive industry. It now seeks to take $900 million out of the Automotive Transformation Scheme. We see in a state like Victoria that up to 90,000 jobs are at risk as a result of a government that has been founded on lies. This is a government that has found itself caught out for the lies that it has told, the deceptions that it has sought to prosecute. This is a government that has lost the trust of the Australian people, and I trust on Saturday its relatives in Victoria will lose the trust of the Victorian people. We will see the debate in this country emerge about what are the prospects of government change because this is the real issue here: if you defy people's trust, it is inevitable that as the political cycle improves or in fact speeds up, then there are circumstances where governments may well be only around for one term. This is a government led by 'oncers'. This is a government that has lost the confidence of the people of this country because it has told so many lies about what it was going to do when it got into office. It has betrayed the Australian people's trust by cutting the budget, doing enormous damage to the economy— (Time expired)

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (18:00):  I move: 


That the Senate take note of the document.


Time will not permit me to speak fully, but I do want to draw the attention of the chamber to the diseases of haemophilia—haemophilia A and haemophilia B.


Before doing so, I just wish to record quickly, if I can, my absolute sympathy to the Hughes family at the loss of their son and brother, Philip, this afternoon. I know everybody in Australia would share that emotion. Our thoughts can only go out to his family and to those associated with him.


It does bring to my mind the shocking disease of haemophilia. It is a chronic genetic disorder caused by having a defective or a deficient blood-clotting factor. I make the point, and I will not long dwell on it, because after many years there is in fact a new long-acting treatment for both haemophilia A and haemophilia B that has come onto the market in our country. Indeed, both of them have now been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration but they are not yet funded for use.


We are not talking about large numbers: 2½ thousand people have haemophilia A and about 600 have haemophilia B—mainly boys and men. But, of course, what a tragic and devastating disease it is. Those who do not have any understanding of it might care to read the book April Fools' Day, written by Bryce Courtenay years ago, about his son, who was a haemophiliac and who died on 1 April.


I make the point with regard to the National Blood Authority because for one of the outcomes—outcome 1, in fact—the key performance indicator and the objective is the secure supply of blood and blood products. At the conclusion, I will seek to continue my remarks because this matter requires a lot more attention, except to say now that it rests with the National Blood Authority in the next few weeks and months to make a decision about funding for the new long-acting treatments for haemophilia A and B.


I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:12):  I rise tonight to speak on the report from the Senate Select Committee on Australia's Food Processing Sector, for which the government's response was handed down this week. As a representative of rural and regional Australia, it was a pleasure to work on this select committee with Senator Colbeck, Senator Xenophon, and others, where we travelled around Australia getting data, while in opposition, on the food processing sector right across Australia, but particularly, I think, for my home state of Victoria—the food processing capital of the nation.


I welcome this government's response to promote the food processing sector. The report was tabled in 2012, with 35 recommendations, which the coalition, in opposition, found to be crucial to reducing the costs and red tape, to stimulating investment in the food processing sector, and to dealing with some of the issues that the sector as a whole had identified—food labelling laws, education and skill sets, research, competition law et cetera, and indeed the impact of the carbon tax on this particular sector.


It is 12 months since we have came into government, and of the 35 recommendations of this report the government has noted all 35 of them. Importantly, we are a government of action and we have actually started dealing with many of these recommendations. We are not only dealing with them but putting them into action. I want to speak about that a little bit tonight.


In my home state of Victoria, the food processing sector is critical to our economy. It has turned over $25.4 billion and employs more than 133,000 people across the value chain. We export to over 100 countries worldwide. Employment in the food product manufacturing sector has defied the general decline in manufacturing employment in Australia. Whilst employment in manufacturing as a whole has decreased by 7.7 per cent over the five years to August 2014, employment in food product manufacturing has increased by 3.1 per cent, and Victoria accounts for 24 per cent of the gross value of the Australian food and beverage industry. It is because this sector is important that we have been proactive in introducing reforms and fulfilling the recommendations that were put forward.


I echo the comments in the government's response to this report that the Australian government has commenced implementing a number of election commitments to boost business competitiveness, as well as to assist the food processing industry. As I mentioned earlier, getting rid of the carbon tax was this government's pre-eminent response to assisting the food processing industry to remain competitive and to be able to grow, particularly when you think that the majority of workers in the food processing industry are actually working in rural and regional Australia, underpinning the local economies of our towns and regional cities.


I think this is incredibly important, when you look at what Gary Dawson, CEO of the Australian Food and Grocery Council, stated about the carbon tax:


""One of the things we found with the impact of the carbon tax was that because food processing is such a trade-exposed sector, processing companies had very little or no capacity to pass through those increased costs to the retailer and therefore to the consumer,"" he said.


""So it went straight to the bottom line of the company and had a direct impact on the viability and profitability of the company.


Do you know what that means? That means less money for people to employ people. It means less jobs in regional Australia. That was the outcome of those opposite's grand carbon tax plan.


The second thing that we dealt with within the food processing inquiry was competition policy, and we made recommendations around recommendation 4. The committee recommended that the government initiate an independent review on the competition provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act, recommending that we should take into particular consideration the misuse of market power, creeping acquisitions, predatory pricing and unconscionable conduct.


We also went on to look at the role of an ombudsman in managing the relationships that exist within the food processing supply chain, and these are key to our government's response. We have initiated, under Minister Billson, a review, the Harper review, of the Competition and Consumer Act which is dealing with those precise issues. It is seeking feedback from farmers groups, from food and grocery councils, from consumer groups and from small businesses to ensure that our Competition and Consumer Act is a 21st century document that deals with the reality of market power and of how it is used and sometimes abused within the context of our domestic economy. I am very proud of a minister that has taken those recommendations by the horns and is dealing with that through the Harper review, and I look forward to the continuing outcome of that particular process.


But we are not alone in our moves, as a federal government, to improve the food processing sector. In my home state of Victoria, the coalition government has seen Victoria's food and fibre exports increase from $7.3 billion to a record $11.4 billion this financial year, an increase of 56 per cent. There were 77 trade missions to 33 countries which support over 3,000 Victorian businesses, developing a $100 million Food to Asia Action Plan and a $6.2 million international engagement strategy.


Where the former federal government failed in promoting trade, the state coalition government of Victoria has been exceptional under its agriculture minister, Peter Walsh, its regional development minister, Peter Ryan, and its Premier, Denis Napthine. The three, as a triumvirate, have been unrelenting in their promotion of our food and fibre industry and in their promotion of our state not only domestically but right throughout the world, leading super trade missions. I sit on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and right now we are conducting an inquiry into the potential for a trade agreement with gulf nations. But from what we are hearing through submissions, everyone we talk to talks about the superior approach of the Victorian government when it comes to promoting their local product in an international market.


Hats off to the state coalition government for promoting the great state of agriculture, Victoria. The Victorian government has just announced a $48 million dairy investment in Pactum Dairy, creating 52 new full-time jobs in Shepparton. Similarly, at Australian Lamb in Colac the state government has announced a $2.35 million plate freezer investment to boost exports, creating 25 new jobs. Hardwick's Meat stage 1 boning room and cold storage expansion, another project announced by the state coalition government, includes a $1.5 million investment, generating 50 new jobs. It is projects like these that ensure our food processing industry continues to thrive, and I welcome the commitment from the recent government response.


I similarly congratulate Premier Denis Napthine, Deputy Premier Peter Ryan and the Victorian Minister for Agriculture and Food Security, Peter Walsh, for their ongoing efforts in improving the food processing sector. I want to stress to the people of Victoria that the food processing sector is such an important industry to a state economy, and this current state government is committed to further investment. It is only a state coalition government that will deliver that investment and those jobs directly into regional Victoria—directly into Colac and directly into the heart of the food processing in my state in Shepparton.


Just while I am on Shepparton, I want to recognise the two days that we had in Shepparton whilst we were conducting our inquiry. Shepparton is in the seat of Murray—the former 'Black Jack' seat—where I know our current candidate, Greg Barr, is running hard and supporting the local food processing industry and is very welcoming of this state coalition government's continued investment into jobs and food manufacturing in central Victoria. It is part of my state, as a Victorian senator.


We heard from Fruit Growers Victoria, Greenham and the Greater Shepparton City Council. We had the Australian Dairy Industry Council. What a great fortnight it has been for dairy. Thank you, Minister Robb. We heard from Hazeldene's Chicken Farm, looking at poultry and growing a variety of food production and at being able to process them in regional Victoria. Getting them to market and to port is another important goal, and the state coalition government is committed to ensuring the East West Link will provide a transport network that will ensure the great clean, green product that is being grown and processed in Victoria will be able to get onto that port, get out of that dock and get to the markets that are waiting for it right around the world, thanks to the super trade missions of the state coalition government. Vote 1 coalition this Saturday.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2014-11-27,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (18:22):  I rise to speak about the decision by the Barnett government to close a significant number of homeland communities in Western Australia. Mr Barnett has been forced to do that by the withdrawal by the Abbott government, as part of its harsh cruel budget cuts, of funding that had been provided over 50 years. 


Western Australia has one of the highest numbers of homeland communities in the country. Aboriginal people living on homeland communities in Western Australia are caught in the crossfire between the Abbott and Barnett governments as they shunt responsibility for who funds the municipal services in these communities. I draw the parallel that, if there were an issue with municipal services in a small country town, I doubt very much that the first response of governments would be to move people out and shut their houses down. In a white community we would not be standing here and saying, 'Because we are now withdrawing funding for municipal services, we are going to shut your town down.' But in that is exactly what Premier Barnett has said to those communities. Without consultation, he has said, 'We're just going to shut you down because we don't want to fund your municipal services.' Despite the fact that municipal services are funded in very small regional and rural communities right across Western Australia, they do not want to do it for these communities. Why do they get away with it? Because Aboriginal people, by and large, still remain voiceless in our country.


Both the Abbott government and the Barnett government have an appalling record when it comes to government spending. The Barnett government has wasted millions of public money on a hospital it has failed to open, which is 18 months overdue, with an amount of $118 million paid to the private for-profit operator before the hospital even opened. Imagine if the homeland communities got the bonus of being able to invest $118 million. The Abbott government says everyone has to be part of its harsh, cruel budget and share the pain. But that is not true; it still wants to continue with its paid parental leave scheme for the wealthy.


Last week we had the Productivity Commission report, which shows little improvement in key areas of Aboriginal disadvantage. But that does not stop the Abbott government from ripping millions of dollars from homeland communities in Western Australia, which, according to Premier Barnett, means that over half of those communities are now under threat of closure.


The Barnett has copped criticism over this announcement, and rightly so. My Labor colleagues caught him out when they visited those homeland communities. Premier Barnett, with his he-knows-best attitude, did not bother to visit. But Ben Wyatt and Josie Farrer did visit. A growing body of academic research over the past 30 years has indicated that life at homelands—'outstations' might be a better word—in health outcomes, livelihoods, social cohesion and housing conditions has been worse than in larger communities. Pat Dodson, a Yawuru man and a well-respected Aboriginal leader, came out this week and said it as it really when he said we would create an internal group of displaced persons. He said:


You'd have displaced Aboriginal people from their homelands or their traditional country, relocated ... on to lands and into places that are not necessarily country that they identify with or have an affiliation [with] … and to be mixed among peoples who they may or may not have good or lasting relationships with.


He went on to say:


There's some kind of assumption that by a process of osmosis, people will be absorbed into the mainstream of Western-life …


Even the Barnett government has it confused. The Premier said communities with less than five people living in them were on his target list. At the very same time, his Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the Legislative Council was saying something quite different. He was saying that it was absolutely nonsensical that communities with five people or less would be closed. So here we have the biggest bungle we have seen which will impact on the lives of Aboriginal people if the Abbott and Barnett governments do not get their acts together. I am saying that Aboriginal people need to be treated like every other Australian and that either the Abbott government or the Barnett government needs to put the municipal services in place and respect the rights of Aboriginal people.
