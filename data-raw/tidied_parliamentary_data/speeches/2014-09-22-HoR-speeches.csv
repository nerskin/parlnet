The SPEAKER
 (10:01):  As members would be aware, there has been significant discussion in relation to security at Parliament House, following the national terrorism public alert level being raised from medium to high. As Speaker I am working closely with the President and intelligence and security agencies to implement necessary security changes here at Parliament House. Members will notice changes to security practices and procedures in Parliament House which are designed to enhance and strengthen the existing security arrangements. 


I would ask that members be patient as the new security procedures are implemented and, whilst every effort will be made to minimise disruption to members, these new measures are necessary to ensure safety to Parliament House and its occupants.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (10:08):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present two reports of the committee: Review of administration and expenditure: No. 11 and No. 12—Australian intelligence agencies, and Review of the listing of Boko Haram;Review of the re-listing of the Islamic State. 


Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e)




Mr TEHAN:
  The committee is required by the Intelligence Services Act to review the administration and expenditure of the agencies of the Australian intelligence community, and this report covers the financial years 2011-12 and 2012-13. 


The committee received comprehensive submissions for both years and conducted private hearings with each of the agencies, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Australian National Audit Office. I am pleased to report that the committee was satisfied that agencies are currently overseeing their administration and expenditure effectively. 


For a number of years now, the committee has monitored the impact of the efficiency dividend and other savings measures on agencies. In this review, the committee sought assurances that each agency continued to have the necessary resources to address and target Australia's national security priorities to the degree necessary to protect Australians against threats to national security.


Madam Speaker, the committee found that the ongoing impact of the efficiency dividend and other savings measures were placing increasing pressure on the AIC agencies. Since 2010, agencies have warned of the potential impact on operational capability. This was reiterated even more strongly in this review with the clear message that any further cuts will lead to capability reductions. For this reason, the committee has recommended that the government review the continued application of the efficiency dividend and other savings measures to the agencies comprising the Australian intelligence community. The committee considers particular consideration should be given to the cumulative impact of these measures on operational capacity, including optimal staffing levels, and the ongoing ability of agencies to protect Australia's national security.


Turning to the second report, the committee has reviewed the making of regulations to list Boko Haram and relist the Islamic State as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code. For Boko Haram, this is the first time the group has been listed by the Australian government. The group has launched attacks of increasing violence and sophistication since 2009. In the period from 2011 and 2014, 29 terrorist attacks were claimed by or reliably attributed to Boko Haram. In addition to assassinations of political, military and religious figures, the group has increasingly targeted non-combatants, including attacks on schools, markets, churches, residential areas and bus interchanges, which have killed hundreds of civilians. The group has also turned to kidnapping, including the April 2014 kidnapping of more than 200 girls from a secondary school in Borno State. Listed as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and other governments, the group is not engaged in any meaningful peace negotiations


Madam Speaker, as I reported in my oral statement to the House on 4 September, the committee fully supports the listing of Boko Haram as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code.


I now turn to IS. Known also as ISIL and ISIS, the Islamic State was relisted as a terrorist organisation by the government on 11 July 2014. In a statement on 29 June 2014, the group had announced:


Accordingly, the ""Iraq and Sham"" in the name of the Islamic State is henceforth removed from all official deliberations and communications, and the official name is the Islamic State from the date of this declaration.


The committee was informed that the listing reflects the expansion of the group's operating area and its announcement of an Islamic caliphate, but that the leadership, membership and methods of the group have not changed.


Described to the committee as 'one of the world's deadliest and most active terrorist organisations', the Islamic State conducts daily attacks on security forces and civilians. In Iraq, the group aims to destroy public confidence and provoke widespread revolt against the government, as well as undermining efforts to contain the group. In Syria, its targets include the regime of Bashar al-Assad, some armed opposition groups, and Turkish and Kurdish militants.


The committee fully supports the relisting on the basis that the group continues to engage in and advocate terrorist attacks. The committee also maintains the view expressed in an earlier report that the strong links to Australia are a significant additional factor in the proscription of this group. We have heard that there are about 60 Australians fighting in Syria and Iraq, with about another 100 people in Australia believed to be providing active support. The committee therefore does not recommend disallowance of the regulation listing the Islamic State as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code.


Could I take this opportunity to thank all members of the committee for their participation in these two inquiries. I would also like to place on the record the support of the committee secretariat in helping to put these reports together. I commend the reports to the House.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (10:15):  I will be talking around three very comprehensive reports in the space of about five minutes. I would like to start my remarks by commending all the reports to the House, particularly those on the listing or relisting of the particular terrorist organisations. I also commend the committee secretary, Dr Anna Dacre; Julia Searle, the inquiry secretary; and Renee Toy, who was the researcher. I thank my fellow committee members, who worked in a bipartisan way to deliver a bipartisan and impartial report in challenging circumstances.


I specifically want to talk about and amplify the chair's concerns with respect to the relisting of the terrorist organisations and to point out that the reports on the review of the listing of Boko Haram for the first time and the review of the relisting of the Islamic State were conducted under the Criminal Code. I want to talk about Boko Haram briefly. The parliament joint committee has completed its review process for the listing of Boko Haram as a terrorist organisation for the first time in this country and the process for the relisting of the Islamic State as a terrorist organisation. The committee was satisfied, as the chair said, that the correct procedures were followed and the decisions to list Boko Haram and to relist Islamic State as terrorist organisations were appropriately made.


On the history of Boko Haram, it is a Salafist Islamic movement, largely based in Nigeria, where they intend to establish an Islamic state and implement sharia law upon the populace. There are allegations that Boko Haram has ties with both the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb and al-Shabaab. The chair went into the statement of reasons for the listing of Boko Haram, which included the 29 terrorist attacks that were attributed to them between 2011 and 2014. They are also well known in Australia and around the world for the kidnapping of more than 200 girls from a secondary school in Borno state. They have released videos threatening further attacks and have advocated the perpetration of terrorist attacks. They have not engaged in substantive peace negotiations and they have now been listed as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, Nigeria, Canada, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom.


I would also like to comment on the Islamic State, as the chair also made comment on previously. The Islamic State has previously been listed, first in 2005 and then 2007, under a former name. As quoted from the report, the Australian government relisted the group under the name Islamic State on 11 July 2014. The listing as 'Islamic State' does not reflect a change in the leadership, membership or methods of the group but does reflect the expansion of its operating area and the announcement of an Islamic caliphate. The land claimed by the Islamic State extend from Aleppo in Syria to Diyala in Iraq, including Sunni dominated areas of both countries.


There was a very thorough process that we undertook in listing or relisting these organisations. I think it is important to put on the record—particularly given the listing of the Islamic State, as it now likes to call itself, although we do not accept the terrorist nomenclature that it uses to falsely establish its primacy in the region—that the public should be reassured with respect to the listing, particularly given what occurred with the raids conducted by our intelligence and security agencies in the past couple of days.


I would like to put on the record on behalf of the committee our thanks to both the security services and the intelligence services for the work they do. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security occupies a very unique space in parliamentary and public life. It is subjected to comprehensive and classified briefings about intelligence agencies. From time to time that does go into operational activity. I can say with some measure of confidence, on behalf of the committee, that the work of the intelligence and security agencies, particularly in addressing the terrorist threat, is strong. The public should be reassured about the work that it is doing to deal with the current threat that it is dealing with. There has been a lot of community concern about what is transpiring in our community as a consequence of the raid. If there is one message I could put to the Australia people, they should be reassured in the quality and the value of our security agencies. They thwarted a terrorist attack on our soil, and I have full confidence in them continuing to do so in the future.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:20):  I move: 


That this House:


(1) notes the importance of supporting young people transition from school into work or further training and preventing them from falling into the trap of unemployment


(2) recognises the important work done in ensuring that students are supported to make the transition through:


(a) the Youth Connections program that has a proven track record in helping young people who have not or are at risk of not completing year 12, transition back into school or further education, training and employment;


(b) the School Business Community Partnership Brokers program which builds partnerships between schools and the wider community including business and charities that help young people achieve year 12 or equivalent qualifications;


(c) National Career Development Strategy services that support vital links between industry, students and training options; and,


(3) is extremely concerned that there is no funding in the budget for these programs past 1 January 2015; and


(4) calls on the Government to immediately reverse its decision to no longer fund these programs past the 2014 calendar year.


Today, I move this motion because this House recognises, or should recognise, the importance of programs like the Youth Connections, the partnership brokers and the national career development service and the impact it has on the lives of young people in our communities—young people who have now been abandoned and betrayed by this Prime Minister and this government. This Prime Minister has let them down significantly. This government has walked away from its responsibility in supporting young people's transition from school to work. This is a government that simply fails to recognise the significant social and economic impact that cutting this critical support will have on Australians in the years to come. Indeed, supporting our students from school to work or further training can be considered the foundation on which the pillars of people's working lives rest in helping young people make the decisions they need to plan their futures. Even if Australia was to have—and we often have—great childhood early learning centres, the best schools, the best TAFES and the best universities, without supporting young people's transition from school into further study and training to help them to work out what they want do and what their futures hold, this transition will be fraught.


It is critical that young people get support when they are thinking about what awaits them in life after school. They do not necessarily know what they are good at, what appeals to them and which career will best suit them without some assistance and guidance from people and from services that help them work out where they want to go and how they will get there. In government, Labor invested over $700 million in programs like Youth Connections and partnership brokers—programs that support our young people to continue their studies or pursue further study or training for transition into the workplace. These programs actually get results. This is something that the government does not seem to understand. These programs were getting results, with almost 75,000 young people in the 2013 calendar year given a helping hand to Youth Connections. This figure was expected to top 100,000 at the end of the year.




Mr Laming:
  You defunded them. Why did you stop funding it?



Mr Hutchinson interjecting—




Ms RISHWORTH:
  We can have members from the government benches whine all they like. They have to face the reality that they cut these programs. They cut these programs that were helping thousands and thousands of young people. Indeed, if we look at the Youth Connections program, it was incredibly successful, with over 80 per cent of young people still in work or education after two years. Nineteen per cent of young people who accessed the service were Indigenous students, 70 per cent of young people who benefited were in regional and remote areas and 40 per cent of young people who benefited were from the lowest socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and this assistance was making a difference. In government, Labor also delivered the partnership brokers program. This was designed to partner schools with the wider community, including business and charities, in actively supporting young people finishing year 12 or equivalent. There was also the national careers development service, which did a number of things and included the very successful jobs guide that I and many people for decades have been relying on to give advice about which courses to do to achieve career aspirations.


Of course, we had the Prime Minister travel to the US and talk about his admiration for a program that helps boost links with schools and businesses. Little did he understand that indeed he was cutting the program that was successfully achieving that in Australia. With Senator Polley I recently visited the National Joblink in Launceston, a Youth Connections provider which will likely be forced to close its doors at the end of the year because of the Prime Minister's cuts. Quite frankly, when speaking to Lisa, the Youth Connections coordinator in Launceston, she simply could not understand why the government would do this.


We get excuses from the government. They have offered measly support now; they have announced measly support for 3,000 students and young people in small pockets of the country. That cannot replace the significant investment to assist 75,000 people. The government need to reconsider this decision. They need to refund Youth Connections, the national partnership and the career service; otherwise young people will be significantly disadvantaged.

"Williams, Matt, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr WILLIAMS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:26):  I rise to oppose this motion. Yesterday I participated in the City to Bay fun run through my electorate. Many young people also participated. I think I even spotted one or two supporters of the member for Kingston there. As they ran through my electorate they would have noticed the ""fixing south roads"" signs—$1 billion of Commonwealth funding for young construction workers. That is another example of how we are helping young Australia and helping build Australia. We are positive about the future of Australia, in contrast to members opposite.


Let us go through a bit of the history. In their last budget the previous Labor government funded the program for a single additional year, with all the funding to conclude at the end of this year. My colleagues on this side of the chamber mentioned that during first speeches by members. Let us remember that the previous Labor government did not provide any further funding or budget allocation. They stand here and say, 'We were committed,' but they did not provide any funding. It is all about money being in the bank; the revenue stream being there. They did not provide the funding. They were not committed to it going forward past this year.


We all know that this program was designed by state and territory governments to take over at the end of the national partnerships. The states and territories have declined to do this for a variety of reasons. I know that in my state of South Australia the state Labor government have mismanaged the finances, with over $2 million interest payments on debt. They have no capacity to fund programs like this. They are forced to make cuts to TAFE and other valuable community services. The government will ensure that in the next round to commence next year Job Services Australia will effectively address the needs of young Australians seeking work. 


So what else is this government doing? I will go through a few points. We are investing a record $64.5 billion in government and non-government schools for education for young people. We have introduced trade support loans, offering loans of up to $20,000 over the life of an apprenticeship. We are supporting more than 80,000 new students each year for higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degree courses. New work for the dole arrangements will also help more young job seekers improve their chances of getting a job while giving something back to the community. Also, there was a recent announcement that $38 million is being provided to deliver the Training for Employment Scholarship Program.


I was down with Luke Hartsuyker in Drakes Supermarkets, which is a fine local example of providing training and jobs for young Australians. The fine member for Reid knows Roger, who is a fine managing director of that company. I met with a number of impressive young staff members. I congratulate Drakes on their training program and commitment to providing jobs for young Australians. They have put through over 200 staff in recent years to gain certificates in food processing or retail management. They have won numerous awards including, in 2012, employer of the year at the Australian Training Awards. So well done to all those associated with Drake food markets.


I just want to make a few points about the higher education system and the necessary reforms that this government is tackling. These reforms will put Australia in a better position to create some of the best universities in the world, better institutions for young Australians. In the past, we have attracted some of the best and brightest from Asia, who have gone on to have outstanding careers. I will just go through a couple. One is His Excellency Dr Tan, who studied a PhD in mathematics at my alma mater, the University of Adelaide, and is currently the President of the Republic of Singapore. An earlier Adelaide university graduate was also a previous President of the Republic of Singapore. Like Adelaide university, Flinders, Uni of SA and numerous other universities around Australia have produced many fine graduates from Asia, but this will be in jeopardy unless we improve and give our universities the best chance to succeed with these reforms.


It is not only we who are talking about these reforms. The peak body of the universities sector, Universities Australia, is saying it is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shape a higher education system that is sustainable, affordable and equitable—important words: 'sustainable, affordable and equitable'—for students and the nation. Dr Gonski recently backed our plans, claiming deregulation will free up funds to make universities even greater.


Funding for higher education is actually going up—something that the members opposite will not acknowledge. We are providing direct financial support, uncapped, for students. Also, we have a package for low-socioeconomic status students which will give them new Commonwealth scholarships, an innovative program. So there is record investment in education, new initiatives supporting students in training and necessary higher education reforms backed by the universities themselves.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (10:31):  I was recently happy to welcome the Leader of the Opposition to the Chifley electorate to visit a massive development venture that is under construction there: the Sydney Business Park at Marsden Park. It is going to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, in particular through a partnership initiated by the developers, joined by a range of community based organisations. The future tenants of the site are going to commit to sourcing the majority of staff from neighbouring suburbs. They are looking to do what they can to deal with the number of unemployed youth in the area, because youth unemployment has plagued our area for quite some time. It is running at roughly three times the national unemployment rate and it is predicted to climb to four times that rate within the next few years. So we need a range of people in business, government and the community to work together to make sure we create jobs and get our local young people ready and skilled up to fill those jobs.


That brings me back to the opposition leader's visit, where he was able to meet the developers and meet on-site with some of the local young people who are already busy working to get a future in the hospitality industry. Courtesy of Marist Youth Care, this band of future entrepreneurs and pretty sharp baristas are running their own cafe in a demountable adjacent to all the site's construction activity. They are the first wave of what will hopefully be many to follow, showing what they are capable if given the chance and boosted by the right support provided by Youth Connections, which is used on-site. That project is just one of many that Marist Youth Care is involved in in the Chifley electorate, giving young people in the area hope of employment and boosting their self-worth.


The following day I visited another organisation, Eagles RAPs in Doonside—a fantastic group of dedicated people who, incidentally, also source Youth Connections funding through Marist Youth Care's grant. Eagles RAPs offers an education platform to young people who have had problems adapting to traditional schooling or who are battling their own personal circumstances such as misdemeanours or a difficult family life.


Now an organisation that delivers hope to others is running out of hope for itself, because the Abbott government has cut $800,000 of Youth Connections grant funding to Marist Youth Care, which also uses Eagles RAPs. In fact, Eagles RAPs is staring closure in the face after 20 years of operation. The area that I am proud to represent does not hold a monopoly on youth unemployment, crime or hard luck stories—not by any stretch—but we do have more than our fair share, and organisations like Marist Youth Care and Eagles RAPs give greater value for money than the funds they secure from the government. But the Abbott government thinks it is clever to slash their funding and tear away at the sections of society that need help the most, as evidenced in the bold letters contained within the budget.


What I found particularly galling was that, the very day after the opposition leader and I met with Marist Youth Care on-site, the Prime Minister turned up in our area, in Blacktown, and had the hide to meet Marist Youth Care, the very organisation that he stripped $800,000 from. The parliamentary secretary was in tow with him, visiting Marist Youth Care in Blacktown. I felt for them, because they were obviously aggrieved. They are impacted on; they are trying to find jobs and skill people up in our area, and the Abbott government has basically cut their funding, but then the Prime Minister wants to use them as a prop for a photo opportunity. Marist Youth Care is good enough for the Prime Minister to use for a photo op but not good enough to support with the funding they need to help reduce youth unemployment in the area I represent. It is an absolute crime. And does it make sense? No, it does not. But in a way that is not surprising. Let us look at the ministry list. This is how many people from Western Sydney sit in the federal ministry, in an area of two million people: one. And this here is how many sit on the list from the east of Sydney, highlighted in orange: one.


That is my issue. This government has no concept of the impact of its decisions. It cuts school funding, makes it harder for our young to go to university, and has slashed programs like Youth Connections. And the impact of these cuts and the human stories is out of sight and out of mind for a ministry that is Eastern Sydney centric, with the exception of Senator Payne—Senator Payne is the only Western Sydney minister. And guess what? She is the Minister for Human Services, who oversights Centrelink—the same government body that will shortly be holding back Newstart payments to the young people who find it harder to get work because programs like Youth Connections get cut. That tells you everything you need to know about this government: if it is out of sight it is out of mind. They do not care for the young people of Western Sydney and the problems they have, because none of their ministers have to walk around the communities that are affected by their decisions, unless of course it is the Prime Minister and his parliamentary secretaries all out there for a cheap photo.

Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (10:36):  I was very pleased to hear that the member for Kingston was recently in Tasmania. Unfortunately, at the forum she attended when she was down there they could not find one of their own Tasmanian senators to actually represent and speak on behalf of the very important reforms the government is making with respect to higher education. But the member for Kingston is not the only member who has ventured down to Tasmania in more recent times. We had the member for Adelaide in my electorate only a month ago. For the first time in years and years and years, Lyons is back on the radar of the Labor Party. They took it for granted for 20 years. So I am very pleased. I welcome members of the Labor Party and the shadow ministry who want to come down to Tasmania and spruik what it is. We also had the member for Ballarat in my electorate, and the Leader of the Opposition more recently in Braddon. It is great to see the Labor Party, after ignoring my state for so long, and after the damage done with the Labor Party and the Greens in power both in Tasmania and in Canberra. We are slowly starting to rebuild. You are most welcome to come down any time and have a look at the good work being done by the new Tasmanian government.


All complaint and no solution: if it was so good, it would have been funded. In 2013-14, the budget was brought down not by the Liberal Party but by the Labor Party—an absolute disgrace. Getting children into work and education should be and always is a priority of government, and it should also be a priority of the community. They need to have the best opportunities to secure a job, to go onto higher education. But there is not one simple fix, and to suggest so is quite simply misleading.


The Abbott coalition government is providing more opportunities for young Australians to earn and/or learn, and it is my true belief that this starts with the family. It is about the culture that is embedded within the family unit. It is about the example that mums and dads set for their children. Yes, of course schools have a role to play. The community mentors have a role to play. And the conversations and the culture need to be there—not in year nine or year 10, but they need to begin in year five or year six, and this needs to be embedded into the curriculum. I will give the example in my own electorate of the Glenora District High School. The principal, Phillip Wells, is a fine educator and takes great pride in getting, for the first time ever in a regional or rural school, all of last year's year 10 students to go on to year 11. Some of you may not realise, but in Tasmania, unfortunately, we do not have year 11 and year 12 in the high schools. That is being changed by the current state government, and they have introduced a voluntary system whereby schools can apply to become part of a program to reintroduce year 11 and year 12.


Phillip Wells, the principal at Glenora district school, got all of the students from year 10 to go on to college last year, and three-quarters of the way through 2014 they are still there. Full marks to him, because this was a program that started at the district school in year 5 and year 6. He is working to encourage these kids to understand the opportunities that are there. Some of these kids come from very poor backgrounds, very low SES backgrounds. With no disrespect to mum and dad, they just do not know the opportunities that are there in the big wide world and the opportunities that a good education can give to those children. As many would be aware, there are a number of schools in my electorate—Cressy district school, New Norfolk High School, Campbell Town district school and Sorell High School—that participate in the Beacon Foundation, which does wonderful work.


The things that we are doing as a government include the trade support loans that are about encouraging students to complete their apprenticeship: ""Complete your apprenticeship and we'll knock 20 per cent off the loan that you take out."" Whether it be $5,000, for example, for a utility vehicle or accommodation assistance, it is about encouraging those students to complete their education.


As a former speaker mentioned, in relation to the higher education reforms, it is about 80,000 more young Australians from low SES backgrounds having an opportunity to go on to higher education, having an opportunity to do sub-bachelor and bachelor and diploma courses at university. That is truly a reform.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (10:41):  I rise to speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Kingston. I was very interested to hear the previous speaker talk about the Labor Party as being ""all complaint and no solution"", particularly having regard to the contributions that we have already heard from government members opposite. ""All complaint and no solution"" is really an allegation that could be more fairly addressed at members of this government—a government that is so narrowly ideological, as demonstrated by the previous speaker's contribution, and that is focused on the family, ignoring the deep social needs of many vulnerable young people and ignoring a positive role of government and the responsibilities of government particularly in this area.


I have spoken on this topic previously. It is a great shame, a tragedy indeed, that this government has seen fit to progress with its cruel and destructive agenda by attacking vulnerable young people—attacking our future. Youth unemployment is, of course, a pervasive problem right across the country. It can have a lasting impact on a person's life.


It is not uncommon for entry level jobs now to be advertised that require minimum amounts of experience, which makes it particularly difficult for an inexperienced young person to secure employment and a start in their working life. As well as this experience gap there is also an information gap whereby young people tend not to have the connections or the networks to know if there are jobs going.


In government, Labor sought to bridge both the information gap and the experience gap between young people and employers with programs like Youth Connections and Partnership Brokers. We invested more than $700 million over five years. Youth Connections helps young people who have not completed or are at risk of not completing year 12 or equivalent qualifications and have barriers that make it difficult to participate in education, training or employment. Youth Connections providers work with young people to help make a successful transition to further education, training or employment.


Before the budget—before this horror budget—I met with some of the local service providers in the Scullin electorate like Kildonan, Whittlesea Community Connections and Crossroads to discuss the program and its importance to our area. I was impressed not just with the passionate and committed staff but also with the results the program is delivering on the ground. Six months after exiting Youth Connections, 94 per cent of young people are still engaged in education and employment. And after two years, more than 80 per cent are still in work or education. This is a significant achievement, particularly in the context of the rising youth unemployment rates. It shows that these programs are working.


But it is about more than statistics. I was, and I remain, deeply affected by the stories I heard of the individual impacts of the program. I think especially of a young woman from Iran, at risk of disengagement two years ago, or thereabouts, now on track to become an architect—a life transformed through these positive, vital interventions. I would like to think that all of us in this place would want to do everything we can to reduce youth unemployment. Getting and keeping a job is one of the most important things a person can do. It builds confidence, independence and a sense of pride and accomplishment, as well as providing food on the table and shelter over our heads. Thanks to this government, funding for these vital programs runs out from the end of 2014, and many providers will be forced to close.


I note that two weeks ago, in what can only be seen as an admission that the government has made a mistake, it introduced some stop-gap measures. However, these announcements will achieve nothing like Labor's programs. I also note that they are targeted at regional youth. I certainly support reducing youth unemployment in regional areas, but what about young people in metropolitan areas like Scullin, Kingston, Parramatta and Reid? Why doesn't the government care about these people? The youth unemployment rate in Melbourne's north-east was almost 12 per cent a year ago, but as of August this year it has risen to 14 per cent. Just $130 million was needed to maintain these programs and, if the funding was maintained, 100,000 young Australians would benefit—a small investment for a big return in our future.


With youth unemployment today at more than double the average unemployment rate, Australia needs a plan for job creation which must involve preventing youth unemployment and supporting at-risk young people. Of course, there is no plan at all in terms of jobs from members opposite. I say this to members opposite—the members in our present government: reducing unemployment should not be seen as budget savings. It should not be seen as a burden. It is an investment in our young people. It is an investment in our capacity and our collective wellbeing. I see the parliamentary secretary at the table sigh. I think it is symptomatic of this government's failure to engage with the real concerns of vulnerable young people in electorates like mine. Unfortunately, it is the case that we have a government that is not concerned about youth unemployment or about the future of this country. All the rhetoric about intergenerational inequality is empty. It is just a mask for ideologically-driven austerity, for a small, narrow view of the state and our collective capacity. I am pleased to join the member for Kingston and Labor members in calling on this government to immediately reverse its decision to no longer fund these programs beyond this calendar year.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:46):  Those opposite never fail when it comes to post-election amnesia. Here they are up in arms about Youth Connections Program, yet while they were in government Labor did not provide any further funding or budget allocation for the program to continue beyond this year. That is right: Labor is responsible for the defunding of this program. Close to my electorate of Ryan, BoysTown has announced that they are looking at filling the gap left by Youth Connections. They are looking at privately funding a program with similar goals to Youth Connections. This is just one private organisation looking to fill the gap. Just because the government does not fund a program, it does not mean that it cannot happen. I would like to commend BoysTown for its initiative. Despite Youth Connections, I would also like to point out that youth unemployment continued to rise under Labor. The coalition government is delivering on our commitment to introduce Trade Support Loans for apprentices to encourage more young people to take up a trade and complete their qualification. From 1 July 2014, the government will offer loans of up to $20,000 over the life of an apprenticeship. These loans will ease the financial burden and help increase apprenticeship completion rates. Like HELP, formerly referred to as HECS, the loans will be repayable only once apprentices are earning a sustainable income.


We are also giving young Australians a greater chance to go on to further education, whether it be through a trade, a sub-bachelor degree or a bachelor degree. As part of the coalitions government's largest education reforms in 30 years, the Commonwealth will provide funding for higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees, providing pathways to careers or further study. These initiatives are all about ensuring that young people are given the opportunity to become educated and broaden their career prospects. For those young people currently in between jobs, the new work-for-the-dole arrangements will help more young job seekers to improve their chances of getting a job while giving something back to the community that supports them. This will also keep them active so that when they do get back into the workforce they remain in the mind frame to cope with normal work hours and mental demand.


The coalition government understands that a highly skilled workforce is crucial to Australia's productivity and global competitiveness. Apprenticeship completion rates of around 50 per cent are not good enough, and the new support services announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry will provide more support to apprentices and employers throughout their years of training. New arrangements will shift the focus from administration to integrated client-centred support, including job matching of potential apprentices and employers; the provision of advice about different training options; personalised mentoring for apprentices identified as needing extra support; guidance to businesses about taking on an apprentice; managing the administration of an apprenticeship, including the training contract; and administering apprenticeship payments and employer incentives.


The coalition believes that the most important difference from Labor's apprenticeship model is that, for both businesses and potential apprentices, the Australian Apprenticeship Support Network will be a one-stop shop, so someone can still go find a chippie and say, 'Are you looking for an apprentice?' but now they can also go to the $200 million a year Australian Apprenticeship Support Network. That network will say: 'I know of a carpenter who's looking for an apprentice. I'll match you up. I will sign you up. I'll make sure that they look after you, and I will manage you and manage any problems that you have during the process.' It is a one-stop shop. The outcome of this is that the person is more likely to complete their training and stay in a job over the long term.


Up until now, apprenticeship centres have not been able to go out and place people in jobs. This will change. The government will actually pay them not only for placing people in apprenticeships but also for keeping them in training so that the apprentice has someone there helping them, mentoring them, looking after all their paperwork, giving them information about a trade support loan, doing all the things that young people need to make sure they finish their apprenticeship.


It is clear that only the coalition has a cross-industry, national approach to reducing youth unemployment, to securing Australia's global competitiveness and to helping create a strong economy.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (10:51):  I thank the shadow minister and member for Kingston for bringing this important matter before us. I think the challenge after they finish school is to try to help young people into employment. There are limited opportunities in many areas. The area that I represent is one of those. It is a very multicultural area, as everyone knows, but it is also an area of significant disadvantage. Regrettably, my area has about a 15 per cent unemployment rate for those between the ages of 15 and 24. These are things that become very important to us on the ground looking at the interest of young people. Therefore, looking at work beyond school becomes critical—and, by the way, is a partnership. It should involve all of us from school, from government agencies and from local business. Everyone has a vested interest in trying to find opportunities for our young people, so this is something we should be doing and working together on.


For this government to turn around and cut almost $2 billion from skills and training and have further cuts projected for the university sector through deregulation—I do not know what has happened in the other states, but in New South Wales I get to see on a pretty regular basis the impact of the cuts the New South Wales Liberal government is making to TAFE—it is little wonder why it is a challenge to get young people into employment. I do not think you need to be a Rhodes scholar to work it out. For young people to find employment opportunities, you must invest in education, and yet what I see is this government doing the exact opposite. The current economic climate would dictate that, with rising unemployment, we invest more, not less in education.


I would like to talk about one organisation in my electorate in south-west Sydney called South West Connect. It specialises in assisting young people transitioning from school into employment. South West Connect, which operates in the Liverpool and Fairfield areas, has positively impacted on the lives of about 7½ thousand young people through 48 partnerships with local business and community groups. The Try a Trade program—or, as it is now called, Seek a Skill—has allowed hundreds of young people of school age to come in and test their skills, basically road testing a possible occupation for their future. This is something that should be encouraged not just in my electorate but across all electorates, particularly in areas experiencing high youth unemployment. The success of these programs is phenomenal.


The two main functions of South West Connect are Partnership Brokers and Youth Connections. Something I would like to talk about in relation to those programs is the Miller Auto Shed, where 180 students, over a period of time, were able to work side by side with various tradesmen. They built up a racing car—or a drag car, at least—and raced it at Eastern Creek. This is something that in my electorate is very important, and I suppose many electorates find this with young males. They wanted to get involved in developing fast cars, as I used to do in my youth. But they actually got hands-on experience in building up a racing car, which I understand—not that I have seen it race—is quite competitive. Of that group who went through, 15 went on to get direct apprenticeships in the industry, whilst another 50 of the students are now working successfully in full-time occupations. So, this changed the position for those children who were at risk. But the important part about it is that they did not leave school at age 15. To get involved in this project and to stay involved in this project they had to commit to stay to year 12, and they did. That is something that changes lives.


Another project I would like to talk a little bit about is the alternative education model partnership. Again, it is facilitated through Job Services Australia and through various providers and local community organisations to help young people engage throughout their secondary education and basically help kids stay at school. These things are changing lives. They do not warrant a $2 million slash and burn by this government if this government is to be serious about youth unemployment.

"Laundy, Craig, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid) (10:56):  I welcome the opportunity to discuss an extremely important policy area and to also discuss how the Abbott government is supporting Australia's youth in their transition into the workforce. The motion rightly raises the importance of getting young people to transition from school—like those who are just leaving the gallery at the moment—into either further education or the workforce. In fact, this government is a great supporter of this transition and has shown through its announcements and policies that we unequivocally recognise the importance of getting young Australians earning or learning. Unfortunately, like so many of the former government's policies, their policies in this area were announced with so much fanfare and were left without the budget for them to continue. In fact, it is a perfect example of why the coalition was elected in 2013 to fix Labor's horrendous record with Australia's budget. Both Youth Connections and Partnership Brokers had no funding beyond 31 December 2014 and on top of that the career development resources had no funding beyond the 2014-15 budget.


Of course, this is just one of many examples, but if those opposite want to continue to put forward motions that demonstrate the hopeless record of their previous government, I will be happy to continue speaking to those motions. But that is not the only thing this motion demonstrates. It shows the dishonesty and hypocrisy of the opposition, and not only with these programs not funded by the previous government. In any case, the Youth Connections program was designed to be taken over by state and territory governments at the end of the National Partnership Agreement on Youth Attainment and Transitions. Similarly, the Partnership Brokers program was designed to have finite funding, with the ultimate goal for the partnership to become self-sustaining—a good idea. For the opposition to now be using these policies as a political tool is opportunism and hypocrisy at its worst.


Separate to the National Partnership Agreement in 2013, there were 72 transition programs funded by state and territory governments that were aimed at improving school attendance and transitioning from school to work. Now, rather than the federal government deeply involving itself in policy areas of the states and territories, this government is focusing on assisting where it will be most effective, and that is by fixing the debt and deficit disaster left behind by the previous government. Our policies are driven at creating economic growth, which will create more jobs for young Australians—especially young Australians. Unlike most of those opposite, I can actually speak from experience when it comes to discussing employment. I spent the majority of my working life on the front lines of Australia's small and family business sector. I can safely assure the member for Kingston and her colleagues that, whilst the government of the day can introduce whatever programs it wants, if business cannot afford to employ people the jobs simply will not be there. I say that again: if business cannot afford to employ people, the jobs simply will not be there.


This government recognises the importance of young people's access to employment opportunities. That is why our policies are directed at increasing economic growth to ensure increasing job opportunities. As we on this side of the House often point out, the government does not create jobs—business does. The best thing government can do to help young Australians find work is to get out of the way of business, cut red tape and get this country's budget back on track. Of course this does not mean that the Commonwealth should step away from supporting young Australians who are looking to find work or further education—far from it. The government's 2014-15 budget is providing funding for a range of initiatives designed to assist young Australians with finding employment—especially following their schooling as they transition to higher education or the workforce. To begin with, the government is investing a record $64.5 billion in government and nongovernment schools. The government has introduced new trade support loans from 1 July 2014. These loans will ease the financial burden on apprenticeships and help increase apprenticeship completion rates. The government has also extended HELP for students studying higher education diploma, advanced diploma and associate degree courses. This will provide pathways for more students to their chosen career.


For those who are unable to find work, the new work for the dole arrangements will help young job seekers as they transition because it will improve their chances. Most importantly, all of these programs are budgeted for, so those who stand to benefit from them can plan their futures. This government will not leave young Australians guessing about the support they receive from the Commonwealth government—unlike the last government.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (11:01):  I have listened with interest to members on the government benches talking about what young people need, I presume in their electorates because their perceptions of what young people need are quite different from those that I have, having spent so much time in my own community. I understand, as members opposite do, that there are people who have started an apprenticeship and need assistance, need support, to continue. I understand that the government is providing $20,000 loans to help them do that. That is one way that the government has chosen to help young people who are already on a path towards work. They have talked about parenting—how you leave it to parents; parents know how to do it. Some parents do, but there are many others who do not and there are young people in my community in families affected by violence or alcohol or just bad parenting who have lost their way. They are not heading towards apprenticeships, which they can then be assisted to finish, they are not heading towards work and they are certainly not heading university—they are on a path to nowhere. They are young people who have lost their way, who are getting in trouble, and many are heading towards homelessness or are already homeless. None of the programs that government members have spoken about—such as moving from school to work programs—apply to them. They are not in school. Good parenting? They do not have it. Assistance in finishing apprenticeships? They are nowhere near an apprenticeship. Assistance in getting into university? They are nowhere near university. These young people are lost and they have no-one to help them find a path back to a good life. They are also on a path to an extremely expensive life for the taxpayer if they end up in crime or are unemployed for long periods. 


It is sensible for governments to involve themselves in finding ways for these young people to find a path back to contributing to society and living good lives. One of the ways the Labor government found was Youth Connections. Youth Connections is incredibly cost-effective. In my community, the cost is about $700,000 a year for Youth Connections through Parramatta, Campbelltown, Bankstown, St George and Liverpool-Fairfield. It is incredibly effective. It assists up to 200 kids—in fact, it is now 215 children—even though it is only funded for 195. It finds young people who have lost their way, and it is voluntary for those young people to get involved in those programs. Sometimes those young people are involved for up to two years. The success rate of Youth Connections is extraordinary. Two years after these young people have found their way into Youth Connections and gone through the program and left, 80 per cent of them are still either studying or in work. These young people are the most vulnerable, most at risk, group in our community and 80 per cent of them are still in work or study two years after they have left the program. That is an extraordinary achievement. I worked it out once based on the entire number—it is about $3,500 per young person. If you only look at the success rate it is a bit more than that, but it is incredibly cost-effective if you are talking about getting young people who are heading towards lives of homelessness and substantial periods of unemployment or crime back onto a path where they contribute to society.


We have heard some extraordinary statements from government members. The member for Lyons said it was the Labor Party that brought down the 2014-15 budget. We are not taking credit for that dud; we are not taking credit for the 2014-15 budget. There is no doubt that what was in the 2014-15 budget was a product of the government—it was the government's budget, not the opposition's budget, and it did not include funding to continue the partnership which had been in place up until the end of 2014. I have no doubt the next speaker will try to make the same point, so I will make this clear. Partnership agreements between state and federal governments are negotiated for a number of years and then towards the end of those partnership agreements they are renegotiated. During the renegotiation phase, because you do not really want to play your hand and you do not want to go out there and say what the figures are, the figures do not have their own budget line for the period beyond the agreement. This is for obvious reasons—it is very similar to a commercial arrangement; you would not suddenly stick 'this is what we are offering you' up in front. You just do not do that. You hold those figures back. There are things, by the way, that are not in the government's budget. Paid parental leave, for example, does not have its own line in the budget but no-one is suggesting that the government has not included it in the budget. (Time expired)

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (11:06):  There are those moments in politics when you ask: what are we doing here? There are those moments when you hope that, before you bring forward a motion, staff in your political office would gather around you and say: 'Don't go there. Don't go and start a debate with the coalition government about a program that you defunded yourself.' But, in fact, no-one gathered around the member for Kingston. No-one gave her that quiet word in the ear that would have made an enormous difference. You remember that sort of eternal silence when the motion finally makes it up to the notice board in the whip's office and nobody wants to speak to it? It is all right; it sits there empty for weeks, and everyone says, 'Don't go there.' Unfortunately, the member for Kingston was not protected by her staff, by her constituents or by those who knew better—and this motion came to parliament today. That is right: the Labor Party is attacking the now coalition government about why we will not rescue, revive and resuscitate a program that they defunded, a program that they cared so little about that in 2012 they only flicked in an extra year of funding—like walking past a beggar and flicking a coin into their bowl. And then come 2013 how committed were they to put it into the forward estimates? It was another one year of funding, with the money running out in December this year. This is the measure of how keen the opposition is in Youth Connections and partnership funding. It is a big fat zero. 


If those opposite had really genuinely cared when they were in government then there would be, as we have said consistently on this side of the chamber, evidence out in the forward estimates—governments think in four-year lots; four years ahead—giving four years of security, certainty and tenure for the people delivering these vital services. There are 450 of them all around this great nation, and 83 programs. But, no, that is not how Labor operate. How Labor operate is that they give a year of extended funding. Of course, you are secure in your job for a year. What sort of security and certainty is that? How can you plan for a family when your funding just trickles in once a year and then in the middle of every year you are wondering: 'Could this be it? Will the guillotine fall?' 


There was no certainty at all given by that Labor government to this program—no passion, no support whatsoever—yet they happen to dig it up now. It reminds me a little bit of my time at a hospital, working in critical care. These government programs are like a patient that we have to continue to support, to keep alive and thriving. We want to make sure that they go on to deliver great things. But what the former Labor government did, as one emergency team handed over to the other, was pull the plug out of the wall, didn't they? They switched off the life support system on Youth Connections, didn't they? And then they snuck out of the building hoping no-one would notice and then they brought this motion in today to criticise the coalition government for not fixing the problem that they created. That's right—they were there on Youth Connections, where they were meant to be, looking after the patient, and they were pulling out the IV drip, switching off the fluid, stopping the blood, booby-trapping the bed and even booking the undertaker! That is what this Labor opposition did and now they have the hide to come in here and move this motion! 


Of course, no-one wanted to speak to this motion on the Labor side. No-one wanted to back that member for Kingston, so we got the nicest people in politics—the member for Reid and the member for Scullion, who are good, kind, well-intentioned people—to come in here and speak on a motion for which they could otherwise find no-one at all to back that member for Kingston. You are good people for coming in here but you have no defence to the basic prime facie case that this program was killed off in 2012, when the Labor government was scurrying around trying to fool voters that they could get back to surplus. The best way to get back to surplus is to hide stuff in the forward estimates. 


I could elaborate on the great stuff that we are doing in training for employment partnerships, the money that is being invested in trade support loans and in basically promoting employers and schools to work together to create the opportunities that we need in the middle. I have often wondered why we need enormous amounts of investment there. SEEK.com has shown us that by providing opportunities rational individuals can go out and find the opportunities they need most. Now there are a small number of individuals for whom that it is not possible. They come from tough family circumstances, with very little guidance and leadership from care givers. They live in tough parts of this country, with parents who are often struggling with mental illness or in and out of incarceration. What we need for those people is properly directed welfare. We need to make sure that that is spent purely on health, education, housing and essential needs. There should also be reciprocal and mutual obligation that they turn up to programs like this, if they want to receive their welfare payment. Of course, no movement was made in that direction by the former Labor government. 


They are a Labor opposition now but when in government they simply measured themselves on how many inputs they made, how much money they could give way. Forget the outcome! It was just about creating more public servants. They never saw a public service job they could not duplicate. They never saw a public service job they could not give to a whole team of them. They were a government that lost their way and this member for Kingston is exactly why we got rid of the Labor government in 2013—and they can stay away for as long as possible!

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"




Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (12:18):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the advisory report on the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014. 




Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).





Mr TEHAN:
  by leave—the committee's inquiry into the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014 has come at a time of heightened concern about the threat of terrorism to Australia and its interests overseas.


The bill implements many of the bipartisan recommendations made by the committee of the previous parliament in its review of possible reforms to Australia's national security legislation.


The recommendations implemented in the bill include:


changes to ASIO's employment framework,


changes to ASIO's warrant based powers, including around computer access warrants and the use of force during the execution of warrants, 


the introduction of a Special Intelligence Operations scheme, 


changes to ASIO's ability to incorporate and share information with other organisations, and


changes affecting the ability of ASIS to collect intelligence on Australians overseas.


The bill also includes a small number of additional measures not previously looked at by the committee. These include an expansion of the secrecy offences applying to employees or other persons in an arrangement with an intelligence agency.


The committee supports the intent of the bill to increase the effectiveness of Australia's intelligence organisations at a time when the threat to our country from terrorism remains high.


While the time frame for the inquiry was short, the committee still received a considerable number of submissions and conducted both public and private hearings. Informed by the evidence, the report has focused on the issues that were of most concern to the committee.


Recent media commentary has included claims that the special intelligence operations framework provided for in the bill could be used to authorise torture by ASIO officers. I should put on the record that the committee received evidence from a range of legal, human rights and civil liberties groups—including the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Australian Lawyers Alliance and the civil liberties councils across Australia—and these groups did not suggest that the bill would enable torture and they did not highlight to the committee any need for torture to be explicitly prohibited in the legislation.


The committee has made 16 recommendations to improve safeguards and strengthen public confidence that the powers extended in the bill cannot be used beyond their legitimate policy intent.


The recommendations include:


clarifying that computer access warrants may only authorise access to a computer network to the extent necessary to collect intelligence on a specified security matter,


reporting requirements relating to the use of force by ASIO officers during the execution of a warrant,


requiring the Attorney-General to approve the commencement, variation or extension of all special intelligence operations,


new notification requirements to support oversight of special intelligence operations by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security,


exemptions from the secrecy offences relating to special intelligence operations for disclosures in the course of legal advice or in complaints to the Inspector-General, and


clarifying that the secrecy offences relating to staff and other entrusted persons of intelligence agencies do not apply to information disclosed to the Inspector-General.


Importantly, the Inspector-General has told the committee she has the authority she needs to oversight the measures in the bill. However, her office needs sufficient resources and expertise to keep abreast with providing the necessary oversight of the intelligence agencies, and the committee has made a recommendation in support of this. The committee has further recommended that the position of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor be filled as soon as practicable. Following consideration of its other recommendations, the committee has recommended that the bill be passed by the parliament.


I wish to thank members of the committee for their constructive and cooperative approach to the inquiry. I am pleased that we were able to reach bipartisan agreement on the issues of contention, and I trust that the committee's report will assist the parliament in its further debate on the bill. On behalf of the committee I sincerely thank those organisations and individuals who made written submissions and appeared at hearings. I particularly thank the Attorney-General's Department and ASIO for their high level of engagement during the inquiry. I would also like to take the opportunity to place on the record my own and the committee's best wishes to Mr David Irvine in his retirement. He has done an outstanding job as Director-General. I would also like to place on record my thanks to the committee secretariat for their help during the reporting of this record. I commend the report to the House.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (13:30):  It is with great alarm that people in my electorate have learned the government is considering exempting live animal exports to Saudi Arabia from the requirements of Australia's exporter supply chain assurance system, or ESCAS. The port of Fremantle handles a significant volume of the live export trade and the people of Fremantle, as well as the people throughout metro and regional Western Australia, are very conscious of the potential for mistreatment and cruelty in an industry that crudely transports millions of animals to a poorly regulated fate. The ESCAS itself is certainly not perfect, but it is the absolute bare minimum that should be required. Unfortunately, this government has no interest in animal welfare. When we talk about trucks and ships packed with animals forced to make long journeys of suffering en route to slaughter in conditions that too often amount to wanton cruelty and torture, this government sees only dollar signs.


Lyn White of Animals Australia has noted:


There are not only no animal welfare laws in Saudi Arabia, there are no animal welfare regulations in their slaughterhouses.


…   …   …


… it is irresponsible that the Abbott government is opening new and risky markets at a time regulations are failing in existing markets and with horrendous consequences for animals.


RSPCA Australia's CEO, Heather Neil, has said:


Giving special consideration and exemptions for one country is a slippery slope back to the horrors we saw in Indonesian abattoirs in 2011—what's to stop others from bullying Australia into the same thing? 


The vast majority of the Australian community want to see animal welfare regulations made stronger and applied rigorously and consistently.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:00):  by leave—Because protecting our people is the first duty of government, it is right that I should update the House on developing challenges to our national security. I acknowledge the commitment of all MPs to keeping our people safe and I especially acknowledge the support the Leader of the Opposition has given the government on this subject. On questions of national security it is always best if government and opposition can stand together, shoulder to shoulder. It lets our enemies know they will never shake our resolve. It is a sign that hope is stronger than fear and that decency can prevail over brute force.


From me and from all ministers in this government there will be three key messages: first, the government will do whatever is possible to keep people safe; second, our security measures at home and abroad are directed against terrorism, not religion; and third, Australians should always live normally because the terrorists' goal is to scare us out of being ourselves. As we all know, there have been major antiterrorist raids across Sydney and Brisbane. Our police and security agencies will always strive to stay at least one step ahead of those who would do us harm and so far, thank God, they have succeeded. I cannot promise that hideous events will never take place on Australian soil, but I can promise that we will never stoop to the level of those who hate us and fight evil with evil.


Regrettably, for some time to come, Australians will have to endure more security than we are used to and more inconvenience than we would like. Regrettably, for some time to come, the delicate balance between freedom and security may have to shift. There may be more restrictions on some so that there can be more protection for others. After all, the most basic freedom of all is the freedom to walk the streets unharmed and to sleep safe in our beds at night.


Creating new offences that are harder to beat on a technicality may be a small price to pay for saving lives and maintaining the social fabric of an open, free and multicultural nation. For more than two years the civil war in Syria, followed by the conquest of much of northern Iraq, has been sucking in misguided and alienated Australians. There are at least 60 Australians that we know of currently fighting with terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, and at least 100 Australians who are supporting them. More than 20 of these foreign fighters have already returned to Australia. As a peaceful and pluralist democracy, we naturally shrink from getting involved in conflicts on the other side of the world, but sometimes these conflicts reach out to us regardless of anything we might do now or have done in the past.


I refuse to call a terrorist movement 'Islamic State' because to do so demeans Islam and mocks the duties a legitimate state bears to its citizens. It can hardly be Islamic to kill without compunction Shias, Yazidis, Turkmen, Kurds, Christians and Sunnis who do not share this death cult's view of the world. Nothing can justify the beheadings, crucifixions, mass executions, ethnic cleansing, rape and sexual slavery that have taken place in every captured town and city. To do such evil, and to revel in doing such evil, is simply unprecedented. To demand the allegiance of Muslims everywhere, and the conversion or subordination of everyone else, is an ultimatum to the entire world.


As we all know, the Middle East is a difficult part of the world where violence is all too common. Indeed, it is a witch's brew of complexity and danger. Nevertheless, it is in the interests of Australia and the world that we here stand ready to join a coalition to help the new Iraqi government to disrupt and degrade the ISIL movement and regain control over its own country. The claim that ISIL's atrocities and threats are a response to something else is an excuse, not a reason. Nothing remotely justifies the mass slaughter of innocents—overwhelmingly Muslims—that the ISIL movement routinely practices. Nothing remotely justifies ISIL's brazen pretension.


It is important to remember that the September 11 attack predated America's involvement in Iraq, just as the first Bali bombing predated Australia's. Groups such as ISIL will cite our involvement—but they would attack us anyway for who we are and how we live, not for anything we have done. It is our acceptance that people can live and worship in the way they choose that bothers them, not our foreign policy.


ISIL kills because it glories in death and because no one has yet been strong enough to stop it. It is ISIL’s success on the battlefield, at least as much as its absolutism, that explains its perverse appeal. Stopping and reversing its advance will help the people of Iraq; it should also reduce its magnetism for people from around the globe who are looking to join a fight.


Last week, together, the Leader of the Opposition and I helped to farewell the Australian force that is ready to join the international coalition against ISIL. Later this week, I will be in New York for discussions at the United Nations which President Obama will chair. Subsequently, the cabinet will again consider the use of our forces to mount air strikes and to provide military advice in support of the Iraqi government.


Last week, the opposition leader and I separately thanked our police and security agencies for their work to disrupt an ISIL plot to conduct demonstration executions here in Australia. For some months, operatives in Syria have been urging their Australian networks to prepare attacks against targets here. An urgent review of the safety of Parliament House has recommended that the Australian Federal Police take control of internal as well as external security. In this building, there will be more armed police, fewer points of access, and more scrutiny of parliamentary passes.


I thank the presiding officers, particularly you, Madam Speaker, for supporting and for beginning to implement these recommendations. They will mean slightly more inconvenience but considerably more protection for everyone involved in our national government. 


Last week, an Australian ISIL operative instructed his followers to pluck people from the street to demonstrate that they could, in his words, 'kill kaffirs'. All that would be needed to conduct such an attack is a knife, a camera-phone and a victim. Consequently, within 36 hours more than 800 police and security agents were deployed in Sydney and more in Brisbane to execute some 30 search warrants. One person has been charged with serious terrorist offences and a large amount of evidence has been amassed that will now carefully be sifted so that further charges might be laid.


It was important to respond with great strength to disrupt this imminent terrorist act. It demonstrates that our determination equals that of those who would do us harm. We will more than match the resolve of our adversaries in all things except malice; because our military, police and security personnel have goodwill towards everyone except those who are plotting to hurt us.


Today, I pledge that our security agencies will have all the resources and authority that they reasonably need. In August, the government committed an additional $630 million to the Australian Federal Police, Customs and Border Protection, the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Office of National Assessments.


Additional ASIO and ASIS officers are being recruited and deployed; biometric screening will start to be introduced at international airports within 12 months; and more Border Force personnel are now being deployed to international airports. Before Christmas, the government will respond to the review of the national security apparatus that is now underway.


Legislation on agency powers is now before the parliament. Legislation to create new terrorist offences and to extend existing powers to monitor or to detain terror suspects will be introduced this week. We cannot prevent from returning home Australians-born-and-bred who have been foreign fighters, however incompatible with our values their conduct has been. Unfortunately, terrorists do not reform just because they have returned home, as the experience with Australians returning from fighting with the Taliban shows.


My unambiguous message to all Australians who fight with terrorist groups is that you will be arrested, prosecuted and jailed for a very long time; and that our laws are being changed to make it easier to keep potential terrorists off our streets. For one thing, it will be an offence to be in a designated area, for example Raqqa in Syria, without a good reason. The only safe place for those who have been brutalised and militarised by fighting with terrorists is inside a maximum security prison.


As well, legislation requiring telecommunications providers to keep the metadata they already create, and to continue to make it available to police and security agencies, will be introduced soon. If the police and security agencies can make a case for more resources and for more powers, the government’s strong disposition is to provide them because it is rightly expected of us in this place that we will do whatever we possibly can to keep people safe. Of course, any such powers would be exercised responsibly, under the watch of the Inspector-General for Intelligence and Security, the Ombudsman, and the joint standing committees of this parliament.


These are troubling times for everyone accustomed to think that terrorism happens in places other than Australia or that history has largely overtaken the use of military force. Our Australian instinct to assume the best of everyone and our tendency to imagine that we live in the best of all possible worlds is being challenged as rarely before. Still, even in what seem darkening times, I am sure that we will not lose our perspective, and will continue to keep things in proportion. Whatever happens, Australia should remain a country where people trust each other, welcome newcomers and are justifiably confident that in most respects our future will be even better than our past. Our country must remain a beacon of hope and optimism that shines around the world.


If, in the weeks and months ahead, Australians come to appreciate and savour our unity as much as our diversity, we will emerge stronger from these difficulties. Even in these times there are grounds for hope in the overwhelming support of Australian Muslims for strong measures against terrorism, and in the coalition of Middle Eastern countries now assembling to support the Iraqi government against the ISIL death cult. With our own Grand Mufti, nearly all Australian Muslims believe that ISIL is committing crimes against humanity and sins against God.


It may be too much to expect that everyone everywhere might finally accept that every single human being has the same inherent rights and dignities. It may be too much to expect that everyone everywhere might finally subscribe to the principle—treat others as you would have them treat you. But it is not too much, surely, to expect that our world might finally and fully grasp that it is never right to kill people because they have a different view of God. Killing in the name of God is never right. Mistreating others in the name of God is never right. And if the all but universal revulsion towards the ISIL horror has this result, good might finally emerge despite the pointless death and dislocation that confronts us now.

Last Thursday at RAAF Base Williamtown and RAAF Base Amberley, the Prime Minister and I together farewelled some of the brave men and women of the Australian Defence Force who were leaving for the Middle East. That is as it should be—keeping our people safe is above politics. The security of our nation runs deeper than our political differences. We all admire the courage and dedication of the Australian Defence forces, and we are all committed to supporting the families of those serving overseas. As I did last Thursday, again I promise those serving overseas and those due to be rotated to service overseas that the parliament will stand by your families whilst you are far away.


Labor fully supports Australia's contribution to the international humanitarian mission to Iraq. We do not offer this lightly. Sending Australians into harm's way is the most serious of decisions. Our support for the government on this issue is not a matter of jingoism or nationalism; it is a calculation of conscience and national interest. There are four key principles that underpin Labor's approach: firstly, we have indicated that we do not support the deployment of ground combat units to directly engage in fighting ISIL; secondly, that Australian operations should be confined to the territory of Iraq; thirdly, our involvement should continue only until the Iraqi government is in a position to take full responsibility for the security of its nation and its people; and, fourthly, if the Iraqi government and its forces engage in unacceptable conduct or adopt unacceptable policies then we should withdraw our support. These four principles will guide our response to the evolving situation in Iraq. They represent the conditions that we have set for our support and the line that we have drawn for Australia's engagement in the region. Again, this is consistent with the government's approach. We do want our Australian military personnel to carry out a clearly defined mission in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government and then come home safely.


Military involvement to achieve humanitarian objectives is not our first instinct and it is never our preferred solution to geopolitical problems, but we recognise that sometimes there is simply no alternative. To put it plainly: we cannot negotiate with ISIL, because there is nothing rational about what they seek to do. ISIL and their like wish only to do harm, to spread the bitter hatred that fuels their genocidal intent. They are a breeding ground for terrorists bent on causing havoc not only in the Middle East but also throughout the world, in a Australia and our neighbouring countries. They are intent only upon desecration and violence with an insatiable appetite for crime and sectarian destruction. Right now across northern Iraq families are being driven from their homes, innocent people are being murdered and women and girls are being oppressed, raped and forced into sexual servitude. The vulnerable communities of Iraq must be protected, and it is right and proper for Australia to make a contribution to this international endeavour.


Let us be clear about the differences between the situation in Iraq today and the conflict that Labor opposed in 2003. The 2003 war was based on a flawed premise and false information. It was a war embarked upon without a meaningful plan to win the peace. In part, it created some of the conditions that have necessitated this international response. It was a war against a hostile Iraqi government without the support of the United Nations and the international community and, as Labor said at that time, the foundations for possible military intervention were simply not there.


However, today the democratically elected national unity government of Iraq is seeking help from the international community to protect its people from genocide and other mass atrocities. Today we are part of an international effort that includes countries from the region, as the Prime Minister has said. We are fulfilling our responsibility as a good international citizen and our duty as a humanitarian peace-loving nation. By our involvement Australia declares that we will not tolerate the spread of hatred. We will not allow the contagion of hatred—the disease of fanaticism and extremism—to afflict the innocent. We will not meet the brutality and ruthlessness of ISIL with silence.


But we face a long and difficult task. Labor understands that we can never drain the swamp of terrorism by military means alone. Defeating jihadist terrorism requires extensive international corporation in intelligence sharing and criminal law enforcement, and strong domestic homeland security—measures backed by strong community support. We go to Iraq not to topple a dictator but to support democracy; to exercise our global responsibility to protect men, women and children at risk of mass atrocity crimes. Our mission is not to pursue territory but to protect the vulnerable. Our goal is not to assert the supremacy of one faith or to advance the interests of one people; it is to defend the rights of all people to preserve the freedom of all faiths.


Ultimately, building enduring peace in Iraq depends upon the people of Iraq. No matter the size of the coalition our involvement cannot by itself guarantee the stability of this region. If freedom and democracy are artificially imposed from the outside they will not last. Above all, a stable Iraq depends upon an inclusive, unity government: a government that rejects sectarianism and the alienation of minorities; a government able to move past ancient hatreds and unite the nation.


Helping the Iraqi government protect its citizens from the threat of ISIL is vital to the long-term security and stability of Iraq, the broader region and the international community, including Australia. The humanitarian assistance we offer should not be confined to military aid. As a safe and prosperous nation made great by immigration, Australia should take more refugees from Iraq and Syria. We should reach out a caring arm to people who have been traumatised by this brutal conflict. For more than two centuries we have given those who come across the seas a second chance. We should be part of an international effort to offer safety and security to vulnerable people who have been displaced by the ravages of this conflict.


These are uncertain times and that uncertainty can breed suspicion. That is always the insidious goal of terrorism: to spread division and to nurture intolerance; to create a world where people fear the unknown and resent difference. They want to change the way we live, the way we see ourselves and the way we treat each other. We cannot allow this. Prejudice and bigotry jeopardise the harmony of our society and they feed the fanaticism that they thrive on. We must jealously guard our diverse, tolerant, welcoming and caring society.


Multiculturalism is one of our nation's greatest gifts. It is a miracle of modern Australia. We should never make the millions of Australians who have become Australians—people from every nation and from every faith—feel less safe or less welcome. We will not overcome hatred with hatred. We will not overcome intolerance by being intolerant. Ill-informed and inflammatory comments about Islam are as unhelpful as they are unfair. Muslim Australians should not be stigmatised for the crimes of ISIL. And ISIL has no right to use the name of Islam. The medieval barbarity that it is inflicting upon the innocent has no part of religion. The twisted aetiology of ISIL bears no relation to a faith of peace and tolerance followed by millions of people. That point should be made time and time again.


Labor will study the government's new security legislation in detail. And we will continue to be constructive, because the safety of the people of our nation is a priority that unites us all. Like the Prime Minister, I clearly reject the assumption that our engagement in Iraq has made us more of a target. I accept, however, that Australia must always be vigilant in the face of extremist threats. A very few Australians, poisoned by fanaticism, travelling to this war zone with the intention of participating in this conflict, do represent a threat to our national security. We will give the legislation that addresses the problem of these foreign fighters the careful consideration it deserves. Labor believes that our security agencies and national institutions should have the powers and resources they need to keep Australians safe from the threat of terrorism.


We also believe in safeguarding fundamental democratic freedoms. We must ensure that in legislating to protect our national security that parliament is careful not to damage the very qualities and liberties that we are seeking to defend from terrorist threat. As we work through the government's legislation, Labor will continue to ensure that the national security imperatives are appropriately balanced with the importance of protecting our democratic freedoms. Parliamentary scrutiny and oversight of these proposals is essential. I welcome the intelligence and security committee's recommendations to improve the first bill dealing with the national security law reform, which is due to be debated in the other place this week. I thank the government for accepting the committee's 17 recommendations to improve scrutiny and oversight of that legislation. I know that this constructive approach will be maintained as we finalise this bill and deal with further national security legislation.


All Australians were shocked by the events of last week; shocked by the closeness of a threat that is often seen as remote; shocked at the thought of the scenes from the towns of northern Iraq and Syria being played out in our streets. We do take a certain comfort in our distance from other parts of the world but we should also take comfort from the success of our security agencies. Their professionalism and their expertise helps keep Australians safe. Their response to these threats has been swift and sure. Our police and our intelligence agencies are more committed and better equipped than the people who would seek to threaten our way of life. This should reassure us. This should give Australians the confidence to enjoy their lives without anxiety.


Australians will not be intimidated by the threat of terrorism. We will be true to ourselves. Australians never give in to fear; we will not start now. We do not back down to threats. Whenever we are challenged, we prevail. Our values of peace, tolerance and love will overcome hatred. They always have; they always will.

"Whiteley, Brett, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (15:15):  Given I had only a short amount of time earlier, I will recommence my speech. Of all the many policies that governments are called to deal with, those dealing with the lives and the welfare of children, as the most vulnerable group in our society, must surely be the most important. Children everywhere deserve a safe and secure home environment. However, it is the sad reality that in some countries, for a range of complex social, cultural or economic reasons, there are children unable to be cared for by their parents, extended families or anyone else and who have no possibility of growing up in a family environment in their country of birth. For some of these children, intercountry adoption might be the only way in which they can have the opportunity to be part of a secure and loving family and to have a chance at a better life.


Intercountry adoption is a complex and sensitive matter for all parties concerned, and a decision to remove a child from its country of birth and possibly, in some instances, from its birth parents is not one that the Australian government believes should ever be taken lightly. Nevertheless, we support international adoption arrangements made under the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, which have established safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and also that eligible, caring families in Australia and elsewhere have the opportunity to adopt an overseas born child and provide that child with a family, a home and a future that he or she might never otherwise have had.


Unfortunately, for too long now significant barriers have faced Australian families wanting to adopt from overseas. Inconsistent rules, high costs and lengthy waiting periods are common—so much so that they have been found to deter many people who would have liked to adopt a child from even starting the adoption process. In recognising that the processes required in bringing together those children from overseas who legitimately need a safe and loving home with those Australians who dream of providing one have been overburdened with inconsistency and complex red tape, the Prime Minister announced in December of last year that the government would simplify overseas adoption by the end of this year. At this point, I want to recognise the personal commitment to this issue made by our Prime Minister. By removing those bureaucratic requirements and delays which serve little real purpose and benefit no-one but simply add to the complexity and cost faced by adopting families, the government wants to make it easier to adopt when such action is clearly agreed by all parties to be in the best interests of the child.


Australia's overarching requirement for any potential partner-country willing to participate in intercountry adoption arrangements with us is that the country essentially meet ethical and legal framework standards and safeguards equivalent to those required under the Hague convention to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child. In those cases where a country is not a signatory to the convention but is seen to satisfactorily meet convention standards, we see no reason why adoptions in that country should not be recognised in the same way as adoptions in convention countries. The changes proposed in this bill will, therefore, place children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral arrangements in the same position as those adopted under Hague convention arrangements—that is, they will be able to travel to Australia with their new families as Australian citizens on an Australian passport.


Seeking as it does to reform the current procedural requirements and reduce unnecessary red tape, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014 is a positive step forward in delivering the government's promise. The key feature of the bill is an amendment which expands the scope of the existing Hague convention provisions so as to include adoptions in accordance with bilateral arrangements. The decision-making framework remains the same. The amendments made by the bill will apply for the benefit of all children adopted under bilateral arrangements, whether the adoption was finalised before or after the amendments come into force.


The government has clearly been delivering on its commitment to improve adoption procedures in other ways. A report by senior officials on options to reform overseas adoption, which was informed by public submissions, has been considered. Improvements have already been announced to the process for families adopting children from Taiwan and South Korea, and a new overseas adoption program with South Africa has commenced—and there are a further seven new programs in the pipeline. COAG has agreed in principle to a new national overseas adoption service from 2015, and options to reduce waiting times for visas for adoptive children from overseas are being developed. In addition, the government will introduce amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act so that obtaining Australian citizenship can happen in a child's country of origin as well as to address processing problems associated with the visa system.


The Abbott government is clearly committed to adoption reform to enable more Australians who wish to adopt a child from overseas to achieve this wonderful outcome. Bringing together a child in need of a home, particularly a special needs child, as children of intercountry adoption so frequently are, with those who wish to offer a safe and loving family is something that should be managed as sensitively and with as little unnecessary red tape as possible. Potential adopting parents are required to go through an extremely complex and robust vetting process—and rightly so—but should not have to deal with any more red tape than is absolutely necessary. I strongly support this bill and commend it to the House.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (15:22):  Children are such a natural part of marriage and life partnerships. They are such a natural function of the biology of life and, for most, a natural and fairly easy process. There is no slight intended to women who face the not insignificant challenges of pregnancy and childbirth meant there. The basis of the family is the key pillar of our society and cannot be overstated. But for some, it is just not easy. Having children is not a straightforward affair and it can be a heartbreaking and demoralising experience when close friends and family start and complete their families and couples are left behind, because—despite every effort—they cannot have children.


This bill is about inter-country adoption, but I would briefly like to touch on local adoption. Australia is undoubtedly scarred by the experience of the Stolen Generation. I will not go back over the history of that experience, the motivations behind it and mixed outcomes it provided. The long-term result is that local adoption has fallen well out of favour. However, with the tragedy of totally dysfunctional parents and the revolving door of foster placements—and God bless those wonderful people who selflessly devote themselves to foster parenting—I fear Australian family law courts are not making the best long-term decisions for at least some of the children.


Is it not possible, even highly likely, that a child removed from serial parental failure and moved in and out of foster homes would not have a far greater chance at life if the responsible agencies and courts were simply to make the decision that—where the child's current circumstances are intolerable and the likelihood of that situation improving substantially are remote—they would be far better off with parents that will love, cherish and nurture the individual? It seems to me our family court system and agencies are haunted by the past and that collectively we are not bold enough to make the right long-term decisions.


It is also worthwhile reflecting also that in the 2012-13 financial year, Australia spent $237 million on assisted reproductive technology through the Medicare system. There is no cap on the number of treatments nor is there any age restriction. I am not suggesting for one minute that couples with fertility issues should not avail themselves of this service, but we do know as each cycle fails the chances of a successful pregnancy with further treatment reduces. Perhaps if more viable alternatives existed—and in this case we are talking about adoption—and perhaps if it were easier to adopt, couples who are desperate to have families may well choose to abandon the IVF programs earlier and follow the path of adoption.


To return to this bill, which refers to international adoption: I was recently contacted by Tanya Fry, a 39-year-old teacher. It is so typical, really. Her and her husband have run the full gauntlet, first from the decisions to have a family, to the initial disappointment of not easily getting pregnant, to the long-term sadness of that failure, to the seeking of help and to the fertility and IVF roller coaster. Nothing is easy, personal or particularly private about the process. Then in their late 30s, Tanya and her husband realised that they would not be able to have their own biological baby and decided that perhaps adoption would be the best option.


I would like to read a few paragraphs from a letter that Tanya has penned for me. This starts in the middle of the letter:


Our main concern is the time it may now take to adopt from overseas (as it is near impossible to adopt within Australia). My husband and I are approaching our 40s and are concerned that the process is going to take so long that we will run out of time. There are significant amounts of people in the same situation as us and it is Important to note how stressful this process is. Couples including ourselves have generally been through significant infertility challenges before making the decision to adopt (in our case recurrent miscarriage). It is really important to us that the timeline suggested for this restructuring is followed so that we are not put through additional stress.


The application is quite a difficult one to fill out.


That is, the application for inter-country adoption.


My main concerns are with the BMI question, my husband has a very muscular build and is not overweight yet his BMI is over what is required (only slightly). It seems ridiculous that someone so fit and healthy could be rejected because of his build.


While watching television I become increasingly upset seeing adverts asking for money to help children/orphans overseas who have nothing. I don't understand how there can be so many children in the world who need parents and why it is so hard to adopt a child. My husband and I are both on good incomes and have the means and ability to raise a child without any assistance. We would be outstanding parents so why is it all so hard!


That is not the end of the letter, but I will end that quote there.


I do not know the prospective parents that well, but I did meet Tanya for the first time the week before last. I am pretty confident that a couple who have tried so hard are likely to be good parents. They have good jobs, a home and commitment. They have already proved far more than most of us are ever asked to do. When we are people who are lucky to be able to raise our own children, we do not get asked how heavy we are. We do not get asked intrusive questions. We just start families. Most of us do a pretty fair fist of actually becoming good parents. What criteria is that to judge people on? We are not even counselled before we start a biological family. It just makes me wonder what we are doing and why we make it so difficult to adopt from overseas.


Then there was the news for Tanya and her husband that the application going okay, but they might have to wait five to seven years. I know adoption is not for all parents and its main emphasis should be on the children, but it is hard to believe—with all the children in the world living in poverty with no family or at least no functioning family and living without education—that we cannot find a way to bring these two needy parties together and that we cannot find a way so that a needy child can live a life of relative privilege in Australia with successful people who could be their loving and compassionate parents if they were only given the chance.


While I recognise that for a number of reasons inter-country adoptions have declined across the globe, it is very concerning to me that Australians were able to adopt just 129 children last year. That is a very small number. It is a small number of the tens of thousands of available children in the world who could have a life of comparative privilege and it is a very small number of the desperate potential parents who are given the opportunity to have what so many of us take for granted—a family.


I know the world is not a perfect place and there will always be those who take advantage of others. We must be ever vigilant so Australian adoptions are never associated with events that could possibly be construed as trafficking. That is why Australia should form adoption programs only with countries or third parties that meet the criteria of the Hague convention. I congratulate the government on taking the initiative of opening a new program with South Africa and making improvements to the process with South Korea and Taiwan. I am also very pleased that COAG have endorsed the move to a national agency to facilitate international adoption to help speed up the granting of suitable visas. It makes sense to have a national desk—after all, migration is a national responsibility and our government-to-government relationships are at this level.


This bill will allow the granting of citizenship as soon as adoption is verified, enabling the newly adopted children to travel with their parents on an Australian passport. It will not suddenly make overseas adoption easy—and I hope there is more we can do in that space—but it is a significant step in the right direction. I hope we can do more in this area and complete the lives of Tanya and her husband and many others like them around Australia and really improve the opportunities of the children that they might adopt.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (15:31):  I am very pleased to be speaking on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014. The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the granting of Australian citizenship to children who have been adopted by Australian citizens under the bilateral adoption arrangements between Australia and countries that are not party to the Hague convention on intercountry adoption. As the Prime Minister said in the House on 29 May this year, policy reform and progress on intercountry adopting has been in the too-hard basket for far too long and simply because of red tape.


This bill has at its very heart a humanitarian focus that looks to remove the unnecessary red tape that gets in the way of children from around the world who have no parents or no effective parents being able to have a much better life in Australia. When you look at the state of the world at the moment, with the rise of mindless terror and vicious international criminal conduct, it is imperative that all of us do all we can to remove the barriers for entry for these children. That is absolutely clear. To this end I find it more gratifying that the policy focus of the bill in removing red tape for these children to have a safe and loving home in this country is not just a symbolic gesture but very real. It will produce outcomes that will make very positive and tangible differences to the lives of so many children around the world.


Earlier Madam Speaker was in the chair. I want to pay tribute to her and the work she and her committee did many years ago in this area. Too often in the past seven years the people of Australia have had their expectations falsely built up by symbolic actions with no substance behind them, but this bill is different because this government is different. Indeed, this promise was made by the Prime Minister in December last year when he committed to reforming overseas adoptions by the end of 2014.


To this end, on 19 December last year Prime Minister Abbott announced that he would establish the Interdepartmental Committee on Intercountry Adoption to consider options for reform and to improve intercountry adoption processes. There were a total of 108 submissions. Twenty-six were from organisations and the remainder came from individuals representing adult adoptees, adoptive and prospective parents, academics and individuals with a professional interest in intercountry adoption, and parents and children who are now adults deeply affected by past practices of forced adoptions. In addition, the Prime Minister received 60 items of correspondence on intercountry adoption reform.


Submissions made to the interdepartmental committee expressed a significant level of frustration with Australia's current approach to intercountry adoption. The particular issues raised were the Commonwealth's approach to selecting intercountry adoption partner countries, the quality of the states and territories' administration and level of support provided to prospective adoptive parents, the cost, the waiting times, the uncertainty of outcomes not only overseas but also within Australia, and the standard of postadoption support services. There were other criticisms that related to the current Commonwealth-state model of regulating intercountry adoption and the lack of nationally consistent laws, policy and procedures. That made it really difficult for families who had moved interstate and across territories to receive consistent and predictable levels of support. It also made it very difficult to provide consistent outcomes across Australia.


Taken as a whole these frustrations can represent significant impediments to Australians considering intercountry adoption. Given the frustrating history, the interdepartmental committee itself stressed that there is an imperative to be clear about the impact that any reforms are likely to have on these impediments to ensure expectations of families are realistic with regard to the future of intercountry adoption in Australia and to make clear that in many cases they will go towards improving the experience of people participating in intercountry adoption rather than making a dramatic change in the rate of adoptions.


It should also be noted that 24 of the submissions made to the committee did not support intercountry adoption and highlighted concerns with the safeguards in place to protect parents and children from unlawful practices and the effects on children growing up outside their culture. Such concerns were acknowledged up-front by the Prime Minister in his second reading speech, when he said:


We do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past, but we do want to remove the red tape and reduce the delays—that do not benefit anyone.


The interdepartmental committee noted that Australia is committed to ensuring that all parties to intercountry adoption arrangements are protected from exploitation and abuses. These vulnerable parties clearly include children and birth families, where a child has been relinquished, and the prospective adoptive parents. It should not automatically be assumed that the interests of these parties are necessarily in conflict. The interdepartmental committee addressed these concerns quite directly on page 8 of its report when it states that:


Greater efficiency in the process, so long as it does not come at the expense of thoroughness, may remove some of the frustrations experienced by prospective adoptive parents, while also reducing the amount of time spent by children in institutions. Australia's approach to adoption recognises that children who cannot be brought up with their family are entitled to grow up in a permanent, secure and loving family environment. A more efficient intercountry adoption system would be better able to provide children with this environment in a timely fashion.


Australia's current regulatory approach observes the international principles guiding intercountry adoption which is set out in the 1993 Hague Convention on the protection of children and cooperation in respect of intercountry adoption.


The fundamental principles in the Convention are: (1) the best interests principle that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all Convention intercountry adoptions; (2) the subsidiarity principle that adoption is subsidiary to care by family, and intercountry adoption is subsidiary to domestic adoption; (3) the safeguards principle that safeguards must be developed to prevent the abduction, sale of, and traffic in children; (4) the cooperation principle that authorities must establish and maintain effective cooperation to ensure that these safeguards are effectively maintained; and (5) the competent authorities principle that only competent authorities—appointed in each country—should be permitted to authorise intercountry adoptions.


For the purposes of the Hague Convention, the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department is the Australian central authority for intercountry adoption. The states and territories are also central authorities under the Hague Convention. However, owing to the lack of political impetus from the Commonwealth, states and territories and the complexity of amending state and territory legislation that relates to both intercountry and domestic adoption, this work has not been progressed, despite many attempts. This is not an acceptable situation. As the Prime Minister said on 5 May this year:


For too long children who legitimately need a safe and loving home and Australians who dream of providing this home have been hindered by red tape and confusion. The Government is pleased to be able to undertake real action to bring families together.


Consistent with these goals, the government has been moving ahead in progressing this issue.


Apart from the Prime Minister's commissioning of the Interdepartmental Committee on Intercountry Adoption report, the government has also put in place amendments to the Family Law regulations that will make it easier to recognise adoptions from Taiwan and South Korea. We have also opened a new overseas adoption program with South Africa; we have instructed officials to commence discussions with seven other countries about possible new overseas adoption programs; we have chaired a COAG meeting which agreed in principle to the Commonwealth providing a new national overseas adoption service from 2015. We have introduced amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to make it easier for children from Taiwan and South Korea to obtain Australian citizenship in their country of origin; and have asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to develop options to reduce waiting times for visas for adoptive children from overseas. The government is now working through the details of the new reforms with the states so that the new approach to overseas adoption can commence as early as 2015.


The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the grant of Australian citizenship to children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral adoption arrangements between Australia and countries that are not party to the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption. Under such bilateral arrangements, Australian citizens have for several years been unable to adopt children from South Korea, Taiwan and Ethiopia. Although the intercountry adoption program with Ethiopia is now closed, there are a number of families who are awaiting the finalisation of their adoptions. 


At present, children adopted under bilateral arrangements require a passport from the home country and an Australian adoption visa to travel to Australia. This imposes additional complexity and cost on the adopting families. Under the amendments to be made by this bill, children will be able to be granted citizenship as soon as the adoption is finalised. They will then be able to travel to Australia on Australian passports with their new families as Australian citizens. The bill will place children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral arrangements in the same position as children adopted by Australian citizens under Hague Convention arrangements.


The overarching requirement from Australia's perspective that a potential partner country is, first, willing participate in intercountry adoption arrangement with Australia, and, second, will meet the standards in safeguards equivalent to those required under the Hague Convention. Where a non-convention country meets these standards, there is no reason why adoptions should not be recognised in the same way as adoptions in convention countries. The government has recently given effect to this principle by amending the Family Law (Bilateral Arrangements—Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998 to provide for automatic recognition of adoptions in partner countries once the adoption is finalised and an adoption compliance certificate has been issued. And in this regard, the bill enhances the wellbeing of adopted children by creating a more streamlined and cost-effective process which allows them to commence their lives in Australia more quickly.


The bill will not change post-adoption support arrangements, which are provided by state and territory governments in accordance with their respective laws. While the laws and procedures may vary in some respects between states and territories, support services are provided to adopted children and their families on an identical basis whether the adoption took place under the Hague Convention or under bilateral arrangements. Children adopted from Hague Convention countries, which issue adoption compliance certificates, are already able to obtain Australia citizenship as soon as the adoption is finalised. This has been the case since the enactment of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007. The adoption compliance certificate provides assurance that the adoption has been carried out in accordance with the ethical and legal framework required by the Hague Convention. The process for adoption under bilateral arrangements, including automatic recognition under Australian law, is in substance identical. There is no reason why those children should be treated differently under the Australian Citizenship Act.


The key feature of the bill is an amendment to subdivision AA of division 2 of part 2 of the act. The amendment simply expands the scope of the existing Hague Convention provisions, so that they also cover adoptions in accordance with bilateral arrangements. There are many important safeguards that the government has built into this legislation. These would be relevant, clearly, if fraud or some other irregularity came to light before citizenship was granted. Similarly, the minister must not approve a child becoming a citizen if the minister is not satisfied of the identity of the child. The amendments proposed by the bill would apply for the benefit of all children adopted under bilateral arrangements, whether the adoption is finalised before or after the amendments come into force.


The government is realistic: this bill is not a magic bullet to solve all of the problems associated with intercountry adoption that have existed for decades, but it is an important and substantial step forward, and the bill gives hope to families. It gives hope to children without parents, where no hope previously existed. It is through actions such as these that we show our humanity—where we can demonstrate that we are not prepared to accept the status quo that presently values bureaucracy and red tape over the welfare of children. Never can such a situation be acceptable. We as a parliament must reject it. As I said earlier, there has never been a more important time for legislation of this kind to be put before the House—so that we as a nation can demonstrate to those who inflict hatred and fear upon the world that Australia offers hope and love to those who deserve a better life. There can be no more deserving recipients than children with no parents. I commend the bill to the House.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (15:46):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I speak today for the government's Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014. Last year, the Prime Minister announced that the government would improve overseas adoption by the end of 2014. The government has been delivering on that commitment. There are three categories which well express the foundations of this amendment. These categories are historical, personal—personal in a constituency sense, and humanitarian. These are separate categories, but they are inextricably intertwined.


Intercountry adoption was first practised widely by the United States as a humanitarian response to the situation of European children from Germany, Italy and Greece, orphaned by World War II. In the 1950s, children similarly orphaned or abandoned during the Korean War were adopted by families in the US and in Europe, and intercountry adoption extended to Vietnam in the 1960s, following the Vietnam War. It was not until the Vietnam War that intercountry adoption was practised in significant numbers by Australian families. Subsequently, as interest in intercountry adoption increased, adoptive parent groups established during the Vietnam War began to extend their operations to other Asian countries.


In 2005, Bronwyn Bishop MP was Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, and launched that committee's report titled Overseas Adoption in Australia. Two key findings of the 2005 report were: that Australia's per capita rate of adoptions from overseas was less than one-third the rate of most First World countries; and that the Commonwealth, rather than the states and territories, should establish and manage new programs with overseas countries. Furthermore, the 2005 report found that fees in some states were too high, and that rules were needlessly harsh. One Australian state used a Body Mass Index to determine those parents who might be too fat to adopt. Another state required prospective adoptive parents to be fingerprinted. There was also a range of signals from state authorities demonstrating that they did not want people to adopt from overseas. When discussing submissions and evidence received by the 2005 committee, the Chairman also noted that, 'Adoption officials have a great deal of power over adoptive parents. Some parents declined to give evidence because they were afraid it might jeopardise their chances of a successful application.' This is unconscionable behaviour on the part of public servants: putting their personal or professional prejudices—wishes—before the very reasonable and understandable longing of parents wishing to adopt. The Chairman of the 2005 committee added: 'In the area of intercountry adoption, ministers and their departments have been unaccountable for too long. The committee is pleased to redress the balance.'


In June 2008, the responsibilities of the Commonwealth government and of the state and territory governments were set out in the Commonwealth-State Agreement for the Continued Operation of Australia's lntercountry Adoption Programme. This demonstrated that good intentions prevailed, though—sadly—actual practice lagged behind. Finally, in December 2013, our Prime Minister announced that he would establish a committee to report to him in 2014 with options for implementing reform within Australia over the next 12 months to improve intercountry adoption. The committee was chaired by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. It had senior representatives from the Attorney-General's Department, DFAT, the Department of Immigration, and the Department of Social Services. In April 2014, the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Intercountry Adoption was completed and tabled. One clear term of reference was: 'immediate steps that could be taken for improving and streamlining the delivery of intercountry adoptions to make intercountry adoption easier and faster for Australian couples'. The 2014 report provides both immediate and longer term options for reform. It noted also that the short-term reforms, in and of themselves, are unlikely to see a significant change in the numbers of adoptions. However, they may assist in reducing some of the frustrations that are experienced in Australia.


The Prime Minister noted in May, during the second reading debate for this bill, that he would not pretend that everything was going to be simple and straightforward immediately. However, he did say that this bill will provide 'significant new hope for parents without children, and significant new hope for children without parents'.


With regard to parents, I now address the personal side to my support for this amendment. A constituent of mine, Ms Jo Ellem, contacted me in March this year. In April, I met with Ms Ellem and her husband in my office and heard their story. It took them five years to bring their first child home, and they have now been waiting seven years to adopt their second child. 


During the 2005 parliamentary inquiry, Ms Ellem was invited to present to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, chaired by the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop MP. The Hon. Julia Irwin MP was deputy chair of the committee. In her covering letter to the report, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop MP referred to the diligent and enthusiastic support of her colleagues on the committee, making special mention of two Labor party committee members, her deputy chair, the Hon. Julia Irwin MP, and the Hon. Harry Quick MP. It should be noted that there was no dissenting report to the committee's report.


Despite the committee's agreement and its bipartisan nature, it is Ms Ellem's belief that the findings of that report are still to be addressed. However, Ms Ellem was much heartened by the Prime Minister's statements regarding intercountry adoptions just two days before she contacted me, and she sought my assistance to get her message to him. According to Ms Ellem, most of the nine programs available for Australian couples to adopt are barely functioning, and they all have long waiting times. She and her husband have been told that there is no end in sight. Nevertheless, they continue to explore all options. 


Ms Ellem found out about a new program for the adoption of mixed race children being run in Japan. Ms Ellem called Family and Community Services New South Wales—FACS—and asked them if they would ring the intercountry adoptions branch in Canberra to pursue the adoption of mixed race children from Japan. I regret to inform the House that Family and Community Services New South Wales refused to even call the intercountry adoptions branch in Canberra. Ms Ellem was told that, even if they did call and even if the Canberra branch said that FACS New South Wales could decide whether this should happen, FACS would refuse to do so. Rather, FACS New South Wales told my constituents that they should look at existing programs in Thailand and the Philippines. Both these countries have waiting periods of four to five years, or even longer. FACS New South Wales told my constituents that it did not have the resources to do otherwise. This was greeted with incredulity by Ms Ellem. 


She and her husband have paid a great deal of money to FACS for their adoptions. They do not object to the not inconsiderable fees, but they do object to the fact that their monies appear not to be used as they would or should have been. As already noted, their second adoption has been going on for seven years, and there have been further fees paid for what clearly is little or no facilitation or progress.


As her elected representative, I made formal representations to the Prime Minister, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to the Attorney-General. Later, I was very pleased to receive an email from Ms Ellem telling me that she had received a telephone call from the Prime Minister's office. Senator Brandis's office had also contacted her. She also had a meeting with the Prime Minister's senior policy advisor on social affairs and has had further communications with the Prime Minister's chief of staff. I am proud to point out that this is a government that, from the Prime Minister down, takes action, seizes the initiative and puts the interests of Australians first.


Finally, there is a humanitarian side to this bill. The history of intercountry adoption is humanitarian—the generous, enlightened and humane response of the United States and of European countries from the 1940s through to the Vietnam War, at which time Australia became more involved, and on to the present day. We pride ourselves as a nation on our enlightened generosity, our charity and our compassion, and we will continue to pursue a humane response to this matter.


MPs involved in the various committees were deeply moved by their experiences during the various inquiries. Their feelings were moved on a number of levels. During the 2005 inquiry, Labor MP Harry Quick said he was deeply moved by his visit to a Chinese orphanage—and understandably so. However, he was also upset that some parents here in Australia felt afraid to give evidence in public in case their chance of a successful application to adopt was harmed. He was quoted as saying:


It is disappointing that we have six states and two territories that are thwarting parents … when there are literally thousands and thousands of young children … who can be placed in loving families, supported far better than they are wandering the streets of countless cities right across the world.


By 2005 Australia's per capita rate of adoptions from overseas was less than one-third the rate of most first world economies. In Australia in 2004, there were 434 intercountry adoptions. In 2010, this number had dropped to 222—a 60 per cent fall. This decline has continued in Australia, with only 129 intercountry adoptions in 2012-2013. This is hardly a magnanimous, charitable and humane approach to a desperate problem which so many generous and loving Australians who want to become parents or who want to complete their families stand ready to alleviate.


There is no decline in Australia in the numbers of couples like Ms Ellem and her husband who want to adopt, yet it would appear that the lack of unification between the states and territories, combined with endless red tape regarding the processing of adoption applications, is preventing Australian couples from applying for overseas adoption.


The 2005 federal parliamentary committee into adoption found that state authorities were biased against adoption generally and appeared, in principle, to be prejudiced against the practice of adopting children from overseas. The 2014 committee's report received submissions that expressed a continued and significant level of frustration with Australia's current approach to intercountry adoption. Particular issues raised include the quality of states' and territories' administration and level of support, and the cost, waiting times and uncertainty of outcomes.


Our Prime Minister and this government have seized the initiative and have taken action. We have opened a new overseas adoption program with South Africa and are commencing discussions with several other countries about possible new overseas adoption programs.


It behoves us to live up to our values and standards of charity and common humanity and to remain mindful that, in improving the adoption process for prospective parents, the paramount consideration for the government is the best interests of the child. There have been bipartisan efforts on the part of this House to reform. May that bipartisanship continue, and may this bill, as presented by the Prime Minister, be accepted by this parliament. I echo the words of the Prime Minister: the effort we are making in this important area will result in more children who need families and more families who want nothing more than to provide a loving and stable home being brought together. I commend this bill to the House.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (16:00):  I thank members for their contributions to the second reading debate on this bill. This bill was, as we know, introduced by the Prime Minister, which emphasises his strong personal commitment and the commitment of his government to the reform and improvement of intercountry adoption. I remind the House that the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014 amends the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to facilitate the grant of Australian citizenship to children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral adoption arrangements between Australia and countries that are not party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. 


The bill is a reflection of this government's commitment to reform overseas adoption and to streamline processes to assist parents and their adopted children. The bill gives effect to one of the recommendations made in the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Intercountry Adoption published in April 2014. It means that children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral adoption arrangements between Australia and other countries will be able to apply for Australian citizenship as soon as the adoption is finalised. They will then be able to apply for an Australian passport to travel to Australia with their new families as Australian citizens. 


The bill seeks to place children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral arrangements in the same position as children adopted by Australian citizens under the Hague convention. Since 2007 children adopted by Australian citizens under Hague convention arrangements have been able to apply for Australian citizenship in their home country. Countries with which Australia establishes a bilateral arrangement must meet the same standards and safeguards as those required with adoptions made between countries that have ratified the Hague convention. Where a non-convention country meets those standards, the government contends that there is no reason why adoptions should not be recognised in the same way as adoptions contracted between convention countries. 


As the process for children adopted under bilateral arrangements, including automatic recognition under Australian law, is in substance identical with those processes under the Hague convention, it is the government's position that the children should be treated the same in regard to access to Australian citizenship. This was recognised by the interdepartmental committee, which identified this issue as suitable for immediate reform. The government has moved quickly to act on that recommendation.


This bill acknowledges the hard work, dedication and perseverance of Australians who have embarked on the challenging journey of intercountry adoption. They have our admiration and respect. On a personal note I wish to commend all of them for their deep, longstanding desire to be a parent. This is something that goes to the very core of our being. I know the pain that they feel when they have been unable to realise their own dreams of being a parent naturally. The fact that they can get over that personal disappointment—although I suspect that can never occur fully—and then turn around and look at a new opportunity and bring a young life in another place into their own home and take them under their care and treat them as their own is truly an inspiring feat. It is a wonderful thing that we can come together in this chamber, and I am sure as will occur in the other chamber, and pass this bill, which will make that process just that little bit easier. It should not have to be so hard. Certainly, there have to be protections, certainly there have to be proper processes and certainly these things need to be in place. But for all of those parents who want to fulfil that opportunity to be parents, because in their hearts they have always been parents, this gives them the opportunity to take that step just that little bit more easily than it could be done before. 


It is the intention of this government, and I am sure all members of the House, that we continue to work on these matters and make these processes and systems more effortless if we ever can. It is work in progress. It is work that is occurring in a bipartisan and multipartisan way in this parliament. Above all, I hope that those who are going through this process see the passage of this bill as an encouragement and an endorsement of what they are seeking to do in their own lives and in the lives of others. I commend the bill to the House.

"Whiteley, Brett, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (15:15):  Given I had only a short amount of time earlier, I will recommence my speech. Of all the many policies that governments are called to deal with, those dealing with the lives and the welfare of children, as the most vulnerable group in our society, must surely be the most important. Children everywhere deserve a safe and secure home environment. However, it is the sad reality that in some countries, for a range of complex social, cultural or economic reasons, there are children unable to be cared for by their parents, extended families or anyone else and who have no possibility of growing up in a family environment in their country of birth. For some of these children, intercountry adoption might be the only way in which they can have the opportunity to be part of a secure and loving family and to have a chance at a better life.


Intercountry adoption is a complex and sensitive matter for all parties concerned, and a decision to remove a child from its country of birth and possibly, in some instances, from its birth parents is not one that the Australian government believes should ever be taken lightly. Nevertheless, we support international adoption arrangements made under the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, which have established safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and also that eligible, caring families in Australia and elsewhere have the opportunity to adopt an overseas born child and provide that child with a family, a home and a future that he or she might never otherwise have had.


Unfortunately, for too long now significant barriers have faced Australian families wanting to adopt from overseas. Inconsistent rules, high costs and lengthy waiting periods are common—so much so that they have been found to deter many people who would have liked to adopt a child from even starting the adoption process. In recognising that the processes required in bringing together those children from overseas who legitimately need a safe and loving home with those Australians who dream of providing one have been overburdened with inconsistency and complex red tape, the Prime Minister announced in December of last year that the government would simplify overseas adoption by the end of this year. At this point, I want to recognise the personal commitment to this issue made by our Prime Minister. By removing those bureaucratic requirements and delays which serve little real purpose and benefit no-one but simply add to the complexity and cost faced by adopting families, the government wants to make it easier to adopt when such action is clearly agreed by all parties to be in the best interests of the child.


Australia's overarching requirement for any potential partner-country willing to participate in intercountry adoption arrangements with us is that the country essentially meet ethical and legal framework standards and safeguards equivalent to those required under the Hague convention to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child. In those cases where a country is not a signatory to the convention but is seen to satisfactorily meet convention standards, we see no reason why adoptions in that country should not be recognised in the same way as adoptions in convention countries. The changes proposed in this bill will, therefore, place children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral arrangements in the same position as those adopted under Hague convention arrangements—that is, they will be able to travel to Australia with their new families as Australian citizens on an Australian passport.


Seeking as it does to reform the current procedural requirements and reduce unnecessary red tape, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014 is a positive step forward in delivering the government's promise. The key feature of the bill is an amendment which expands the scope of the existing Hague convention provisions so as to include adoptions in accordance with bilateral arrangements. The decision-making framework remains the same. The amendments made by the bill will apply for the benefit of all children adopted under bilateral arrangements, whether the adoption was finalised before or after the amendments come into force.


The government has clearly been delivering on its commitment to improve adoption procedures in other ways. A report by senior officials on options to reform overseas adoption, which was informed by public submissions, has been considered. Improvements have already been announced to the process for families adopting children from Taiwan and South Korea, and a new overseas adoption program with South Africa has commenced—and there are a further seven new programs in the pipeline. COAG has agreed in principle to a new national overseas adoption service from 2015, and options to reduce waiting times for visas for adoptive children from overseas are being developed. In addition, the government will introduce amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act so that obtaining Australian citizenship can happen in a child's country of origin as well as to address processing problems associated with the visa system.


The Abbott government is clearly committed to adoption reform to enable more Australians who wish to adopt a child from overseas to achieve this wonderful outcome. Bringing together a child in need of a home, particularly a special needs child, as children of intercountry adoption so frequently are, with those who wish to offer a safe and loving family is something that should be managed as sensitively and with as little unnecessary red tape as possible. Potential adopting parents are required to go through an extremely complex and robust vetting process—and rightly so—but should not have to deal with any more red tape than is absolutely necessary. I strongly support this bill and commend it to the House.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (15:22):  Children are such a natural part of marriage and life partnerships. They are such a natural function of the biology of life and, for most, a natural and fairly easy process. There is no slight intended to women who face the not insignificant challenges of pregnancy and childbirth meant there. The basis of the family is the key pillar of our society and cannot be overstated. But for some, it is just not easy. Having children is not a straightforward affair and it can be a heartbreaking and demoralising experience when close friends and family start and complete their families and couples are left behind, because—despite every effort—they cannot have children.


This bill is about inter-country adoption, but I would briefly like to touch on local adoption. Australia is undoubtedly scarred by the experience of the Stolen Generation. I will not go back over the history of that experience, the motivations behind it and mixed outcomes it provided. The long-term result is that local adoption has fallen well out of favour. However, with the tragedy of totally dysfunctional parents and the revolving door of foster placements—and God bless those wonderful people who selflessly devote themselves to foster parenting—I fear Australian family law courts are not making the best long-term decisions for at least some of the children.


Is it not possible, even highly likely, that a child removed from serial parental failure and moved in and out of foster homes would not have a far greater chance at life if the responsible agencies and courts were simply to make the decision that—where the child's current circumstances are intolerable and the likelihood of that situation improving substantially are remote—they would be far better off with parents that will love, cherish and nurture the individual? It seems to me our family court system and agencies are haunted by the past and that collectively we are not bold enough to make the right long-term decisions.


It is also worthwhile reflecting also that in the 2012-13 financial year, Australia spent $237 million on assisted reproductive technology through the Medicare system. There is no cap on the number of treatments nor is there any age restriction. I am not suggesting for one minute that couples with fertility issues should not avail themselves of this service, but we do know as each cycle fails the chances of a successful pregnancy with further treatment reduces. Perhaps if more viable alternatives existed—and in this case we are talking about adoption—and perhaps if it were easier to adopt, couples who are desperate to have families may well choose to abandon the IVF programs earlier and follow the path of adoption.


To return to this bill, which refers to international adoption: I was recently contacted by Tanya Fry, a 39-year-old teacher. It is so typical, really. Her and her husband have run the full gauntlet, first from the decisions to have a family, to the initial disappointment of not easily getting pregnant, to the long-term sadness of that failure, to the seeking of help and to the fertility and IVF roller coaster. Nothing is easy, personal or particularly private about the process. Then in their late 30s, Tanya and her husband realised that they would not be able to have their own biological baby and decided that perhaps adoption would be the best option.


I would like to read a few paragraphs from a letter that Tanya has penned for me. This starts in the middle of the letter:


Our main concern is the time it may now take to adopt from overseas (as it is near impossible to adopt within Australia). My husband and I are approaching our 40s and are concerned that the process is going to take so long that we will run out of time. There are significant amounts of people in the same situation as us and it is Important to note how stressful this process is. Couples including ourselves have generally been through significant infertility challenges before making the decision to adopt (in our case recurrent miscarriage). It is really important to us that the timeline suggested for this restructuring is followed so that we are not put through additional stress.


The application is quite a difficult one to fill out.


That is, the application for inter-country adoption.


My main concerns are with the BMI question, my husband has a very muscular build and is not overweight yet his BMI is over what is required (only slightly). It seems ridiculous that someone so fit and healthy could be rejected because of his build.


While watching television I become increasingly upset seeing adverts asking for money to help children/orphans overseas who have nothing. I don't understand how there can be so many children in the world who need parents and why it is so hard to adopt a child. My husband and I are both on good incomes and have the means and ability to raise a child without any assistance. We would be outstanding parents so why is it all so hard!


That is not the end of the letter, but I will end that quote there.


I do not know the prospective parents that well, but I did meet Tanya for the first time the week before last. I am pretty confident that a couple who have tried so hard are likely to be good parents. They have good jobs, a home and commitment. They have already proved far more than most of us are ever asked to do. When we are people who are lucky to be able to raise our own children, we do not get asked how heavy we are. We do not get asked intrusive questions. We just start families. Most of us do a pretty fair fist of actually becoming good parents. What criteria is that to judge people on? We are not even counselled before we start a biological family. It just makes me wonder what we are doing and why we make it so difficult to adopt from overseas.


Then there was the news for Tanya and her husband that the application going okay, but they might have to wait five to seven years. I know adoption is not for all parents and its main emphasis should be on the children, but it is hard to believe—with all the children in the world living in poverty with no family or at least no functioning family and living without education—that we cannot find a way to bring these two needy parties together and that we cannot find a way so that a needy child can live a life of relative privilege in Australia with successful people who could be their loving and compassionate parents if they were only given the chance.


While I recognise that for a number of reasons inter-country adoptions have declined across the globe, it is very concerning to me that Australians were able to adopt just 129 children last year. That is a very small number. It is a small number of the tens of thousands of available children in the world who could have a life of comparative privilege and it is a very small number of the desperate potential parents who are given the opportunity to have what so many of us take for granted—a family.


I know the world is not a perfect place and there will always be those who take advantage of others. We must be ever vigilant so Australian adoptions are never associated with events that could possibly be construed as trafficking. That is why Australia should form adoption programs only with countries or third parties that meet the criteria of the Hague convention. I congratulate the government on taking the initiative of opening a new program with South Africa and making improvements to the process with South Korea and Taiwan. I am also very pleased that COAG have endorsed the move to a national agency to facilitate international adoption to help speed up the granting of suitable visas. It makes sense to have a national desk—after all, migration is a national responsibility and our government-to-government relationships are at this level.


This bill will allow the granting of citizenship as soon as adoption is verified, enabling the newly adopted children to travel with their parents on an Australian passport. It will not suddenly make overseas adoption easy—and I hope there is more we can do in that space—but it is a significant step in the right direction. I hope we can do more in this area and complete the lives of Tanya and her husband and many others like them around Australia and really improve the opportunities of the children that they might adopt.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (15:31):  I am very pleased to be speaking on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014. The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the granting of Australian citizenship to children who have been adopted by Australian citizens under the bilateral adoption arrangements between Australia and countries that are not party to the Hague convention on intercountry adoption. As the Prime Minister said in the House on 29 May this year, policy reform and progress on intercountry adopting has been in the too-hard basket for far too long and simply because of red tape.


This bill has at its very heart a humanitarian focus that looks to remove the unnecessary red tape that gets in the way of children from around the world who have no parents or no effective parents being able to have a much better life in Australia. When you look at the state of the world at the moment, with the rise of mindless terror and vicious international criminal conduct, it is imperative that all of us do all we can to remove the barriers for entry for these children. That is absolutely clear. To this end I find it more gratifying that the policy focus of the bill in removing red tape for these children to have a safe and loving home in this country is not just a symbolic gesture but very real. It will produce outcomes that will make very positive and tangible differences to the lives of so many children around the world.


Earlier Madam Speaker was in the chair. I want to pay tribute to her and the work she and her committee did many years ago in this area. Too often in the past seven years the people of Australia have had their expectations falsely built up by symbolic actions with no substance behind them, but this bill is different because this government is different. Indeed, this promise was made by the Prime Minister in December last year when he committed to reforming overseas adoptions by the end of 2014.


To this end, on 19 December last year Prime Minister Abbott announced that he would establish the Interdepartmental Committee on Intercountry Adoption to consider options for reform and to improve intercountry adoption processes. There were a total of 108 submissions. Twenty-six were from organisations and the remainder came from individuals representing adult adoptees, adoptive and prospective parents, academics and individuals with a professional interest in intercountry adoption, and parents and children who are now adults deeply affected by past practices of forced adoptions. In addition, the Prime Minister received 60 items of correspondence on intercountry adoption reform.


Submissions made to the interdepartmental committee expressed a significant level of frustration with Australia's current approach to intercountry adoption. The particular issues raised were the Commonwealth's approach to selecting intercountry adoption partner countries, the quality of the states and territories' administration and level of support provided to prospective adoptive parents, the cost, the waiting times, the uncertainty of outcomes not only overseas but also within Australia, and the standard of postadoption support services. There were other criticisms that related to the current Commonwealth-state model of regulating intercountry adoption and the lack of nationally consistent laws, policy and procedures. That made it really difficult for families who had moved interstate and across territories to receive consistent and predictable levels of support. It also made it very difficult to provide consistent outcomes across Australia.


Taken as a whole these frustrations can represent significant impediments to Australians considering intercountry adoption. Given the frustrating history, the interdepartmental committee itself stressed that there is an imperative to be clear about the impact that any reforms are likely to have on these impediments to ensure expectations of families are realistic with regard to the future of intercountry adoption in Australia and to make clear that in many cases they will go towards improving the experience of people participating in intercountry adoption rather than making a dramatic change in the rate of adoptions.


It should also be noted that 24 of the submissions made to the committee did not support intercountry adoption and highlighted concerns with the safeguards in place to protect parents and children from unlawful practices and the effects on children growing up outside their culture. Such concerns were acknowledged up-front by the Prime Minister in his second reading speech, when he said:


We do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past, but we do want to remove the red tape and reduce the delays—that do not benefit anyone.


The interdepartmental committee noted that Australia is committed to ensuring that all parties to intercountry adoption arrangements are protected from exploitation and abuses. These vulnerable parties clearly include children and birth families, where a child has been relinquished, and the prospective adoptive parents. It should not automatically be assumed that the interests of these parties are necessarily in conflict. The interdepartmental committee addressed these concerns quite directly on page 8 of its report when it states that:


Greater efficiency in the process, so long as it does not come at the expense of thoroughness, may remove some of the frustrations experienced by prospective adoptive parents, while also reducing the amount of time spent by children in institutions. Australia's approach to adoption recognises that children who cannot be brought up with their family are entitled to grow up in a permanent, secure and loving family environment. A more efficient intercountry adoption system would be better able to provide children with this environment in a timely fashion.


Australia's current regulatory approach observes the international principles guiding intercountry adoption which is set out in the 1993 Hague Convention on the protection of children and cooperation in respect of intercountry adoption.


The fundamental principles in the Convention are: (1) the best interests principle that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all Convention intercountry adoptions; (2) the subsidiarity principle that adoption is subsidiary to care by family, and intercountry adoption is subsidiary to domestic adoption; (3) the safeguards principle that safeguards must be developed to prevent the abduction, sale of, and traffic in children; (4) the cooperation principle that authorities must establish and maintain effective cooperation to ensure that these safeguards are effectively maintained; and (5) the competent authorities principle that only competent authorities—appointed in each country—should be permitted to authorise intercountry adoptions.


For the purposes of the Hague Convention, the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department is the Australian central authority for intercountry adoption. The states and territories are also central authorities under the Hague Convention. However, owing to the lack of political impetus from the Commonwealth, states and territories and the complexity of amending state and territory legislation that relates to both intercountry and domestic adoption, this work has not been progressed, despite many attempts. This is not an acceptable situation. As the Prime Minister said on 5 May this year:


For too long children who legitimately need a safe and loving home and Australians who dream of providing this home have been hindered by red tape and confusion. The Government is pleased to be able to undertake real action to bring families together.


Consistent with these goals, the government has been moving ahead in progressing this issue.


Apart from the Prime Minister's commissioning of the Interdepartmental Committee on Intercountry Adoption report, the government has also put in place amendments to the Family Law regulations that will make it easier to recognise adoptions from Taiwan and South Korea. We have also opened a new overseas adoption program with South Africa; we have instructed officials to commence discussions with seven other countries about possible new overseas adoption programs; we have chaired a COAG meeting which agreed in principle to the Commonwealth providing a new national overseas adoption service from 2015. We have introduced amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to make it easier for children from Taiwan and South Korea to obtain Australian citizenship in their country of origin; and have asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to develop options to reduce waiting times for visas for adoptive children from overseas. The government is now working through the details of the new reforms with the states so that the new approach to overseas adoption can commence as early as 2015.


The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the grant of Australian citizenship to children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral adoption arrangements between Australia and countries that are not party to the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption. Under such bilateral arrangements, Australian citizens have for several years been unable to adopt children from South Korea, Taiwan and Ethiopia. Although the intercountry adoption program with Ethiopia is now closed, there are a number of families who are awaiting the finalisation of their adoptions. 


At present, children adopted under bilateral arrangements require a passport from the home country and an Australian adoption visa to travel to Australia. This imposes additional complexity and cost on the adopting families. Under the amendments to be made by this bill, children will be able to be granted citizenship as soon as the adoption is finalised. They will then be able to travel to Australia on Australian passports with their new families as Australian citizens. The bill will place children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral arrangements in the same position as children adopted by Australian citizens under Hague Convention arrangements.


The overarching requirement from Australia's perspective that a potential partner country is, first, willing participate in intercountry adoption arrangement with Australia, and, second, will meet the standards in safeguards equivalent to those required under the Hague Convention. Where a non-convention country meets these standards, there is no reason why adoptions should not be recognised in the same way as adoptions in convention countries. The government has recently given effect to this principle by amending the Family Law (Bilateral Arrangements—Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998 to provide for automatic recognition of adoptions in partner countries once the adoption is finalised and an adoption compliance certificate has been issued. And in this regard, the bill enhances the wellbeing of adopted children by creating a more streamlined and cost-effective process which allows them to commence their lives in Australia more quickly.


The bill will not change post-adoption support arrangements, which are provided by state and territory governments in accordance with their respective laws. While the laws and procedures may vary in some respects between states and territories, support services are provided to adopted children and their families on an identical basis whether the adoption took place under the Hague Convention or under bilateral arrangements. Children adopted from Hague Convention countries, which issue adoption compliance certificates, are already able to obtain Australia citizenship as soon as the adoption is finalised. This has been the case since the enactment of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007. The adoption compliance certificate provides assurance that the adoption has been carried out in accordance with the ethical and legal framework required by the Hague Convention. The process for adoption under bilateral arrangements, including automatic recognition under Australian law, is in substance identical. There is no reason why those children should be treated differently under the Australian Citizenship Act.


The key feature of the bill is an amendment to subdivision AA of division 2 of part 2 of the act. The amendment simply expands the scope of the existing Hague Convention provisions, so that they also cover adoptions in accordance with bilateral arrangements. There are many important safeguards that the government has built into this legislation. These would be relevant, clearly, if fraud or some other irregularity came to light before citizenship was granted. Similarly, the minister must not approve a child becoming a citizen if the minister is not satisfied of the identity of the child. The amendments proposed by the bill would apply for the benefit of all children adopted under bilateral arrangements, whether the adoption is finalised before or after the amendments come into force.


The government is realistic: this bill is not a magic bullet to solve all of the problems associated with intercountry adoption that have existed for decades, but it is an important and substantial step forward, and the bill gives hope to families. It gives hope to children without parents, where no hope previously existed. It is through actions such as these that we show our humanity—where we can demonstrate that we are not prepared to accept the status quo that presently values bureaucracy and red tape over the welfare of children. Never can such a situation be acceptable. We as a parliament must reject it. As I said earlier, there has never been a more important time for legislation of this kind to be put before the House—so that we as a nation can demonstrate to those who inflict hatred and fear upon the world that Australia offers hope and love to those who deserve a better life. There can be no more deserving recipients than children with no parents. I commend the bill to the House.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (15:46):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I speak today for the government's Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014. Last year, the Prime Minister announced that the government would improve overseas adoption by the end of 2014. The government has been delivering on that commitment. There are three categories which well express the foundations of this amendment. These categories are historical, personal—personal in a constituency sense, and humanitarian. These are separate categories, but they are inextricably intertwined.


Intercountry adoption was first practised widely by the United States as a humanitarian response to the situation of European children from Germany, Italy and Greece, orphaned by World War II. In the 1950s, children similarly orphaned or abandoned during the Korean War were adopted by families in the US and in Europe, and intercountry adoption extended to Vietnam in the 1960s, following the Vietnam War. It was not until the Vietnam War that intercountry adoption was practised in significant numbers by Australian families. Subsequently, as interest in intercountry adoption increased, adoptive parent groups established during the Vietnam War began to extend their operations to other Asian countries.


In 2005, Bronwyn Bishop MP was Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, and launched that committee's report titled Overseas Adoption in Australia. Two key findings of the 2005 report were: that Australia's per capita rate of adoptions from overseas was less than one-third the rate of most First World countries; and that the Commonwealth, rather than the states and territories, should establish and manage new programs with overseas countries. Furthermore, the 2005 report found that fees in some states were too high, and that rules were needlessly harsh. One Australian state used a Body Mass Index to determine those parents who might be too fat to adopt. Another state required prospective adoptive parents to be fingerprinted. There was also a range of signals from state authorities demonstrating that they did not want people to adopt from overseas. When discussing submissions and evidence received by the 2005 committee, the Chairman also noted that, 'Adoption officials have a great deal of power over adoptive parents. Some parents declined to give evidence because they were afraid it might jeopardise their chances of a successful application.' This is unconscionable behaviour on the part of public servants: putting their personal or professional prejudices—wishes—before the very reasonable and understandable longing of parents wishing to adopt. The Chairman of the 2005 committee added: 'In the area of intercountry adoption, ministers and their departments have been unaccountable for too long. The committee is pleased to redress the balance.'


In June 2008, the responsibilities of the Commonwealth government and of the state and territory governments were set out in the Commonwealth-State Agreement for the Continued Operation of Australia's lntercountry Adoption Programme. This demonstrated that good intentions prevailed, though—sadly—actual practice lagged behind. Finally, in December 2013, our Prime Minister announced that he would establish a committee to report to him in 2014 with options for implementing reform within Australia over the next 12 months to improve intercountry adoption. The committee was chaired by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. It had senior representatives from the Attorney-General's Department, DFAT, the Department of Immigration, and the Department of Social Services. In April 2014, the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Intercountry Adoption was completed and tabled. One clear term of reference was: 'immediate steps that could be taken for improving and streamlining the delivery of intercountry adoptions to make intercountry adoption easier and faster for Australian couples'. The 2014 report provides both immediate and longer term options for reform. It noted also that the short-term reforms, in and of themselves, are unlikely to see a significant change in the numbers of adoptions. However, they may assist in reducing some of the frustrations that are experienced in Australia.


The Prime Minister noted in May, during the second reading debate for this bill, that he would not pretend that everything was going to be simple and straightforward immediately. However, he did say that this bill will provide 'significant new hope for parents without children, and significant new hope for children without parents'.


With regard to parents, I now address the personal side to my support for this amendment. A constituent of mine, Ms Jo Ellem, contacted me in March this year. In April, I met with Ms Ellem and her husband in my office and heard their story. It took them five years to bring their first child home, and they have now been waiting seven years to adopt their second child. 


During the 2005 parliamentary inquiry, Ms Ellem was invited to present to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, chaired by the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop MP. The Hon. Julia Irwin MP was deputy chair of the committee. In her covering letter to the report, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop MP referred to the diligent and enthusiastic support of her colleagues on the committee, making special mention of two Labor party committee members, her deputy chair, the Hon. Julia Irwin MP, and the Hon. Harry Quick MP. It should be noted that there was no dissenting report to the committee's report.


Despite the committee's agreement and its bipartisan nature, it is Ms Ellem's belief that the findings of that report are still to be addressed. However, Ms Ellem was much heartened by the Prime Minister's statements regarding intercountry adoptions just two days before she contacted me, and she sought my assistance to get her message to him. According to Ms Ellem, most of the nine programs available for Australian couples to adopt are barely functioning, and they all have long waiting times. She and her husband have been told that there is no end in sight. Nevertheless, they continue to explore all options. 


Ms Ellem found out about a new program for the adoption of mixed race children being run in Japan. Ms Ellem called Family and Community Services New South Wales—FACS—and asked them if they would ring the intercountry adoptions branch in Canberra to pursue the adoption of mixed race children from Japan. I regret to inform the House that Family and Community Services New South Wales refused to even call the intercountry adoptions branch in Canberra. Ms Ellem was told that, even if they did call and even if the Canberra branch said that FACS New South Wales could decide whether this should happen, FACS would refuse to do so. Rather, FACS New South Wales told my constituents that they should look at existing programs in Thailand and the Philippines. Both these countries have waiting periods of four to five years, or even longer. FACS New South Wales told my constituents that it did not have the resources to do otherwise. This was greeted with incredulity by Ms Ellem. 


She and her husband have paid a great deal of money to FACS for their adoptions. They do not object to the not inconsiderable fees, but they do object to the fact that their monies appear not to be used as they would or should have been. As already noted, their second adoption has been going on for seven years, and there have been further fees paid for what clearly is little or no facilitation or progress.


As her elected representative, I made formal representations to the Prime Minister, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to the Attorney-General. Later, I was very pleased to receive an email from Ms Ellem telling me that she had received a telephone call from the Prime Minister's office. Senator Brandis's office had also contacted her. She also had a meeting with the Prime Minister's senior policy advisor on social affairs and has had further communications with the Prime Minister's chief of staff. I am proud to point out that this is a government that, from the Prime Minister down, takes action, seizes the initiative and puts the interests of Australians first.


Finally, there is a humanitarian side to this bill. The history of intercountry adoption is humanitarian—the generous, enlightened and humane response of the United States and of European countries from the 1940s through to the Vietnam War, at which time Australia became more involved, and on to the present day. We pride ourselves as a nation on our enlightened generosity, our charity and our compassion, and we will continue to pursue a humane response to this matter.


MPs involved in the various committees were deeply moved by their experiences during the various inquiries. Their feelings were moved on a number of levels. During the 2005 inquiry, Labor MP Harry Quick said he was deeply moved by his visit to a Chinese orphanage—and understandably so. However, he was also upset that some parents here in Australia felt afraid to give evidence in public in case their chance of a successful application to adopt was harmed. He was quoted as saying:


It is disappointing that we have six states and two territories that are thwarting parents … when there are literally thousands and thousands of young children … who can be placed in loving families, supported far better than they are wandering the streets of countless cities right across the world.


By 2005 Australia's per capita rate of adoptions from overseas was less than one-third the rate of most first world economies. In Australia in 2004, there were 434 intercountry adoptions. In 2010, this number had dropped to 222—a 60 per cent fall. This decline has continued in Australia, with only 129 intercountry adoptions in 2012-2013. This is hardly a magnanimous, charitable and humane approach to a desperate problem which so many generous and loving Australians who want to become parents or who want to complete their families stand ready to alleviate.


There is no decline in Australia in the numbers of couples like Ms Ellem and her husband who want to adopt, yet it would appear that the lack of unification between the states and territories, combined with endless red tape regarding the processing of adoption applications, is preventing Australian couples from applying for overseas adoption.


The 2005 federal parliamentary committee into adoption found that state authorities were biased against adoption generally and appeared, in principle, to be prejudiced against the practice of adopting children from overseas. The 2014 committee's report received submissions that expressed a continued and significant level of frustration with Australia's current approach to intercountry adoption. Particular issues raised include the quality of states' and territories' administration and level of support, and the cost, waiting times and uncertainty of outcomes.


Our Prime Minister and this government have seized the initiative and have taken action. We have opened a new overseas adoption program with South Africa and are commencing discussions with several other countries about possible new overseas adoption programs.


It behoves us to live up to our values and standards of charity and common humanity and to remain mindful that, in improving the adoption process for prospective parents, the paramount consideration for the government is the best interests of the child. There have been bipartisan efforts on the part of this House to reform. May that bipartisanship continue, and may this bill, as presented by the Prime Minister, be accepted by this parliament. I echo the words of the Prime Minister: the effort we are making in this important area will result in more children who need families and more families who want nothing more than to provide a loving and stable home being brought together. I commend this bill to the House.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (16:00):  I thank members for their contributions to the second reading debate on this bill. This bill was, as we know, introduced by the Prime Minister, which emphasises his strong personal commitment and the commitment of his government to the reform and improvement of intercountry adoption. I remind the House that the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014 amends the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to facilitate the grant of Australian citizenship to children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral adoption arrangements between Australia and countries that are not party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. 


The bill is a reflection of this government's commitment to reform overseas adoption and to streamline processes to assist parents and their adopted children. The bill gives effect to one of the recommendations made in the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Intercountry Adoption published in April 2014. It means that children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral adoption arrangements between Australia and other countries will be able to apply for Australian citizenship as soon as the adoption is finalised. They will then be able to apply for an Australian passport to travel to Australia with their new families as Australian citizens. 


The bill seeks to place children adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral arrangements in the same position as children adopted by Australian citizens under the Hague convention. Since 2007 children adopted by Australian citizens under Hague convention arrangements have been able to apply for Australian citizenship in their home country. Countries with which Australia establishes a bilateral arrangement must meet the same standards and safeguards as those required with adoptions made between countries that have ratified the Hague convention. Where a non-convention country meets those standards, the government contends that there is no reason why adoptions should not be recognised in the same way as adoptions contracted between convention countries. 


As the process for children adopted under bilateral arrangements, including automatic recognition under Australian law, is in substance identical with those processes under the Hague convention, it is the government's position that the children should be treated the same in regard to access to Australian citizenship. This was recognised by the interdepartmental committee, which identified this issue as suitable for immediate reform. The government has moved quickly to act on that recommendation.


This bill acknowledges the hard work, dedication and perseverance of Australians who have embarked on the challenging journey of intercountry adoption. They have our admiration and respect. On a personal note I wish to commend all of them for their deep, longstanding desire to be a parent. This is something that goes to the very core of our being. I know the pain that they feel when they have been unable to realise their own dreams of being a parent naturally. The fact that they can get over that personal disappointment—although I suspect that can never occur fully—and then turn around and look at a new opportunity and bring a young life in another place into their own home and take them under their care and treat them as their own is truly an inspiring feat. It is a wonderful thing that we can come together in this chamber, and I am sure as will occur in the other chamber, and pass this bill, which will make that process just that little bit easier. It should not have to be so hard. Certainly, there have to be protections, certainly there have to be proper processes and certainly these things need to be in place. But for all of those parents who want to fulfil that opportunity to be parents, because in their hearts they have always been parents, this gives them the opportunity to take that step just that little bit more easily than it could be done before. 


It is the intention of this government, and I am sure all members of the House, that we continue to work on these matters and make these processes and systems more effortless if we ever can. It is work in progress. It is work that is occurring in a bipartisan and multipartisan way in this parliament. Above all, I hope that those who are going through this process see the passage of this bill as an encouragement and an endorsement of what they are seeking to do in their own lives and in the lives of others. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (21:00):  Now that the New South Wales Liberal government has, effectively, sold the Port of Newcastle, the proceeds should be used to fund key projects that benefit the Newcastle, Lake Macquarie and Hunter regions, primary among which is the Glendale transport interchange. A veritable chorus line of Liberal ministers and premiers have performed the same song-and-dance routine for the people of the Hunter over the past few years, promising us our 'fair share' when it comes to the proceeds of the port sale. However, since signing on the dotted line, the government has hit a sour note. It has been embroiled in a corruption scandal that has claimed the scalps of almost every single Liberal MP from the Hawkesbury to Port Stephens, as well as the Liberal-aligned Mayor of Newcastle. We have heard allegations that individuals—from business groups and from all political persuasions—attempted to distort the approval process for a coal terminal at the port, and that the way Port Botany and Port Kembla were privatised has rendered the prospect of a container terminal at the Port of Newcastle virtually impossible. It is entirely fair for the people of the Hunter to doubt these decisions, and to demand that their elected representatives work collaboratively, in the best interests of the region and its economy.


Based on this, I wish to highlight my own recent experience which has, unfortunately, caused me to question the New South Wales government's approach. I applaud the New South Wales Labor opposition for their recent commitment to return half of the proceeds of the port sale to the region. It is imperative that the allocation of this—or indeed of the government's expenditure—is done in a manner which considers the investment needs of the region more broadly, not just the needs of the inner city. The Glendale transport interchange has been identified by RDA Hunter as priority infrastructure necessary for the continued development and growth of the Hunter, as set out in our regional plan. The 11 combined Hunter councils have unanimously identified it as the most strategically significant infrastructure project in the region. So far, $37.5 million has been forthcoming, from all levels of government, and I understand Lake Macquarie City Council has allocated a significant proportion of this to the current capital works program. But the fact remains that further funding is required to complete the project, which includes building the Pennant Street Bridge in the first stage, and the construction of a railway station in the second stage.


In December last year, I wrote to the then Treasurer, Mike Baird, urging him to allocate funds from the Port of Newcastle sale to keep the momentum on this project going. I was disappointed with his reply, which ruled out further support for the interchange from that transaction. A few months later, upon her appointment as Minister for the Hunter, I wrote to Gladys Berejiklian, drawing her attention to the fact that the New South Wales government is responsible for rail bridges and stations, and that she was in a unique position to seek further funding from the port sale. I did not receive a response. Most recently, after a further $100 million was provided to the Hunter Infrastructure and Investment Fund from the port sale, I sought an urgent meeting with the Chairman, Peter Blackmore, after he had commented publicly that the Glendale interchange may not be considered through this new round. In a bipartisan spirit, I invited local state MPs, Sonia Hornery and Andrew Cornwell, to accompany me to this meeting. The member for Wallsend, who is a vocal advocate for the Glendale interchange, agreed to attend. Unfortunately, the then member for Charlestown refused to join the delegation. Mr Blackmore did not even acknowledge my request, instead referring my letter to ex-officio member, Bob Hawes, who is the General Manager of the Hunter Development Corporation, a New South Wales government organisation. Mr Hawes refused to meet with me.


As the federal member representing Western Lake Macquarie and Western Newcastle, it is incumbent upon me to pursue opportunities to progress the Glendale interchange, irrespective of the level of government or its political orientation. But when the opportunity arises to secure funds from the sale of a profitable public asset—a significant share of the revenue from which should be invested in the Hunter region—not only elected representatives but also appointed officials should work as hard as possible to secure the best outcome for our community. It is unfortunate that this is not occurring. I want to see the Glendale interchange built. It is a vital piece of infrastructure for our region—a region where it is projected, by Lake Macquarie City Council and by the state government in its regional planning, that 6,000 houses will go in over the next few decades. It is necessary that the Glendale interchange be built, and it requires the cooperation of all levels of government. However, if those tasked with the allocation of these funds are not working in an inclusive way, then they are not working in the best interests of the people of the Hunter.


I call on the New South Wales government to make a strong commitment to the Glendale interchange, and deliver further funding to complete stage one, at the very least, with the proceeds from the sale of our port. Madam Speaker, I would submit that a commitment to the Glendale transport interchange is a commitment to our region, and should be the litmus test for any candidates and any political parties in the upcoming state election.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (10:36):  People on the New South Wales North Coast have many concerns with the actions of this cruel Liberal-National Party government. They have concerns about the doctor tax and the petrol tax. As well as the impact of the unfair budget, another major issue is this government's attack upon workers, its attack on penalty rates and also its unfair moves towards outsourcing, which threatens jobs, particularly in regional areas.


We have a situation where Liberal-National Party backbenchers are regularly in the media calling for penalty rates to be reviewed, which of course means slashed. That is their ultimate goal. Make no mistake about it: this would result in a return to the days of Work Choices. So many people in my electorate remember how devastating Work Choices was upon their working conditions. There are at least 10 coalition members who have publicly said penalty rates need to be reviewed. When a Liberal-National Party MP says 'reviewed', we know that is code for 'cut'.


The impact of cutting penalty rates in electorates like Richmond would be devastating. This was confirmed in the recent study by the McKell Institute titled The economic impact of penalty rate cuts on rural New South Wales. The report examined the effects of cuts to penalty rates for those working in regional electorates in the retail industry, an industry which relies heavily on penalty rates. The study found that the economic impact of penalty rate cuts would result in a loss of income of $22.6 million a year collectively for the 6,700 retail workers in my electorate of Richmond. These cuts to penalty rates represent a 16.6 per cent loss in take-home pay for the average worker in Richmond. The study also highlighted that cutting penalty rates for retail workers would mean a loss of $6.5 million to local businesses—a huge amount.


At the last election I had National Party members in my area publicly running around saying they wanted to see penalty rates slashed, and they continue to do that. Labor will fight these unfair plans they have to cut the pay of local workers. We will also fight to protect working conditions and against the very unfair moves we see by this government in terms of outsourcing.


We saw the government announce last week that it will outsource Centrelink and Medicare call centre work to Telstra. This action threatens jobs, privacy and service standards. The Department of Human Services employs nearly 7,000 workers in its Medicare and Centrelink call centres, many of them in regional and outer suburban areas. In fact, this action could have a major impact in my electorate, as there is a very large Centrelink call centre in Tweed Heads. These employees deliver very, very high standards in often extremely difficult circumstances as well.


At this stage, the terms of the contract that the government is proposing to enter into with Telstra are not clear, and there are still many unanswered questions. People in my electorate want to know how many local jobs will be cut as a result of these decisions. Also, will Telstra be able to use third-party call centre operators, as it does with its own call centre network? Will call centre work be sent offshore, where Telstra operates call centres? And it is not exactly clear how the privacy of Medicare and Centrelink confidential records will in fact be protected. All of these unanswered questions need to be answered by the Abbott government.


This decision by the Abbott government is yet another attack on the good staff of the Department of Human Services. These actions, along with their constant threat to cut penalty rates as well, are another cruel act by a very cruel government. We see their attacks on workers when it comes to penalty rates, and now we see these threats in terms of outsourcing these very important roles. There are many people in my electorate who are very concerned and many at the Centrelink call centre who are very worried about the future of their jobs.

  I second the motion.




Ms CLAYDON:
  Poverty and extreme poverty in particular continue to be a major issue around the world. According to the United Nations, global extreme poverty—that is, people living on less than $1.25 per day—has halved since 1990, but more than 1.2 billion people remain in extreme poverty today. Ongoing conflict, political unrest, natural disasters and disease outbreaks across multiple continents are putting more and more pressure on already stretched economies, and millions of people have been displaced from their homes.


According to the UNHCR there are more than 52 million refugees and displaced persons worldwide. In Syria alone, more than three million people have been forced to abandon their homes and flee for their lives due to the ongoing conflict. A further 6.5 million are displaced within the country's borders.


In Africa, the World Health Organization have described the current Ebola epidemic as unparalleled in recent times, with more than 2,400 people already killed. They hope that the outbreak can be limited to tens of thousands rather than hundreds of thousands of people.


And, closer to home, thousands of typhoon survivors in the Philippines are still sheltered in tents and makeshift bunkhouses following the devastation of last November's Typhoon Haiyan.


While adding to global poverty, these singular and often catastrophic events are by no means the root cause of poverty in our world, and there are underlying issues that also need to be addressed. I would like to pay tribute to the progressive social networks like Micah Challenge that work tirelessly to ensure that our focus remains on these deeper underlying causes of global poverty.


Australia needs to strengthen its efforts in tackling poverty and injustice through the Millennium Development Goals, not renege on its once bipartisan commitment. The first action the government could take is to reinstate the $7.6 billion that they cut from the overseas aid budget.


Under Labor, overseas aid helped make a difference to the lives and health outcomes of millions of people in countries like Papua New Guinea, Afghanistan and Timor-Leste. Labor doubled Australia's contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. And we near doubled Australia's annual aid budget from $2.9 billion to $5.7 billion in six years of government, despite the tough budgetary environment, so as to maintain the commitment of the previous Howard government to continue to raise the aid budget to 0.5 per cent of GNI. This is a commitment the now Prime Minister also made before being elected and promised to keep as late as December last year, I might add—a commitment that has now been abandoned. 


I am proud to say that Novocastrians are very generous supporters of international development and make a substantial contribution both financially and with our time to nations not so well off as ours. More than 20,000 individuals, 500 local businesses and 55 community and church groups in Newcastle actively support international development. A number of these contributors joined the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international development and me last week in a public forum and raised concerns about the current state of Australia's overseas aid budget. The message of the day was loud and clear: as an economically rich and developed nation, Australia has the responsibility to be a global leader in developing aid programs and funding. 


I draw the House's attention to the ongoing work of Micah Challenge, which this year shines a light on multinational tax dodging and corruption. In their words, the Shine the Light Initiative has been designed:


… to tackle the scourge of tax dodging which robs developing countries on a massive scale of vital revenue for poverty reduction and sustainable human development.


In 2008, it was estimated that more than $120 billion was lost to developing countries through just two forms of multinational tax evasion. That is more than these developing countries receive in aid. As chair of the G20 this year, Australia has a unique opportunity to influence world economic leaders in tackling this problem of multinational tax avoidance. 


I welcome news over the weekend that the G20 members have agreed to implement the common reporting standard on financial account information over the next couple of years. The common reporting standard will mean that tax authorities will automatically exchange information about what individuals and companies have in their bank accounts, so that it becomes much harder to hide funds.


As the G20 chair, Australia should be out in front of the pack, ensuring that these measures are implemented in as timely a manner as possible back here in Australia. But I see that the Treasurer has instead pushed our time frame back 12 months. I think dragging our heels in this regard is no good at all; the government needs to get the legislative processes— (Time expired)

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (11:12):  I am pleased to rise on this motion put forward by the member for Newcastle, but I do have some issues with the wording of the motion. The member for Newcastle comes into this chamber and condemns the government for cutting the overseas aid budget. I am sure the member for Newcastle read the recent budget and has been following the debate in public over the last six years and that the member for Newcastle understands that this nation has currently run deficit budgets for the last six years and it will take at least three years until we can at least get that budget back into a balance. So that means that every year we are continuing to borrow more and more money. So if the member for Newcastle comes in and want to spend more money on foreign aid, a very noble cause, she should say where that money is coming from. Where is that money coming from? So you are going to raise taxes on other businesses? You are quite safe. We would like to hear where the money is coming from. Now we know where it came from for the last six years. We know where a lot of the foreign aid budget came from for the last six years: it was simply borrowed. So for the last six years we were actually borrowing money from overseas to give it back overseas. Even the former foreign affairs minister Bob Carr said you cannot run aid on borrowings. So if it is the proposal, which I seem to hear here from members on the other side, to raise company tax rates to pay more to fund their additional foreign investment—



Ms Claydon interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Ewen Jones
):  The member was heard in silence.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  let them put that up. Let them put that up so every company knows, so everyone out there in the public knows, that your plan, if elected to government, is to raise the company tax rates so you can spend more on foreign aid. 


I would like to give one example of how much of our foreign aid budget does not actually achieve what is intended. The previous government, over its last three years, gave $416 million to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Much of that money went into financing a bridge. There was $160 million to build a bridge. That is all very nice and that is all very well, but I think the taxpayers of Australia should be asking: why can't the Socialist Republic of Vietnam fund their own bridges? If the Australian taxpayer is doing it, that simply leaves the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to spend money on other things. Since we were so generous in giving them $416 million, that freed up funds for the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to buy 12 of the latest model Russian fighter jets last year for $460 million. We, the Australian taxpayer, may as well give the money to Putin's Russia to pay for those jets and let the Russians send those jets to the Vietnamese, because effectively that is what is happening. That is what is happening.


There is another point in the motion I would like to raise. The member for Newcastle talks about 'condemning the government for its lack of action on multinational tax avoidance'. They had six years in government. I would be very interested to hear what they did during their six years in government. Absolutely squat! In contrast, we currently have our Treasurer up in Cairns for the G20, leading the world and leading the OECD nations in tackling that problem. So what we should be doing is changing this motion to say that we condemn the lack of action of the previous government and congratulate our federal Treasurer for taking steps and leading the way on multinational tax avoidance.


The other thing I would quickly like to add is on poverty. What we need to understand is that yes, it is correct that extreme global poverty has been halved since 1990. But we need to understand that it has not been aid that has led to that decline. What it has been is the adoption of free market principles.




Ms Hall:
  Ha!




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  What a sad, sad response. The adoption of free markets and the encouragement of entrepreneurial activity: that is what lifts people out of poverty, not handouts. You combine free market principles, encouragement and reward for entrepreneurial activities and an abundant supply of low-cost electricity. That is what lifts people out of poverty. That is what our history shows and that is what we should be encouraging more and more of to make sure that we actually lift those people out of poverty. (Time expired)

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (11:17):  I have to say that the first thing that the member for Hughes has demonstrated is that he has absolutely no idea about aid at all, absolutely no idea about poverty and absolutely no idea about what is happening in developing countries. I have to say that the member for Hughes stands condemned for standing up in this chamber and showing such contempt for developing countries and showing a total lack of knowledge of anything to do with aid and development. I do not know how a member of parliament can actually get to this place with such limited knowledge as we have seen from the member for Hughes.


The member for Hughes talks about budgets and deficits. Everything that a government chooses to do is about priorities. The government that he is part of has a priority of introducing a Paid Parental Leave scheme whilst at the same time cutting money from a budget to provide assistance to developing countries. Talking about the free market being responsible for the improvement in developing countries once again shows he has absolutely no idea what he is talking about. Has he looked at what has happened when companies like Nestle market baby formulas in countries where there is extreme poverty? Has he looked at the exploitations that have taken place in relation to the free market? It has made it easier to exploit people in developing nations. It has made it easier to increase the level of poverty and it has done absolutely nothing whatsoever to improve the situation.


I really do not know what Putin's Russia and Vietnam have to do with this wonderful motion that the member for Newcastle has before us today, which is about the Millennium Development Goals and progress towards making poverty history. It is about improving public health in developing countries. It is a program that is about linking in to shine the light on tax dodging and corruption, using Australia's position as chair of the G20. It is also about taking this opportunity to get rid of the scourge of tax dodging. Christian Aid has highlighted this, and since 2008 developing countries have lost more than US$160 billion through two forms of multinational corporate tax dodging: price transferring and false invoicing.


I am surprised by the member for Hughes's contribution, but I do not think that there are many members in this House that actually do not want to see extreme poverty and hunger eradicated throughout the world. I think that most members of this parliament want to see the Millennium Development Goals reached. I see that this is a way that we as a country can use our role to actually show leadership and to bring about some changes. I really feel that it has been a missed opportunity.


Oxfam called on the G20 ministers to rein in multinational tax cuts. The world's finance ministers need to crack down on avoidance is what Oxfam says. Oxfam's Helen Szoke said that the international tax regime was 'broken' and needed fixing. Reports from the weekend's G20 actually show that we have failed. We have failed. We have not stepped up to the mark. We have made minimal changes. We have given lip-service to multinational tax evasion. We are actually leading to its entrenchment.


I have to finish by saying this government's contribution to multinational tax evasion has been to open loopholes. We closed them; this government is opening them. It stands condemned for that. We want to see poverty eliminated worldwide.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:22):  I have spoken about foreign aid many times in this place, highlighting that instead of foreign aid being judged by merely the number of dollars spent, the key indicator of a project's success should be what is actually achieved on the ground. That is exactly what Minister Julie Bishop's new aid paradigm achieves.


While there is no way of waving a magic wand and suddenly making all foreign aid more efficient and effective, there are a number of ways aid recipients, donors, workers, governments and the private sector can work together to improve the efficiency of our system. The cost of aid delivery on occasions appears to outweigh the aid itself, and in quite properly trying to protect the integrity of our aid system we all too often burden ourselves with the bureaucracy and inflexibility that can overwhelm the good intentions.


There are a number of effective partnership relationships to improve aid delivery ranging from public-private partnerships to the whole question of social entrepreneurship. At least 80 per cent of today's assistance comes from non-public sources, up 30 per cent from 40 years ago, according to USAID. It is estimated that from an initial investment of $2.1 billion in public funds, USAID was able to leverage an additional $5.8 billion in private funds and contributions.


From my discussions with Abt JTA, a private aid consulting firm doing some great work in Papua New Guinea, they believe that leverage is crucial. There has been little effort in the past to use the aid program to leverage funds from others and develop collaborative partnerships. However, there is considerable potential to do so. William Easterly, a professor of economics at NYU, believes that is it is important—especially for Western nations—to identify that development happens mainly through home-grown efforts. Easterly believes that the developed nations provide foreign aid and development programs through the lens of Western culture with a focus on significant bureaucracy and set approaches that do not involve the people whom the services are supposed to benefit.


While I was in Papua New Guinea at the end of last year with the Australian Defence Force, I was inspired to some extent by a discussion with Sir Peter Barter and Father Jan Czuba, the President of Divine Word University, about the benefits of institution-to-institution support as an effective method of aid delivery. Father Jan has focused programs within the university to be primarily health and education based so that PNG graduates contribute back to the community in areas that are needed the most. The PNG LNG Project, a joint venture between ExxonMobil and Oil Search, has developed an efficient community health impact management program, which is a leading example of a privately funded aid program.


Significant improvements in facilities' healthcare delivery have occurred in the PNG LNG Project villages. There are many avenues the Australian government can take to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our foreign aid and, at the end of the day, value for our taxpayer dollars. The coalition understands that our aid effort should be focused firmly within our region, where Australia's interests lie. The foreign minister has also announced some performance targets for the revised program, which are: reducing poverty—by July 2015, all country and regional programs will have aid investment plans that describe how Australia's aid will promote economic growth in ways that provide pathways out of poverty; focusing on the Indonesia-Pacific region, increasing the proportion of country program aid that is spent in the Indo-Pacific region to at least 90 per cent from 2014-15; and empowering women and girls—more than 80 per cent of investments regardless of their objectives will effectively address gender issues in their implementation.


I would also like to point out that, while those opposite like to stand and complain that Australia is not spending enough on aid, we are now achieving greater aid results for every dollar spent under the coalition's paradigm than under Labor's reckless money-throwing approach. Even Bob Carr acknowledged that a nation cannot have an unsustainable aid budget. The member for Sydney committed Labor to spend an extra $16 billion on the aid program yet has not revealed where this additional $16 billion will come from. Labor even raided $30 million from the emergency fund for its blow-out on border protection costs. Yes, Labor was its own third largest recipient of foreign aid budget. Fortunately, the coalition has now restored this money. This shows how careless and irresponsible Labor is with Australia's foreign aid. Only the coalition can be trusted to deliver foreign aid responsibly and in a way that will see the best outcomes for each dollar spent.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (11:27):  There are a number of aspects of this particular resolution. One of them is the foreign aid budget. In relation to the wild outburst by the member for Hughes, where he used the phrase 'the Socialist Republic of Vietnam' five times to in some way disparage foreign aid to Vietnam, he has not been on the forefront of insisting that this very government he is part of not have a foreign aid program in Vietnam. This kind of attempt to in some way insinuate that it is money misspent, and only by the previous government, is absolutely preposterous.


On the foreign aid budget; everyone knows the argument that there have been budget deficits. Let us put to one side parental care and other issues. Even if you have a deficit, you have to make decisions. I think Bob Geldof put it very well in The Guardian during his recent visit to Australia. He said


You are one of the richest countries in the world … You can’t mess with your sovereign promise to the poor, they’re too vulnerable, they’re too weak.


Similarly, another person with a bit more expertise than the member for Hughes, Professor Damien Kingsbury; the Director of the Centre for Citizenship, Development and Human Rights at Deakin University, on 14 May in Crikey spoke of 'savage aid cuts'. He spoke of the current provisions 'ignoring' Millennium Development Goals, and he said that the earlier commitment to lift aid to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2017-18 'now appears entirely gone'. Karen Barlow, on ABC radio straight after the budget, could speak of 'the biggest savings measure of the budget' and spoke of a fundamental reshaping of foreign aid. We can come about the question of the deficit, but decisions have to be made by government as to how they do it. Quite clearly, the main target was foreign aid.


We come here and hear arguments that, supposedly, the previous speaker has got some 'scientific analysis' which is only known to her and that she is already able to demonstrate that supposedly every foreign aid dollar now being spent is far more effective than those spent for the last 20 years. As  to where she gets that evidence from, I doubt there is any source. On 18 July, the Prime Minister, in response to correspondence from me, wrote saying:


It is vital that we help developing countries capture revenue on profits earned in their jurisdiction so they can establish and protect their tax bases. Australia is using its leadership in the G20 to ensure developing countries can participate in and benefit from the reforms.


They are noble sentiments and I would hope that there is some action. However, one has to see this in the context of a government which closed loopholes for international tax evasion. It was a major measure. They actually reduced the loopholes. So to come out here now and say that we are going to be in the forefront is quite questionable.


I also note that the Treasurer has been shouting from the rooftops that, with regard to the question of exchanging financial information, we are supposedly going to be at the forefront of a move towards an international reporting standard that is common. However, the early adopter group of nations, including the major G20 powers such as the United Kingdom, Argentina, France, Germany, India and Italy, have a timetable far in advance of Australia.


The other question here is a question of global poverty. Obviously, there is some comfort to be had from advice that says that 21 per cent of people in the developing world live on $1.25 a day compared with 43 per cent in 1990 and 52 per cent in 1981. I do not doubt that there have been advances, but I notice an article in the latest edition of the New York Review by Ian Johnson called 'The Chinese Invade Africa'. He noted that whilst there is a significant number of people in Africa now described as middle class—300 million Africans spend $2 to $20 a day and they are supposedly middle class—he noted that 60 per cent of those people are in the $2 to $4 category. Indisputably, there is a large challenge ahead of us.


I want to say that Ban Ki-moon, amongst others, has certainly hit the nail on the head with his comment:


We all know the heavy toll taken by corruption. More than a trillion dollars stolen or lost, every year—money badly needed for the Millennium Development Goals.


However, we cannot totally blame African leaders for, quite frankly, the rampant tax evasion. In recent weeks there has been a big focus on Amazon and Google: they are basically operating in countries, doing offshore operations and then claiming it has got nothing to do with the entity on the mainland. There are figures produced that developing countries only take 13 per cent of GDP and taxes compared to rich countries taking an average of 34 per cent; a discrepancy mainly due to tax evasion.


We now have a situation where there is talk of long overdue of international— (Time expired)

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra—Chief Government Whip) (11:32):  I rise to speak on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australia Fund Bill 2014 proposed joint committee on the Australia Fund. It is a bill, interestingly, to establish a joint committee and it is to look at this question as to whether an Australia Fund would be useful. I think the origins of it are well known: the member for Fairfax, as leader of the Palmer United Party, asked us to look at the concept of this. The terms of reference are quite wide, but I think one can understand why a motion of this type is being moved: from time to time Queensland in particular has been affected by drought and floods, which we are all very familiar with, and the manner in which we deal with these issues has always required government assistance in one form or another to deal with the very significant disadvantage that people are sometimes afflicted with as a result of national emergencies of that type.


The question is: how should you look after people's needs? How might you respond to them? It is being suggested that we should have a committee to inquire into the need for a rural and manufacturing industries fund to deal with crises and natural disasters and to look at matters relating to emergency or ongoing financial relief. It would look at loans—whether guarantors might be necessary to purchase all or part of an existing loan, whether to waive interest or to capitalise it, whether to assume control of a business for a particular period, whether to grant funds to an appropriate industry body and whether to grant funds to a business for the purposes of purchasing new technology to make it more economically viable—and also look at bankruptcy and insolvency laws and how they might impact.


Let me make it very clear. This is an inquiry to look into issues that we all regard as important and that governments have over a long period of time responded to. It is really a question of whether there are better ways of undertaking that task.


Committees provide an opportunity for organisations and individuals to put views to us and to have those matters dealt with on the public record. Parliament's committee system has significantly strengthened our parliamentary arrangements here in Australia for dealing with these sorts of issues. The make-up of this particular committee will include a balance of government and non-government members and senators, and obviously any position that might be adopted would require cross-party support. Having a committee with broad representation is likely to ensure that we get a thorough investigation, particularly as to whether there is a need for a fund. Such a committee would be able to undertake inquiries around Australia, not just in Queensland but where natural disasters occur frequently. And, of course, we will treat with respect the committee's views, just as we do with all other committees.


In the end, the response will be a matter for government. Nobody knows where an inquiry of this sort might lead, but I am sure all of those who sit on the committee will bring their conscientious efforts to produce an outcome that is worthy of consideration. I would simply note that, in terms of some of the media commentary around industry subsidies and handouts, the government has expressed some views and the Treasurer had something to say. I think it is useful to quote because it may help to inform the committee and the way in which they look at this issue. He says the government believes that 'industry, being in the business of relying on its own enterprise, should not become reliant on taxpayer support, because ultimately industry assistance is revenue from another person'. I think the Treasurer was making it clear that the government does not necessarily support the creation of a new government owned industry assistance bank. The members who are giving consideration to this matter ought to have, I think, some regard to those thoughts.


The issues raised in the terms of reference are challenging, and I am sure there will be a wide range of submissions put. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that we cannot predetermine the outcome of an inquiry of any committee, but the government will await the recommendations of the report and will obviously give proper consideration to the matters that the committee raises.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:38):  It is clear from the contribution from the member for Berowra that the government supports this legislation, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australia Fund Bill 2014, which sets up a committee, but is not necessarily committing to the establishment of an Australia Fund. It seems to me that what the government is really doing is playing along with the Palmer United Party's proposition that they want to set up a committee to do this but at the end of the day reserving its judgement on it. I believe that that is simply a political move on the part of the government and a tactical move to stall and delay any decision on this matter. But it also raises the question of just what deals have been made between the government and the Palmer United Party with respect to this whole issue, because it is clear from comments that the Treasurer has already made and comments that the Prime Minister has made that at no stage in the past was this government going to look at providing any form of direct assistance to industries, farmers and the like, but suddenly it has changed its view and is now prepared to consider what options are available. Why would a government change its view and consider what options are available were it not for perhaps having done deals with the Palmer United Party?


Again, that is a matter that goes to another statement made by the Prime Minister before the election that this is a Prime Minister and a government that will not make deals with Independents and minor parties but instead will lead as a government and govern as a government. So much for that commitment made to the Australian people before the election. It is clear that once you are in government all bets are off, all promises are in the past, and we now face a new landscape. It really highlights the hypocrisy of the government that it was prepared to say one thing before the election and another after.


But it is even more concerning because this proposition effectively flags giving hope to industries and farmers that are perhaps struggling right now and need some form of government assistance. By setting up a committee to look at what is available, it gives them some hope. The reality is that, by the time the committee is set up, carries out its inquiry, prepares its report and brings it back to parliament, and then the government responds to that report, we will be into the next election. It means that these people will not be able to get any form of assistance whatsoever.


What is even more concerning about that is that the member for Fairfax, in his address in support of his own bill, strongly made the point that one of the issues of concern to the farmers and industries that need assistance is the delay that they are experiencing as a result of government processes. So here they are being critical of government processes but then setting up another process which does exactly the same—it causes delay, it causes uncertainty. I suspect that, by the time this matter is resolved by the government, anyone who needs assistance right now will have moved on; it will be well and truly too late.


This is a government that has made it clear that it is not interested in manufacturing in this country. It has already turned its back on the manufacturing sector. We saw it very clearly with respect to car makers in this country, we saw it with respect to SPC Ardmona workers and we have seen it with respect to numerous other industries that hang off those sectors, both in the food area and in the direct manufacturing area. We are now also seeing it with respect to the construction of naval ships here in this country. This is a government that is not prepared to lend one iota of support to manufacturing, yet it pretends, by saying it is prepared to look at a proposition put forward by the Palmer United Party, that it might do so. The government simultaneously says that it cares about farmers in Queensland, yet we know that it is very, very slow in delivering the kind of assistance that they already need and that is available through drought relief schemes and the like. It is just dragging its heels in respect to providing the support that it could provide.


There are mechanisms available and already in place if the government wants to support both industry and farmers. There are funds available and already in place. Although the government has cut almost half a billion dollars of funding to manufacturing and industry generally, there are still funds available. Let us look at the processes that are available, improve those if we need to and stop wasting time with what is nothing more than a delaying proposition by the Abbott government.

 (Makin) (11:38):  It is clear from the contribution from the member for Berowra that the government supports this legislation, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australia Fund Bill 2014, which sets up a committee, but is not necessarily committing to the establishment of an Australia Fund. It seems to me that what the government is really doing is playing along with the Palmer United Party's proposition that they want to set up a committee to do this but at the end of the day reserving its judgement on it. I believe that that is simply a political move on the part of the government and a tactical move to stall and delay any decision on this matter. But it also raises the question of just what deals have been made between the government and the Palmer United Party with respect to this whole issue, because it is clear from comments that the Treasurer has already made and comments that the Prime Minister has made that at no stage in the past was this government going to look at providing any form of direct assistance to industries, farmers and the like, but suddenly it has changed its view and is now prepared to consider what options are available. Why would a government change its view and consider what options are available were it not for perhaps having done deals with the Palmer United Party?


Again, that is a matter that goes to another statement made by the Prime Minister before the election that this is a Prime Minister and a government that will not make deals with Independents and minor parties but instead will lead as a government and govern as a government. So much for that commitment made to the Australian people before the election. It is clear that once you are in government all bets are off, all promises are in the past, and we now face a new landscape. It really highlights the hypocrisy of the government that it was prepared to say one thing before the election and another after.


But it is even more concerning because this proposition effectively flags giving hope to industries and farmers that are perhaps struggling right now and need some form of government assistance. By setting up a committee to look at what is available, it gives them some hope. The reality is that, by the time the committee is set up, carries out its inquiry, prepares its report and brings it back to parliament, and then the government responds to that report, we will be into the next election. It means that these people will not be able to get any form of assistance whatsoever.


What is even more concerning about that is that the member for Fairfax, in his address in support of his own bill, strongly made the point that one of the issues of concern to the farmers and industries that need assistance is the delay that they are experiencing as a result of government processes. So here they are being critical of government processes but then setting up another process which does exactly the same—it causes delay, it causes uncertainty. I suspect that, by the time this matter is resolved by the government, anyone who needs assistance right now will have moved on; it will be well and truly too late.


This is a government that has made it clear that it is not interested in manufacturing in this country. It has already turned its back on the manufacturing sector. We saw it very clearly with respect to car makers in this country, we saw it with respect to SPC Ardmona workers and we have seen it with respect to numerous other industries that hang off those sectors, both in the food area and in the direct manufacturing area. We are now also seeing it with respect to the construction of naval ships here in this country. This is a government that is not prepared to lend one iota of support to manufacturing, yet it pretends, by saying it is prepared to look at a proposition put forward by the Palmer United Party, that it might do so. The government simultaneously says that it cares about farmers in Queensland, yet we know that it is very, very slow in delivering the kind of assistance that they already need and that is available through drought relief schemes and the like. It is just dragging its heels in respect to providing the support that it could provide.


There are mechanisms available and already in place if the government wants to support both industry and farmers. There are funds available and already in place. Although the government has cut almost half a billion dollars of funding to manufacturing and industry generally, there are still funds available. Let us look at the processes that are available, improve those if we need to and stop wasting time with what is nothing more than a delaying proposition by the Abbott government.


Debate adjourned.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (11:43):  I move:



That this House:




(1) notes:




(a
)


that Peter Greste has had a distinguished career as a journalist with CNN, Reuters, WTN, BBC and Al Jazeera;




(b
)


the long pre-trial incarceration, refusal of bail, procedural errors, extraordinary allegations, and acknowledged extremely severe sentences; and




(c)


widespread international condemnation of the process, characterised by United States Secretary of State John Kerry's comment that it was 'a chilling and draconian sentence'; and




(2) calls on the Government to continue pressing Egyptian authorities for justice and raising these human rights issues in all viable international fora.



At the outset, I thank the member for Macmillan for initiating this motion. He approached me about this and asked if I could frame some words. We also had some discussions with legal representatives for Peter Greste to make sure that we did not go against his interests.


As I indicated in a previous contribution in relation to this matter, Peter Greste is a world-renowned journalist. He has worked on four continents and in 2011 received a Peabody Award. That is an important ingredient of this reality: this person is internationally recognised, he is reputable, he is renowned for his work. In that context it is preposterous to say, as Egyptian authorities have, that because he works for Al Jazeera, which is based in Qatar, and because of Qatar's association with the Muslim Brotherhood, in some convoluted, irresponsible fashion, this supposedly indicates that he is supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was arrested on 29 December last and commented on 26 January, the next month, 'I have no desire to weaken Egypt nor in any way see it struggle…Our arrest doesn't seem to be about our work at all. It seems to be about staking out what the government here considers to be normal and acceptable.' 


Obviously the seeming public reality is that because they engaged with the Muslim Brotherhood, because they gave them an opportunity to put their views, because they sought their interpretation of events—and they are somewhat controversial, quite frankly, in Egypt. I recall going to rallies against the previous Morsi government's measures against the Coptic minority on a number of occasions and I deplored its actions. There is some controversy about what occurred in regard to Morsi's replacement by a military led regime, so it is legitimate for reporters to go out there and ask for alternative points of view.


On 29 January Egypt indicated that it would prosecute 20 Al Jazeera journalists, including Greste. Typical of world reaction was the comment of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on 1 February, 'We urge the Egyptian authorities to promptly release all journalists imprisoned for carrying out legitimate news reporting activities in exercise of their fundamental human rights.' There are grave questions about the way this whole case has been conducted. There was a 22-minute report on the arrest and interrogation with sci-fi film music in the background. There was the question of photoshopped  pictures of Greste with high ranking Egyptian government officials, images of cars on a bridge and a documentary produced by Greste on a very controversial issue—soccer!


The conviction was widely condemned by Western media and governments. Deakin University lecturer on Middle Eastern studies, Mat Hardy, said that the reality was that there would be only be one outcome: 'Once the case started moving it didn't matter what evidence was presented.' British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, said, 'Egypt should review unacceptable sentences against Egyptian and international journalists and show commitment to freedom of the press.' Similarly, the Secretary of State in the United States, John Kerry, said, 'The conviction and chilling, draconian sentences by the Cairo Criminal Court of three Al Jazeera journalists…lacked many fundamental norms of due process, is a deeply disturbing setback to Egypt's transition.' 


The wide-ranging allegations remind me somewhat of a book I am reading at the moment—Jacek Hugo-Bader's book Kolyma Diaries: A Journey into Russia's Haunted Hinterland. In that there is a person who was sentenced to 20 years jail under article 58 of the Soviet measures because he, as a student leader, was approached by other students to look at a program they had, a political program. He was then jailed for 20 years under three provisions—terrorism, group activity and anti-Soviet agitation. I am afraid that some of the allegations against Greste and co. would seem to be those wide-ranging comments.


I am pleased that on 10 September the Egyptian Ambassador to Australia, Dr Hassan El-Laithy, commented, 'I hope when the procedures come to an end, in the courts, everything will be cleared, that's what I really hope for, I hope that he will be reunited with his family, sooner rather than later. And I assure you that this is the real position—we hope to see him back home.'


I think the Australian parliament, regardless of political views, regardless of the level of activity on human rights, regardless of members' interests in international matters, is united in the need for this to happen. We are also somewhat reassured by comments on 7 July by the President of Egypt saying, 'I wished they were deported right after they were arrested instead of getting put on trial.' So between the lines there is some hope. I am pleased to join with the member for McMillan and others today in calling for Australia to raise this matter in every international fora possible.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Randall
):  Is the motion seconded?

",HoR,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,"<title>Greste, Mr Peter</title>",PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS,27,1
"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:48):  I am happy to second the motion, Mr Deputy Speaker. I rise to speak on this motion today with a heavy heart. On the day of Peter Greste's sentencing, 23 June, I introduced a motion to this place commending the government for their continued representations on his behalf. I acknowledge that my colleagues from all sides joined with me in the hope of a just and proper outcome; however, this was not the case. Unfortunately, on this occasion justice was denied. Being a journalist is not a crime; telling the truth is not terrorism. I spoke with Peter's parents, Lois and Juris, following the sentencing and they assured me that they and Peter were not giving up and that they would appeal and make every possible effort. The Australian government has not given up either and continues to take up opportunities to raise this case with the Egyptian government and authorities.


As a result of the large number of official representations already made on Peter's case since December 2013, the government is confident that Egyptian authorities are fully aware of the importance of this case. The foreign minister has assured me that the Australian Embassy in Cairo will continue to provide consular assistance to Peter, and this includes regular visits. Unfortunately, Peter Greste's case must exhaust all legal processes before a pardon or presidential clemency can even be raised.


There have been a number of instances where our government has made representations to the Egyptian authorities, and the government has made it clear that it supports an expedited appeal process so that this case can be finally resolved and so that Peter can be allowed to return home to his family. From Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop and Attorney-General Senator Brandis to senior bureaucrats, including Australia's Ambassador to Egypt, Dr Ralph King, all have continued to make representations at the highest levels on behalf of Peter Greste. Obviously not all the behind-the-scenes works are for public discussion. Prime Minister Abbott spoke by telephone to the then interim President Mansour on 27 March, expressed his appreciation for the President's letter to Mr Greste's parents and sought assistance from the President to bring about an early resolution of the case and Mr Greste's release. 


The case of Peter Greste is incredibly concerning. A free press is in every person's and every country's interests. As Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated:


A free press will help every country, including Egypt, to be better in the months and years ahead and obviously a free press is not compatible with harassing journalists going about their ordinary business.


The trial of Peter Greste has also received notable international reactions. In January the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, said:


We have consistently expressed our serious concern about the limits on freedom of peaceful assembly and expression in Egypt … The United States again urges all sides to condemn and prevent violence and to move towards an inclusive political process based on the rule of law and respect for the fundamental freedoms of all Egyptians.


The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also called for the release of Mr Greste. A spokesperson for the high commissioner said that the arrest was based on 'vague charges', was of great concern and had increased fears among the general media. In a White House press briefing in February, spokesman Jay Carney said that the tension was 'of deep concern' to the administration: 'We have strongly urged the Egyptian government to drop these charges.'


With the ongoing appeal process, I think I can speak for all Australians when I say we are hopeful for a positive outcome, and our hearts go out to Lois and Juris and their family during this tough time. 


Journalism is an honourable profession. We rely on the integrity of journalists as a primary source of our information—information upon which we base judgements and decisions. We rely on the courage of journalists who report from troubled places, who place their lives at risk to report the facts. Peter Greste is a journalist of integrity, a journalist of courage. He is a constant reminder of the importance of freedom of speech, particularly in the Middle East. I am honoured to stand today beside my colleagues from all sides of politics to demonstrate our united and unwavering support for Peter and his colleagues. I look forward to the day when we can welcome Peter Greste to this place and thank him for his courage and integrity. I commend the motion to the House.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (11:53):  I rise to support the important motion moved by the member for Werriwa and commend him for moving it. In most democracies the media and the judiciary are two parts of a single story. The best of these institutions are motivated by the same objective: the pursuit of truth in the interests of all the people. Nations function best when the press and the justice system serve to strengthen not weaken each other. But when these institutions fail, and if they are pitted against each other, if one or other is compromised, freedom and justice are threatened and contaminated. It is real, honest, innocent people who can be the victims. So it was in the appalling and heart-wrenching case of Peter Greste in Egypt this year.


As the member for Werriwa mentioned, Peter is a distinguished journalist with more than 25 years of experience working for an array of high-quality agencies, including Reuters, CNN, WTN, BBC and Al Jazeera. His experience in the industry is extensive and diverse, having worked for bureaus in London, Bosnia, South Africa, Chile, Mexico, Belarus, Afghanistan, Kenya, Somalia and most recently, of course, in Egypt. It was in this last location that Peter became a news story himself, as the injustice and unfairness that he suffered at the hands of the Egyptian judicial system was disseminated around the world.


Accused and convicted of spreading false news and conspiring against certain powerful groups in Egypt, he was shamefully sentenced in June this year to seven years in prison just for doing his job as a journalist. What is more, the process that led to his arrest and conviction, along with that of his two other colleagues from Al Jazeera, was fraught with procedural irregularities and extraordinary breaches of the principles that underlie any just and reasonable system of law. Throughout this whole process, the government and the opposition here in Australia have been united in condemnation of the miscarriage of justice that is the Peter Greste case. At what must be an awful time for his family, for his parents and for his brothers, Mike and Andrew, who live here in Australia, our hearts go out to them. We have no alternative but to maintain hope that the appeal lodged in August will be successful and that Peter will be granted freedom.


We all heard the words of Egypt's envoy to Australia that Peter will be back home in Brisbane sooner rather than later, and many of us were encouraged by them, although we have learned over the past few months not to get our hopes up. Our message to the Greste family must be that the Australian parliament will stand with them for as long as it takes to free their beloved son and brother. Peter Greste's brother Andrew wrote an article recently in TheSydney Morning Herald. He described how, throughout most of his professional career, the idea of constitutionally enshrined press freedom was just an abstract principle. It is an important principle but it is not an abstract one. It needs to be protected and advanced. It needs constant attention.


In many countries, freelance journalists and foreign correspondents risk their lives every day to maintain our awareness of the situations unfolding throughout the world. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, we have seen 36 journalists killed on the job around the world this year. We have seen the shocking and deplorable public executions of Steven Sotloff and James Foley in Syria that haunted televisions around the world. And there have been less-well-publicised but equally devastating murders in Iraq, Israel, Ukraine, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico and Africa. Each and every death, and each and every journalist who lives in fear of harm or detention, is a tragedy for the profession and a tragedy for all of us who depend on their work for information and for knowledge.


The Labor Party believes fundamentally in the freedom of journalists to be able to do their work, as does, I think, every member in this place—and I commend the member for Ryan for her remarks a moment ago. We will continue to stand beside Peter and his family, and all the journalists who risk their lives in the course of their important work. They should never be imprisoned or harmed for doing their job and for reporting the news. That is why this is an important motion moved by the member for Werriwa, and that is why I am proud to support it.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2014-09-22,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (11:58):  I would also like to acknowledge the member for Werriwa and thank him for bringing this important motion to the parliament. I rise to speak in support of this motion. Peter Greste has a distinguished career with a number of media organisations working right across the world. His plight first came to my attention in December when his brother Andrew, who is a constituent of mine and is a farmer out near Wee Waa, sent me an email outlining the situation that his brother Peter was in. At that time, I contacted the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop. I understand that, in a myriad of ways, Australia has been endeavouring to help Peter Greste return home.


Peter Greste graduated in journalism from the University of Queensland. He has worked everywhere from regional Victoria to Afghanistan. The respect that his colleagues have shown for him throughout the trial has been an accurate indication of the regard in which he is held. Mr Greste is no stranger to tragedy, and indeed in 2005 he witnessed his producer, Kate Peyton, being killed by being shot in the back outside their hotel in the Somali capital of Mogadishu. In reflection on her death, he said:


We were working together on the story, just the two of us, and we both knew what we were getting into.


It was a risk we both judged to be worth taking, if only because so few reporters have been into Somalia in the past decade, and nobody can hope to make a considered judgment of either Africa or Islamic extremism without understanding why that country has remained so anarchic.


Peter had only been in Egypt for two weeks when he was arrested in his hotel room. Since his arrest his legal team have announced to the public that they have lodged an appeal against his conviction. At the moment we do not have any clear idea about the time lines for this appeal process. This is obviously distressing not only for Peter Greste but for his entire family. Mr Greste is receiving regular visits from consular officials in Cairo and we will continue to provide support to Mr Greste. Mr Greste's parents, who have been based in Cairo since late June, have also been able to visit Peter and I would like to also comment on the great courage and dignity that Mr and Mrs Greste have shown through this incredible ordeal.


The Australian government has, at every opportunity, expressed concern about the way in which this case has unfolded. Representations have been made to the relevant Egyptian authorities throughout Mr Greste's trial, including by the foreign minister and the Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister has said, these journalists were just doing their job. We do have to acknowledge that Mr Greste is subject to the Egyptian justice system, however frustrating that may be. The Prime Minister has publicly stated his commitment to taking all reasonable action to ensure Peter Greste and his colleagues are released as quickly as possible. The Australian government has been clear: we respect the outcome of the recent elections in Egypt, but Mr Greste's trial highlights the concern that we have about Egypt's commitment to the transition to democracy. 


Inherent to any good democracy is a free press. These sentiments have been echoed by leaders around the world including US Secretary of State John Kerry and United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron, as well as representatives of the highest level from New Zealand, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also issued a statement about their deep concern at the court decision of 24 June. In the statement, Secretary-General Ban described the trial as having proceedings that clearly appear not to meet the basic fair trial standards. It is clear that the Egyptian authorities are completely aware that the Australian government is seeking Mr Greste's release in order for him to return to his family as quickly as possible. We support an expeditious appeal process and we will continue to work with Mr Greste and his family throughout this process. I acknowledge the great courage that Peter Greste has shown through this horrendous ordeal and my sincere hope is that he returns to Australia sooner rather than later.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (12:03):  I rise to support this important resolution moved by the member for Werriwa—important because it is an opportunity for us to show as a parliament our absolute unity in support of Peter Greste's release and our support for freedom of the press. Peter Greste, of course, has been detained in Egypt since December of last year. Peter was charged with defaming Egypt and having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. In June of this year he was convicted of these charges and sentenced to seven years in jail. Peter is detained with his colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who have also been convicted of defaming Egypt and having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Baher Mohamed was also sentenced to an additional three years in prison for possession of ammunition. This referred to a spent bullet casing he found on the ground during a protest in those tumultuous times in Egypt.


Freedom of the press is something that we take for granted here in Australia. Our governments do not always like what they read in newspapers, nor do we as parliamentarians. But we accept that openness is a part of our democracy. I welcome the idea that Egypt has gone down the path of democracy with an independent judiciary. But, when a journalist simply going about his duties finds himself breaking the law, it is very clear that Egypt has much more work to do to adopt all of the institutions that are essential to democracy. I find it unfortunate that the Egyptian government cites one of these institutions, the independence of the judiciary, to justify its failure to protect another: the freedom of the press.


There is no doubt that the work of journalists, particularly in the zones that Peter Greste worked in, is challenging and takes great courage. It is courage based upon the principle that people have a right to know what is going on in the world. Every day journalists place their own safety behind the principle of getting access to information and informing the citizenry of what is occurring. Around the world, many journalists—too many journalists—are killed each year or imprisoned for simply doing their job. The Peter Greste case brings home to Australia that this is the case.


It is a fact that, as Thomas Jefferson said, you cannot limit freedom of the press without destroying it. What we have here is a case where that freedom of the press is being restricted. The press are being intimidated by the fact that not just Peter Greste but also his colleagues from Al Jazeera have gone through what has been described as a farcical trial. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance report that according to the International Federation of Journalists 88 journalists and media workers have been killed so far this year. That is an extraordinary figure! It is an extraordinary figure which shows the danger that people put themselves in.


Peter Greste is someone who left Australia in the 1990s to pursue his dream of becoming a foreign correspondent. He worked for the BBC and Reuters, where he covered Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. In 2011 he started with Al Jazeera and, in that year, he also won a prestigious Peabody Award for a BBC report on Somalia.


One of the lawyers for the Al Jazeera journalists concluded their final argument by saying:


This is not a trial for these defendants alone—this is a trial of all journalists.


Our entire parliament stands, as well as with Peter Greste, with the Greste family, who have shown such courage. On behalf of the opposition, we give every support to the government in its endeavours to ensure Peter Greste's early release.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (12:08):  I rise to add my voice to those of my parliamentary colleagues who have today shared their concern and frustration that Australian journalist Peter Greste remains behind bars in Egypt's Tora prison. I heartily welcome this opportunity to ensure Australia and the international community do not stop fighting for Mr Greste's freedom. As we have heard, Mr Greste was erroneously found guilty of spreading false news and supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. He was sentenced to seven years in jail. As a former television journalist myself for many years, I was shocked by both the conviction and the severity of the sentence. This shock has resonated with journalists and foreign correspondents around the world. To describe this finding as unjust is a monumental understatement.


Peter Greste is a man who was simply doing his job: reporting the facts with integrity and with balance, without fear or favour. He was also, and is, a journalist of great distinction and courage. His track record speaks for itself. Mr Greste was not pushing any agenda other than that of a reporter seeking to report the truth.


In 1991, Mr Greste first left Australia to pursue his dreams of becoming a foreign correspondent. He had a long and notable career reporting from conflict zones, shining a light on some of the most disturbing aspects of humanity. He spent time working across Africa, the Middle East and South America for media outlets including CNN, Reuters, BBC and Al Jazeera. Notably, he reported from Kabul on the emergence of the Taliban. He returned to report from Afghanistan after 9/11. Mr Greste has also spent time in places including Bosnia, Mexico, Chile, Kenya and Tanzania. He moved to Mombasa on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast in 2004, where he became a freelancer.


In 2011, as we have heard, he won a prestigious Peabody Award for his documentary Somalia: Land of Anarchy. Six years earlier, his producer, Kate Peyton, was shot dead while they were reporting from Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. It shows the absolute courage and determination of the man that he would return to the scene of such an horrendous incident to complete the report they had been working on together. Peter Greste said later of Ms Peyton's death:


I was with her when she was shot. We were working together on the story, just the two of us, and we both knew what we were getting into. It was a risk we both judged to be worth taking, if only because so few reporters have been into Somalia in the past decade, and nobody can hope to make a considered judgement of either Africa or Islamic extremism without understanding why that country has remained so anarchic. So when I am asked who cares what happens at a dusty, poverty stricken, anarchic backwater on a corner of Africa, the answer is as simple as it is obvious: Kate Peyton cared.


Peter Greste laid bare the confronting truths about Somalia for the world to see, as he did in Egypt. Today I call on the Egyptian authorities to do the right thing and to release Mr Greste and his colleagues immediately. As we have heard, he was jailed along with Al Jazeera colleagues Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed.


Our government will continue to take all opportunities to raise this case with the Egyptian government. The government has made clear that it supports an expeditious appeal process, so that this case can be finally resolved and Mr Greste allowed to return home to his family. The Australian embassy in Cairo will continue to provide consular assistance to Mr Greste, including visiting him on regular occasions. I commend foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott for the way they have handled this terrible situation. They, along with other Australian authorities and officials, have been making numerous representations to the Egyptian authorities.


We must now wait for the appeal to come before the court. We—of course, all parliamentarians here in Australia—are incredibly hopeful of a more favourable outcome. Egypt must realise that a free press is a crucial element to a democracy. I urge the court to make the right decision and send Mr Greste home to his family.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (13:15): I rise in support of the Australian Education Amendment (School Funding Guarantee) Bill 2014. This bill is very important for two main reasons. Firstly, this government, since coming to office, has broken its promise that no school would be worse off and the promise it made at the last election that it would keep the Gonski school funding model. This model is so critically important to ensure funding and resources are allocated on a needs basis. Unfortunately, the government has trashed that model. Secondly, Labor opposes this government's savage cuts to school education, whether it be in early childhood, primary or secondary school and all the way through to higher education. That legislation is currently before the Senate committee. These cuts will have devastating impacts on Australian students, the education sector and the economy. This bill should not be necessary, and it would not be necessary if the government had kept its word and fully implemented the Gonski school funding model.


Labor recognises the need for a national needs-based funding model designed to support the student resource standard by allocating extra funding for students with a disability, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and students from rural and regional communities to ensure that every student across the country is allocated the resources they need to achieve their best and that every school can be its best. Students support this model. Mums and dads support this model. Schools support this model. The sector supports this model. The Liberal Party supposedly also supported this model.


I remind the House that it was the now Minister for Education who on 29 August 2013, days before the last election, said to the mums and dads and the teachers of Australia:


… you can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school …


Like most things promised by those opposite before the election, the minister was misleading the Australian people.


Despite the reckless actions of this government, the bill before us today will stop Australian schools sliding backwards. It will put a stop to the savage cuts to schools that have been occurring under state Liberal governments, including more than $180 million in cuts inflicted upon students in Western Australia by Premier Barnett this year alone. These cuts are leaving our schools worse off. Left to continue, these cuts will lead to the decline of our educational facilities and education standards, leaving Australia poorer as a nation. Australian education standards and Australian graduates are world class. This government, with its budget of broken promises, wants to diminish Australia's intellectual reputation.


Labor had a plan for our schools, a plan that would have seen the Commonwealth, states and territories work together to improve educational standards for Australians everywhere. Tony Abbott pledged to honour his agreement to the Gonski school funding model but has since walked away from it. He has walked away for cynical political purposes. In doing this, he has put at risk a once-in-a-generation opportunity to ensure that every Australian school is of the highest standard and that every student gets a fair and equal opportunity to achieve their best.


It is time for Tony Abbott to start admitting he got it wrong. It is time for the Prime Minister to fund years 5 and 6 in the budget and roll out the full agreement, as he promised to do before the election. No weasel words from the Prime Minister or from the Minister for Education can take away the fact that there was a clear commitment to Gonski—including signs in the member for Boothby's electorate on election day saying that the Liberal Party would match the Labor Party dollar for dollar. It is time for the government to keep that promise. But it is also important that we ensure that the states and territories do their bit to lift our education standards.


This bill will tie the Commonwealth funding for schools in every state and territory to the very basic principle that there are no more state education budget cuts. This bill is an important part of Labor's plan that the states and territories have signed up to, but we need a Commonwealth government that will hold them to account and ensure that together we are working to lift the education standards of our country. So I call on the government to support this important bill before the House today, and I hope that they will reconsider decent school funding. (Time expired)

 (Ryan) (13:20):  I rise today to speak on this farce of a private member's bill, the Australian Education Amendment (School Funding Guarantee) Bill 2014, yet again. Those opposite do not seem to be able to fathom the fact that the coalition government is actually putting more funding into schools. That is right: the coalition government restored the $1.2 billion that the previous Labor government stole from Australian schools. In Queensland, this means $794.3 million more funding, and this fact has been acknowledged by the Queensland Minister for Education, Training and Employment. And the coalition has not stopped there. The annual increase for all Queensland school sectors, government and non-government, for recurrent and capital spending is an increase of 10.8 per cent in 2014-15, an increase of 11.3 per cent in 2015-16, an increase of 10.7 per cent in 2017-18 and—yes, Madam Deputy Speaker—another increase in 2017-18 of 7.5 per cent. That is all increased spending. Total Commonwealth funding to government schools in Queensland will grow by $662.3 million by 2017-18, a 68.7 per cent increase from 2013-14, while the non-government sector will grow by 35 per cent over the same period.


It is indeed unfortunate that we cannot afford Gonski's original recommendations, which I would just like to point out are not at all the same as the model Labor tried to pass off as their Gonski reforms to ensure they got a media splash. No, unfortunately, due to the reckless spending and waste of the previous Labor government, we are currently experiencing the fastest increase of debt in our nation's modern history. Because of Labor, if nothing is done to rein in their spending commitments, we are looking at an interest bill of $3 billion each month, which is $300,000 million, or one new hospital, every month. This money is being wasted on interest repayments which could have been used to fund the full Gonski vision. It is wasted money because Labor put their irresponsible spending on the nation's credit card with no means to pay it off.


Just as bad as Labor's innate ability to rack up record levels of debt, their irresponsible levels of spending were not enough. No, instead they felt the need to pretend to the Australian people that they were spending even more. Indeed, when you look at the projected expenditure of Labor's education funding, it is hard to tell what it is—an economic sleight of hand or some malicious time bomb planted by reckless politicians who knew they would never have to face the reality and pay up.


It is shamelessly simple. The vast majority of Labor's so-called promised funding comes well after the forward estimates, so Labor never wrote it into a budget paper. In true Labor style they made up exciting slogans, printed pretty flyers on high-gloss paper and put out lots of press releases. But the reality behind these grandiose statements is about as genuine as Labor's infamous 'We will return to surplus this budget'—all myths.


As a party that pretend they are the ones who care most about education, not once did those opposite stop to think about how to get best value for the Commonwealth's education spend. Not once did they stop to think that, despite almost two decades of rivers of gold flowing into the school education sector, Australia's school testing scores continued to steadily decline. Yes, that is right: the Productivity Commission's Report on government services 2014 shows a graph clearly outlining Commonwealth spending on schools increasing, yet the program for international student assessment scores has been decreasing in both literacy and numeracy. This is because governments should not just recklessly throw money at our education system and hope for the best, as the previous Labor government did.


Instead, as the coalition government are doing through our Students First plan, we should focus on the four key areas that evidence shows will make a real difference for students. Those key areas are teacher quality, school autonomy, engaging parents and strengthening the curriculum. And, in an important point, Australian school education is actually the responsibility of the state governments. The federal government, which really has no responsibility over schools, contributes approximately 15 per cent of the total schooling budget for states and territories.


Just to recap, we have a coalition government that is actually increasing funding to schools beyond the forward estimates, is adding an additional $1.2 billion that Labor ripped away from schools and is ensuring that the money being spent will actually result in better outcomes for students and teachers. Only the coalition is putting Australian students first.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (13:15): I rise in support of the Australian Education Amendment (School Funding Guarantee) Bill 2014. This bill is very important for two main reasons. Firstly, this government, since coming to office, has broken its promise that no school would be worse off and the promise it made at the last election that it would keep the Gonski school funding model. This model is so critically important to ensure funding and resources are allocated on a needs basis. Unfortunately, the government has trashed that model. Secondly, Labor opposes this government's savage cuts to school education, whether it be in early childhood, primary or secondary school and all the way through to higher education. That legislation is currently before the Senate committee. These cuts will have devastating impacts on Australian students, the education sector and the economy. This bill should not be necessary, and it would not be necessary if the government had kept its word and fully implemented the Gonski school funding model.


Labor recognises the need for a national needs-based funding model designed to support the student resource standard by allocating extra funding for students with a disability, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and students from rural and regional communities to ensure that every student across the country is allocated the resources they need to achieve their best and that every school can be its best. Students support this model. Mums and dads support this model. Schools support this model. The sector supports this model. The Liberal Party supposedly also supported this model.


I remind the House that it was the now Minister for Education who on 29 August 2013, days before the last election, said to the mums and dads and the teachers of Australia:


… you can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school …


Like most things promised by those opposite before the election, the minister was misleading the Australian people.


Despite the reckless actions of this government, the bill before us today will stop Australian schools sliding backwards. It will put a stop to the savage cuts to schools that have been occurring under state Liberal governments, including more than $180 million in cuts inflicted upon students in Western Australia by Premier Barnett this year alone. These cuts are leaving our schools worse off. Left to continue, these cuts will lead to the decline of our educational facilities and education standards, leaving Australia poorer as a nation. Australian education standards and Australian graduates are world class. This government, with its budget of broken promises, wants to diminish Australia's intellectual reputation.


Labor had a plan for our schools, a plan that would have seen the Commonwealth, states and territories work together to improve educational standards for Australians everywhere. Tony Abbott pledged to honour his agreement to the Gonski school funding model but has since walked away from it. He has walked away for cynical political purposes. In doing this, he has put at risk a once-in-a-generation opportunity to ensure that every Australian school is of the highest standard and that every student gets a fair and equal opportunity to achieve their best.


It is time for Tony Abbott to start admitting he got it wrong. It is time for the Prime Minister to fund years 5 and 6 in the budget and roll out the full agreement, as he promised to do before the election. No weasel words from the Prime Minister or from the Minister for Education can take away the fact that there was a clear commitment to Gonski—including signs in the member for Boothby's electorate on election day saying that the Liberal Party would match the Labor Party dollar for dollar. It is time for the government to keep that promise. But it is also important that we ensure that the states and territories do their bit to lift our education standards.


This bill will tie the Commonwealth funding for schools in every state and territory to the very basic principle that there are no more state education budget cuts. This bill is an important part of Labor's plan that the states and territories have signed up to, but we need a Commonwealth government that will hold them to account and ensure that together we are working to lift the education standards of our country. So I call on the government to support this important bill before the House today, and I hope that they will reconsider decent school funding. (Time expired)

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (13:25):  I believe this is an exceptionally important motion because it deals with youth unemployment, with the transition of young people from school to work and with making sure that they can actually achieve that goal. 


I was absolutely shocked at the simple fact that, in this budget, the funding for Youth Connections was cut. Youth Connections is a fantastic program. It has a great track record and it has really delivered in my electorate, and particularly on the Central Coast. I noticed that the member for Robertson and the member for Dobell came to this House and spoke about small business. I thought that they would be up here speaking up this particular private member's motion. The Central Coast is an area in Australia that has a very low retention rate and an extremely high youth unemployment rate. It is an area that Youth Connections has played a very important role in. There have been a number of programs. One program that I have been particularly involved with—and I might say it no longer exists since the budget— was the Brighter Futures local solutions program, which really delivered to young people on the Central Coast.


Youth Connections on the Central Coast works with organising work placements and partnership brokers. It has innovative learning programs, ability programs and youth reference groups. Bara Barang is working with the local Darkinjung people and delivering a program in that area. In the Lake Macquarie part of my electorate, I have an employment group that works out of my office. We have run a number of events locally. We are also working on identifying jobs in demand in the area and then going out and talking to providers and trainers that would be able to provide those people that are looking for work with the skills they need to obtain work. Youth Connections has been one of the organisations that have had a lot of input into that. It had a lot of input into an employment expo that we held down in Windale a couple of years ago—a community day where we brought the whole community together. The role it plays in connecting unemployed youth, or youth that are leaving school, with work is vitally important.



On apprenticeships, this government has attacked apprenticeships. One of the areas where we have been working hard on locally has been attracting students at the local high schools to undertake school-based apprenticeship training. It has been very successful and, once again, Youth Connections has been really active in that space. This government uses rhetoric and puts in place harsh programs that are going to make it hard for young people when they leave school to actually achieve that goal of a job—even to undertake the training, when they will have no financial support whilst they are doing it. The organisations that have been funded to provide them with the support and training that they need can no longer function because they have been defunded. This leaves young people in a situation where they are devoid of hope and of opportunities, and at the same time those organisations I have talked about are no longer in a space where they can operate and give the training they would like to—the partnership brokerage. Even books like the job guide the department produced which provided information on jobs and training will no longer be funded by this government after next year. In every area resources are being taken away, and at the same time there is this enormous demand being placed on young people to find jobs. They have to do that without resources. They have to do it without support, and the organisations have been defunded. (Time expired)

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (13:30):  I commend the member for Kingston and the member for Shortland for noting the importance of supporting young people transitioning from school to earning or learning. This is a critically important issue for my electorate and, indeed, it is a critically important issue for Australia. Unfortunately, however, this motion before the House is typical of Labor's approach to problem-solving: they list a series of programs, ignore the outcomes and call for more funding. It is typical of how they approach government: no focus on results.


As a new parliamentarian, it is this lack of focus on results I am determined to highlight and address because government has to be about more than posturing. It has to be about outcomes. It has to be about delivery. Let us take a look at the failures we have seen in the youth unemployment and training area in recent years. Between 2008 and last year we saw an eight per cent reduction in youth employment rates, while the overall employment market increased by eight per cent. We saw participation rates for people under the age of 25 falling from 71 per cent to 66 per cent, having climbed in the previous five years. We are at the point now where we have youth unemployment rates of about 12½ per cent compared to 6 per cent in the overall economy. One in three unemployed people is aged under 25 and we have hotspots of youth unemployment like Burnie and Devonport where youth unemployment rates are over 20 per cent. This is a very serious problem that the previous government completely failed to address.


Let us take a look at apprenticeships and training. In the final quarter of 2013, commencements in apprenticeships were 19.6 per cent lower than for the same quarter in the previous year and completions were 24 per cent lower. These numbers are worrying, but the numbers are even bleaker when we look at trades and technical training. As the AiG employer survey from 2012 shows, technicians and trade workers represent the most significant areas of skills shortage. It is a much larger number than for any other occupational group, with 33.3 per cent of survey respondents noting shortages in this area. Completion rates for Australian apprenticeships are unacceptably low at 55.4 per cent. That means almost 45 per cent of people undertaking apprenticeships never actually complete—45 per cent. What an extraordinary economic cost to Australia! Meanwhile we had the Labor Party claiming that their programs were going to fix this, but of course they did not. 


In contrast to Labor, the Abbott government will be and is focusing on outcomes. We have set ourselves a target of creating one million jobs in five years and two million jobs in 10 years. Even the ABC Fact Check—God bless it—agrees that we are on target to achieve that outcome. Our policies to resolve the twin issues of chronic youth employment and chronic skills gaps are and will continue to be completely results driven. We are rolling out a series of services that will help engage young people with work—these include work for the dole, the revised Job Services Australia program and the Green Army Program. 


In my electorate, five Green Army projects are in the process of starting up and, as of this month, the call has gone out for 17- to 24-year-olds to form the first round of recruits to the Green Army. This will become the largest ever team of young Australians supporting environmental action across the country. Participants will be able to undertake accredited training, such as work readiness, conservation and land management, heritage conservation, project and human resource management, or heritage trade skills. 




Participation is open to a diverse range of young people, including Indigenous Australians, school leavers, gap year students, graduates and job seekers.


Under the previous Howard 
government
, we saw 
a 13 per cent increase
 in youth employment rates, with a strong focus on the Green
 C
orps. This is the direction 
that 
the A
bbott government will be taking—results focused and delivering, not just talking.





Another exciting program for young people is the Trade Support Loans 
s
cheme, enabling apprentices to access financial support over the course of their apprenticeship
 in a manner that is akin to the HELP or HECS scheme for university students. The completion incentive
 built into the loan stru
cture
 is particularly commendable.





The 
W
ork for the 
D
ole program will be reinvigorated to ensure practical work experience and direct connections in a work-like environment are given top priority
. We 
will be encouraging those aged under 30 to be learning
 or earning. Our programs will always be focused on outcomes. 
Few issues can be more important for the future of this country
 than delivering growth and creating jobs for the young. 
It is our strong commitment.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (16:00):  I rise today to pay tribute to the mighty Footscray Bulldogs team, who scored their third consecutive VFL grand final win yesterday. Ninety years after Con McCarthy led Footscray to back-to-back-to-back state league flags in 1923 and 1924, Chris Maple's charges made it a threepeat in Footscray's first year back in the VFL competition as a stand-alone outfit. It should be noted that the Bulldogs left the then VFA, after winning the flag in 1924, to join the VFL ranks. 2014 marks their return to the VFL, and what a way to come back—winning the flag. The score at the final siren was Footscray 109 to Box Hill Hawks 87—a great result, considering Box Hill's dastardly ploy to play Hawthorn premiership champion Cyril Rioli in the VFL final. Trailing by 18 points early in the final term, the grid of the playing group, led by best-on-ground Brett Goodes and Lin Jong in the midfield, wrestled back control to kick the last six goals of the game. Goodes and Jong demonstrate the success of Indigenous Australians and of multiculturalism in footy in Melbourne's west, and they are heroes across the football fields in Melbourne's west today. 


The crowd of 23,816 was an attendance record at the VFL Grand Final at Etihad and the biggest VFL crowd in over 30 years. I congratulate the president of the Footscray Bulldogs, Peter Gordon, and the CEO, Simon Garlick, for their vision in fielding a stand-alone VFL side, and particularly for bringing footy back to Whitten Oval. I had the pleasure of giving my daughter her first taste of suburban footy at Whitten Oval at the derby with Williamstown Seagulls earlier this year, and I keenly anticipate making it a family tradition in the future.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for the Environment) (16:46):  In addressing the question of Iraq and the extraordinary activities which we have seen carried out at the hands of the extremists of ISIL, I want to begin with history, taking us back a decade. In the wake of September 11, in the wake of the Bali bombings, in the wake of the Madrid bombing and in the wake of the London attacks, I remember the discussions in this House. On 30 March 2004 I said in relation to the extremist offshoot that was a perversion, an abasement and a rejection of the majestic religion of Islam that was the predecessor of ISIL, al-Qaeda—and who would ever have believed that the term 'less extreme' could ever be used in relation to al-Qaeda—had this world view:


… al-Qaeda is seeking to establish a Taliban-style Islamic caliphate across the world. That is its objective. It is a clear, 100-year vision and it is an objective which it seeks to bring about through jihad or holy war. There is no capacity to reason, talk or negotiate. Everything that we try is rejected. We are infidels in their mind, and so too are all of those moderate Islamic states which reject the notion of a Taliban-style globe. That is the situation we face today. The strategic objective of al-Qaeda is very clear. It is to bring down the core Islamic states of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Indonesia by destabilising them and breaking down the structures in those societies. In order to do that, it seeks to break down Western connections, to frighten away Western engagement, to break down resolve within those societies and to cause fragmentation.


Sadly, a decade later, those sentiments remain true. They have, however, been transferred from al-Qaeda—which remains a clear and present danger, a manifest international threat—to, extraordinarily, an even more barbaric and extreme psychopathic regime. 


The world has a very dark side. We saw it in the last century at Tuol Sleng, outside of Phnom Penh in Cambodia, under the Khmer Rouge. It is highlighted at the Jewish Holocaust museum Yad Vashem and by the monument to the murdered Jews of Europe only a few hundred metres from the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. We are seeing a replay of that dark side today as genocide is carried out across the borders of northern Syria and northern Iraq through the activities of ISIL and their psychopathic regime that glories in human brutality. They use the weapon of modern mass communication to broadcast and display with an almost unimaginable malice the atrocities they have carried out. They then use the weapons of modern mass communication to broadcast and to display, with a sense of malice that is almost unimaginable, the atrocities they carry out. We have seen, all too sadly, the beheadings and the crucifixions. We have seen the executions of Western journalists in the most medieval fashion. But these things are played out on a grand scale in relation to their own people.


The greatest victims of ISIL have of course been the Islamic people. For the most part it is Sunni on Shiah, but there is no compunction about Sunni-on-Sunni violence; there is no compunction about Sunni-on-Christian violence; there is no compunction about violence against Yazidis. There is no religious barrier to it; it is a totalitarian, authoritarian and genocidal regime. It is also a regime that is utterly at odds with the teachings of Islam. Women are treated as sex slaves. They are subject to the most horrendous crimes. There is a glory amongst the ISIL fighters in the degradation of all humans who are not one of their kind. There is no religious basis to this; it is an utter perversion of a great, grand, majestic world religion.


Against that background, I wanted to address where we are at now. Obviously, Australia, in my view, has to be part of an international coalition under the emerging right to protect, which is ensuring that genocide is simply not allowed to be carried out on our watch. But it is occurring now. Let us not gloss this over. We are witnessing an unfolding genocide. It is not yet on the scale of Cambodia or Rwanda or of what occurred in post-1948 China or in Stalinist Russia, but it is emerging towards the scale of what we saw in the former Yugoslavia, which was a catastrophic failure of Western will.


We see here that it is time for the world to intervene. I say that not just for reasons of national security, although they are of and in themselves sufficient to justify any action. I say this for reasons of simple, common, base humanity. I witnessed the activities in Rwanda. Shortly after the genocide there, I was present in Rwanda. I spent time as a chief election observer in Cambodia as that country was attempting to recover. I have lived in Israel and visited the monuments of Yad Vashem and other holocaust tributes as well as having seen Dachau and, only recently in Berlin, the recollections of this most profound of perhaps all the holocausts during the Second World War. This cannot be allowed to stand in the 21st century.


It is a deep, powerful responsibility. It is not without its risks. As a coalition not just of the West but, hopefully, of Middle Eastern states and others, we need to take action. These fighters are being drawn in by the prospect of virulent glory. They are being inspired by the ability to, with a sort of sick madness, project the atrocities to the world in the hope of attracting some and scaring others. This is the moment when the world stands up. This is something which on our watch we must be part of. We must do it, of course, in a sensitive way and a cautious way so as to protect our utterly indispensable, invaluable Australian men and women who serve.


But no mistake: there is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. Everybody has tried to engage, but at times there are elements of hard security that are indispensable. In my view, as I wrote in March 2004 in an opinion piece in the Herald Sun, there are four steps that must be taken to discredit and defeat this extremist stream. Firstly, we need to encourage broadbased economic development, along with greater democratisation of wealth in the Islamic world. Secondly, we have to encourage and assist those who would teach tolerance in Islamic schools and communities rather than extremism. Thirdly, we have to engage in joint policing and intelligence, not just with the West but also with the predominantly Islamic states. And fourthly, there has to be a hard security answer. There is no way around it. You cannot negotiate, you cannot talk down, you cannot have sense prevail amongst those who are engaged in a genocidal, virulent, psychopathic cause. That means that there are risks, but let us be clear that the risks of inaction are far greater than the risks of action.


We have a duty to Australians to ensure that the security threats we have seen of recent days are addressed at source. We have a duty to the world to ensure that a movement that could cause immense damage is stopped. But we have a duty to the Christians, the Yazidis and the Sunni and Shiah of northern Iraq to take steps to protect them. (Time expired)

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (16:56):  I rise to express my strong support for the Prime Minister's statement on Iraq. In security matters, of course, there are two key areas where good governments should focus: words and actions. Words matter because they shine a light on what we know to be true. By speaking plainly, we make it clear that we will not allow unconscionable acts to be swept under the carpet. Some things just have to be said so that barbarism cannot hide in the shadows. But actions matter even more, because without actions statements on security matters can become jarringly hollow. Our government has moved strongly to call the actions of ISIL for what they are. The evil perpetrated by this group ranks among the great horrors perpetrated by mankind. ISIL has committed indiscriminate mass murder. It has attempted to wipe out entire populations based on their ethnicity or religion. It has systematically subjected thousands of women to violence and sexual slavery. It has conducted depraved public exhibitions of murder designed to terrify and intimidate. Our Prime Minister has spoken strongly and forcefully against these horrific acts.


But we know that words on their own are not enough. We need to act to tackle this appalling terrorist army. We have done so. By providing humanitarian assistance to the Yazidi people during the siege of Mount Sinjar, we helped to save the lives of many people. Of course, the situation for the Yazidi people remains extremely difficult. But we know that the delivery of humanitarian supplies and air strikes by the United States allowed people to survive who would otherwise certainly have perished. We should be proud of that. As we move into a new phase in the conflict with ISIL, it is entirely right that Australia plays its part. It is not a Western coalition fighting ISIL; it is a coalition against evil. To not act would see ISIL expand its territory further, get access to more weapons—and potentially more sophisticated weapons—and give it a greater base from which to plan attacks around the world. No modern terrorist group has ever created such a record of destruction in such a short period of time. The speed of the advance of ISIL demonstrates that it will take substantial international commitment to stop it. We must be a part of that commitment. The tiny group of Australians who support ISIL are of course not reflective of any part of our society. We all want to see the killing stop. The actions that the government is taking will mean that Australia plays its part in stopping the rise of this appalling group.

Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:59):  I too would like to rise to support the Prime Minister's statement on Iraq and our action in the Middle East in this particular theatre of war. I have always had an interest in this region even as a young person. This area that we are talking about is the cradle of civilisation. This is the land of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers which was once considered to be the cradle of civilisation. This is the area of civilisation back in history where the great city of Babylon was between the two great rivers. This was the city of Nebuchadnezzar, one of the great kings of our historic past. So this region has been an area that the world has focused on for many civilisations.


However, the problem with this region is that it has always been divided along either ethnic or religious lines. These ethnic and religious lines are the reasons why the various groups have always been at war or had tensions with each other. In contemporary eras we now talk about the fact that both the Sunni and Shiah Muslims are bitterly opposed to each other. It always makes me wonder that somebody who is a follower of one particular religion can allow themselves to be so bitterly opposed to another because of what is deemed to be a reasonably small inflection in the interpretation of that religion. As we know, this comes from some of the teachings in the Koran. We are not just isolating this to the Muslim religion. We have seen atrocities in Northern Ireland between the religious forces, between the Catholics and the Protestants. So we are not just talking about one group of religious supporters and another. This is not anti-Muslim. This is about people who have decided to become barbaric and destabilise not only that part of the Middle East and that part of the world but the world in general.


It is not in any way surprising that this destabilisation also flowed from a number of other factors. We recall the Arab Spring of several years ago starting in Tunisia, and then in Egypt which is still going through upheavals as a result. We know that eventually Syria became part of the Arab uprising and under the Assad regime this marked the genesis of this ISIL campaign. The Assad family have been ruling Syria for many years, sometimes brutally. The regime has certainly been warlike to its neighbours and the Assad family have ruled Syria with an iron fist. They are from a minority group within Syria. Eventually the majority of the Syrians rose up and said that they wanted a regime change. We have seen now the so-called freedom fighters—or the terrorists, depending on which side of the ledger you come from—in Syria fighting. We have seen some pretty brutal things in Syria, where accusations have been made that the Syrian regime gassed its own people—a horrific thing to do to your own people.


We know that we were in Iraq with the former coalition to stop Saddam Hussein. That was about regime change and we could commentate on that all day. It is my belief that we and the Americans left Iraq too early and that is one of the reasons why Iraq is in the situation it is, because they needed a leader who would heal Iraq, not cause further divisions. Because of the strong conflict between the Sunnis and the Shiah, we have the situation where the Shiah under Nouri al-Maliki did not go out of their way to be inclusive and the Sunnis now under a number of clerics have risen up. Thank goodness there has been a change in leadership just recently, because now there is a move towards trying to bring the two groups together.


However, this situation has created a climate for ISIL to flourish. We have seen some horrific things which every other speaker has spoken about. But to try to be as barbaric as they have been is an obvious strategy. We have seen the beheading of James Foley, a US journalist. We have seen the beheading of Steven Sotloff, an Israeli-US journalist. We now see David Haines, a British aid worker, has been executed, and another aid worker is about to be executed if you listen to their websites and their public announcements. Peter Neumann, a security expert, says:


ISIS looks at this as a low-cost strategy—


these beheadings.


They are seeing that in order to capture the world's attention and recruit people, they no longer need to take down the World Trade Towers or hit the Pentagon.


These beheadings get the same sort of attention, and they have.


The problem with this is that there is genocide. There is a distinct move towards trying to rid themselves of anyone who is not part of their fanatical group, and it is much based upon religious lines—fanatical religious lines. The true Muslim faith does not preach this sort of hatred, but we saw for example, just recently on Mount Sinjar, ISIS besieging 40,000 Yazidis and demanding that every one of them be killed unless they converted to their Muslim faith. Thank goodness that the Kurdish helped break these lines and that we have now supported—along with some of the other partners that are being put together, led by the United States—not only food drops but bombings that stopped this absolute wipe-out of one small group of people.


So we are beholden, as a responsible nation in this world, to see that movements like this do not continue. They are well resourced because, as I said, of the breakdown in Iraq where the Iraqi army, which was left with a massive arsenal of weapons and machinery, just run away from it when they came along. This is an army that some people say has 20,000 people. Others estimate it could be 50,000 people. That is going to be the magnitude of the commitment. Well, Australians are very good at what they do, and we are joining this coalition to stop ISIS in its tracks. It will not be easy. It will not happen overnight. But we owe it to the freedom of the rest of the world. And everyone here previous to me has quoted Edmund Burke, so I will not do it again, but it is true that evil prospers when good men do nothing.


The Australian troops that will be going over there are brave men and women that are going to make a difference. We should make a difference to people who want to live in freedom and who want to live without persecution, and we need to help show them a better way. So, obviously, I support the Prime Minister's statement.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (17:08):  I rise today to support the government's position in relation to the ongoing situation in Iraq. As events over past months, and as recently as last week, have shown, we are living in an age where the peace and security of individuals is being threatened in Iraq, here in Australia and around the world. This extremist threat is not new but has been around for decades, most acutely highlighted by the al-Qaeda attack on the twin towers in 2001, which killed 10 Australians, and the Bali bombings of 2002, when 88 Australians were brutally murdered by al-Qaeda linked terrorists. As a result of the United States led coalition actions in Afghanistan and Iraq, together with the vital work of our security services, thankfully we have been spared further related terrorist atrocities here in Australia.


While the threat has not gone away, with the increasing instability in Syria over recent years and a fledgling democratic government in Iraq, ISIL have separated from al-Qaeda and become the predominant threat to individuals not part of their stream of Islam and to nations around the world. ISIL, by conquering large tracts of land both in eastern Syria and northern and western Iraq, have built up a wealth of capital from oilfields, together with funds raised from kidnappings, piracy and wealthy supporters around-the-world. When matched with their ultraviolent jihadist tendencies and a commitment to the world domination of an Islamic caliphate, ISIL are a danger which we cannot ignore. 


We have seen over recent months the images of beheadings, possible genocide of non-Islamic groups in Iraq, rape and forced marriages, in addition to mass executions by ISIL. As the events of last week are likely to show, ISIL is not only a danger to peace in the Middle East but also intent on threatening the safety and peace of Australia and the Western world.


I look back to the al-Qaeda attacks of the early 2000s. Al-Qaeda were able to launch attacks on the Western world by taking control of Afghanistan, together with the Taliban. As was notably seen with the attacks in London, al-Qaeda were then able to use Afghanistan as a training base for their leading terrorists, who were able to return to their home countries, where, together with a small number of radicalised individuals, they were able to then carry out mass atrocities.


It is clear that ISIL are now following a similar model but with the added help of social media and an increased speed of communications to aid their murderous terrorist intentions and to spread fear. This is therefore a threat that we as a government have to take seriously, both to defend the freedoms of Australia and to protect the liberty and security of individuals around the world threatened by ISIL. The only way to defeat radical extremists is to oppose them and to join forces with like-minded nations and groups to defeat them. While this is a fight that will not be easy to win, action is required to make the world and Australia safer over the long term.


The United States has been building up a coalition of nations to oppose ISIL. Last week's debate in the Security Council, initiated by Secretary of State John Kerry, demonstrated unambiguous support from around the world to support the new elected Iraqi government in its fight against ISIL. Indeed, I understand that Australia is one of more than 40 nations that have indicated their support for the elected Iraqi government in its fight for survival against ISIL. As a nation with a strong military arm but also, sadly, a nation which has around 100 citizens who have decided to join with the murderous ISIL group, it is important that Australia is prepared to deploy aircraft and special forces to the effort to fight ISIL and support the democratic government in Iraq.


Alongside the military effort, it is also important to provide humanitarian relief. Australia has already contributed to the international airdrop effort in northern Iraq, committed in June to a $5 million aid package and offered to resettle 4,400 Iraqis and Syrians fleeing the violence who are now eligible for special humanitarian visas. In addition, last week the foreign minister also committed a further $2 million to the United Nations Population Fund specifically to provide reproductive and health support services to women and girls who have been brutalised by ISIL.


This is a fight which does require a strong and united coalition to fight against terrorists and extremists. It has also seen support from many Middle Eastern countries and from others, including France, through air strikes. This united and strong action will need to be confirmed again later this week at the UN Security Council, chaired by President Obama, so that, alongside humanitarian and military intervention, we can starve ISIL of fighters, arms, ammunitions and funds. This is an effort that will not be easy or short. Sadly, it may even encourage some terrorists to use it as an excuse to commit further atrocities—not that they have needed this excuse in the past to commence such action. But it is an effort that is required because we are facing a terrorist group which hates us, hates Western freedoms and hates anyone who does not want to live as it lives. We therefore need to continue to stand up to ensure that we can live in a peaceful and pluralist democracy.


I commend the government's actions and thank those serving in the armed forces, together with their families, for their service. This is a difficult time for us as a nation. At such time, it behoves us all—particularly members of this place and other community leaders—to remain calm and considered in our approach to the recent increase in the terror alert and in events both abroad and here at home. At such a time, community debate remains important. We should not shy away from discussing important issues of national security even though they may be difficult and confronting. Every community leader should seek out the facts and act to chart a path through present uncertainties together and with respect.


I reiterate that recent concerns about our own safety are about crime and not about religion. No-one is above the law in this country. Everyone in this country has the right to live their own lives within the rule of law, free to practise their religion and free from persecution. Common sense informs us that no group within our community is homogeneous. Australian society is made up of many diverse groupings of people who, in turn, form communities and our nation. Those who stand up for the rule of law and human decency should always be applauded. We should recognise those people who draw on our common values, underpinned by our nation's laws, to bring people together and who clearly label evil where they see it.


I commend prominent Muslim advocate Dr Jamal Rifi for his comments reported over the weekend where he said that the Muslim community, the broader Australian community and the federal government are on one side and extremism and racism are on the other. He rightly noted that anyone who feels that they have been improperly dealt with by the police are able to make a formal complaint, as in Australia our police must act within the law. In his work bringing Australians together, such as at the barbecue in Lakemba on 15 September—which I note was attended by Hon. Scott Morrison, Minister for Immigration and Border Protection—Dr Rifi deserves our full support.


However, those that seek to divide us, or indeed undermine our way of life, should resolutely be condemned. We should never be silenced from speaking against what is wrong. Individuals, in some cases self-appointed, or organisations which promote or condone hatred and violence against innocents can never be tolerated. If, in the face of the threat from such groups, we lose our nerve to out evil, then those who do not value our free society will have their victory and we will have been silenced into submission. I am gravely concerned by the claims made by Mr Uthman Badar, the face of Hizb ut-Tahrir, that the recent raids in Sydney and Brisbane are apparently in his mind an example of the police targeting Muslims as scapegoats. Worse still, Mr Badar uses this sensitive time to fan the flames of unrest amongst Muslim people, to actively promote distrust in police and our laws and, in so doing, in our democratic system of government. In doing so, he encourages division between Australians both in the Muslim and broader Australian community. 


What does Mr Badar hope to achieve by promoting disaffection in Muslim Australia? I suspect it is power. However, power is just the mechanism to promote principles. And what are the principles that he holds dear? Mr Badar refuses to either condemn the murderous cult of ISIL nor discourage young Australians from travelling to Iraq or Syria to join forces with it. Let us be clear. These people are terrorists. They murder innocent people: Iraqis and Syrians. They murder people for being foreign journalists or bringing aid. They do this in the most barbaric manner and then broadcast their act to the world to give added power and potency to their crime. They stand for the exultation of death rather than the preciousness of life. They stand for power by might and fear rather than that derived from those democratically appointed by the people and the rule of law. In short they are an extremist cult defined by the loose notion of that which they oppose. They have shown no limits in what they will do in pursuit of power. Every Australian—every human being—should hold them in the strongest condemnation.


The Prime Minister in his statements and actions has outlined a responsible path, one that unites us as a nation and one that safeguards our citizens. I commend the Prime Minister's statement to the House. Our freedoms are precious. We should do all that we can to defend them.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2014-09-22,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (17:19):  In his autobiography, former CIA boss George Tenet provides an insight into life in the Middle East from one of the strongmen who subjected tens of thousands of his citizens to cruelty and brutality on what can rightly be described as an industrial scale. The former Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, under interrogation after his capture by US troops, reluctantly admitted his country did not have a stockpile of chemical and biological weapons or weapons of mass destruction—a key factor behind the coalition of the willing's invasion of his country in March 2003. 'It is a tough neighbourhood', Tenet quotes Saddam as saying. Saddam was more concerned about how Iran, the country against which he waged a bloody, decade-long war during the 1980s, would respond if it learnt Iraq in fact did not have weapons of mass destruction.


Over the past few months, life in Iraq for up to seven million people has gotten a lot tougher of course. The capture by ISIL of towns and cities in Syria and Iraq, and the appalling human toll this has wreaked, is a tragedy of global proportions. Revelling under its black flag, and even blacker heart, ISIL is creating an abattoir where the demented fantasies of thousands of seriously evil individuals are playing out in the name of religion. No religion, no god, would ever condone the sort of violence that is currently underway in the territory currently under ISIL's control.


For civilised people not to respond to the barbaric actions that have been reported over recent months would be a grave and unforgiveable failure of responsibility. It is for this reason that I very much support the Prime Minister's clear-minded resolve and determination to support the United States and approximately 50 other nations who have committed to degrade and destroy ISIL. The Greens say they fear our involvement and that it would lead to a quagmire, but avoidance and appeasement surely is not the answer.


Former United States President Bill Clinton cited as a significant foreign policy failure his hesitation at involving America in the atrocities being played out between feuding tribes in Rwanda in the 1990s. The President had earlier been burnt by the death of United States military personnel in Somalia and was extremely reluctant to become involved in another ill-fated conflict in Africa. The President blinked and millions died.


Appeasement against psychopaths has a long history of failure. For the civilised world to adopt a similar position with ISIL would be dangerous. These people will not stop in Iraq and Syria. Given half a chance they would spread their poison throughout the entire Islamic world. But to charge in with all guns blazing would also be a mistake. The global coalition that has rallied behind the United States is developing a considered approach to dealing with this regime of terror that shows complete and utter disregard for human life.


I will briefly focus on two aspects of ISIL's horror regime, but there are many more that could be picked out. I was sickened to read recently about the fate of potentially thousands of women, Muslim and Christian, who are being held by Islamic State fighters and are being sold off as brides against their will. These women and the children at the centre of the storm are innocents who should be front and centre in the minds of those who criticise the large body of opinion in support of trying to put an end to this horror.


The very public executions of two foreign journalists and an aid worker over recent weeks have been designed to drive a wedge between Western governments and their people—a horrible bargaining chip that is as vile as it is shocking. But an unintended consequence is that it could also stem the flow of information out of the territories currently occupied by ISIL, which would allow these people to carry out their abhorrent cruelty out of sight of the rest of the world. My thoughts are with those journalists and others who have provided a flow of information out of Iraq and Syria and who are now in the clutches of the ISIL barbarians. 


Even in the few short weeks since the Prime Minister delivered his opening address in the Iraq motion, the grounds have shifted substantially. While I wholeheartedly support the position that the government has taken in response to the Islamic State, the caliphate, and the innocent millions at the centre of this madness, I also support moves this government is making to ensure and secure innocent Australians here at home.


Last week's revelations of an ISIL-inspired terror plot to decapitate an innocent Australian makes me feel sick to the core. That there are people in our community who are prepared to exhibit such disregard for human life has nothing to do with religion. These people are nothing more than criminals and they should be and will be treated as criminals. I say to these people, 'When you are identified by our security agencies and when you are captured by our police forces, you will pay the price that your mindset and actions so richly deserve.'


In Darwin and Palmerston our diverse ethnic community is at the heart of a tight-knit social fabric that binds us together. One of the greatest pleasures of my job is the citizenship ceremonies I conduct each month which give me the privilege of being able to meet with and talk to the people from a range of backgrounds who choose to make the Territory home—those who come here to join us, not to change us. The pleasure these people have in becoming citizens is for me very touching and extremely rewarding. These people are welcomed and embraced by our country.


The malcontents and ingrates pictured on the front pages of Australian newspapers last week are trash who lack the courage and capacity to become valuable citizens of this great country. They are scum and should be treated as such.


While it is extremely sad that Australia is again taking up a defensive position in Iraq, I am heartened by the recent elevation of a more conciliatory and inclusive leadership in that country, which I hope will bring all of its citizens together. Defence Force representatives from the electorate of Solomon played key roles in the battle to liberate Iraq and then began the reconstruction after the 2003 ousting of the Saddam Hussein regime.


I am sure I speak for all those Australians who served in the Middle East on that occasion in saying that the path to unity can again be rebuilt. Only a unified position will put an end to what is going on in the Middle East, and I commend the steps taken by the Prime Minister and by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in playing a lead role on the world stage in combating this evil.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:27):  Deputy Speaker Porter, can I say at the outset how pleased I am that you are in the chair, being a member of this committee and somebody who I have enjoyed an interlocution with over the subject matters of this report. As you know, all of those members of the 44th Parliament who represent a major party were elected on a platform which included the bipartisan proposition that it is now time to recognise the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and their language, cultures and unbroken connection to land, in the founding document of our Commonwealth—that is, our Constitution.


I cannot improve on the words of my friend and colleague Senator Nova Peris, who explained that in this act of recognition we do not ask that Australians relinquish 200 years of settlement and that history, but rather we join to that over 40,000 years of continuous Aboriginal history. Nova is a renowned Australian and the first Aboriginal woman to be elected to our federal parliament. She is a powerful advocate and tells a poignant personal story on the importance of recognition. Nova is the first Indigenous woman to be elected to the Australian Senate.


As you would know, it took over 70 years from the time of Federation for the first Aboriginal Australian to enter the federal parliament as a member of this place. On 8 September 1971, that first Aboriginal Australian to take up a seat, Senator Neville Bonner, made his first speech to parliament. In that speech he made the following observation:


Less than 200 years ago the white man came, I say now in all sincerity that my people were shot, poisoned, hanged and broken in spirit until they became refugees in their own land. But that is history and we take care now of the present while, I should hope, we look to the future. Following the advent of the white man came a transitional period which still exists today. Then began to appear the emotional scars; the psychological wounds became a torment from which by and large we have still not recovered. 


That was in 1971 and it is well known to most members in this place that we have still not completed the task of reconciliation. Those wounds have still not been healed. I have chosen Neville Bonner because he was the first Aboriginal senator in this place. I could equally have quoted from scores and scores of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have told their story in very moving ways about the impact that settlement has had, the impact of dispossession and the impact on our first peoples' cultures, their livelihood and their psyche. I was very moved when I again read the 2008 contribution of Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who spoke of the fact that he has met and discussed this issue with every Australian Prime Minister from Gough Whitlam to the present, and how it is his deep concern that we resolve this issue of constitutional recognition.


The simple objective of recognition is slightly more complicated when we attend our focus to the text of the Constitution. It is a resilient document which has been interpreted flexibly over the past 114 years, but there are some sections which cannot be reinterpreted as anything other than racist in their intent. Section 25 is one such section. It contemplates the race-based exclusion of people from the electoral roll for state or federal elections. It is inconceivable that we might address the subject of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples without addressing this racist remnant within our Constitution. As the report states, there is clear agreement on the removal of this clause.


The second issue that we need to attend to is a clear statement of recognition, and in this the obvious task has been aided by the work of the expert panel who have handed down a report which the JSC has had the benefit of relying upon. There are forms of words within there, and within the interim report of the JSC, which I think all parliamentarians can attend their mind to and around which we will find agreement.


That is the first two of three tasks that need to be completed in the act of recognition, the first being the removal of racist clauses and the second being the inclusion of a statement of recognition. But the expert panel recommended—and I agree—that we need to do one further thing. I argue that we need to go further and include within the proposition to be put before the Australian people a clause which would prohibit henceforth the Commonwealth parliament from passing legislation which discriminates against people on the basis of their race. I argue that the members of the government and their supporters within the community should support this constitutional protection against discrimination, and I believe that it is entirely consistent with liberal and conservative philosophy. A failure to do that—to support the protection of this right—is a denial of fundamental liberal values, the first of which—which those on the conservative side of politics have long held dear—goes to the primacy of the rights of individuals. Governments, it is argued, should only do what individuals cannot do and should tread warily when interfering with the rights of individuals that are recognised by all civil societies. Liberals have long imagined a society built upon the primacy of those rights of individuals—the rights to property untrammelled by interference from government, the rights of freedom of speech and the right of freedom against arbitrary detention without trial. Our Constitution protects some of these but not all of them. I also argue that the protection against discrimination on the basis of race is one of these rights that liberals have always championed.


The second reason I argue that this is consistent with liberal philosophy goes to a consistent thread of liberalism from the founding of the Liberal Party and the conservative parties to this date—that is, the fact that there should be reasonable restraints upon governmental power. No government and no parliament should have unlimited power to legislate in ways that interfere with the liberties of its citizens. This is a point that is made with special force in societies that have sought to federate their governmental powers as a check and balance against central government. The constraints are underpinned by social norms, by democratic representation and by the rule of law—but, importantly, these powers should also be constrained by that constitutional protection against those forms of discrimination that I contemplate.


The third point is this: the protection of the rights of the minority against the majority. Whether it is in the field of workplace relations, in business or in public debate, liberals and conservatives have always sought to guard against the tyranny of majoritarian rule. It is why our founding fathers created a Senate and gave small states equal representation of senators to the larger states; it is why our Constitution contains numerous protections that were created out of concerns that the larger states would dominate the smaller ones; and it is why, in classic conservative philosophy, there is an emphasis on restraining the power of the strong against the weak.


I argue that a further protection should be the protection of individuals of a particular race, whether they are a majority or a minority, against discrimination. It is no answer to this to say that those protections should be maintained by the popular vote and through the democratic process of representative government. It is why a true liberal and a true conservative should be attracted to the notion that the right of an individual should not be determined by their race, no matter whether that individual is a part of an overwhelming majority or a tiny minority. Some may argue, and they have, that this right is already protected by federal laws—and this is true—but the fact is that the federal law does not constrain the federal parliament, as this change would contemplate. I argue simply this: those who argue that the federal parliament should be able to discriminate against people on the basis of race have an onus upon them to explain why that should be so.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (17:37):  I rise today to welcome the interim report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, tabled in June this year, and to welcome this opportunity to make a few brief comments on that report. Whilst not a sitting member of the committee, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the members of the committee for their work in the preparation of this interim report and to also commend the earlier work of members of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, which was formed back in 2010. I acknowledge and thank the 30 individuals and organisations who have made valuable submissions to the joint select committee and recognise the tens of thousands of Australians, right across the nation, who are actively contributing to the ongoing task of constitutional recognition. I understand that some 185,000 Australians have now signed a pledge on the Recognise Australia website, and indeed many more community and social networks have been activated around this issue.


The submissions to the expert panel were part of an extensive process of community consultation. The expert panel travelled to some 85 different communities across Australia, covering rural, remote and metro regions, and received more than 3,500 submissions—which suggests that this is definitely an issue touching deeply into the lives of many Australian citizens. 


Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution is well overdue. It is a historical oversight, or indeed a historical wrong, that must be made right. I stand firmly with Labor in the belief that the sooner our Constitution gives recognition to our first peoples the better. Labor is committed to pursuing meaningful change in the Constitution, change that unites the nation and reflects the hopes, dreams and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. 


We know that multiparty support is critical for any referendum proposal to be successful, and as such Labor is working constructively with the government through the joint committee to make sure there is a political consensus on the content of a proposal to be put to the Australian public. Australia of course does not have a very good track record of voting yes in referendums, with only 8 out of 44 referendums delivering a successful outcome. So the joint committee's interim report is extremely important, and I know that its work has been based, as it should be, on the 2012 report from the expert panel on constitutional recognition. The committee's role is to secure strong, multipartisan support around the timing, specific content and wording of the referendum proposals that were effectively outlined by the expert panel in their report.


The expert panel, co-chaired by Mr Mark Leibler AC and Professor Patrick Dobson, made four major recommendations. The first one recommends deleting section 25 of the Constitution, which of course permitted states to disqualify people from voting on the basis of race, and section 51(xxvi), which allows the Commonwealth to make laws on the basis of race. The panel also recommended adding a new section 51A, 'Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples', that recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first occupants of Australia, acknowledges the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their traditional lands and waters, respects the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and acknowledges the need to secure the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The expert panel also recommended adding a new section,116A, which would effectively prohibit any racial discrimination. It says that governments should not discriminate on the grounds of race, colour or ethnic or national origin. 


This new section, I suggest, is absolutely critical. It is more than reasonable to think that a modern democracy like ours should have a constitution that provides a guarantee against racial discrimination. Indeed, there is a very clear and compelling logic to how these proposals fit together in terms of granting constitutional recognition whilst at the same time guaranteeing no discrimination against any citizen. The argument is that these are two sides of the one coin, that you cannot have meaningful recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution if, on the other hand, you continue to enable laws that will be racially discriminatory. There is also a proposal for an additional section 127A, which is about the recognition of languages. Whilst recognising English as the national language of Australia, this section notes that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages were indeed the original Australian languages and are an important part of our national heritage.


To build the momentum needed for a successful constitutional change, a bill for an act of recognition to acknowledge the unique place of Australia's first peoples was passed with unanimous support through this parliament on 12 March 2013. Importantly, this act contained a sunset clause to ensure that this matter is progressed by parliament within two years, with that end date being March 2015. The previous Labor government invested some $10 million into helping build public awareness and community support for change. This important work is being led expertly by Reconciliation Australia via their RECOGNISE Australia campaign. I certainly hope that the joint select committee will consider, very closely, requests for additional and greater resourcing for public awareness campaigns as we get closer to the timing of a referendum. If this government is serious about constitutional recognition and the success of a referendum on the matter then this additional financial support for community education initiatives will be vital.


I would like to close now with words from the late Dr Yunupingu, Yothu Yindi's songwriter and lead singer, who leaves an enormous legacy and example for us all to respect and follow. Dr Yunupingu strongly believed that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be recognised in our nation's founding document. He said:


I want all Australians from all backgrounds, coming together for a better tomorrow. And I believe the time for change is now. So it's time for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to be formally recognised by the Constitution. It's the right and decent thing to do. Please give us your support.


The current multi-party support and growing community support for constitutional recognition does in fact offer us a historic opportunity to acknowledge the unique status of our first peoples and to remove those discriminatory provisions from our Constitution. The Australian Constitution is the founding document of our Federation, for our laws and for our government, but it is silent on the special place of Aboriginal people in this country, except of course to give implicit endorsement of discrimination in sections 25 and 51(xxvi).


Here we stand some 113 years later, with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to address this silence—to make amends for this greatest piece of unfinished business on our nation's books. As Professor Patrick Dodson noted this year in his Lowitja O'Donoghue Oration:


Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people goes to the heart of what type of nation we want to be—Are we people that shrinks from the uncomfortable truth of the past? Or a nation that is mature and capable enough to address a wrong and make our Constitution something we and the next generation can take pride in.


Opportunities to change the constitution come rarely. Labor believes the sooner our Constitution gives recognition to our first peoples the better. It is time to put an end to the constitutional exclusion of Aboriginal people from the national polity.


Debate adjourned.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:27):  Deputy Speaker Porter, can I say at the outset how pleased I am that you are in the chair, being a member of this committee and somebody who I have enjoyed an interlocution with over the subject matters of this report. As you know, all of those members of the 44th Parliament who represent a major party were elected on a platform which included the bipartisan proposition that it is now time to recognise the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and their language, cultures and unbroken connection to land, in the founding document of our Commonwealth—that is, our Constitution.


I cannot improve on the words of my friend and colleague Senator Nova Peris, who explained that in this act of recognition we do not ask that Australians relinquish 200 years of settlement and that history, but rather we join to that over 40,000 years of continuous Aboriginal history. Nova is a renowned Australian and the first Aboriginal woman to be elected to our federal parliament. She is a powerful advocate and tells a poignant personal story on the importance of recognition. Nova is the first Indigenous woman to be elected to the Australian Senate.


As you would know, it took over 70 years from the time of Federation for the first Aboriginal Australian to enter the federal parliament as a member of this place. On 8 September 1971, that first Aboriginal Australian to take up a seat, Senator Neville Bonner, made his first speech to parliament. In that speech he made the following observation:


Less than 200 years ago the white man came, I say now in all sincerity that my people were shot, poisoned, hanged and broken in spirit until they became refugees in their own land. But that is history and we take care now of the present while, I should hope, we look to the future. Following the advent of the white man came a transitional period which still exists today. Then began to appear the emotional scars; the psychological wounds became a torment from which by and large we have still not recovered. 


That was in 1971 and it is well known to most members in this place that we have still not completed the task of reconciliation. Those wounds have still not been healed. I have chosen Neville Bonner because he was the first Aboriginal senator in this place. I could equally have quoted from scores and scores of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have told their story in very moving ways about the impact that settlement has had, the impact of dispossession and the impact on our first peoples' cultures, their livelihood and their psyche. I was very moved when I again read the 2008 contribution of Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who spoke of the fact that he has met and discussed this issue with every Australian Prime Minister from Gough Whitlam to the present, and how it is his deep concern that we resolve this issue of constitutional recognition.


The simple objective of recognition is slightly more complicated when we attend our focus to the text of the Constitution. It is a resilient document which has been interpreted flexibly over the past 114 years, but there are some sections which cannot be reinterpreted as anything other than racist in their intent. Section 25 is one such section. It contemplates the race-based exclusion of people from the electoral roll for state or federal elections. It is inconceivable that we might address the subject of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples without addressing this racist remnant within our Constitution. As the report states, there is clear agreement on the removal of this clause.


The second issue that we need to attend to is a clear statement of recognition, and in this the obvious task has been aided by the work of the expert panel who have handed down a report which the JSC has had the benefit of relying upon. There are forms of words within there, and within the interim report of the JSC, which I think all parliamentarians can attend their mind to and around which we will find agreement.


That is the first two of three tasks that need to be completed in the act of recognition, the first being the removal of racist clauses and the second being the inclusion of a statement of recognition. But the expert panel recommended—and I agree—that we need to do one further thing. I argue that we need to go further and include within the proposition to be put before the Australian people a clause which would prohibit henceforth the Commonwealth parliament from passing legislation which discriminates against people on the basis of their race. I argue that the members of the government and their supporters within the community should support this constitutional protection against discrimination, and I believe that it is entirely consistent with liberal and conservative philosophy. A failure to do that—to support the protection of this right—is a denial of fundamental liberal values, the first of which—which those on the conservative side of politics have long held dear—goes to the primacy of the rights of individuals. Governments, it is argued, should only do what individuals cannot do and should tread warily when interfering with the rights of individuals that are recognised by all civil societies. Liberals have long imagined a society built upon the primacy of those rights of individuals—the rights to property untrammelled by interference from government, the rights of freedom of speech and the right of freedom against arbitrary detention without trial. Our Constitution protects some of these but not all of them. I also argue that the protection against discrimination on the basis of race is one of these rights that liberals have always championed.


The second reason I argue that this is consistent with liberal philosophy goes to a consistent thread of liberalism from the founding of the Liberal Party and the conservative parties to this date—that is, the fact that there should be reasonable restraints upon governmental power. No government and no parliament should have unlimited power to legislate in ways that interfere with the liberties of its citizens. This is a point that is made with special force in societies that have sought to federate their governmental powers as a check and balance against central government. The constraints are underpinned by social norms, by democratic representation and by the rule of law—but, importantly, these powers should also be constrained by that constitutional protection against those forms of discrimination that I contemplate.


The third point is this: the protection of the rights of the minority against the majority. Whether it is in the field of workplace relations, in business or in public debate, liberals and conservatives have always sought to guard against the tyranny of majoritarian rule. It is why our founding fathers created a Senate and gave small states equal representation of senators to the larger states; it is why our Constitution contains numerous protections that were created out of concerns that the larger states would dominate the smaller ones; and it is why, in classic conservative philosophy, there is an emphasis on restraining the power of the strong against the weak.


I argue that a further protection should be the protection of individuals of a particular race, whether they are a majority or a minority, against discrimination. It is no answer to this to say that those protections should be maintained by the popular vote and through the democratic process of representative government. It is why a true liberal and a true conservative should be attracted to the notion that the right of an individual should not be determined by their race, no matter whether that individual is a part of an overwhelming majority or a tiny minority. Some may argue, and they have, that this right is already protected by federal laws—and this is true—but the fact is that the federal law does not constrain the federal parliament, as this change would contemplate. I argue simply this: those who argue that the federal parliament should be able to discriminate against people on the basis of race have an onus upon them to explain why that should be so.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-09-22,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (17:37):  I rise today to welcome the interim report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, tabled in June this year, and to welcome this opportunity to make a few brief comments on that report. Whilst not a sitting member of the committee, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the members of the committee for their work in the preparation of this interim report and to also commend the earlier work of members of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, which was formed back in 2010. I acknowledge and thank the 30 individuals and organisations who have made valuable submissions to the joint select committee and recognise the tens of thousands of Australians, right across the nation, who are actively contributing to the ongoing task of constitutional recognition. I understand that some 185,000 Australians have now signed a pledge on the Recognise Australia website, and indeed many more community and social networks have been activated around this issue.


The submissions to the expert panel were part of an extensive process of community consultation. The expert panel travelled to some 85 different communities across Australia, covering rural, remote and metro regions, and received more than 3,500 submissions—which suggests that this is definitely an issue touching deeply into the lives of many Australian citizens. 


Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution is well overdue. It is a historical oversight, or indeed a historical wrong, that must be made right. I stand firmly with Labor in the belief that the sooner our Constitution gives recognition to our first peoples the better. Labor is committed to pursuing meaningful change in the Constitution, change that unites the nation and reflects the hopes, dreams and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. 


We know that multiparty support is critical for any referendum proposal to be successful, and as such Labor is working constructively with the government through the joint committee to make sure there is a political consensus on the content of a proposal to be put to the Australian public. Australia of course does not have a very good track record of voting yes in referendums, with only 8 out of 44 referendums delivering a successful outcome. So the joint committee's interim report is extremely important, and I know that its work has been based, as it should be, on the 2012 report from the expert panel on constitutional recognition. The committee's role is to secure strong, multipartisan support around the timing, specific content and wording of the referendum proposals that were effectively outlined by the expert panel in their report.


The expert panel, co-chaired by Mr Mark Leibler AC and Professor Patrick Dobson, made four major recommendations. The first one recommends deleting section 25 of the Constitution, which of course permitted states to disqualify people from voting on the basis of race, and section 51(xxvi), which allows the Commonwealth to make laws on the basis of race. The panel also recommended adding a new section 51A, 'Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples', that recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first occupants of Australia, acknowledges the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their traditional lands and waters, respects the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and acknowledges the need to secure the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The expert panel also recommended adding a new section,116A, which would effectively prohibit any racial discrimination. It says that governments should not discriminate on the grounds of race, colour or ethnic or national origin. 


This new section, I suggest, is absolutely critical. It is more than reasonable to think that a modern democracy like ours should have a constitution that provides a guarantee against racial discrimination. Indeed, there is a very clear and compelling logic to how these proposals fit together in terms of granting constitutional recognition whilst at the same time guaranteeing no discrimination against any citizen. The argument is that these are two sides of the one coin, that you cannot have meaningful recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution if, on the other hand, you continue to enable laws that will be racially discriminatory. There is also a proposal for an additional section 127A, which is about the recognition of languages. Whilst recognising English as the national language of Australia, this section notes that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages were indeed the original Australian languages and are an important part of our national heritage.


To build the momentum needed for a successful constitutional change, a bill for an act of recognition to acknowledge the unique place of Australia's first peoples was passed with unanimous support through this parliament on 12 March 2013. Importantly, this act contained a sunset clause to ensure that this matter is progressed by parliament within two years, with that end date being March 2015. The previous Labor government invested some $10 million into helping build public awareness and community support for change. This important work is being led expertly by Reconciliation Australia via their RECOGNISE Australia campaign. I certainly hope that the joint select committee will consider, very closely, requests for additional and greater resourcing for public awareness campaigns as we get closer to the timing of a referendum. If this government is serious about constitutional recognition and the success of a referendum on the matter then this additional financial support for community education initiatives will be vital.


I would like to close now with words from the late Dr Yunupingu, Yothu Yindi's songwriter and lead singer, who leaves an enormous legacy and example for us all to respect and follow. Dr Yunupingu strongly believed that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be recognised in our nation's founding document. He said:


I want all Australians from all backgrounds, coming together for a better tomorrow. And I believe the time for change is now. So it's time for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to be formally recognised by the Constitution. It's the right and decent thing to do. Please give us your support.


The current multi-party support and growing community support for constitutional recognition does in fact offer us a historic opportunity to acknowledge the unique status of our first peoples and to remove those discriminatory provisions from our Constitution. The Australian Constitution is the founding document of our Federation, for our laws and for our government, but it is silent on the special place of Aboriginal people in this country, except of course to give implicit endorsement of discrimination in sections 25 and 51(xxvi).


Here we stand some 113 years later, with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to address this silence—to make amends for this greatest piece of unfinished business on our nation's books. As Professor Patrick Dodson noted this year in his Lowitja O'Donoghue Oration:


Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people goes to the heart of what type of nation we want to be—Are we people that shrinks from the uncomfortable truth of the past? Or a nation that is mature and capable enough to address a wrong and make our Constitution something we and the next generation can take pride in.


Opportunities to change the constitution come rarely. Labor believes the sooner our Constitution gives recognition to our first peoples the better. It is time to put an end to the constitutional exclusion of Aboriginal people from the national polity.

"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2014-09-22,"



Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (18:15):  In light of the approaching National Police Remembrance Day, I am thankful for this opportunity to acknowledge the significant role police officers play in our community and the great deal of risk and sacrifice that comes with their job. National Police Remembrance Day is held on 29 September each year to reflect on those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Each year thousands of people across Australia stop to pay tribute to the brave members of the police force who have lost their lives and to offer support to their families. 


I have felt compelled to raise awareness of the National Police Remembrance Day as I proudly served my community as a police officer for 25 years, reaching the rank of sergeant. I know what it is like to leave your family at home each day, to go out and protect other families in the community. I joined the New South Wales Police Force in October 1985, graduating from class 216. My career in the Police Force was very rewarding, but as an officer I had to deal with many challenging and confronting situations. I will never forget my first autopsy, my first deceased person or my first fatal motor vehicle accident that I attended.


During my time in the New South Wales Police Force, I saw firsthand the devastating effects the death of a colleague can have on their family, friends and other police officers, and the entire community in which they serve. A death within the force is a solemn reminder of the dangers our police force face and the risks they must take every time they go to work to keep our community safe. As any member of an emergency service would know, it takes a great deal of courage to leave your own family behind to protect those who you have never met each time you go to work. When an officer is killed in the line of duty, there is no telling how many police officers are affected from all over Australia. Many officers reconsider the risk they take every day and the family members they would leave behind if something were to go wrong.


The camaraderie in the police force is second to none. That is why so many police officers and former members of the police force will stop to remember their fallen comrades on 29 September. Even if they do not personally know an officer who has been killed, they know how easy it could be for a day at work to turn into a horrible nightmare for themselves or their colleagues.


Each year a Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance is held to honour those comrades who have fallen in the line of duty. Officers travel from the Police Wall of Remembrance at the Domain in Sydney to Canberra and are joined by police officers from Australia's other states and territories along the way. The ride is a great tribute to those officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice protecting the community. It not only commemorates the sacrifice made by the fallen officers but raises money for the loved ones they have left behind.


Previously in this House I have spoken about two courageous police officers who were killed whilst on duty. Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding was killed after responding to an armed robbery and hostage situation on the Gold Coast in May 2011. Constable Leeding was described by his family and peers as a great father, a top bloke, a larrikin and a hero. His death had a devastating impact on the Gold Coast community and police officers across the country. 


I also spoke about Senior Constable Jim Affleck, a highway patrol officer from my electorate who was run down during a police pursuit along the F5 in 2001. Jim was laying road spikes to stop a stolen vehicle when he was run down at high speed. I remember that day like it was yesterday, as would many others in Macarthur. After his death, Jim was awarded the Commissioner's Valour Award for his exceptional bravery. Jim was a dedicated professional police officer and his death shocked not only the police force but the entire Campbelltown community in which he served. The deaths of these two police officers, as with any police officer killed on duty, demonstrate the danger members of the force put themselves in every day to keep the community safe.


I join many people in the Macarthur electorate who have the utmost respect and admiration for the members of the police force. These men and women take great risks every time they go to work and they deserve so much respect from the community for risking their lives to protect others. Macarthur has more than 300 police officers working in Camden, Campbelltown and Macquarie Fields local area commands, serving their local community. These men and women worked very hard to fight crime and keep our residents safe. Away from work they are normal people with loving families, with high hopes and dreams for the future. At work they are brave and courageous men and women who do everything they can to protect my electorate.


Earlier this year, I was proud to recognise in this House the recipients of the Macarthur Rotary eighth annual Police Officer of the Year awards. The award ceremony is an opportunity for Rotary clubs in the Macarthur region, on behalf of the community, to recognise the good work being done day in and day out by the majority of the men and women in the New South Wales Police Force. In 2014, the Macarthur Police Officer of the Year award was presented to Leading Senior Constable Eleanor Jenkins from the Campbelltown local area command. LSC Jenkins is a perfect example of the dedication and commitment that our police officers give to the job every time they go to work, combining shift work and family responsibilities whilst doing front-line policing duties.


Our police force is made up of thousands of hardworking, dedicated and courageous people like this, and has been for many decades. In 2012, New South Wales commemorated the 150th anniversary of the New South Wales Police Force. The anniversary was held on 1 March because, on this day in 1862, the independent police units of a colony were amalgamated into the single New South Wales Police Force. These officers serve our community with great integrity and honour. I hope that one day everyone will appreciate the sacrifices they make and the risks they take to protect us.


For some, being a police officer follows a long line of family members who also served in the police force. Senior Sergeant John Thompson celebrates 52 years in the force this year. He began his career in 1962. I was fortunate enough to work with Senior Sergeant Thompson towards the end of my career in the police force. He comes from a long line of dedicated police officers. Sergeant Thompson's great-great-grandfather, John Carroll, caught the bushranger Captain Moonlight. His grandfather and father were also police officers. Now Sergeant Thompson is the second longest serving police officer in New South Wales.


I mention Sergeant Thompson today because he is a fine example of the dedication and commitment that our police officers give to the job. It is not an easy job to do. Far too many officers have paid the ultimate sacrifice and have lost their lives doing it. Unless you have worked in the police force, or have a family member who does, it is hard to comprehend the dangers these men and women put themselves in every day to keep the community safe. Today, I would like to make a special mention of all the policemen and policewomen working tirelessly in my electorate. Macarthur owes a great deal to these police officers for their ongoing commitment to protecting our community. On behalf of the people of Macarthur, I would like to thank those who currently serve our community. You deserve the highest respect for the work you do. 


Over the years, I have met with many of these officers who love their job serving the community in this way. But no matter how much they love being a police officer, they all know the risks and dangers they face every time they put their uniform on. In New South Wales alone, we have lost more than 240 police officers in the line of duty since August 1803 for a variety of causes. These include being shot by bushrangers, drowning whilst crossing a creek, being shot by an offender, being assaulted, motorcycle accidents during pursuit and motor vehicle accidents. No matter how they died, it is terribly sad when the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting others are killed whilst doing so.


Today, I would also like to pay tribute to Police Legacy organisations across the country. Police Legacy is a not-for-profit organisation which provides emotional and financial support to the widows and children of deceased police officers. The mission statement of the New South Wales Police Legacy is that no widow, widower or child of deceased, serving, or former police officers will ever feel forgotten or in need. 


The New South Wales organisation currently provides support for more than 1,300 police family members, caring for children as young as two and widows as old as 101. As of May 2014, Police Legacy Queensland was supporting 48 families. South Australian Police Legacy has been in operation since 1989. It cares for more than 360 widows and 60 children. There are currently 361 widows, three widowers and 43 children under 20 years of age being supported by Western Australian Police Legacy. Victorian and Northern Territory Police Legacy organisations are also strongly committed to supporting families, widows and their children. Today, I would like to acknowledge the good work of Police Legacy who look after remaining loved ones of the police officers that have been killed in the line of duty.


In the lead-up to National Police Remembrance Day, my heart goes out to the families of all police officers who have been killed in the line of duty. I offer them my heartfelt condolences. I am sure that they share with me the hope that one day society will understand and respect the great undertaking that is required to serve as a police officer. Until then, I am sure the brave men and women of Australia's police forces will continue to protect their communities despite the dangers they face and the harsh reality that some may not return home to their families. I believe it is important that we in this House continue to express our gratitude and reaffirm our support for the nation's 56,000 police officers whose dedication and commitment ensure continuous peace and safety across our communities.
