"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-11-02,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 731. 
This is a very important motion to hundreds of thousands of our fellow human beings. I do not believe that it ought not be a matter for urgent discussion in this chamber because of the fixed view of the opposition that anything to do with matters outside our national boundaries is not a matter for debate in this chamber—certainly under the process of motions at this time. The motion reads:
That the Senate—
	(a)	notes the 2 to 1 judgement of the Supreme Court of India to allow the Sardar Sarovar project in the Narmada Valley—
for those who do not know, that is to the north of Mumbai and inland from the western Indian coastline—
to proceed to completion `at the earliest', and that this will lead to progressive increases in the height of the dam wall to 90 metres and beyond with the agreed consequences—
that is, agreed by the three judges—
of displacing thousands of minority peoples from their ancient living areas against their will, without the promised rights to rehabilitation and despite the drowning of affected environments; and
	(b)	respectfully calls on the President (Mr Narayanan) and the Prime Minister (Mr Vajpayee) of India to implement the precautionary approach of the minority Judge J Bharuch recommending that further construction ceases until a committee of experts gives it an environmental clearance.
This is an extraordinary project. This is going to drown the lives of not just hundreds, not just thousands, but eventually hundreds of thousands of poor people who have no say. We know from past progress that they are going to have, through lies and cheating at the highest level, displacement without restitution.
I point to an earlier project in India—the flooding of the Pong dam in 1961—where a high official, Morarji Desai, said to the people being flooded by that project:
We will request you to move from your houses after the dam comes up. If you move, it will be good. Otherwise we shall release the waters and drown you all.
I am quoting from Arundhati Roy's recently printed book, The cost of living. Ram Bai, whose village was submerged when the Bargi dam was built on the Narmada, the system we are talking about—I think there are some 3,000 dams proposed for this one river system—now lives in a slum in Jabalpur instead of getting the rehabilitation they promised. This woman now says:
Why didn't they just poison us? Then we wouldn't have to live in this shithole and the government could have survived alone with its precious dam all to itself.
We are in a world where it is very important that we stand for the rights of poor people, particularly indigenous people. The process now for the people on the Narmada is to stay with their homes. Some of them are threatening to stay there and drown rather than be moved because it is, indeed, the end of their lives. 
Let me finish by quoting from Arundhati Roy's new book. She says:
Even as I write, the monsoon is raging outside my window. It's high noon, but the sky is dark, and my lights are on. I know that the waters of the Sardar Sarovar reservoir are rising every hour. More than ten thousand people face submergence. They have nowhere to go. I have tried very hard to communicate the urgency of what is happening in the valley. But in the cities, people's eyes glaze over. “Yes, it's sad,” we say. “But it can't be helped. We need electricity.” The story of the Narmada valley is nothing less than the story of Modern India. Like the tiger in the Belgrade zoo during the NATO bombing, we've begun to eat our own limbs.
I believe we should express our concern for our fellow human beings and this environment. We should be sending this message to the authorities of India. I am at least grateful that in this democratic chamber I have had the opportunity to speak up for those people in this awesome circumstance.",SENATE,<title>SARDAR SAROVAR PROJECT</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I thank Senator Brown for deferring this motion from yesterday. As he knows, we have a process of consultation about motions that appear in the Senate and our process had not been completed at that time, so I thank Senator Brown for that courtesy. It was conveyed to Senator Brown's office this morning that we do not support the motion, although we could only leave a message on the telephone answering machine—that is not a criticism, just a statement of fact. Indeed, we do not support the suspension or the motion and there is a variety of reasons why.  
I am charged with addressing why this matter should not be given precedence. Even having heard all the comments of Senator Brown, I have to say that this motion is not a motion that cannot be dealt with in the ordinary course of the business of the Senate. There are good reasons why this matter ought to be given proper consideration. I do not think that anything Senator Brown said indicated that this matter was so imminent that it had to be dealt with today. The opposition have for some time had a policy in relation to these matters and that is that, where they are controversial, they should be properly debated rather than dealt with on a formal basis, and we do not resile from that position. We simply say that, in relation to this matter, there is nothing in the matters that have been put before us that indicates that it is a matter which is so pressing that not dealing with it today would mean that the subject would not be available to us to consider later. For that reason we will be opposing the motion.",SENATE,<title>SARDAR SAROVAR PROJECT</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-02,"—I would like to speak briefly to this issue. It is an important one. Whilst it concerns a development—perhaps that is not the right word—or an operation in India rather than Australia, it is very significant. It highlights again some of the problems and difficulties that ordinary people in developing countries have in trying to retain basic human rights. There is any number of examples that could be pointed to of inappropriate projects and developments that have caused immense disruption to everyday people in many parts of the world. In this context, it is worth drawing attention to the Democrat legislation, put forward by Senator Bourne, aimed at trying to ensure appropriate standards of behaviour by Australian companies overseas, and that would include projects such as this. This project does not involve Australian companies, but any Australian company involved in any project or proposal would need to operate in a manner that met appropriate standards. That is one example of the Democrats' attempts to try to raise the standards of behaviour and to try to prevent unfortunate occurrences like this one continuing to happen as they do.
If they have the opportunity, it would be worth while for all senators to obtain a copy of a speech that was given yesterday during lunch time at the National Press Club by Anita Roddick, the founder of the Body Shop. She spoke about corporate behaviour and the need for greater morality in the business world. The power of economics nowadays far outweighs, in many cases, the power of governments. In that context, it is crucial that we try not only to bring attention to issues like this but also to raise the standards of behaviour in corporations, governments and citizens around in the world, and the belief in their actions. It was a fascinating and very inspirational speech, and I very much recommend it to everybody. It goes to the heart not specifically of this project but of why these things continue to happen and why it is such a problem that they do. The precautionary approach that was recommended by the majority judge in this case is a crucial one not just in environmental terms but in terms of human rights and human lives. It is, I think, appropriate that we seek every opportunity to incorporate that not just into law but into behaviour and into the ethos of the global community.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2000-11-02,"—On behalf of Senator Gibson, I present the following report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit: Report No. 379, Contract management in the Australian Public Service. I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The statement read as follows—
Madam President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I have pleasure in presenting the Committee's Report No. 379, Contract Management in the Australian Public Service.
The search for excellence in contract management is one of the most pressing challenges for the APS. With the move to greater outsourcing of programs and services, public sector agencies must equip themselves with a range of skills, knowledge and experience to ensure that contract management is efficient and effective. 
The following figures help to give some context to the scale of contract management in the APS: 
·	in 1998-99, there were just over 111 000 purchasing transactions of goods and services of value greater than $2 000 reported by Commonwealth Government agencies, totalling $7.9 billion; and
·	over 30 000 suppliers are awarded contracts of value greater than $2 000 by the Commonwealth annually.
·	Madam President, in view of the public monies allocated to purchasing goods and services, and the complexities of managing government contracts, it is essential that this aspect of public administration be given sufficient and ongoing scrutiny.
The Committee, therefore, examined the following issues:
·	the adequacy of the accountability framework;
·	major contracting fundamentals including contract specifications and performance monitoring; and
·	the key challenges for contract management personnel.
The Accountability Framework
Madam President, the key issue that has arisen as part of this and other inquiries is the growing extent to which executive government is applying commercial-in-confidence status to all or parts of government contracts. 
The Committee concluded that accountability and parliamentary scrutiny is being eroded through the application of commercial-in-confidence to all or parts of government contracts.
The Committee, after reviewing a range of accountability options, recommended an accountability framework that would, if implemented, be effective and practical. The framework includes the following key principles:
·	that all contract management staff must have the highest regard for public and parliamentary accountability, and accept, in the first instance, that all government contracts will be subject to full public scrutiny; and
·	if it can be shown that public access to a government contract is not in the Commonwealth's best interest then a claim can be made to exclude certain clauses of a contract from public access but not the entire contract.
Madam President, if Commonwealth agencies maintain that part of a contract must be confidential then they must give reasons to the parliament. The Committee, therefore, recommended that all CEOs under the FMA Act should, whenever claiming commercial-in-confidence, issue a certificate stating which parts of a contract and why these parts are to be withheld.
Each agency is expected to respond to this recommendation. Those agencies that reject the recommendation will need to state this and give reasons to the Committee.
In addition to this measure, the Committee proposed that all agencies: 
·	must establish and maintain an effective contract register;
·	must indicate in their Annual Reports if they have exempted any contracts, exceeding $2000 in value, from notification in the Purchasing and Disposals Gazette; 
·	the Auditor-General should conduct a review of agency performance in complying with the reporting requirements of the Gazette Publishing System; and
·	that the Ombudsman Act 1976 be amended to extend the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to include all government contractors.
The Committee again reviewed the access powers of the Auditor-General, and reaffirmed recommendation five in Report 368 which stated that the Auditor-General must have access to contractors' premises for the purpose of inspecting and copying documentation and records directly related to a Commonwealth contract, and to inspect any Commonwealth assets held on the premises of the contractor This power is an essential part of the accountability process and will be another tool in protecting the Commonwealth's interests.
The overwhelming evidence to this inquiry, from both industry and government agencies, is that Auditor-General access to contractors' premises is accepted by contractors and has not led to them raising their prices. In addition, the equivalent of the Auditor-General in the United States, the Comptroller General, does have the power to access contractor premises.
Contracting Fundamentals
Madam President, I now turn to the Committee's examination of key contracting fundamentals. Drafting appropriate and effective contract specifications is considered to be the key element from which all other contracting responsibilities are tied. The Committee noted the support for the use of functional/performance based specifications over process specifications. Functional specifications help to develop innovative approaches in achieving outcomes.
Madam President, the Committee's examination revealed a case of excessive monitoring which, based on the evidence,  the contractor could not fulfil. BUSY Inc has a contract with the Department of Employment, Training and Youth Affairs to provide Entry Level Training Support Services. One of the key performance specifications of this contract requires BUSY Inc to visit every employer every six to 10 weeks to ensure adequate service provision. Visits must be personal. 
The problem is BUSY Inc has 20 000 `files' which relate to clients at various progress stages. The Committee suggests, that if this performance requirement is correct, then BUSY Inc would not be able to complete the task using email let alone by personal visits. The Committee draws this example to the attention not only of DETYA but all agencies as a constant reminder to appropriately specify monitoring exercises that are cost and time effective yet produce adequate decision making information.
In relation to performance monitoring, the Committee noted that the Auditor-General has revealed several weaknesses with agency contract performance management. These include not specifying adequate performance information, not using the information to adequately monitor performance, and not undertaking regular consultation with the service provider. In view of the this, the Committee concluded that all agencies should, as part of their internal audit program, review the adequacy and effectiveness of their contract key performance measures and monitoring frameworks.
In relation to risk management, the Auditor-General found that there was minimal consideration of the contract management risks associated with the final two phases of the contract lifecycle, namely contract administration and performance monitoring and contract succession. Therefore, the Committee concluded that the Department of Finance and Administration, in its next edition of Competitive Tendering and Contracting Guidance for Managers, should ensure that advice and guidance on risk management addresses all phases of the contract lifecycle.
Madam President, one of the major issues examined under risk management is the allocation of risk between contractors and the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's approach to risk allocation is that risks should be managed by the party most capable of controlling that risk. The Committee notes concerns by industry organisations that government agencies often sought to transfer as much risk as possible to contractors. 
While the Committee supports the position that risk should be managed by the party best able to control it, agencies should take note of industry concerns. Risk allocation, however, must remain a negotiation issue between the Government agency contracting out and the service provider.
Contract Management Personnel
Finally, I turn to the Committee's examination of contract management personnel. Madam President, legal aspects of contract management are critical. It is essential that all contract managers have legal awareness. Apart from day to day management, this legal awareness will ensure that a contract manager, who must have a broad range of skills, will know when to seek legal advice. Agency CEOs must provide the training opportunities for contract staff to acquire critical skills and knowledge such as legal awareness. 
The Committee noted that corporate memory is a vital part of effective corporate management. While agencies understand this, there was little information on strategies for retaining and strengthening corporate knowledge. Therefore, the Committee concluded that CEOs should undertake an internal audit of contract staff focusing on skills, expertise, and separation patterns.
Madam President, the Committee is pleased to note that more agencies are reporting that they have centralised purchasing units which provide a source of procurement and contract management expertise which other staff can use for guidance and advice. This trend follows a finding made by the Committee in Report 369, Australian Government Procurement.
In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to express the Committee's appreciation to those people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings.
I would like to thank the members of the sectional committee for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. I also thank the secretariat staff who were involved in the inquiry: the Secretary to the Committee, Margot Kerley; sectional committee Secretary, Stephen Boyd; research officer, Ms Paola Cerrato-D'Amico and administrative officer Tiana Gray.
Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title>,Committees,7,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I rise to speak on this report, as it is a report of great significance arising out of an earlier report of the Joint Public Accounts and Audit Committee on Australian government procurement. This report is entitlement Contract management in the Australian Public Service. It goes one step further in examining the processes involved in Australian Public Service procurement, which is a very large area indeed. Paragraph 1.6 on page 3 of the report outlines the reasons for the inquiry. I will elaborate on this as I go through a brief examination of the report. Paragraph 1.6 states:
With the move to greater outsourcing of programs and services, public sector agencies must equip themselves with a range of skills, knowledge and experience to ensure that contract management is efficient and effective. 
At the end of the day, what we are seeking is that the Commonwealth gets value for money in the massive number of contracts that are let. The report referred to that: there were some 111,753 in 1998-99, and the value of contracts greater than $2,000 reported by Commonwealth government agencies totalled $7.9 billion. So we are indeed dealing with a large amount of money, and we are indeed dealing with a real need for accountability to ensure that those contracts are, firstly, proper contracts and, secondly, pursued properly and delivered to the Commonwealth in a fit and proper manner. 
Chapter 2 of the report goes to the issue of accountability. Paragraph 2.1 of the report says:
Previous inquiries have concluded that this trend—
that is, the trend to commercial-in-confidence—
is reducing parliamentary accountability and the public's `right to know'.
One of the things that I have pursued in this place is the right of the parliament and the public to know of the expenditure of the Commonwealth in its various departments over a period of time. One of the obstacles that has been put in place against people such as me trying to inquire into the efficacy of some of these contracts is that very issue of commercial-in-confidence. 
The second part of paragraph 2.5 goes on to point out the mechanisms available to the parliament and to the public for accountability. One of the mechanisms that I am closely associated with is estimates. It is in the estimates process where I and many of my colleagues have run into the difficulties of commercial-in-confidence. This report is timely because it notes that this greater trend to application of commercial-in-confidence is reducing parliamentary accountability and the public's right to know. 
It is interesting to note the comments of the Australian National Audit Office at paragraph 2.37 when they say:
From our perspective, it is probably too easy at the moment for agencies to claim commercial-in-confidence. We think that the weighting should come back the other way, but I would still say that there would be instances where we have to be very careful with that information. 
So the situation is that the ANAO have run into difficulties with commercial-in-confidence. They are say-ing that the weighting has moved too far the other way, resulting in many of these contracts where commercial-in-confidence is claimed not having the transparency that should and must apply. 
The report goes on, quite rightly, to point out at paragraph 2.38:
The ANAO in addressing the application of commercial-in-confidence to government contracts supports a reverse onus of proof test. That is, `information should be made public unless there is a good reason for it not to be.' 
That seems fair and reasonable. The ANAO go on to say in paragraph 2.38:
The ANAO indicated that this would `require the party that argues for non-disclosure to substantiate that exposure would be harmful to its commercial interests.' 
That is a very important tenet that has been placed in this report to draw attention to the fact that commercial-in-confidence is being used; it is being weighted against public accountability and transparency. There needs to be a shift, and that shift needs to come back very much the other way. The report went on to say that the committee would not endorse the codification of a set of principles for determining whether commercial-in-confidence should be able to be claimed in the writing of a contract. Nonetheless, the committee did urge in its report at para 2.76 that there should be:
... preventative measures, suggested by the ANAO, that would help to change the culture and approach of contract managers towards accountability. In particular, contract managers must accept the premise that government contracts should be subject to full public scrutiny.
That is what the public wants; that is what the parliament wants; that is what we must have. This cloak of secrecy caused by the claim of commercial-in-confidence is insufficient. Whilst the committee would not codify a set of principles for the claiming of commercial-in-confidence, it recommended at para 2.80:
That all CEOs under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 should, whenever claiming commercial-in-confidence, issue a certificate stating which parts of a contract and why these parts are to be withheld.
It will be interesting to see the response that we get from the government on that recommendation, but it may well be just a small start in removing this grab that seems to be going on to claim commercial-in-confidence within contracts. The report went on at para 2.127 to reaffirm an already stated recommendation of the committee in its report 368 in respect of the access by the Auditor-General to appropriate records such that the Auditor-General can be reasonably confident that the delivery of the contract has been covered for the Commonwealth government. The recommendation bears reading. It says:
The Committee recommends that the Minister for Finance make legislative provision, either through amendment of the Auditor-General Act or the Finance Minister's Orders, to enable the Auditor-General to access the premises of a contractor for the purpose of inspecting and copying documentation and records directly related to a Commonwealth contract, and to inspect any Commonwealth assets held on the premises of the contractor, where such access is, in the opinion of the Auditor-General, required to assist in the performance of an Auditor-General function.
There we have a recommendation, where we now have a great deal of outsourcing, to give the Auditor-General the appropriate access so that accountability can be assured for the parliament and for the government of the day. 
In concluding, I just want to say that there are some other important issues which I have not touched on, one being the need for corporate memory to be retained within the Public Service such that the management of contracts can be handled in a fit and proper manner. The other issue, of course, is the training and the education of those people who are managing the contracts, because we believe as a result of this inquiry that there is a need for best practice to ensure that value for money is being given to the Commonwealth in the management of contracts in the Australian Public Service. I commend the report to the Senate and I seek leave to continue my remarks.

The report goes on, quite rightly, to point out at paragraph 2.38:
The ANAO in addressing the application of commercial-in-confidence to government contracts supports a reverse onus of proof test. That is, `information should be made public unless there is a good reason for it not to be.' 
That seems fair and reasonable. The ANAO go on to say in paragraph 2.38:
The ANAO indicated that this would `require the party that argues for non-disclosure to substantiate that exposure would be harmful to its commercial interests.' 
That is a very important tenet that has been placed in this report to draw attention to the fact that commercial-in-confidence is being used; it is being weighted against public accountability and transparency. There needs to be a shift, and that shift needs to come back very much the other way. The report went on to say that the committee would not endorse the codification of a set of principles for determining whether commercial-in-confidence should be able to be claimed in the writing of a contract. Nonetheless, the committee did urge in its report at para 2.76 that there should be:
... preventative measures, suggested by the ANAO, that would help to change the culture and approach of contract managers towards accountability. In particular, contract managers must accept the premise that government contracts should be subject to full public scrutiny.
That is what the public wants; that is what the parliament wants; that is what we must have. This cloak of secrecy caused by the claim of commercial-in-confidence is insufficient. Whilst the committee would not codify a set of principles for the claiming of commercial-in-confidence, it recommended at para 2.80:
That all CEOs under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 should, whenever claiming commercial-in-confidence, issue a certificate stating which parts of a contract and why these parts are to be withheld.
It will be interesting to see the response that we get from the government on that recommendation, but it may well be just a small start in removing this grab that seems to be going on to claim commercial-in-confidence within contracts. The report went on at para 2.127 to reaffirm an already stated recommendation of the committee in its report 368 in respect of the access by the Auditor-General to appropriate records such that the Auditor-General can be reasonably confident that the delivery of the contract has been covered for the Commonwealth government. The recommendation bears reading. It says:
The Committee recommends that the Minister for Finance make legislative provision, either through amendment of the Auditor-General Act or the Finance Minister's Orders, to enable the Auditor-General to access the premises of a contractor for the purpose of inspecting and copying documentation and records directly related to a Commonwealth contract, and to inspect any Commonwealth assets held on the premises of the contractor, where such access is, in the opinion of the Auditor-General, required to assist in the performance of an Auditor-General function.
There we have a recommendation, where we now have a great deal of outsourcing, to give the Auditor-General the appropriate access so that accountability can be assured for the parliament and for the government of the day. 
In concluding, I just want to say that there are some other important issues which I have not touched on, one being the need for corporate memory to be retained within the Public Service such that the management of contracts can be handled in a fit and proper manner. The other issue, of course, is the training and the education of those people who are managing the contracts, because we believe as a result of this inquiry that there is a need for best practice to ensure that value for money is being given to the Commonwealth in the management of contracts in the Australian Public Service. I commend the report to the Senate and I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-02,"—The minister is not here at the moment, and I am waiting on a response to some questions that have been raised. He will have those, I am sure. He will be able to tell me the date on which the guidelines cleared the legal and audit branch of the department, I have got no doubt. Here he is. There have been some discussions this morning about this bill. My concerns concerning the guidelines were canvassed with officers and the minister's office this morning, and I understand that there have emerged some proposals with regard to the amendments I have moved to this bill. I have not actually seen the government's response to these matters so is it possible, Minister, for me to have a look at the wording that is being proposed?",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-02,"—I gather, Senator Carr, that there has been some discussion between your office and that of the minister for education in relation to this matter. I have before me a draft proposed amendment which I can provide to you so that we can go through it. It basically states, under the heading `Report to parliament':
The Minister, as soon as practicable after the information is available and at least annually, from 2002, must cause to be laid before each House of Parliament, a report on:
(a) how funding appropriated under this Act has been distributed, annually, by institution and by State and sector;
(b) all performance information requested and collated, aggregated by State and sector as reported in the National Report on Schooling in Australia; and 
(c) the reason for any decisions to reduce funding to any provider.
That relates to I think clause 19 of the bill. It would come in under part 5 as a fresh clause which would be added on after the previous clauses of the bill. So it would not amend any particular clause in that bill but would come in as an amendment to the bill. I do not know how you find that, Senator Carr.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-02,"—Minister, I appreciate that these things have been done in a hurry. Unfortunately, the proposal that we spoke of this morning, before the commencement of business, went to the issue of the agreements being made public. That proposal has been excluded entirely from this proposition, and that is not what we discussed. What we discussed was the concern of the department about the agreements being made public prior to their commencement. Why is it the government's view that these agreements should not be made public at all?",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-02,"—There is, of course, a commercial-in-confidence argument there, Senator Carr. I know that you will shake your head at that. I think Senator Hogg, who is in the chair, was talking about this this morning in relation to a report from a committee. It is dealing with agreements relating to indigenous education and it would provide information on commercial matters. It is not normal for those sorts of agreements to be published. The principal is fairly clear. The Commonwealth does not, as a rule, publish all of its commercial contracts. These are contracts and they touch on commercial matters. I really think we cannot take that matter much further.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-02,"—Minister, I am very disappointed with that response. We spoke this morning of the concern the department had about commercial-in-confidence. I was prepared to discuss what their concerns were in that regard but, frankly, this is a device that is used far too readily by this government. I need to have it explained to me. What is it about educational providers that is so commercial in confidence? We are talking here about moneys being paid by this parliament to educational providers. This is not even contestable in the open market. This is the relationship between schools and other educational institutions and the Commonwealth department. That is the nature of these agreements, as I understand them. If I am wrong on that, can you please explain that to me? If there is something that is so secret about this, I think we need to know what it is because my suspicions are immediately aroused as to why it is that this government does not want to have any level of serious public accountability on this matter.
We are talking here about $600 million going to some of the most disadvantaged people in this country. We are entitled to know how those people are being treated by educational providers. We are entitled to know how it is that this government intends to spend the money we are appropriating. I may well be entirely satisfied with the current administration of this particular section in the department, but what if it changes? What if the government policy changes? This gives us no opportunity to explore those questions. I come back to the central point: this is not about saying that we are trying to get into the nitty-gritty of commercial relationships in terms of the provision of contestable moneys. That is another argument entirely. This is, as I understand it, about moneys going to help people who ought to be getting a much better go. We are talking about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, their communities and their families. I tried to put a view in terms of the second reading debate about the context of this particular issue. The levels of disadvantage for Aboriginal communities defy description. It is a great tragedy that so little is being done by the parliaments of this country in this regard. Whatever good intentions there may well be in sections of the government, unless we can be certain that this money is being spent properly I will continue to remain sceptical as to whether or not this is the best allocation of the moneys concerned.
The real problem that is emerging in this debate is essentially the cargo cult mentality of state public services—that is, the Commonwealth parliament is here to provide a very large brown paper bag and that there should be no essential accountability for how that money is spent. Education departments around this country think it is their right to receive a truckload of money and not have to argue about how they are going to use it. That is a position that I find very difficult to accept. As I said, in the context of mortality rates in the community amongst Aboriginal people being so high, when you see the health concerns in general terms being so high, when you see the appalling conditions in which people are expected to live and when you see basic services like telephones and electricity not being provided, is there any wonder that Aboriginal kids are not able to as well at school as we would all like to see. Frankly, unless we can be certain that the money is going to those communities and being spent by those communities to alleviate those concerns, then I am not satisfied. The days are gone when we could hand out very large sums of money to top up the administrative costs of the public services in the states. Minister, I need to know: what is it about these agreements that is so secret that you do not want to see them made public? ",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-02,"—They are not that secret, because I can recall an instance, Senator Carr, at estimates when we provided copies of indigenous education agreements to you. As I recall, that was a couple of years ago, and I was at that Senate estimates and there was no secrecy there. What you are talking about is tabling these agreements; what we are saying is that in the Senate estimates process we have provided information. There is nothing secret there. But the other thing is that, if you look at our proposed amendment, you will see that it deals with a number of aspects that the minister has to provide: how funding under the act has been distributed annually by institution, by state and by sector. That is not secret. That is showing where the money is going. You have been saying, `We want to know where is the money is going.' We have an annual report which shows how it is distributed for that year by institution, by state and by sector. That is the start.
The next step is that any performance information requested, collated and aggregated on a state and sector basis is provided. That performance information goes squarely to the point that you are making, which is that you want to know that this money is achieving what it is setting out to do—the outcomes. That is contained in that performance information, so this is the second part of making that information available. Also, it makes public the reason for any decisions to reduce funding to a provider, which is always a hot issue. If a provider has funding reduced in the normal course of events, there is always some controversy surrounding that. This would require reasons for that decision to be provided in this report.
Senator Carr, that is a fairly transparent process. You can take that, which is in our proposed amendment, and combine it with the Senate estimates process where we have provided copies of these agreements to you. We do that on the basis that you will act responsibly with those agreements. We are saying that the opposition and other parties of course—I see Senator Allison from the Democrats in the chamber here—can have that sort of scrutiny. What we are saying is that the Commonwealth as a rule does not table or publish in a comprehensive form all of its contracts across the board, and that when we provide information to senators we hope they will use it responsibly.
You recall that with the issues of university funding and the financial details surrounding universities we asked that comments be constrained in the public arena because people were saying that various universities were in strife financially. That can unfairly visit upon a university all sorts of problems. People start thinking that that institution is in trouble. It is like saying that a bank is in trouble. You have to be careful with how you use your public scrutiny, and that is all we as a government are saying. We are saying that you just cannot use that information irresponsibly because you can cause all sorts of problems and create a misunderstanding that things are worse for an institution than they otherwise might be. There is that process of scrutiny with the estimates process, and we have provided copies of these agreements in the past. When you combine that with our proposed amendment, you have a system which is transparent and accountable.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-02,"—Minister, I can see that you have been rushed this morning—you obviously have not understood the problem. What you are doing is amending our amendment—these are our proposals in terms of the reports to parliament. It is our amendment. What you are doing with that particular provision is inserting the words `from 2002'—that is all you are doing. You are basically accepting that amendment but imposing a date of 2002, as I understand it.
—We agree with you.
—I am delighted to hear that. In this business it is not often that you get the government to agree with propositions put forward, but it demonstrates again how reasonable I am on these matters. I am pleased to see that the government has seen sense in accepting the opposition's amendment and that provision, although I would be interested to know why 2002 was the date you selected rather than next year. That is my first question. Minister, you should be aware that you are actually talking about the Labor Party's proposition, not the government's. The second question is the issue of the publication of the agreements. As you have said to me, you have given me copies of these agreements in the past, so the question of commercial confidentiality, as far as I am concerned, falls to the ground. You have provided them to me in the past, so clearly commercial-in-confidence does not apply. The issue I go to is why these agreements cannot be seen more widely.
Public scrutiny is the issue here. We are not talking about the financial viability of a university. We are talking about whether or not the university spends the money in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement, and I will be addressing that at the Senate estimates. That is another matter entirely. We are saying that there is a need to make these agreements available. As I understood the discussion before we commenced proceedings today, that proposition was basically accepted. The only issue is at what point, but you have come back in here and said to us that that is now off the table. I trust that is not the position and that I have just misunderstood it. Under those circumstances, we would perhaps be obliged to move our amendments in their original form and have the matter resolved by way of message from the House. That would give us time to talk it through. Frankly, I understood from the discussion this morning that the agreements would be made available. The only issue was the question of time.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-02,"—I can answer the matter about 2002 quite easily because you are dealing with a quadrennium which starts with 2001. If you had a report for 2001, you would not have anything to report because you would be talking about March 2001, the beginning of the quadrennium. So the first report will be March 2002, which will report on the previous year. There is nothing untoward and no magic in that, and I think you accept that, Senator Carr. That is simple mathematics as to how the quadrennium works. In relation to the other matters that you raised, it was my understanding that that was not the agreement, although I was not party to the discussions. I can pursue that further with the officials who are here. I had been advised that the proposal, as I have indicated, was the one that was canvassed, but you are saying no, it was not. You are saying that the proposal included publishing of the agreements. I will seek some advice on that.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-02,"—I wonder whether the minister could clarify a couple of other changes to the ALP amendments. I notice that item (b) of the second ALP amendment asks for `all performance information requested and collected', whereas the government's amendment says `collated'. Could that be explained? I also ask about the significance of including `as reported in the National Report on Schooling in Australia'. Why was that inserted by the government in their amendment?",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-02,"—I am advised that it should be `collected' and not `collated'; that is a typographical error. In relation to the National Report on Schooling in Australia, that is something which is in place in any event and provides a good mechanism which can be relied on, so it was thought that could be usefully employed here. It is in operation. It is nothing more than that. You have a system where you have this National Report on Schooling in Australia, so why not use that as a touchstone, so to speak, for the information that is to be included in item (b)? I do not think there is any problem with that, but if you have any queries, Senator Allison, we can pursue them. ",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-02,"—Perhaps the ALP can enlighten us on whether they think that would limit the scope of the information being requested. I wonder about the purpose of inserting it, whether it is an attempt to exclude other information.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-02,"—Senator Allison, the question you ask is a reasonable one. I would like further clarification from the officers. Our original amendment did not go to the form of the presentation of the report, and it may have been an oversight in our case. I do not know whether we would necessarily get any more information, other than that provided by the National Report on Schooling. My concern about the National Report on Schooling has been the issue of delay. I know it has improved in recent years, but it has often been many years out of date. In the past, that was certainly the case. Given that we have a specified date here—2002—does that mean the report will be issued in 2002, or does it mean reports concerning 2002?",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-11-02,"—I will add to that previous point that I made to Senator Allison. The National Report on Schooling is a useful mechanism which is in place. It is a report from MCEETYA, the ministerial council of education ministers across Australia. There has been some delay in the report, but that has been because it is a report of that council. I think it is important to remember that this is a national report which comes from that ministerial council; it is not something which comes solely from the minister for education's office or from the Commonwealth government. I think that is what gives it its force and integrity, if you like, because it is a report coming from a ministerial council and truly is a national report. It was thought, rather than have a separate mechanism which is costly and an administrative burden, why not use that vehicle which is there, particularly so when it comes from the ministerial council of education ministers? So that is some expansion on that point and it also addresses Senator Carr's point. 
I go back, Senator Carr, to the situation you mentioned vis-a-vis the discussions with the officials in the minister for education's office. I understand it was made clear that your amendments dealing with clause 10 and the insertion of (1A), which provided for making these agreements available for public scrutiny, were not acceptable and that the government would come back to you with a proposal which would deal with how this might be dealt with in an annual report. It was not accepted that that be done and that the government would then come back to you with a counterproposal. There was not any agreement, as it were, of, `Yes, we'll make it available for public scrutiny.'
—I accept that. The word `agreement' is too strong.
—Yes. So we are clear on that, that there was not an agreement in relation to that. We have come back with a counter proposal. Your position, as I understand, is that you want to persist with the first part of your amendment, which provides that the minister must make a copy of that agreement available for public scrutiny prior to the agreement's commencement. We think that is undesirable, particularly so when you look at making an agreement available before its commencement. I think that is another troubling aspect of this. As I have said before, scrutiny is available in the process we are proposing not only through annual reporting but also through Senate estimates committees where we have provided copies of these agreements. Two years ago I think we provided every indigenous education agreement that we had, or a copy thereof, to Senator Carr. I seem to remember that quite clearly. I do not think I can take that too much further on behalf of the government. ",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-02,"—Thank you, Minister. I appreciate your frankness and, given that you cannot go too much further on behalf of the government at this stage, I suggest that we press on with the existing proposals. That will provide some opportunity to discuss the matter when the message returns, and I presume it will return, from the House of Representatives. Otherwise, the government then has a choice of accepting our proposals as they are. I do not know what Senator Allison's view is on that matter but, frankly, I think we could probably spend a lot of time going round in circles.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-02,"—I do not want to further the debate other than to indicate that we are still supportive of the ALP amendments. It has always been our view that the public expenditure of money should mean that the contracts associated with that public expenditure should be made public. That is consistent with Democrat policy and views. It would also appear to me that the government's reluctance on this issue cannot be justified by saying that commercial-in-confidence means that if a university gets into trouble everybody knows about it. A contract rarely, in my experience, goes into that kind of trouble issue. So we would be happy to support the ALP amendments as they stand.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-02,"—We do believe the issues of public accountability in these matters are critical. We are not flat-footed in terms of the precise wording that has been proposed. As we discussed earlier this morning, I am prepared to consider the issue of timing in regard to the publication of agreements. But we do believe that agreements ought to be published at some point through the parliamentary processes. I do not believe that the arguments in regard to commercial-in-confidence are sufficient reason not to publish them in this particular context regarding this program.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-02,"—The Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 provides legislative power for the minister to implement his design for bonded scholarships for medical practitioners in rural and remote areas. Bonded scholarships were originally proposed by Labor at the 1998 election and, as it happened, were opposed by the Howard government at that time. Labor strongly supports the need to get more doctors into rural Australia and believes that there needs to be a comprehensive reform of the current training arrangements to provide short- and long-term solutions to this problem. 
By the May 2000 budget, the government had picked up a version of Labor's proposal and provided $32.4 million over four years to create 100 bonded scholarships of $20,000 per annum linked to new places in university medical schools. These scholarships will be offered each year to students who have missed out on qualifying for normal entry to a university medical course. In return, the student will be bonded to practice in rural areas for a period of six years at the completion of full vocational registration as a GP or a specialist.
Senators need to be aware that it takes at least 11 years to complete a university degree, undertake an internship and then complete paid vocational training as a GP or specialist. In other words, the first fully registered doctors from this scheme will not start working off their bond in a rural position until 2002, and they will not complete this obligation until 2017. These are very long time frame measures, and this fact is the cause of much of the controversy that has erupted since this bill and the associated draft contract were made public. The way the scheme has been designed means that its contribution to medical treatment in this country will occur only in the long term and other strategies are needed to underpin this approach. 
Country people are desperate about the shortage of doctors and the absence of bulk-billing in many places. Increasing the number of doctors is a starting point, but this needs to happen in the short term as well as the long term. Restoration of some balance between the number of doctors and other health professionals in rural Australia and the accessibility of medical infrastructure is one of the major challenges facing rural Australia. The roots of this problem go deep as there are difficult social and professional pressures that push doctors towards the cities as they grow older and gain more seniority and specialised skills. Long-term solutions are needed to tackle these social roots of the problem.
Essentially, this bill provides a legislative mechanism for the Commonwealth to enforce a bond on the scholarship holder. The proposed new section 19ABA provides that, if a medical practitioner breaches the commitment to work in a rural or remote area for six continuous years, the Commonwealth will be able to restrict payment of Medicare benefits in respect of that practitioner's services for up to 12 years. As I have indicated, the ALP's rural health policy at the last election included a bonded scholarship scheme of $20,000 per year for up to 100 medical students. Labor's policy required medical graduates to work in a rural area of need for the same number of years for which they received the scholarship. In 1998 the minister dismissed Labor's proposal as fundamentally flawed and in a press release dated 10 September 1998 claimed:
The Rural Doctor Placement Scholarships are probably unconstitutional due to the limitation in section 51 preventing civil conscription of doctors.
The AMA also embraced bonded scholarships as a means of providing an incentive for young doctors to plan a career in the country. However, since they have seen the conditions of these contracts, they have become quite concerned about issues of fairness and enforcement. I think a number of senators attended a recent breakfast function at which the President of the AMA outlined those concerns. The key features that the AMA are concerned about are that the legislative mechanism for enforcement could be too harsh, people are committed to work in rural areas for too long and there is no provision for review of hardship cases. The Australian Medical Students Association has also expressed grave reservations about the proposed scheme in the belief that `such scholarships will do nothing to aid rural health'. Unfortunately the minister has designed a less effective and less fair scheme than Labor's proposal and along the way lost the support and goodwill of the AMA and the young doctors.
There can be no doubt that the shortage of doctors in rural areas is a major problem in the Australian health system that has been growing for some time as a result of the combined effect of social and economic factors. This was recognised by the previous Labor government, which put in place a number of measures to reverse the leakage from rural areas and these made good progress up to 1996. Unfortunately the Howard government's efforts regarding rural doctors have been unfocused and the targets it has set for itself have not been achieved. On 13 May 1998 in the Norman Cowper Oration the minister said:
We are making important gains. In 1997 the number of doctors in rural areas went up 4%. We are hoping that the figures for 1998 will show a similar or greater increase.
In fact, the increase in effective full-time doctors for the two years up to 1998 was only 0.4 per cent. Over the last four years more than a dozen new programs have been announced without making any great noticeable inroads. A number of these programs have been outright flops, while others have provided some assistance. The 1997 clinical assistantship program was intended to provide additional training places for rural based doctors to do supervised training in rural areas. There was not a single applicant to participate in this program, despite the expenditure of significant funds developing and advertising it. Similarly, the register of medical availability was intended to provide a list of qualified doctors willing to undertake locum work in rural areas. Of the eight people who put their names on the list, it is understood that none were qualified to practise medicine in Australia and most were not Australian residents. This scheme was also quietly axed. 
Some $2.5 million has been spent on projects run by rural undergraduate steering committees at Australia's 10 medical schools to promote interest in rural medical services. These projects have not yet been evaluated and details of how the money has been spent are unavailable. The John Flynn Scholarship Scheme is a holiday program designed to encourage 150 medical students to take two-week placements in rural areas to experience the realities of rural service. Problems have been experienced getting students to take placements in areas of need, with too many applications for some attractive destinations where local doctors have a limited capacity to supervise students during those times. The scheme is yet to be evaluated to determine whether the availability of these placements has any long-term impact on the likelihood of graduates moving to rural Australia. I note that the recent Rural Stocktake comments on the John Flynn scholarships and, at page 100, states:
... as with many of the rural health incentives there has been delayed consideration of the management of the program ... The challenge will be to integrate the scheme as one of the complaints voiced during the Stocktake was that it was not known what some of the scholars were doing with their time and there was a lack of coordination with other student placements.
The list of failed or partially executed programs goes on and on, but there has been little progress in developing real solutions. I sincerely hope that the Wooldridge bonded scholarships are more successful than these previous programs.
The government has repeatedly claimed that it has solved the problem of doctor shortages in rural Australia, but the official statistics prove otherwise. In January 1999, the member for Farrer, whilst Acting Prime Minister, claimed that rural doctor numbers had jumped by 7.2 per cent in two years. The health minister repeated this claim in parliament in December 1999. Questioning by a Senate estimates committee exposed the truth. The Acting Prime Minister and the minister had misled the public by using figures that included any doctor who had made a Medicare claim in a rural area. In fact, there had been only a meagre 0.4 per cent increase in the actual number of equivalent full-time doctors in the bush. Over those two years, the 3,550 full-time equivalent doctors in rural and remote areas had increased by just 13.
The department has since refused to release more up-to-date figures on an equivalent full-time basis, and I know that is something Senator West will be pursuing in estimates again in a few weeks time. It appears that some progress has been made, but it is time that the government released the full figures so that some dispassionate analysis can be done on the impact of recent measures and the sorts of problems that need to be addressed.
Any improvement in the total number of doctors in rural health areas also has to be seen in the context of the large increase in the number of temporary resident doctors coming to Australia for long- or short-term work. The latest figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare indicate that, up to 1998, there was a net inflow in the permanent migration of medical practitioners of 176 per year. Since then, a large number of additional people have been approved under the scheme, which requires five years of service in a rural and remote area. The exact numbers approved under this scheme since early 1999 have not as yet been disclosed, but it is understood to amount to several hundred during the last year across all states. If this is the case, then one can only draw the conclusion that we are actually going backwards in relation to getting Australian trained doctors into rural areas. The small net increase in the number of doctors in rural and remote Australia reflects the sizeable increase in the number of overseas trained doctors who are filling the gaps left by retiring Australian doctors or doctors moving out of the bush. Increasingly, seeing a doctor outside of the cities means you get to see a trainee or an overseas trained doctor. 
Let us turn to the details of the government's proposed scheme. The bill is a very general empowering piece of legislation that permits contractual undertakings to be made by young doctors and for these contracts to be enforced through the nonpayment of medical benefits in the future. A lot of public comment has focused on the implication that young doctors who default will be banned from Medicare for 12 years. The legislation actually provides that, if a person defaults, they will be prohibited from receiving Medicare benefits for the period agreed in the contract if a breach occurs and that the maximum shall be twice the period that the practitioner agreed to work in a rural or remote area. This is a very significant obligation. Anyone signing such a `Wooldridge contract' should take great care to ensure that there are adequate clauses to protect their interests and to provide just terms in the event of that person being unable to fulfil their original intention of working continuously in a remote or rural area for the contracted time.
As the AMA has pointed out, it is important that there be a mechanism for dealing with hardship cases to enable the contract to be varied in circumstances where the person is unable to continue with the plans for reasons beyond their control, such as poor health. The contract suggests that this will be done as a `personal discretion' of the minister. In the opposition's view, this is not the best way to handle such complex matters. This is another significant issue, because the advice from the Parliamentary Library is that legally there will be no ban on accessing Medicare for twice the period in the contract. This ban will come into effect automatically when default occurs, for whatever reason.
I also note that the guidelines require the six years of service in rural areas to be continuous, which might be hard for many students. Most doctors would be at least 27 years old by the time they get vocational registration, and 33 by the time they complete their six years of bonded service. Many women doctors would be thinking of having children around that age. Hence, their work as a doctor might be interrupted, even if they were continuously a rural resident and went back to being a rural doctor when they resumed work. It would seem sensible for the contracts to be amended to allow students to serve out their six years including approved periods of suspension of service where this became necessary for personal reasons, such as parental leave. Senators would be familiar with bonded university scholarships that used to exist in some states for rural teachers, and with the range of problems that would arise from time to time where a person was unable to fulfil their contract as they had intended. We should learn from those experiences and ensure that the new scheme is fair and just to all concerned.
There will be a lot of confusion about these scholarships because they sit side by side with other schemes—most noticeably, the RAMUS scholarship, which gives $10,000 a year without bonds to students from rural areas; and the HECS remission arrangements, which provide for forgiveness of HECS debt for university graduates doing training in rural areas. The relationship between these schemes and the eligibility to participate in more than one at the same time has not been made clear.
As I have indicated, the opposition will be supporting this bill, but we believe that there is a need to establish some minimum requirements about the contracts that the minister envisages will underpin his scholarship scheme. The opposition circulated draft amendments to the bill when it was first debated in the House and has subsequently discussed those amendments with the government and young doctors, resulting in the revised amendments which will be before the Senate today. These touch on several aspects of the scheme, with the intention of making the scheme fairer and ensuring that key information is included in a standard form contract which students can rely on over the years. 
The major provisions will: provide greater flexibility about the areas in which specialists might serve in order to meet the needs of regional towns; provide for an independent person to consider and approve applications for suspension of the contract obligation or variation on hardship grounds; ensure that the participants receive advice about the contract before it is signed; require the contract to be of a standard form and regulation; and ensure that the contract explicitly stipulates the obligations that must be met if the person does not become a medical practitioner, including the amount to be repaid and the interest rate that will apply. 
These amendments are very important. We should listen to the letters that senators have received expressing concern about the pressure that will be placed on young people as they enter university. It is important that people taking up a contract understand fully the implications of the contract they are entering. Let us remember that many of these people will be 17-year-olds entering university for whom the offer of a place in medical school and $20,000 a year will be very attractive. It is important that they are fully aware of the significant commitment they will be making to rural medical service and of the length of time involved in meeting this commitment. The minimum requirement should be that the person entering the contract should be required to obtain independent professional advice about the contract so that they fully understand the obligations they are entering into. This is the kind of protection that is now commonplace in major credit contracts. It seems to me that it would be very wrong not to insert such a measure here.
I will conclude by saying that I hope these bonded scholarships will work to achieve the goal of getting more doctors into rural Australia. The impact will be apparent only in the long term because of the long cycle involved in this scheme. But the bonded scholarships are only a part of it, and there must be a range of supporting policies to ensure the health work force is appropriately distributed around Australia and able to meet Australian citizens' demands. Unless the social and economic barriers are overcome and the attractions of working in rural areas are equal to the attractions of city locations, there will continue to be a geographical imbalance in the distribution of health workers. This is not just a problem that affects doctors; it is just as serious for nurses, pharmacists, dentists and health workers in virtually every field.
Logic would suggest that graduates will continue to look for opportunities to practise in a field which they find challenging and financially rewarding and that, if the rewards and challenges remain concentrated in the main cities, the outcome is likely to bear little difference to the schemes of the past. It would be desirable for the future rules to be clear and remain consistent over a long period of time. This will require a consistent long-term approach going beyond the term of any one government. The opposition are strongly in support of strategies that will get a real increase in rural doctors, and bonded scholarships are a key part of the overall strategy. The opposition will be supporting the passage of the bill and hope that the Senate will support the amendments we are putting forward, which we think will make the scheme fairer and more effective.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (RURAL AND REMOTE AREA MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-11-02,"—When we deal with the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000, we need to begin by remembering that the impact of the rural doctor shortage is quite significant on people living in rural and remote Australia. We need to start with that premise. Indeed, as everyone working in the health area acknowledges and as everyone out in rural and remote Australia acknowledges, we really do have a major problem. It is obviously not just with doctors. It is not just doctors who are in short supply. You can go through a raft of allied health professionals—perhaps we should begin with nurses and list them. There are dentists, mental health workers, physiotherapists and speech therapists, and the list goes on and on.
One of the things the Democrats would like to see shortly on the tail of this bill is some action, either through COAG or in other ways, to get the states involved in a similar scheme for nurses, whether it is simply relieving their HECS debt and encouraging them through that incentive to work in rural and remote areas or whether it is a recruitment program of young men and women from rural schools to support them through nurse training. As we know, it is now done in the tertiary sector. Nurses can no longer train in their local hospitals; they have to travel. Often that means that, if they do get together the resources, they do not return to rural areas. They form partnerships and make friends in the city, and that is where they stay.  
Once we have dealt with this, I would encourage the government to look at creative ways of dealing with what is probably becoming one of the critical issues in health in this country, and that is the shortage of nurses. We are now seeing wards in public hospitals shut, not because of the lack of funding but because of the lack of qualified nurses. Certainly in the aged care sector, nursing home after nursing home says to me that it cannot even get relief nurses out of private nursing pools to fill vacancies. When you have nurses regularly working four, eight and more hours of overtime after their own shifts or before their own shifts, you see pretty quickly that burnout will set in and we will have even fewer nurses.
But I would like to get back specifically to this bill. We see that the health status of people who live in rural and regional Australia is significantly worse than the health status of those of us who live in the cities. They have a shorter life expectancy. Their levels of mortality and illness increase as the distance from metropolitan centres increases. There is no doubt that reduced access to health services plays a part in all of this. Other factors include lower levels of employment—that is, greater unemployment. We know about the link between unemployment and poor health. Also, out in the bush many occupations are highly hazardous. From farm work through to mining, there is a raft of occupations that are inherently more dangerous than sitting behind a desk in an office somewhere in a high-rise in a city. Also, road accidents in rural and remote areas tend to be far more serious than those on city roads. Our indigenous population tends to be concentrated a long way out from major cities and, unfortunately, the health of our indigenous peoples is abysmal and needs far more resources. Rather than just put in more doctors, we really need to look at a complete package of services in rural and remote areas for Aboriginal Australians.
This is basically why we are supporting the bonded scholarship scheme. It is a good start in getting together the health teams that we need in rural and remote Australia. In fact, our call for some sort of scholarship scheme goes back to 1994 under Labor. I acknowledge that, by 1998, Labor were actually calling for it. It is going to be with some interest that we deal with the amendments to this bill, because I think some of the amendments that the Labor Party are moving would actually undo a lot of the good work that is currently in this bill.
I do have to acknowledge here the opposition that is raging, particularly from the AMA. Although they have supported the principle of bonded scholarships, we have to put on record that they do not like the coercive nature of these contracts and that they are concerned about the contracts. But we have to say that bonding is bonding: you undertake a commitment and, if you do not fulfil that commitment, there is bound to be a penalty. I hope that we will see them come to understand that, while it is not going to be absolutely watertight—because so much is reliant on the contracts, which the potential students will freely sign or decide not to sign—inevitably, there has to be a stick as well as a carrot. The carrot is the $20,000 a year scholarship that in many cases helps these students to be able to move to the city to study, but the stick is that they have to pay the money back if they do not then fulfil the requirements in the contract and, also, that they cannot get a Medicare number in areas where we do not want them to work.
Yes, there is a shortage of GPs in a number of city areas, but if we have a shortage of GPs in, say, the western suburbs of Adelaide, we can always go to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital or, at worst, to the Royal Adelaide Hospital at night. If there is a shortage of GPs down in Noarlunga—which there is—you can hop in the car and perhaps travel up as far as Brighton or travel towards the city and you will access a GP in one of the clinics there—for example, the one on Anzac Highway. But you do not have a doctor in some of these regional and rural areas. It can be a trip of 20 minutes minimum—you are probably looking at several hundred kilometres in a lot of areas—before you can access even the most basic medical treatment. So we have to start where the greatest need is, and that is out in rural and remote areas. 
There are many reasons for the shortage of GPs out there, and these include recruitment practices from medical schools. In the past—I am pleased to say it is changing—they concentrated on the top 0.01 per cent of students, the very top students at matriculation. They did not worry about any interviews, they did not look at any post-school qualifications—it was not a second degree as, in many places, it is now—and there was no check to see what sorts of interpersonal skills or commitment to medicine that particular person had. It basically meant that the brightest students in the country struggled to get into medicine. If you went to an inner city private school, if you were able to do the extra weekend work and the extra tutorials and if you had access to all the excursions and all the additional support, the resources, the smaller class sizes and everything else, you could have a much better chance of getting into medicine.
The potential, capability and real desire to do medicine of the brightest of the bright students in rural areas was often all irrelevant. I hope that, through these scholarships, we will see them going to the universities that have the best record as far as rural students are concerned. I note that the minister has given me some detail on this—for example, I have the South Australian details. I think 10 of the extra places are going to Flinders University, which has an excellent record of attracting rural students, whereas only five of the extra places are going to the University of Adelaide, and that does not have a good record. The course at Flinders is now a postgraduate course.
Not surprisingly, many of these students in the past—once qualified—stayed in the cities. They came from the cities, they stayed in the cities and they often headed down the path of the more technical specialties. They were obviously doing a very important and worthwhile job but not out in rural and remote Australia. I hope that we will have some more discussion as the minister briefs us—particularly during the committee stage—on some ongoing commitments from the government that the universities that will continue to get these scholarships and the additional places for those students will be those with the best record in terms of getting rural students in and, also, where the doctors end up. We need to keep track of where these doctors are going and any difficulties we do have as far as people not being completely comfortable with the requirements of these scholarships, and that will obviously take some monitoring.
Another issue as far as shortages of doctors is the actual cost of getting to university for rural students. Even now, with some changes in the assets test, there are still many students for whom it is simply beyond their means to do a full medical degree and, indeed, they are lucky if they can access tertiary education at all. If they do, it is often by correspondence. If you look at some of the other issues the Commonwealth government and the state governments are addressing for attracting doctors out to the bush—in particular, I look at some of the housing programs, where housing for doctors is part of the package—all of this will go together. I do not see these bonded scholarships as out there on their own. There is a raft of different issues that need to be tackled to keep doctors out in the bush.
We need to acknowledge that it is a complex problem, and I want to here acknowledge the success of the John Flynn Scholarship Scheme and the RAMUS scholarships, which are providing students with rural experience and which are encouraging students to then continue working in rural and regional Australia. All of this must be a continuing part of the government's strategy. This is just complementing what is already being done at both state and federal levels. Another very positive aspect of this legislation is that these are additional places. We are not looking at existing places being diverted into the scholarship program. We have, each year, 100 additional doctors. 
I strongly dispute the government's suggestion that we have too many doctors in Australia. I think they need to go back to the drawing board to look at work practices and to look at the fact that we now have in our medical schools a ratio of male students to female students of about fifty-fifty. But it is not just the young women who are choosing not to work the 80 or 100 hours a week; many of the young men are also choosing to spend some time with their families. The government need to think again as to what the total medical work force in this country is and they need to look back through the statistics and realise that many of those showing up are actually working very short periods of time. The government need to realise that we have a large number of doctors who are at or beyond what would reasonably be considered to be retirement age—again, particularly in rural areas—and that these 100 extra doctors will literally disappear overnight into rural Australia. We are shortly going to have to completely review the number of doctors that we have actively working—just the number of doctors coming in from overseas should start ringing alarm bells.
As we look at the compulsion—a word that I know some are having difficulty with—for these doctors to go to rural and regional areas, we need to look at the issue that this is public money. We should not be spending public money where it is not needed. If we have these doctors finding a way, through the contract system, to get back into the cities then we will basically be paying public money—either through Medicare or through public hospital funding—for doctors that are not really needed. It is not unreasonable for the community to object to this and to say that, if we are going to spend this amount of public money, it should be spent where we actually need it to be spent.
Due to population increases and changing work practices, I think that we are also going to have to look carefully at our specialist training programs. Also, as I mentioned on another piece of legislation, while the government is saying that there are no students coming out of medical school still looking for a training place, the message we are getting is that some of the vacancies in training places are going begging because of the extraordinary workload and the absolutely ridiculous hours that trainees are expected to work, particularly in the public hospital system, and the way these programs are structured in some specialties. So I say again to government: as we look at getting specialists out into rural and regional Australia, we need to look at some of the training programs and why it is that people are voting with their feet and simply not doing some of these courses. We are going to be facing shortages not just in regional hospitals but also in city hospitals.
We do have a number of concerns, and I acknowledge that the minister has dealt with some of them. As we move through the committee stages, some commitments will be tabled specifically regarding exceptional circumstances. If a student finishes their course and begins work as a doctor, I think it is only reasonable that if they become temporarily or permanently incapacitated—while they will not ever need to use their Medicare number in the city; that restriction will stay—they should not have to pay back any of the bond money that they would normally have been required to pay back. However, if a doctor comes back for temporary purposes, there is always the ability to negotiate some part-time work, maybe in a public hospital or in some other area, and not have to question the use of a Medicare number. I am sure that, once we get these amendments in place, students will see that the expectations on them are reasonable and that there is a limited opportunity, in genuine extenuating circumstances, to make sure that they are dealt with properly and that the minister's discretion is used wisely. 
We will talk through all of this once we get to the committee stage. In particular, the Democrats are keen to see that those who sign up do so with their eyes open, in the full knowledge of what they are signing up to, and that they get the legal advice they need. Some have even suggested that there may be some insurance policies which they could sign onto in the event of some extraordinary circumstances where they find themselves having to pay back the bond money. So it may be possible to insure against the very odd circumstance where they would not have an opportunity to have the debt waived. We will deal with that further in committee. I will close by saying that we are happy to support this scheme, both because it will get more doctors into rural and remote Australia and because we will get 100 extra places in medical schools. ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (RURAL AND REMOTE AREA MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I too wish to address the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000. In a perfect world, rural and remote areas would not be in the position of needing bonded scholarships. Indeed, doctors would choose to move there based on the fact that it was the best place to live—as it once was, and it certainly was when I grew up in a country area.
Unfortunately, rationalisation has hurt our country areas. It has closed banks, schools, hospitals, hotels, sporting clubs and many other amenities that contribute to the social viability of a fulfilling life. In some ways, a shortage of doctors in rural and remote Australia is a symptom of a far more complex issue related to rural decay. While bonded scholarships are to be commended, they will solve only part of the problem.
As my colleague Mr Sidebottom, the member for Braddon, highlighted in his speech in the other place, the average number of doctors per 100,000 is 260 nationally, compared with Tasmania's 247 per 100,000. As Mr Sidebottom also highlighted—and as I said in an earlier speech—there is an average of one general practitioner for every 1,300 people in the Mersey-Lisle area of Tasmania. I will address that issue later, because I have something more to say on that. This compares with Hobart, our capital, which has one doctor for every 800 people. As shown by James Houlahan in his research for the Centre for Agricultural Health and Safety, given that farming—not banking or being a public servant—has the highest accident and death rate of any occupation, one could think that the ratio of GPs should be higher in the country than in the city, given the need and the lack of major hospitals within close range. 
This problem of access will not be immediately remedied by bonded scholarships, as those doctors will not come online for at least 10 years. Nor will access to specialists be resolved by the scholarships. This is a big issue in my electorate—in fact, through the whole of rural Tasmania. Often people from the north-west and west coast of Tasmania are referred to specialists in the south and the north of the state. This involves a day's travelling and often an overnight stay. Numerous accounts have been given to me of people travelling only to find their appointment has been cancelled, moved to the next day or even moved to the next week. Waiting lists of two years or more for some specialists are not uncommon in rural and remote Australia. 
On the coast where I live, specialists fly in from Melbourne, so if you need a specialist urgently either you are flown to Melbourne or you have to wait until that specialist comes—they usually come once a month. Some of them come once a fortnight. Accounts of waiting lists of two or more years for specialists are not uncommon in rural and remote Australia. This is most often outside the ability of the specialist to resolve, as undue demands or unforeseen complications have impacted on their ability to run to time. I am sure we have all experienced long waiting times when we have had to visit specialists, particularly when they fly in from Melbourne to see a number of people and then fly out again. However, this does not help those who have travelled. If they are on welfare payments, the cost of finding a place to stay is prohibitive. Additionally, if the appointment is put off until the following week, the transport costs can be impossible to meet. This can obviously affect those who are working with the patient, as even hospitals are finding the costs of transporting their patients to a larger health facility is creating an unreasonable impost on their budget, taking away scarce resources that could have gone into much needed other areas of health. One member of the medical profession put it to me like this:
When did hospitals become bus services? We are not funded to supply those health care transport costs to the level that is needed, but our patients need those costs. 
It is a catch-22 situation.
Often, without the specialist's input we cannot proceed any further in our treatment—so it is a need, not a luxury. If we pay for the transport costs, the money has to come from somewhere in our budget, and that means other areas have to go without.
The bonded scholarships will not fix the shortage of nurses. I think I may have heard Senator Lees refer to this. One of the hospitals in my area has the equivalent of eight full-time nursing positions that are proving difficult to fill. Some nurses I know have suggested to me that they will not work in the nursing profession again as the job is not what it was. By that, they mean that their patient contact is limited because there is a shortage of nurses. Fewer nurses means that time with patients is scarce, stress high and personal satisfaction low as many feel that they are unable to achieve the level of care for patients that they feel the patient needs.
Adequate support health care professionals are vital for GPs. Ancillary services supplied by dentists, psychologists, counsellors, podiatrists, speech therapists, et cetera are part of health. Many are in short supply in rural and remote areas. Again, I can refer to the north-west coast where I know there is a shortage of psychologists, and quite often people have to go to Launceston. This is further supported in a media release from the National Rural Health Network, who say:
We are also disappointed that there is still no equivalent support for nursing and allied health students ...
Thus, unless some of the other gaps in health care are remedied, in 10 years time we may well have enough GPs but they will have no support services. This would obviously impact on the likelihood of them staying past the time of their tenure.
As mentioned earlier in my speech, doctors don't just work in the country—they live there too. Thus, having vibrant rural communities is extremely important, as doctors will have families, and their wives or husbands will need jobs and their children will need schools to attend. None of those issues are addressed by bonded scholarships, and one of the biggest deterrents in doctors not choosing rural practices is the view of their partners. The partners of doctors need fulfilling lives and many complain of the difficulty of finding work—even part-time work. Some complain of the narrowness in some elements of rural communities. That is not putting down rural communities. That is simply saying that people who come from universities and city hospitals have not experienced rural life, and quite often find it difficult to find a group with whom they can relate. It is not to say that narrow-minded groups do not exist in urban societies, but rather that they are less likely to intrude into your private lives. This phenomenon would be helped by increasing the range of professionals living in and around rural Tasmania, not only doctors.
We must not fudge the figures, so we should not count part-time doctors as full time. Often one doctor will work across many areas in the country—one day here, one day there. Thus, having five doctors listed on the plaque outside the surgery may not mean that there are five doctors available five days a week, but rather that there may be the equivalent of two or three full-time positions. This is a classic situation where I live. Quite a number of doctors in my area have spoken with me about this issue. They are at an age where they would like to retire but, because of commitments to patients, feel they cannot do so. No-one has come forward to buy into their practices, so those doctors are working part time now but still meeting their obligations. Once the bonded scholarships are in, it would be great for these doctors to be able to retire as they deserve to. As my colleague from Capricornia Ms Liver-more pointed out in her speech, claiming there was an increase of 301 doctors in rural Australia is disingenuous. That figure included locums working for short periods in country areas. When that was factored in, there was an increase of only 13 full-time doctors in rural Australia. Thus there was no increase of seven per cent at all. This cloud does not help rural Australia, in fact it amounts only to about 0.4 per cent increase in full-time doctors. 
We are concerned about some aspects of the bonded scholarships. First, will the students receive independent advice before entering into the agreement? Second, what of those who do not complete their degree? Will they have to pay back some of the benefits received? Unforeseen circumstances will arise, for example illness or family breakdown. Third, will any mechanism be in place to help deal with these situations? Fourth, who will adjudicate—the minister or an independent body? These issues need to be addressed and are obvious problems with the legislation.  
In their submission to the Productivity Commission, the National Rural Health Alliance states:
More broadly, poorer health outcomes also reflect socio-economic disadvantage. Incomes are lower, job and career opportunities fewer, and access is poorer. If there is to be equality in health outcomes between metropolitan and non-metro-politan Australia, then there will have to be equality in lifetime opportunities. In short there will have to be regional development.
This really gets to the nub of the problem. Doctor shortages are in essence a symptom of years of rural neglect throughout rural Australia, coupled with the unintended consequences of rationalisation. If we continue with this narrow application of economies of scale, we will see smaller communities often subsumed by an ideological agenda that separates and segments society into non-interrelated areas. No wonder they are caught on the hop, for if rural Australia teaches us anything it teaches us that everything is connected. Thus, without increasing the vitality of the whole of rural Australia, the bonded scholarships for doctors will merely put some bandaids on the wounds. As good doctors will tell you, without treating the cause the injury will eventually return.
I want to refer to a letter in my local press yesterday from Mr Vic Wilson, District Manager of North West Community and Rural Health, concerning the Queenstown hospital. Apparently, the surgeon at Queens-town, Mr Fraser Young, is to retire at the end of the month, and they are finding it difficult to find a surgeon to replace him. Mr Wilson said:
The department has been working hard to attract a visiting surgeon to Queenstown, to ensure that surgical services are maintained.
This is a classic example of the difficulties the west coast of Tasmania have in attracting surgeons. Hopefully they will be able to resolve that situation, but that has not been made clear. Also, at Rosebery on the west coast there are two GPs, both of whom live in Melbourne. They fly in, service the area during the week and fly home to their families at weekends, which leaves the west coast uncovered for medical purposes during the weekend. The doctors are trying to service the community, but they also have families and the families do not want to live on the west coast. The problem is exacerbated because these two doctors fly in and fly out again. Apparently, one of them occasionally stays over for the weekend. But this situation means that these doctors are on call for 24 hours a day. Doctors serving communities which are dispersed, as is the case on the west coast, do have difficulties. They also sometimes, apparently, dispense medicine. There are enormous problems, particularly on our Tasmanian west coast.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (RURAL AND REMOTE AREA MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-02,"—As we have just heard, the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 is all about providing services to people living in rural and regional Australia. I support what Senator Denman just said, particularly about the state that I represent, the state of Tasmania, and the problems on the west coast. The problems on the west coast of Tasmania are indicative of problems being experienced in other parts of the rural community of Tasmania. Another example I could put forward is the problem that has been experienced by the community of St Marys. This government trumpeted St Marys as being the site of one of the rural transaction centres that it was funding to provide an extension to the services that were available. But, while all that was happening, the community was losing its doctor; and losing its doctor in circumstances resulting in the community being faced with having no doctor in that community. There was a potential for a medical practitioner to be available in a nearby community. But that doctor was under great pressure to service that community—the community of St Helens—as well as the community of St Marys. There clearly is a crisis in the medical services available to people in rural and regional communities of Australia, as exampled by those problems in Tasmania. 
This bill is intended to provide legislative power for the minister to implement his design for bonded scholarships for medical practitioners in remote and rural areas. It has taken some time to come. Bonded scholarships were originally proposed by Labor at the 1998 election, and I might say that initiative was opposed by the Howard government. Labor strongly supports the need to get more doctors into rural Australia. Labor believes that there is a need for comprehensive reform of the current training arrangements to provide short- and long-term solutions to the problem, because there is no doubt that the shortage of doctors in rural areas is a major problem in the Australian health system which has been growing for some time as a result of the combined effect of social and economic factors. Senator Denman just spoke about the amenity of the community that is available and the effect that that has on the willingness of medical practitioners to set up their family arrangements so that they are present in, part of and available to the community. If some of the more remote communities are condemned to a situation where doctors simply operate for the period of, say, normal business hours so that they can leave the area and travel to a place where their family is prepared to live, then that solution will be less than desirable for rural and regional Australia.
Unfortunately, it has to be said that the Howard government's efforts on rural doctors have not been properly focused and that the target it set for itself has not been achieved. I stress that people living in the bush are not only facing problems with the provision of health services; they are also facing problems with diminishing access to a whole range of services, including access to a number of other things which I will come back to later. It has to be said that country people are desperate about the shortage of doctors, and the absence of bulk-billing is, as Senator Evans said, a matter that contributes to the problem. It is a fact that increasing the number of doctors is a point at which the program could commence, but this is a short- and a long-term problem which has to be addressed.
The situation is, of course—as has been outlined earlier in the debate—that doctors and medical practitioners are finding it difficult to justify to their families establishing themselves in rural and regional Australia. That challenge to rural and regional Australia, one would hope, would be addressed by a measure which, as I indicated earlier, is the sort of measure that Labor was proposing. The problem of doctors seeking to move from rural and regional areas into the cities exacerbates as their children reach the age where they are looking for tertiary education, universities or even just a high school or a secondary college—the system that applies in Tasmania—that supplies them with access to subjects which will allow them to progress to tertiary training of the sort they would like to undertake. The problems within a whole range of services in rural and regional Australia impact greatly on the willingness of medical practitioners to remain for long periods in country areas.
That brings us to the question of how this bill is intended to be enforced. As Senator Evans pointed out, there is a fairly draconian provision under the bonded scholarship arrangement which under section 19ABA provides that medical practitioners who breach their commitment to work in rural or remote areas for six continuous years can be restricted in terms of their access to payments of Medicare benefits for a period of up to 12 years. That restriction will impact on their ability to successfully practise in general medicine or, I suspect, in most other areas. Labor had quite a different policy, which tied the period of the scholarship to the period of time which they were required to perform the bonded work. In this case the government is, I think, applying a measure to these doctors which will in fact militate against them taking up the scholarships.
That is the position which I think the AMA has raised. They are quite concerned about issues of fairness and enforcement. They are concerned that it is too harsh. They are concerned that people are being committed to work for too long a period in regional areas. As Senator Evans pointed out, there is no provision in the legislation to review hardship cases, and one can imagine a great many circumstances where a bonded doctor might find circumstances which strongly militate against remaining in the country area for good and what one could imagine might be justifiable and acceptable reasons. The Australian Medical Students Association also expressed those grave concerns, to the extent that they say that the scholarships will not in fact aid rural health, that they will militate against people taking up the scholarships. This scheme is, therefore, less effective and less fair than Labor's proposed scheme and, unfortunately, along the way appears to have lost the goodwill of the young doctors and the AMA. 
Senator Evans pointed out the record of failure of this government in terms of providing health services to rural Australia. The fact that the targeting has not been properly focused was outlined. He did, for example, say that between 1996 and 1998 there was only an effective increase in full-time doctors of 0.4 per cent. Over the last four years more than a dozen new programs have been announced to aid this, without any noticeable inroads. In fact, a number of those programs failed completely. The clinical assistants program of 1997 was a failure. There was actually not a single applicant to participate in the program, and that was despite significant funds being expended on its promotion and development.
The register of medical availability, which was intended to provide lists of doctors available for locum work in rural areas, led to the situation where no qualified practitioners—that is, registered to practise medicine in Australia—put their names on the list. That scheme was also quietly axed. The Rural Undergraduate Steering Committee's medical schools promotion programs have—although $2½ million has been spent—not been evaluated, and there are no details available on how the money has been spent. The John Flynn Scholarship Scheme has yet to be evaluated. No-one is able to say whether there has in fact been any long-term impact on the likelihood of graduates moving to rural Australia, which I guess is why the government is pursuing this measure.
So there have been a great many programs—and I will not enumerate them—which have attempted to provide assistance to rural communities in this area. I go back to the point that you cannot just take this thing in isolation. The Australian government, and other governments, can take measures to address this problem in isolation, but the problem is one—and Senator Denman touched upon this—where a variety of measures need to be put in place to ensure that not only can we provide a system which has an encouragement, an incentive, for medical practitioners to remain in rural and regional Australia but also they find that the communities in which they live have the amenities which justify them keeping their families there and experiencing the very good things that rural and regional Australia has to offer in terms of lifestyle. I think that should also be said.
But one of the issues, for example, that is quite topical in terms of what is important for people in rural and regional communities is access to the world—access to information. One concern is of course public broadcasting. As we have heard quite recently, the problem of public broadcasting and regional Australia has been given sharp focus by the new managing director of the ABC, Mr Jonathan Shier, who told a meeting of Labor members yesterday that in the ABC news and current affairs, for example, is a core business—not the only core business but a still core business. I would have thought the National Party would have agreed with that. They have made a number of pronouncements about the maintenance of news and current affairs, and one hopes that on this occasion they will be effective and actually get something done. They have been a notable failure in most other areas.
—Name one.
—I do not want to take that interjection, because I wanted to deal with other matters in this speech. I do not have time to deal with all of the failures of the National Party, but you do tempt me, Senator McGauran. The National Party and Mr Shier have said that the issue of funding of the ABC is a key one, and they are both correct. Mr Shier told us that there would be a cut in news and current affairs funding of three per cent but was not able to identify the areas where the cuts would be made. He also told us that news and current affairs programs had spent more than their budget by borrowing money from other areas of the corporation over the past two years—presumably so they could maintain the sort of service that is ancillary to the needs of rural and regional communities and provide part of the social amenity that is part of the issue which I say is important in terms of retaining medical practitioners and their families in those communities. Mr Shier said that borrowing had been achieved because news and current affairs know how to work the political issues. 
I suppose that is an issue for Senator McGauran and his party, because Mr Shier has clearly had enough of all this and has put news and current affairs on notice. Their budget has been cut back from $120.1 million, which was the level of funding required to maintain current production levels, to a starting point of $115 million. As I said, from this new starting point he wants to cut another three per cent or $3.7 million. Mr Shier told us that, if his managers come back to him and say that they cannot make the cuts, he will have to buy that argument or find someone who can find the savings. He meant the latter, I take it.
Part of the new structure of the ABC is the establishment of a production resources department. This department houses all the technical staff, such as camera crew, sound people, lighting technicians and editors. It is headed by a Shier appointee, Mr Drew Lean. I understand that a review of staffing levels in that department is currently under way. I further understand that it is the intention of Mr Shier and his appointee Mr Lean to cut staffing numbers in this department by 100 people. This reduction is not to be achieved by way of voluntary redundancies or natural attrition—I am advised that 100 people will be sacked. This will mean the loss of more regional jobs, the loss of skills from regional Australia and more hardship for regional families. The government will stand by and say, `This is nothing to do with us; it is a matter for the ABC board.' The ABC board will say, `This is nothing to do with us; it is a decision for management.' And so the responsibility will be passed down the line, but in the end it will be regional Australia that will have to wear the result. While all this is happening, Mr Lean will be enjoying a three-week holiday in Tuscany.
This is the environment which surrounds the legislation before this chamber. We are going to put in place a mechanism for bonded scholarships for doctors—a mechanism which has lost the support of the AMA and the Young Doctors Association—which seeks to place doctors in rural and regional communities. Hopefully it will not be a failure, because this is something that is needed. The Labor Party have announced they will support this legislation. But around all of that, the government have responsibilities not only to ensure that they provide a mechanism which will encourage doctors to locate themselves in rural and regional Australia but to attempt to do all that they can to ensure that there are the sorts of resources and that there is the sort of amenity which will encourage doctors to remain in those communities.
Short-term fixes are not the solution. They will lead only to the failure of yet another program with good intent—one badly planned, badly delivered and with a bad outcome. We can see with the example I have given of what is happening with the ABC that, if 100 jobs go from news and current affairs, that will impact across Australia and affect a number of communities. It will see the withdrawal of resources and, I suspect, centralise the news gathering ability of the ABC. There is no doubt that the ABC is one of those organisations which provides to rural and regional Australia the sort of information amenity that means they are not left behind.
So, as I say, the Labor Party will be supporting this bill. It is unfortunate that, while all of this is going on, the cuts that I have just mentioned, the 100 people that will be sacked, will do nothing to create the amenity that is so necessary to supplement measures, ill-designed and possibly ill-fated—but I hope not—to provide proper medical services in rural and regional Australia. Hopefully, at the end of the day, when Labor are returned to power at the next election and we fix the problems that have been created with this legislation, as they are revealed, places like St Marys on the West Coast of Tasmania will be able to get the medical services  they need. This would not be on a fly-in, fly-out basis or on the basis of overtaxing the few doctors who wish to remain; it would be on the basis of the provision of medical services on an ongoing basis from medical practitioners who are quite happy to locate their families in rural and regional Australia—which, as I said, provides in many other respects an excellent lifestyle and an excellent place to raise children—and of providing support for a very important part of the Australian community: rural and regional Australia. ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (RURAL AND REMOTE AREA MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I rise to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000. I spoke here not too long ago suggesting that Health Amendment Bill (No. 4) was an insufficient title which did not give you a clue of what it was about. So I commend the title of this bill, which actually does give you a clue to what it is about. It does not of course give you the detail of what is in this legislation, and those are some of the points that I want to address, as my colleagues already have. I also want to pick up on Senator O'Brien's point that it is a very curious business to be taking people out of the country, whilst arranging to send doctors there. I believe Senator O'Brien's point is very powerful. It is not only the people from regional ABC who are affected; it is people from schools, people from banks and people from any number of walks of life in rural Australia. Even some of the stores that provided agricultural products, to say nothing of food and clothing, have closed. So we may indeed, according to the timetable on this legislation, just get our bonded doctors to the country in time to find that everybody else has left. I hope that that is not the case.
There is nothing like a good exaggeration, I suppose, to start a discussion or at least my contribution. But, as we know, there is a very big problem confronting people in politics, people like us, who are listening to the continuing story of complaint coming from rural and regional Australia about the loss of services, about the retreat of all sorts of infrastructure—and, with that, go the people. When the people have gone, the provision of services for the few who are left becomes more expensive and much harder. Certainly one of the major concerns for people living in rural and regional Australia has been health care and the provision of adequate health services of whatever sort. I always think it is wonderful, along with Crocodile Dundee and a few other romantic things about Australia, that we established the Flying Doctor Service. It is one of the great characteristics of this country and perhaps we should make some more movies about that.
We have to recognise the tyranny of distance in this country, and we have to try to see if we cannot get services to people, but in a way that acknowledges the distances and the remoteness. We cannot expect sometimes to have the full service of the health complement in every rural and regional town in Australia. It is really not the same, even in just basic costs, as providing care in our major capital cities. The Flying Doctor Service has got a flavour that is particularly Australian and a character of make-do health care and provisions. I have always enjoyed flying along with the doctors in the aeroplanes; there is often a pilot, but quite often the pilot is the doctor.
—Or nurse.
—I have noticed that, and that is very important, Senator West. We are becoming a very good song and dance team here. I think the message needs to be said again and again. Quite often it is indeed the nurse who flies the plane, helps the doctor, fixes up the patient and maybe stays around longer, but not if she is flying the plane back. It is daft to be looking at health care that is doctors only, without the ancillary staff and, in particular, the good sisters. Senator West has made the point a number of times in this chamber that health care that talks about doctors and does not talk about the support network, particularly nursing care, is fraught; it is creating a way of looking at health care that is not real. Indeed, in rural and remote Australia it is the nurse who is very often the person who is the first point of contact for health care. Often you will find a nurse has stayed around, is living in the area, is providing rural and remote health assistance, and may often be the first point of contact who may then locate, contact or call in the ambulance or flying doctor assistance. 
Let us now turn to what we are doing in this legislation, which is providing bonded scholarships to encourage doctors to go and work in rural and regional Australia. I think it does need to be noted that this proposal that is now being adopted by the government is similar to, but worse than, the one that was proposed by Labor and which was so scathingly dismissed by Minister Wooldridge at the time. Minister Wooldridge dismissed the Labor government's proposal—the rural doctor placements scholarships—as `probably unconstitutional', he said, `due to the limitation of Section 51 preventing “civil conscription” doctors'. It is clear that the minister has had a change of heart and also has modified the Labor Party policy to try to deal with the difficulty of getting more doctors into rural and regional Australia, but the proposal he has come up with is not nearly as good as the Labor one and is not satisfactory. That is why the Labor Party will be moving amendments to try to improve this legislation. It is clear, and any number of Labor Party people have said, that we support the idea of bonded scholarships to assist young doctors to take up training and to work in rural and regional Australia. We have no problem about that. But we have to recognise that a lot of young people who are 16 or 17 and completing high school will be making decisions about a contract of $20,000 a year for a scholarship.
—Often in a private school.
—Indeed, often in a private school, but wherever students will be making this decision, it is a tough call when you are 17 to know what on earth you will be thinking about and doing when you are 27. I do not know how many of you would honestly admit that you know doctors who actually graduated and then decided that practising medicine was not for them. There are a number. I met a few on a football field not too far from the heart of Adelaide a little while ago. They had just finished medicine and said, `No way could I work as a doctor.'
I think it is a terrible tragedy that people would actually spend six years competently studying and then graduate very well only to discover that practising postgraduate is not the sort of thing they want to commit to. I have met more than one young doctor who has made that decision recently, which actually indicates to me that we should be talking to doctors not only about scholarships but about the nature of medical practice when they graduate. We want to try to take into the medical profession and into those many years of dedicated study people who want to practise medicine at the other end, but I always expect and allow that they will make a few mistakes from time to time. I know a lot of people who have gone to university and studied law with the clear intention of never practising it. I think we have to allow that some people will make that decision.
If you are talking about a bond where people will take some 11 years to complete a university degree, undertake the internship and then complete paid vocational training as a GP specialist before they actually get to do the six years minimum to work off their bond, then that is a fairly large decision for people to make, particularly at 16 or 17 years. I do not understand from reading anything about this legislation that people will be able to work for three or four years, take out a scholarship for three years and then work for three years later. I ask the minister to tell me whether that is possible in his comments. I do not understand from anything I have read that you can do that. It looks as though it is go to whoa—six years, all in or none in. I think I am getting the suggestion from the advisers that it is all in or none in. Some people who have had the experience of growing up in the city and then doing a placement as a student in a rural practice may think, `Hey, this would be great,' so they might seriously think when they are in their early 20s of taking up a bonded scholarship for the last three years and then having to work off a bond for three years. If that is not a possibility, I would certainly suggest it might be worth considering at some stage. But there is nothing like talking about what is not in the bill. 
I am particularly concerned about the harshness of the bill, and I want to talk about some of the provisions that the Labor Party wants to address in its amendments. First of all, we will be moving amendments to provide greater flexibility about the areas in which specialists might serve in order to meet the needs of regional towns. We will be moving amendments to provide for an independent person to consider and approve applications for suspension of the contract obligations or variations on hardship grounds. I think it is quite reasonable to expect that there will be some people who, for reasons outside of their control, will not be able to fulfil their obligation for six continuous years. We think it is very important that there should be somebody to actually adjudicate on the conditions of an individual's life and see whether there is a way in which the hardship grounds and variations of that contract can be taken into account. I do believe that having an individual person, council or whatever—but an independent person—to assess that is very important. I have spoken a little about the importance of participants receiving good advice about the contract before it is signed. There are probably one or two people in this chamber who would remember, as I do, being as old as I am, when lots and lots of students went to university and studied to be teachers. They did this on a teachers' bonded scholarship.
—Yes, like I did.
—Yes.
—A few of us remember well. Welcome, colleagues, all of you who can remember as I can. I remember all sorts of students happily went off and did their three years training. I remember all sorts of students who graduated and had to wait for the ballot to see where they were sent. I remember the gross injustice when some teachers finished in beautiful public schools in city areas and other teachers, after having done the same scholarship bond, finished in very rural and remote Australia with minimal assistance and so on. There was an unfairness about that, in the sense that they had the same teaching and the same scholarship but some finished here and some finished there. I guess most of us can remember some—no names, of course—who crossed the border so as to never have to serve out their bond for teaching, because their teaching scholarships were associated with the state.
—Like draft dodgers.
—Senator McGauran, were you remembering one?
—I was just comparing them to draft dodgers.
—Oh, Senator! I think there may be examples, but we will leave the draft dodgers to you, and we will stay with those people who have made decisions at 17 but then found it hard to act on them when they graduate because all sorts of other things have happened in their lives. They may have fallen in love.
—Oh!
—I am glad that upsets you. Doesn't that change your view of the world? Doesn't it mean that your whole prospect of vision is completely different? I hope it does because I think you senators over there sound like a very dull lot if falling in love has not changed your view of the world or what you want to do.
—Are we just going to put it on the taxpayers' bill?
—No, no. The taxpayers are not necessarily going to be defaulted on; I am just suggesting that these are situations that 16- or 17-year-olds may not necessarily have full experience of. They do certainly change one's life, and so does getting married or deciding to join the armed forces and practise your medicine in a slightly different way or with a different group of people in a different area. It is true that some people might decide that the idea of this bond is so appalling that they will slip the country and hope that, in 25 years of living somewhere else, they will be forgotten and the government will not require them to pay back their debt. I think we have to be pretty careful about what kind of information and assistance we give young students if they should sign on to this very serious contract. 
We have to also deal with what happens to not only the students who finish their medicine and decide not to practise but the students who fail and do not complete their medicine. What kind of obligation have they got for repayment? Are there interest terms and so on? The Labor Party will be moving amendments concerning that, and they are all important additions to this legislation because they go to dealing with some of the difficulties that the Labor Party has with it. It is stern stuff, and I think we need to make sure that the people who sign on to these scholarships are given fair assistance in signing on to the contract and fair assistance in coping with it if they have to, for whatever reason, come off it.
We know about the shortage of doctors in rural and regional Australia. One thing that was told to me very recently which I thought was pretty disturbing was that there is an absence in rural Australia of doctors who bulk-bill. That is very important for the people of Australia, people who depend on those doctors. I have heard my Liberal-Country Party colleagues pouring on me all sorts of encouragement, to say nothing of abuse, about how they offer choice. But they are not seeing that the choice of bulk-billing is provided to consumers in rural and regional Australia. The story that most disturbs me is of a regional town in an unnamed state where a number of doctors in the town ganged up on the one doctor who was bulk-billing and made it absolute hell for that doctor.
—Common occurrence. 
—Senator West adds that it is a common occurrence. I would have thought that this ought to be shocking the government and they should be looking at ways to address it. Some of the rural doctors and the rural doctor organisations do a lot of good things—and I know them and have had the benefit of their telling me my attitude is wrong on a lot of things in inquiries that I have chaired and attended in the past. But, as well as trying to encourage doctors out there, we should be encouraging practice in the country amongst doctors that does provide choice. If there were ever any evidence—if I had evidence, or if any patients or consumers or people in the country had evidence—that says that Dr Bloggs wants to bulk-bill but he is being dropped on from a great height by his colleagues who are talking him down, who are encouraging patients to know that he is not a competent doctor by saying, `You would not go to him. He is bulk-billing. He is not as good as the rest of us,' I would find that appalling. I would find that really shocking. If we are going to get bonded doctors into rural and regional Australia, then I believe we have to allow those doctors to make choices about how they ask patients to pay. I believe we should be putting that seriously, if not hard, into the contract, at least within the ambit claim of the contract. 
What is the point of sending doctors out there if they are going to be charging like wounded bulls and denying the patients the right of the option of bulk-billing? Bulk-billing has been a core part of the Medicare arrangement in this country and a core reason why so many people now know that they do not have to fret about going to the doctor, unlike before we came to office in 1983 when some two million Australians had no protection against the cost of their medical bills and thousands of women left their children to be sick rather than worry about whether or not they could pay the bill to the doctor. Those fears went with Medicare, and the community has been assisted by the option, agreed by the doctors before the introduction of Medicare, of bulk-billing. That option should extend to rural and regional Australia. I know we walk on glass saying, `You cannot tell doctors what to do.' Yet here we are saying, `If you sign this contract, Doc, for $20,000 a year, then for six years you will serve in rural and regional Australia, and if you do not we have a fantastic penalty for you: we will take two times each year that you did not serve and deny you the full medical benefits.' That is tough and that is telling doctors a fair amount. 
You say, `We are not really telling them. They are going to have to sign on to all of this.' Yes, they are. But if you are determining conditions fairly stringently, as you are in these contracts, I would like to challenge you to take up the option of choice for people in rural Australia to have bulk-billing. I was astounded to hear how vicious and vehement the campaign was against the doctor who dared introduce bulk-billing and how that doctor has been significantly paid out. If we are going to ask these doctors to go into rural and regional Australia to work out their bonded scholarships, can they bulk-bill? Or, in the year 2012 when you finally get them there on their bonded scholarships, will they be allowed to bulk-bill or does this contract arrangement say, `No bulk-billing'? I know it does not say that, at least not that I can read. I would like to know, Minister. I would like you to give me an assurance that these doctors, when and if they finally get there, will be allowed to bulk-bill without any harassment or subtle nasty pressure from their colleagues. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (RURAL AND REMOTE AREA MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I again advise that I have some interest in the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000: I am a member of two colleges of nursing in this country and a member of the Health and Research Employees Association. Many resident doctors are also members of that union. This government are again attempting to fix the problem of the maldistribution of doctors in this country leading to shortages in rural areas and oversupplies in the city areas. They have actually pinched part of the Labor Party's policy, and for that I say we must have been on the right track, even though Minister Wooldridge certainly laid into us, saying that we could not possibly do this, that it was wrong and everything else prior to the last election. Anyway, we do not mind him taking the good parts of our policy, but we need to look at how he is going to implement it and we need to look at a number of issues that relate to this. I again have concerns with this government, and I repeat what I said the other night: this government seems to be of a mindset that health care equals doctors and acute hospital beds. You cannot deliver a health service of any quality and standard with just doctors. They are not able professionally to provide the full range of care that is needed for people, be it in a hospital or be it in a community. Nor are they able to make nursing diagnoses and outline nursing practice or make physiotherapy diagnoses and physiotherapy practice or occupational therapy diagnoses and occupational therapy practice or be dieticians—the whole gamut. 
The government are moving more and more down the line of saying that doctors are the be-all and end-all—that is where supreme power will reign—who will tell all other health professionals what they should and should not be doing. Before the government go much further with the negotiations that I know are continuing, I urge them to think again. The other health professionals will not tolerate or cop it—and nor will the people when they understand that doctors and the other health professionals have their specialty areas in which they have trained. I repeat: a health service is not just about doctors and acute hospital beds. If we are to run a good health service, we must have a multidisciplinary team comprising doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, rehabilitation counsellors, psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses and social workers. They are only part of the team that we need to run a good health service. Each profession complements and cooperates with the other and should consult with the other. No one profession has knowledge of health issues that is superior to any of the others: health professionals have expertise in differing areas in the provision of health care.
Yet this government seem able only to look at doctors in rural areas. They are incapable of considering the health delivery and work force needs of the other health professions in rural areas. I refer senators to a press release issued by the New South Wales College of Nursing and Professor Judy Lumby, the executive director of the college, following the last budget. The release is entitled `Rural health not just about doctors', and it states:
The NSW College of Nursing has expressed its bitter disappointment in the narrow focus of rural health funding in the Commonwealth Government's Budget for 2000-2001.  
“Once again we are being told that rural health means rural doctors,” said Professor Judy Lumby, executive director of the College. “The Budget papers talk about measures `designed to provide more doctors and better health services' but what they really mean is better doctor services.” 
“There is a real shortage of nurses—not just a distribution problem which is the cause of the shortage of rural doctors—and yet there is not one measure aimed at promoting the recruitment and retention of the nursing workforce in rural areas.” 
The NSW Ministerial Advisory Committee on the Health Services in Smaller Towns (the Sinclair Report) recognised the very real problems rural health services had in attracting nursing and allied health staff (which, despite the Budget attempts to combine them, are actually two separate professional groups). It noted “that without an adequate nursing workforce it will be impossible to maintain current rural hospitals”. 
“Measures such as the HECS exemptions and scholarships currently only being offered to medical students would go a long way to enticing not only young people into nursing but encouraging those who have left the workforce to retrain,” said Professor Lumby. 
“This is not just an issue of money—although the cost of education is just as much a disincentive for nurses to train as it is for doctors.” 
“What really hurts is the message from the Commonwealth Government—once again—that nurses are not valued. This is one more piece of evidence that the Government doesn't take into account (or perhaps is just not aware of) the central role played by nurses in health care. 
“It is especially sad that this blatant disregard for the contribution nurses make to health in Australia comes just before International Nurses Day (Friday 12 May). 
“The theme for this year—Nurses: always there for you—may not be true for much longer.”
The Royal College of Nursing Australia made similar comments as did the nurses association, the ANF. It bewilders, concerns and alarms me that the Commonwealth government does not see that it has a major and significant role to play in addressing the work force shortages of nursing and the allied health professions. When I ask in estimates committees about the Commonwealth's role and what it intends to do in this regard, I am told continually, `We only worry about doctors; the states look after the rest.' That is denying the Commonwealth's responsibility for the provision of total and adequate primary, secondary and tertiary health care for the people of this country.
The Commonwealth does have a role in this area. It provides funding to the higher education institutions for initial training and collects the HECS debts that people owe. Yet it is not prepared to look at what happens after that. Once people graduate, the Commonwealth says, `Go away, I don't want to know; I am not interested in you: I am just interested in the doctors.' As I have said before, the problem with the medical health work force is that there is a maldistribution. The problem with all the other health professionals is that there is not enough of them. There is a shortage of nurses not just in Australia but world wide. This government must look at some way of addressing the nursing shortage in this country, and perhaps devise a plan or program that will solve the worldwide problem.
Yet we see this government encouraging organisations and health areas to move away from using nurses. Let us take the government's moves in the age care sector. The Howard-Anderson government is providing incentives for age care facilities not to bother employing registered, or even enrolled, nurses. This government is actively pursuing downgrading the level of care that is provided to people who need nursing and health care as part of their broad health needs. We heard some of the earlier speakers in this debate talk about the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The RFDS provides a great service: it is written up in history and there are myths and legends about it. However, I suggest that senators read some works by the historian Idriess. I refer to Betty Mitchell's 48th annual oration to the New South Wales College of Nursing, in which she said:
Idriess, a historian of the Australian outback tells us:
In 1924, a nursing service was started, unique in the history of the world—`The Border Sisters'. These nurses operated alone, each for a period of two years, within a district that embraced seven thousand five hundred square miles.
She goes on to say:
McPheat, another historian, further attests to the difficulties faced by the early remote nurses: 
after clockwork city hospitals the Sisters must learn to travel through floods and dust-storms; to camp for nights in the bush on diets of dry bread and dry beef; to ride a horse and perhaps swim rivers clinging to its tail; to improvise splints from a nearby tree. These nurses shouldered responsibilities normally placed only on doctors and made decisions that caused their hearts to stand still.
If you talk to those nurses who are providing care in the remote and rural areas of Australia, including New South Wales, you will find that they are still providing care and making decisions that cause their hearts to stand still—because there are no doctors there. But we have to ensure that the skills of those nurses who are providing that care are recognised and rewarded and also that they are protected from litigation. 
Mrs Betty Mitchell also goes on to talk about the role of nurses when the RFDS makes a trip. She says that nurses working in environments where they are 200 kilometres from their destination often have to drive on dirt roads, and after good rains or any rain this can be quite a challenge. She states:
Nurses working in these environments must have a diverse range of abilities and knowledge. How many metropolitan nurses in one day routinely attend personal care, manage clinics, give immunisations, administer medications, take x-rays, suture wounds, apply clinical judgements, use the UHF radio to give information or get advice from the RFDS or GP, visit people in their homes, take the ambulance out (usually with the handyman as a driver) to attend accidents, heart attacks or snake bites, then practice meteorology and relay wind and weather conditions to the RFDS pilot, all while clearing kangaroos and wild pigs from the runway?
They do all this while keeping their patient's condition stable.
This is the sort of situation they are facing and the sort of work that they are doing. If we do not do something about addressing not just the issue of the maldistribution of doctors in rural Australia but the issue of the shortage of nurses in Australia across the entire board—in every place, from the major teaching hospitals to these remote areas—then we will not have anybody there to be able to give the meteorological reports to the RFDS pilot whilst actually clearing the runway of kangaroos and pigs and stabilising their patient or maintaining the stability of their patient's condition. That is the reality of this world—and that is the reality that this government has to face.
This government has introduced a number of other scholarships and schemes also: the RAMUS scholarships of $10,000 a year and some HECS remission and exemptions. I see and hear nothing about how those scholarships and existing or future exemptions will work in relation to these bonded scholarships. They are one of the issues that this government has to address.
I go back to the issue of the minister saying that he would get the figures for us eventually—and, if he cannot give us those figures today, I will follow it up at estimates. In January 1999 the member for Farrer, then acting as the Prime Minister, claimed that rural doctor numbers had jumped by 7.2 per cent in two years. The health minister repeated this claim in parliament in December of last year. But questioning at estimates revealed to me that a meagre 0.4 per cent increase in the actual number of equivalent full-time doctors had taken place. The 3,550 full-time equivalent doctors in rural and remote areas had increased by just 13 over these two years.
What this government is doing is playing fast and loose with figures. It runs around saying that the number of doctors has jumped by 7.2 per cent. But it fails to tell us what number of doctors are working whatever is considered to be the equivalent hours of a full-time doctor. There has been feminisation of the work force, and female doctors are often choosing to work part time. So, sure, we are seeing more doctors coming into the area, but we are seeing them electing to work part time.
This, of course, raises some concerns about those doctors who take this bonded scholarship up. They take it up at 17 years of age. They have between six to eight years of university, depending on which university they go to. If they go, say, to Sydney University, they do a three- or four-year degree, often in an allied health profession. They have to get sufficient grades there to get their degree, their standard qualification. Then they go on and do medicine. So that is an eight-year course they have to complete just at university.  
They then have to do their internship before they even look at doing postgraduate further experience and training. So these people are in their late 20s when they start to look properly at what they will be doing and where they will be working. It might well be that they get their vocational registration in 10 years, at the age of 27 or 28, and then have to do six years on top of that. Many women, by 27, 33 or 34 in particular, are wanting to have children or have already started a family. There does not appear to be anything in this legislation that will enable female doctors—or maybe even male doctors—to work and spend some time being a parent to their children; there is nothing that answers those needs. This legislation talks of `continuing service', and I think this government has a number of questions to answer in relation to this.
I keep repeating and turning back to the fact that this government seems to be concerned just about doctor numbers in the bush, the gross numbers, and has not provided us with the very minute details that we need. It will not tell us the number of full-time equivalents that are out there in the various categories. I warn the minister that, if he cannot give me the answer today, the department should be very ready for this answer to be given at estimates. So you have three weeks maximum to give me the figures. I will be performing and getting very upset and very annoyed if you do not.
Senator Crowley mentioned bulk-billing and I have to mention it also. I am seeing a decrease in the amount of bulk-billing in rural areas. I am getting complaints from pensioners down in the MIA, in the Riverina, around the Goulburn area and down at the South Coast of this state. We have doctors deciding not to even bulk-bill pensioners. There are some radiological practices that will not even bulk-bill their pensioners for some of their scans and ultrasounds. We are talking big money here. We are talking three-figure sums—$150, $200 or maybe even more. For people on fixed incomes, that is almost an impossibility. Bulk-billing is there to enable these patients to have tests and services provided to them on their health needs, not on somebody's hip pocket desires. I will leave that point there.
I want to finish by saying that health care and the delivery of a good health system are about having a multidisciplinary team to provide the health services needed. You cannot run a health system with doctors alone. You cannot run a health system with nurses alone. Mind you, I think there was a time in Israel a few years ago when the doctors went on strike and the mortality figures actually dropped. Ponder that one. It is very important that we remember that health care is best delivered by a multidisciplinary health team. I speak here about multidisciplinary health care teams as somebody who has worked in a multidisciplinary community health team, and I know the respect for and the value and abilities of all of the other health professionals that I worked with. That was the way that we were able to deliver a good health service, and that is what this government has to look at doing—providing ways that we can have adequately trained health professionals from all of the health professions providing equal service and getting equal support to be trained, not just one group getting more support than the others. That is not fair, and it is not the way to go about addressing medical work force needs.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (RURAL AND REMOTE AREA MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I rise to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000. At the outset might I compliment my colleague Senator West on her remarks. I listened very intently. She has touched upon a range of concerns with respect to the delivery of health services for people in rural and remote areas. I wish to come back to that a little bit later in my remarks. This legislation has a noble objective, and that is the objective of increasing the supply of medical practitioners, doctors, in rural areas. It has a noble objective. Indeed, the idea has a noble background. This proposal, which the government is now going to implement, follows a policy that was put forward by the Australian Labor Party at the last election. At that time, when we dared to suggest that you could look at bonded scholarships as a means of attracting medical practitioners to work in rural areas, the minister abused us. He said that it would not work, that it was a stupid idea and that he and his government were not going to adopt it. 
All good policies that come out of the Labor Party—and there are many of them—are eventually adopted or supported by the coalition parties. We have seen that historically with Medicare itself. It had its beginnings as Medibank, the universal health cover scheme introduced by the Labor government in the 1970s. Despite all of the attempts by successive Liberal-National Party governments to dismantle it, abolish it and destroy it, it is and remains the integral part of our health system in this country—one which clearly enables us to hold ourselves up as delivering one of the best health systems in the world.
Of course, there are continuing problems, largely due to the lack of funds made available to the states, particularly by this government, in order for them to fully deliver the services that are needed. In rural areas, where issues such as tyranny of distance are everyday problems to confront, this is even more difficult. I do not wish to spend much time on the specific details of the legislation, because it has been well canvassed by previous speakers. As Senator Evans pointed out in his speech in the second reading debate, the opposition support the legislation. We support it because, as I said, it derives from Labor Party policy. It is a system which we believe should be brought into place and which, hopefully, will result in an increase in the number of medical practitioners in rural areas. But we have also made it clear that, whilst we support the legislation, we will be moving amendments to deal with a number of the problems that have been identified by the Labor Party and indeed by other groups, including the AMA.
Those problems have been well documented. They go to issues such as the fact that, whilst this scheme will now be brought in, it could be 11 or 12 years before it has any real impact—because of the time it takes for medical students to undertake and complete their education, their training, their residential qualifications and so on. We hope this policy will have results, but they will be some time down the track, and the immediate problems of the shortages of GPs and medical specialists in rural areas will remain for some time. Problems have also been identified with respect to the draconian penalties that would apply under this legislation for persons who, for one reason or another, do not complete the period of work required under the bonded arrangements. That needs to be addressed, particularly to take account of issues such as hardship and so on.
There is no doubt that, if you were looking for the single minister who has most comprehensively failed in his or her task of managing a portfolio—and there are plenty of candidates in this government—it would be the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge. This minister has been roundly condemned by every single state and territory government in this country for his management of the health portfolio. We all recall the tortuous road that the states and territories had to travel to try and finalise a Medicare agreement. Each one of those state premiers and ministers for health—Liberal, Labor and National Party—condemned this minister and this government for the shortage of funds that the government was proposing in respect of that Medicare agreement. It even got to the stage where the premiers all walked out of a Premiers Conference over the issue of Medicare funding. It is unfortunate that the legacy of this current minister will remain for some time as the states try and repair the damage that has been caused by his mismanagement and, particularly, by the severe cuts to the states in the areas of funding for public hospitals, the inequities that have been produced through the private health insurance rebate scheme and so on.
I want to contrast that with the position of the New South Wales government and the great strides that they have made—notwithstanding those funding cuts and the general cuts in funds to the states that they had to suffer after this government came to office in 1996—in improving health services, particularly in rural areas. Senator West mentioned earlier the fact that the New South Wales government have established the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Healthcare in Smaller Towns. That was a tremendous initiative and, to show the genuineness of the proposal—which was implemented by Minister Craig Knowles in New South Wales—Minister Knowles appointed as the chair the very respected former minister and former Speaker of the House of Representatives Ian Sinclair. Ian Sinclair is a former National Party minister—indeed, I think he is a former Country Party minister, as well—of this parliament. 
Ian Sinclair was not a Labor Party member—he was our political opponent—yet he has a long history of representing a rural electorate in this parliament as well as having ministerial portfolios in that regard. That was in the days when the then Country Party came into this parliament and represented the interests of people in rural areas. Sadly, that is not the case today. The National Party have no say and no influence and, consequently, the issues particularly affecting rural people—and health is a major one—go unheeded by this government.
The New South Wales government has implemented its Action Plan For Health which, over the next three years, will inject a further $2 billion into the health system of New South Wales. Communities in rural New South Wales, particularly, will be receiving an additional $317 million in annual recurrent funding for rural health. That is an increase of 15 per cent from the current amount. The New South Wales government has also sought to address some of the issues that this legislation is directed at—that is, trying to improve the position with respect to GP or medical practitioner services in rural areas. It has streamlined the assessment process for overseas trained doctors to be able to take up positions in rural areas. It funds areas such as the Rural Doctors Network, the rural health training units, the Rural Medical Officer Cadetship Program and the Rural Registrar Training Program. In the last two years, for instance, the NSW government awarded over 147 allied health grants to students undertaking rural clinical placements. So there is a range of issues and time does not permit me to go into the detail of all of those. I will just conclude, to allow the parliamentary secretary to wind up the second reading debate.
Senator West also pointed out that if you are going to deliver an appropriate health service, you have to look at the whole picture. She quite correctly drew attention to issues which relate to, for instance, the shortage of experienced nurses. The New South Wales government has tackled that problem by providing rural and remote undergraduate scholarships specifically to support rural nursing students. As I said, we are prepared to support this legislation because it is based upon a good objective—increasing the supply of medical practitioners in New South Wales. It is one of the few things, if not the only thing, that this government has done in the area of health that has been of any value to rural areas, let alone to any other parts of Australia. It is an initiative originally proposed by the Labor Party and rejected by this government, and it is good to see them getting on board for once and adopting our policies to deal with these important issues.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (RURAL AND REMOTE AREA MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-11-02,"—I am very pleased to hear of the opposition and Democrats support for this bill. The bill, the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000, relates to the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme. There is a real need to get more doctors into rural Australia. The scholarships available under the MRBS Scheme will provide $20,000 a year to medical students in exchange for an undertaking to work in rural and remote areas. After six years in a rural area, these doctors will have gained a greater understanding of rural medi-cine and its rewards and challenges, and this will provide a solid basis for a future career direction.
This legislation underpins the MRBS Scheme and ensures that it is sustainable. The legislation protects the medical students as well as the Commonwealth by ensuring that all parties are well informed about the extent of their obligations and by making sure that the rules cannot be changed. Legislation is necessary to make sure that the promise to deliver 100 extra doctors per year to rural Australia is not compromised. The bill provides that Medicare benefits are not payable for professional services rendered by or on behalf of a doctor who is in breach of a contract with the Commonwealth to work in a rural or remote area. The bill states that Medicare benefits will not be payable for twice the period that the doctor has contracted to work in a rural or remote area. The period of this ban may be shorter, according to the details of the contract. This ban is necessary to prevent doctors who breach from adding to the oversupply of medical practitioners in urban areas, at least until they have fulfilled their contract with the Commonwealth to practise in a rural area.  
The scheme is designed to be as flexible as possible without compromising the objective of delivering 100 extra doctors. The legislation must therefore be broad, so as to allow for flexibility for both the scholars and the Commonwealth. This is a very long-term scheme and will be in place for decades. The flexibility will allow the scheme to be improved as may be recommended by future reviews. The scheme will complement other schemes and scholarships which are designed to ameliorate the shortage of doctors and health professionals in rural areas, in the short and medium term as well as in the long term. 
Should a scholar find that they cannot, or are unable to, work in a rural area, their career is not at an end. They will have to repay the Commonwealth, and their access to Medicare will be banned, but they will still be registered medical practitioners if they complete their training. The ban provision is to ensure that scholars who have promised to serve six years in the country do not go into private practice in the city where there are already some areas of oversupply. This is important. Scholars who breach will still be able to work as doctors, but they will not be a burden to Medicare. They can pursue several other career options; for example, in public hospitals, Aboriginal medical services, community health centres, public health units, STD clinics, educational or research institutions, local or state government bodies, private companies or journalism. There are many careers in medicine which do not require billing of Medicare in major metropolitan areas.
The obligation to work in a rural area is simply the value of the scholarship. There is no penalty for scholars who fulfil their commitment—that is, that they do what they are contracted to do when accepting a place in a medical school that would otherwise not have been offered. There have been concerns about the ability of these students to commit to a long-term career path because of their age. These students are not immature. The average age for first-year undergraduate medical students in 1999 was 21½ years, and for graduate first-year medical students it was 32½ years. I think that Senator Crowley's comments about looking at issues of alternate lifestyle, which were so romantic, have their roots more in ALP philosophy than in common medical sense.
Students who enter into these contracts will be required to seek independent legal advice before committing to the serious obligation to serve as a doctor in a rural area. The Commonwealth is distributing comprehensive information packs to universities and students to ensure that they are all fully informed. For the very few applicants who are younger than average, they will not be required to sign a contract until they are 18 years of age. The scheme is flexible and the contract allows scholars to take up to 16 years to complete their training to fellowship level before being required to commence their service. Generally speaking, a scholar would complete training from undergraduate level entry in 11 to 14 years and from graduate level in even less time—approximately nine to 12 years. This provision allows scholars a number of years in which to travel, to take a break, to have a family, or to pursue other study interests prior to commencing service in a rural area. 
Also included in the contract is the provision for scholars of either sex to break or defer rural service for up to 12 months in order to look after a newborn or newly-adopted child. This scheme gives scholars the freedom to practise wherever they choose in rural or remote areas for six years and to change location within that time. Scholars will be able to choose from 90 per cent of the Australian landmass, including places such as Katherine in the Northern Territory, Albany in Western Australia, Coffs Harbour and Bathurst in New South Wales, Devonport in Tasmania, Port Augusta in South Australia, or Mildura in Victoria. In addition to these ample examples, the contract provides for ministerial discretion should a scholar seek to defer the period of their service. The contracts will state that the minister can allow deferrals of the bonded services or, in the event of a breach of the contract, reduce the subsequent repayment obligations or period of Medicare ban. This discretion is intentionally broad because it is not possible to foresee all of the circumstances in which a scholar would seek to apply for discretion. 
The issue of an independent tribunal has been raised. It is entirely appropriate that the minister hold this discretion and not a third party. The minister, as the elected representative of the people, is in a good position to balance fairness to individual scholars against the benefit for rural communities of receiving medical services. It is important to note that the ministerial discretion can operate in only one direction—the minister can only defer or reduce obligations on the scholar. I have specifically noted the comments of both Senator West and Senator Forshaw in this matter. Very obviously, Senator Forshaw needs some history lessons on the achievements in office of the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge—or perhaps he needs treatment for the early signs of Alzheimer's disease. What needs to be put on the record very carefully is that Dr Wooldridge has supervised and overseen a period of increased funding and innovation in areas right across the health portfolio. His four years in office compare very favourably with that of the 13 years under Labor. 
Senator West raises a number of relevant and very proper issues with regard to health care. I hope she has also engaged the health minister from New South Wales, Mr Craig Knowles, in these areas—specifically with regard to nursing training. Has she also consulted and discussed with the AMA on the issues of bulk-billing? Senator West asked about other schemes that the government has put in place to deliver doctors to the bush, to ensure ongoing support for these medical practitioners once they are in the bush and to provide other health services to rural areas, including allied health and nursing. The MRB Scholarship Scheme is a long-term initiative to deliver more doctors to rural communities. It fits within an integrated range of initiatives covering the short, the medium and the long term, and provides support and incentives to deliver more doctors to the country. These include short-term initiatives to get doctors into the bush immediately, initiatives to support doctors who are already out there and long-term education initiatives which target doctors at the beginning of their careers. One immediate strategy to get more doctors to the bush is the Overseas Trained Doctor Scheme. The Commonwealth works with the states and territories to facilitate recruitment of overseas trained doctors to rural communities for urgent, short-term vacancies under the newly established state OTD Scheme for placements of five years or more. However, these are not ideal and are dependent on a continuing supply of overseas trained doctors wishing to come to Australia. The ideal is to get Australian trained graduates into rural areas.
Initiatives which will support doctors who are already in the bush include the Rural Locum Relief Program and the Rural Retention Program, which aims to recognise and retain long-serving general practitioners in rural and remote communities with high relative need for retention support. Also, in answer to a number of the other issues raised by Senator West, let me comment on the support to improve allied health services. Under the regional health strategy there will be more allied health professionals to work with local doctors in meeting community needs, and this can and does include nurses. There will be additional support to attract and retain pharmacists in rural areas, which will, in turn, build the professional links which are necessary to sustain rural practice. There will be a lifeline for small non-government country hospitals at risk of closure and an increase in the Regional Health Services Program by more than 50 per cent, which will give another 85 communities services they would otherwise not have had. There will also be a framework of service for rural doctors to have access to a broader range of experience and allied health support. 
Long- and medium-term educational initiatives which provide a stronger focus on rural health care in medical education are: the Rural Australian Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme, the new General Practice Registrars Program, the Rural Undergraduate Steering Committee Program, the John Flynn Scholarship Scheme, Medical Student Vacation Scholarships and nine new regional clinical schools and three additional university departments of rural health at a cost of $117 million over four years. These initiatives are mutually reinforcing and will increase the accessibility and the viability of medical and health services in rural Australia in both the short and the long term. This legislation is necessary for rural Australia. It has the support of the universities and of more than 1,700 students who have contacted the department and the minister to register their interest to date. It will provide 100 extra doctors per year to areas of need in rural and remote Australia and it will do this through a sustainable and flexible scheme. I thank all senators for their contributions to this debate. I accept the issues and areas of important health priority that they have identified. The Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 is a bill for rural Australia.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-02,"—This bill, the Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Bill 2000, amends the Patents Act 1990 to repeal the petty patent system, implement the innovation patent system and make other minor amendments. The Patents Act currently provides two forms of patent protection: the standard patent and the petty patent. The petty patent was introduced in 1979 with the intention that it would provide protection for innovations typically developed by Australian small and medium business enterprises. It was intended to provide relatively inexpensive patent protection for inventions with a short commercial life. Although the petty patent system was directed at lower level inventions, it required the same inventive threshold as that required for a standard patent.
In 1995, the Advisory Council on Industrial Property published their report Review of the petty patent system and concluded that the petty patent system was not achieving its objectives. They recommended the replacement of the petty patent system with the innovation patent system. The innovation patent system would require a lower inventive threshold than the standard or petty patent, so it would provide protection for lower level inventions. It would have a shorter life of eight years compared with the 20 years of a standard patent. Based on overseas experience with similar systems, the Advisory Council on Industrial Property concluded that the innovation patent system would be better suited to the needs of small and medium business enterprises than the petty patent system. I understand that the government accepted most of ACIP's recommendations in agreeing to establish an innovation patent system to protect incremental inventions that may not be inventive enough to warrant standard patent protection and are not covered by design legislation. I understand that innovation patents through this legislation will not be available for plants or animals, biological processes or the generation of plants and animals. 
An innovation patent will be granted after a formalities check and will provide the patent owner with a right that is quick and cheap to obtain, is relatively simple and that will last for a sufficient time to encourage investment in developing and marketing the invention. Substantive examination—that is, the time consuming and most costly process in which the invention is assessed against statutory criteria—will only occur if directed by the Commissioner of Patents or requested by the patent owner or a third party. If the patent meets the requirements of examination, it will be certified and, if not, it will be revoked. To reduce the scope for unsubstantiated threats, an innovation patent owner under this legislation can only enforce their rights if their patent has been certified.
This bill will also move many of the fee payment requirements from the Patents Act to the Patents Regulations 1991 to enable the administrative function to be handled more flexibly by the patent office. The bill will also correct a number of ambiguities and minor errors in the Patents Act. There is also a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act as a result of the introduction of the innovation patent. There is some cost to revenue of this legislation, rising from half a million dollars in the next financial year—that is, 2001-02—to $2 million in the year 2004-05 and again in 2005-06.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-11-02,"—I thank the opposition parties for their cooperation and for their contribution to this debate. The coalition government's commitment to fostering innovation and maintaining a strong and effective intellectual property system in Australia is reflected in the National Innovation Summit held in Melbourne earlier this year and by the record $4.5 billion we have committed to major science and innovation programs in the 2000-01 program. The Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Bill 2000 is a key part of this process, building on the government's commitment to providing a patent system which better meets the needs of Australian business and ensuring that Australian intellectual property laws remain internationally competitive. The bill seeks to introduce a new, innovative patent system which will provide an inexpensive, fast entry option into the patent system. As I said, I welcome the opposition's support of the bill, which will enable both large and small businesses to profit from their investments in innovation. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I want to make some very brief comments on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999, which the opposition is supporting. It is a bill which makes a number of controversial amendments to legislation dealing with veterans, the most notable of which relate to the formal recognition of the treatment of additional compensation payable on death or severe injury of veterans, the inclusion of counselling services in the services which may be provided to veterans' children and the correction of obvious errors in decisions of the Veterans' Review Board relating to the review of certain of their decisions. There are matters mentioned in the Parliamentary Library's Bills Digest No. 23 2000-01 on this bill, to which I would refer colleagues, which deal particularly with the issue of the way that compensation might apply where the result leads to maximum payments being increased to $200,000 for death or severe injury—that is, 80 per cent or more whole person impairment—$50,000 in respect of each dependent child at the date of death or severe injury and $1,000 payable to severely injured members or dependants of deceased members for obtaining professional advice. Having said that, I commend the bill to the Senate. The opposition will be supporting the bill.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-11-02,"—The National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 2000 (No. 2) amends the National Crime Authority Act to enable the National Crime Authority to do the work that Australian wants it to do. As was pointed out in the second reading speech, the National Crime Authority is a body which gathers together the powers the states might have and the powers the Commonwealth might have and uses those powers to make sure that crime in Australia is sought out and suppressed. That is a good thing. Australia has a number of police forces. There are police forces in the two territories and the states, and there is the Australian Federal Police, a most outstanding body, which has often been said here in the Senate.
The need for the National Crime Authority was felt in the eighties and was set up according to legislation, and that legislation of course depends upon the Constitution. No matter how much we might desire to set up a body, if that body is not set up and it does not exercise powers provided in accordance with the Constitution then it cannot exercise the authority that we might want to give it. Bodies like the National Crime Authority are dedicated to stopping the use of arbitrary power against the citizens of a country, with the people trying to exercise arbitrary power being those who bring in drugs that we do not want, people who commit fraud and so on.
But just as we want the law to stop people who are criminals exercising arbitrary power against society, so too we need to have the policing authorities regulated in such a way that they do not exercise arbitrary power, and that is why these bodies must conform to the Constitution. There is some concern, pursuant to a decision by the High Court—which interprets what the Constitution means, and does it very well—that the National Crime Authority is not now exercising the powers that we as legislators, and the community, for that matter, want it to exercise and that some cure should be found. That is the point of this legislation: to ensure that insofar as power can be given to the National Crime Authority within the terms of the Constitution, that is done. Of course, the opposition supports that.
This amendment bill has been brought on now. The last amendment that was brought on and passed in this chamber on this matter as a noncontroversial measure was an act entitled, `An Act to amend the NationalCrime Authority Act 1984, and for related purposes'. That was passed at the end of last year. That sought to correct any possible problem that there may have been with the National Crime Authority, going right back to its inception in 1984. We were assured, and we accepted that assurance at that time, that it had no retrospective effect, because we do not want matters dealing with crime to have a retrospective effect. I noticed soon after that that the National Crime Authority was able to proceed against motorbike gangs, and there were some arrests made, and so on. That was interesting. But in any event there is no problem with retrospectivity here. This bill helps the National Crime Authority to get on with the excellent work it is doing. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2000 (NO. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-11-02,"—The National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 2000 (No. 2) attempts to ensure that the National Crime Authority legislation confers constitutionally valid powers, functions and duties on the NCA and of course arises out of the High Court case of this year which meant that some Commonwealth-state cooperations may be invalid—or, as more succinctly pointed out in the research done within the Bills Digest:
As a consequence of High Court's decision in R v Hughes, the bill amends the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to clarify the powers, functions and duties of the National Crime Authority by: expanding the scope of Commonwealth references to include States offences which have a federal aspect; ensuring that where the Authority is under a duty to investigate a matter pursuant to a State reference, those references will be limited to matters that have a federal aspect; and clarifying that the Authority does not have any duty or obligation to perform any function or exercise any power conferred by a State law, unless there is a federal aspect.
In other words, this bill aims to ensure that there is no want of power for the NCA in terms of the work it carries out. In that regard, this bill is very much a clarification of powers, not an increase of them. Therefore, we Democrats are confident that this is not a situation which might involve concerns from civil libertarians. 
As a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority, I acknowledge the important and ongoing work that the NCA does and I acknowledge also that it is keen to see the passage of this legislation, and with good reason. That being the case, we Democrats are supportive of the bill. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2000 (NO. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-11-02,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. I know all senators have been involved in this and have scrutinised the bill closely, and a number have sought personal briefings from officers before determining their position on the bill. The response to the bill is a good example of those occasions when groupings in the Senate can work together without an explosion of partisan politics and produce a good outcome for the community. 
The NCA is vital to Australia's effort to combat organised crime and it is imperative that any doubt about the scope of the operations it can undertake be put beyond doubt as soon as possible. The amendments proposed by the bill are designed to provide a valid basis for the broadest possible range of NCA investigations by giving them federal coverage. The roles of the Commonwealth and states in the management of the NCA and the issuing of references remain unchanged. I am grateful to honourable senators for their support and their contributions this afternoon to what is a very necessary measure, and I commend the bill to the chamber. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2000 (NO. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-11-02,"—This is a bill that must be right because it is non-controversial. The government is supporting it, the opposition is supporting it and I think the Democrats are supporting it.
—Do you support it?
—That is a very interesting question, because I have some worries about it. Therefore, I must be wrong, which I admit right at the start. My concern with this bill arose from the deliberations of a committee of which I am very proud to be chair. It came before the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which wrote to the minister, Senator Vanstone. In the way she always does, the minister replied by letter and helped the committee to the fullest extent possible. I would like to acknowledge the way she treats the committee generally, and particularly on this occasion. I also acknowledge the help of the people in her office, in particular Mr Paul Griffiths, whom I am going to embarrass by naming him. People from the Attorney-General's Department are here, including Mr McDonald, who has been outstanding in that department over the years.  
Having said all that, I should sit down now and not tell people about my concern. Why should I have any concern at all? The second reading speech, which I have here, starts off with the minister saying that in 1825 British clergyman and writer Charles Caleb Cottons observed: 
There are some frauds so well conducted that it would be stupidity not to be deceived by them.
The point of putting that in there is to show that crime is forever with us and that crime should be suppressed—something with which we would all agree. I thought of that perhaps more well-known statement by William Blackstone in 1765 that it is better that 10 guilty persons escape than one innocent person suffer. I know he said it in more robust times when they still had hanging, drawing and quartering. They had it going in those times in 1765. Indeed, as I recall, they had burning. Some crimes resulted in men being punished by being stripped and dealt with.
—They burned the women.
—They burned the women because they did not want to strip them. Senator West has to understand that they burned the women because to strip them would be obscene.
—Is that right, Senator Cooney?
—That is absolutely correct.
—And then the argument went up in flames.
—We should not jest, even in these times, about those sorts of issues. In any event, this bill extends the geographic jurisdictions that Australia purports to exercise. It extends to the point where if Australian citizens overseas—say, in a country like Greece or Latvia—commit a crime under the definition of fraud, bribery and related offences, they can be dealt with in Australia even though the crime was committed overseas, and at the same time they can be extradited.
Recently, on another excellent committee on which I sit with Senator Ludwig, the treaties committee, a treaty was brought up that dealt with extradition, and we had a discussion about that. That treaty was with Latvia, but there are others. Under those treaties and based on the Extradition Act 1988, we would extradite Australian citizens to those countries for trial on the basis of the no evidence rule. If one of those countries sets out certain facts, sends for the accused here and the Magistrates Court looks at it and thinks it is all right, we are obliged to send that person to that country for trial. However, many of those countries do not extradite their citizens to Australia. They extradite other people, but not their citizens. Civil law countries do not extradite their citizens to our country. Why is that? One reason given for not extraditing their citizens to Australia for a crime committed here is that they try them in their own country. We as a common law country are most disinclined to prosecute people, whether they be citizens or otherwise, who commit crimes overseas.
We therefore attached riders to our approval of the treaty, but in any event we approved it. Part of the reason we approved it was the difference between civil law countries and common law countries. Common law countries will deal only with a confined jurisdiction; that is, crimes committed within their country but not crimes committed overseas.
—Or was it really Trimbole?
—Yes, Trimbole. Senator Ludwig remembers it. That was only about two or three weeks ago. The legislation we are debating today will allow us to try Australian citizens if they commit a crime overseas even though no part of the crime was committed in Australia and it has nothing to do with Australia. However, if the crime is committed overseas, we will nevertheless try these people. 
What does that say about the advice we were given at the time we were dealing with the treaty with Latvia? As the committee honestly went about its work, it was told that the culture and the tradition is that civil law countries prosecute people who commit crimes in Australia and therefore they will not send their citizens to Australia when Australia wants to try them. What else does that mean? Does it mean that a person who commits a crime in Greece is going to be prosecuted in Australia?
To give an example, say an Australian backpacking around Greece is accused of theft. When he or she returns to Australia, they can be prosecuted in Australia for that crime after this legislation is passed, and everybody says that it is proper to pass it. Therefore, they can be prosecuted in the Australian Capital Territory, Sydney or Melbourne. After that person is convicted and serves his or her sentence, Greece can then say, `We want our go now. You haven't prosecuted him or her in respect of all these matters. We want you to extradite him or her over here now.' Greece would not have to produce any evidence; it would need only to make a statement of fact and we would be obliged to send him or her to Greece to serve another sentence. I have concerns that there appears to be a double jeopardy.
There are other issues in relation to this bill that worry me. If a person commits a crime according to Australian law in Greece and it has nothing to do with Australia, except that the person is an Australian citizen, and that person is brought back here, prosecuted and says that it was not a crime in Greece, who has the onus of proving it was not a crime in Greece? The person has an evidentiary burden to prove that it was not a crime in Greece. How is he or she able to do that?
In my young days, which were a long, long time ago, in civil cases if somebody had to prove a foreign law—say, the law of Turkey—they would get an expert and prove the law of Turkey as a matter of fact. That did not seem to cause the plaintiff or the defendant, as the case may have been, great distress. Yet it seems that the prosecution cannot bring itself to the task of proving what should be relatively easy for it to prove, because it has all sorts of connections around the world through the prosecutor's office, through Interpol and so on. No, that is left to the young people. My children are not so young, but if my grand-daughter takes off to Greece in some years to come and she is accused of committing a crime there, when she returns to Australia she will have to prove as a matter of fact—and it would be as a matter of fact—what the law of a foreign country is. That seems to me to just be oppressive. 
It seems to me that it also embeds in the law even more the fact that you need money to conduct a defence. I do not think that is a good thing. Why do I say that? What happens when a person of considerable wealth is prosecuted by the NCA or whatever through, of course, the DPP. I might say that Mr Bugg is an excellent Director of Public Prosecutions. 
If I can just digress, I notice that a former Deputy Director of Prosecutions in Victoria, Mr Bernard Bongiorno, has been appointed to the Victorian Supreme Court. From my point of view, that is a most outstanding appointment. His Honour Mr Justice Bongiorno, as he now is, is a great man. I wish to acknowledge his great career, a career that has adorned the legal profession of Australia. He will make a most outstanding judge. He is a man of fair mind and of great ability with the law and a great finder of fact. 
After that diversion, I will return to the bill. Why should this burden be placed on a young backpacker? That is what we have subjected backpackers to now—double jeopardy. An Australian citizen will be able to be sent back to Greece after being tried here for a similar crime that might well have arisen out of the same set of circumstances. People will say, `That would never happen,' but the law allows it to happen. What, no doubt, will be said is, `The Attorney-General would never do that.' Therefore, what this poor backpacker has to rely on is the wisdom of the Attorney-General. The present Attorney-General is, of course, quite an outstanding Attorney-General, but what about the attorneys-general of the future? There is no legal remedy for any of this. It is all executive remedy. So we have put our citizens at risk and the only protection we have given them is ministerial discretion.  
I do not know whether any of these countries have any agreement with Australia to overcome these problems with the criminal law. But it just seems a bit poor that, in respect of the way a person can be prosecuted for a crime, an Australian citizen is worse off than the citizens of many other countries. I do not think that is a good thing, and it just worries me a bit because of my grand-daughter. 
Nevertheless, we have the wisdom of the parliament before us. Everybody seems to agree that this is an excellent piece of legislation. However, it is very worrying legislation if we do not go beyond it and do not say, `Look, the Attorney-General would never let this happen,' or, `The system would never let this happen.' Of course people will say, `The executive would never do that,' and, `These countries that we have these treaties with are very reasonable countries.' Nevertheless, under the law, if a magistrate is asked under the terms of a treaty to send a person back to Greece or to any of these other countries, so be it. 
What might well happen is that the magistrate would be asked not to send the person back until that person had been tried and perhaps jailed here. There has to be some relief for people who have committed criminal acts. I hope that one of the beliefs of this society is that there is such a thing as redemption, of being able to return to society. We ought not have a system that just crushes a person for committing a crime, for making a mistake, for carrying out an act of theft in Athens and then be subject to the sorts of punishment that this act leaves open. In any event, it would have been nice to have this issue pointed out to us in the treaties committee when we were told that Australia's culture in this area was not to go beyond its own shores.
They are the concerns that I have with this legislation. I would like to touch on some other issues in the legislation, but time is on the wing and this legislation is not controversial.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-11-02,"—I do not know what to say to Senator Cooney. He is one person to whom I listen carefully, because I have worked with him on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and respect his commitment to ensuring that the parliament is not railroaded by the executive. Obviously, I am not as au fait with this bill as he is, as I am standing in for the minister. But the bill will achieve many longstanding goals of the government in terms of clarifying, simplifying and ensuring that there are adequate offences in legislation to meet the challenges of the new century. The prosecution of theft and fraud offences is improved by replacing complex provisions dependent on common law terminology with codified offences that have been developed in cooperation with the states and territories. The opportunity has been taken to update fraud and forgery offences to take into account new technology and there are new offences previously not included in Commonwealth law, such as the proposed unwarranted demands offence, which is similar to state and territory blackmail offences.
The advisory report of the House of Representative Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which was tabled on 26 June, agrees. It concludes:
This Bill represents one of the most significant changes to the Commonwealth criminal law in recent years. It arises out of the Commonwealth's long-term aim of consolidating all of its criminal laws into one easily accessible, clear and consistent Act of parliament. 
The committee has examined the bill carefully and produced an excellent report, which has led to improvements in the bill in the House. The government has taken action to address all of the recommendations of the standing committee's 26 June 2000 advisory report. 
Maybe Senator Cooney might have wished that there was a member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. But the responsibility for the areas covered by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has been left to the Senate as the house of review. In response to some of the things that Senator Cooney said, it is the case that extended geographical jurisdiction will be allowed in future using the provisions of the bill on a case by case basis as approved by parliament in enacting future bills. That would be a very important area for the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to watch carefully to ensure that it believes the extension of geographical jurisdiction is appropriate in those particular cases. The defence in this bill is a major improvement to the extent that the existing provision in the Crimes Act 1914 contains no such defence. I believe there will be a briefing for the Scrutiny of Bills Committee next Wednesday to further explain the provisions and to listen to concerns.  
I thank Senator Cooney for allowing this debate to proceed and for permitting the briefing to occur as a separate matter. But, as I said, it will be an issue. Because this is a template, the parliament will have an opportunity to look at it on a case by case basis as each bill comes before us and to examine whether it is appropriate for that power to be extended in that case and to what level. So it is not all water under the bridge. I am sure Senator Cooney and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee will be as vigilant as ever in examining each of those bills to ensure that the template we have set up does not result in the outcome as described by Senator Cooney. I thank honourable senators for their cooperation in the passage of this bill and I thank Senator Cooney for his contribution. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"West, Senator Sue",ALP,2000-11-02,"—My question is to Senator Herron, representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care. Can the minister confirm that the ACCC is currently investigating false, misleading and deceptive conduct by six health insurance funds? Can he confirm that this has resulted in Federal Court action against the federal government owned Medibank Private, which is the nation's largest health insurer?

"West, Senator Sue",ALP,2000-11-02,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware of criticisms by consumer organisations that the publicly funded ads on lifetime health were grossly misleading and lacked any detail on the complex issues that consumers needed to consider in choosing a health fund? Doesn't this mean that the federal government has spent $17 million for political purposes and ignored its obligation to properly inform the public?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health Insurance Funds: Investigation</title>,Questions Without Notice,16,1,question
"Herron, Senator John",LP,2000-11-02,"—I thank Senator West for the question. There is no doubt that the Labor Party are very touchy in relation to private health insurance. If there is one thing that has been a great achievement for this government, it is the fact that we have been able to increase the number of people that have private health insurance, where 41 per cent of the population is now covered by private health insurance.
—A fantastic achievement.
—A fantastic achievement, as Senator Hill just said—a great achievement. Inevitably there will be problems when dramatic changes occur. There will be an investigation done when allegations of this kind are made, because that is what it is all about. We have a Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to look into these matters, and appropriate action will be taken. Notwithstanding that, the great achievement of this government has been to increase the number of people that are privately insured. We are very proud of that record. The effect of it, of course, is that it will take pressure off the public hospital system because people can access private hospitals and, importantly, it gives freedom of choice—with this being exercised by nearly half of the population now. What was the Labor Party's record on this? They took it down to about 32 per cent—to below 30 per cent in my own home state of Queensland—because of the reduction in rebates and the charges put onto the private hospital system that did not exist before in a deliberate attempt at socialising the health system of this country. 
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Don't skirt around it. Socialism is a dirty word in the Labor Party now—they do not want to know about it. It was their official policy.
—Like roll-back.
—It is getting a bit like roll-back, as Senator Kemp just said. It is a dirty word, the big `r' word—you do not talk about that.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. I have great difficulty seeing how this is relevant to a question about investigating false, misleading and deceptive conduct by health insurance organisations and increases in premiums.
—I think, Senator Herron, you have perhaps allowed interjections to distract you a little.
—With respect, Madam President, I talked about the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman, and that is the avenue available to anybody that has a problem. I did mention that in my previous answer, but Senator West obviously did not want to hear that. There has been an increase in the number of consumer complaints—we are not denying that. In fact, we welcome it because we want the system to function correctly. It can only function correctly if it is functioning in the best interests of the people that subscribe to the private health insurance scheme. But we have to put things into perspective. The total number of complaints for the year has increased by only 3.5 per cent over the previous year.
—How many?
—Senator Crowley asks me how many. Relative to the rise in membership, it was about 50 per cent over the same period. I am happy to answer that question.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston), to questions without notice asked by Senators O'Brien and Forshaw today, relating to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and outsourcing 
Senator Alston represents in this chamber the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Of course, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is Mr Truss, and he holds a cabinet position. That, at least, tells you that it is an important portfolio area—but not, obviously, to Senator Alston. Increasingly now we find that, whenever Senator Alston gets asked a question to do with this portfolio, he simply does not know the answer. In addition, he has not even looked at the brief. He fumbles around at the table and, with his ideologically obsessive hatred of trade unions, hurls abuse whilst he desperately seeks an answer. 
Today he was asked questions relating to proposals to potentially privatise core services of AQIS in the quarantine area and questions relating to cuts in the funding of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry because they have not met the obligations imposed upon them with respect to the outsourcing agenda. Minister Alston knew nothing. This is an extremely important issue. The quarantine service provided by AQIS is vital to the health of all Australians; it is vital to our agricultural, forestry, fisheries and other industries, particularly our export based industries. It is also vital to those areas where we import products. As my colleague Senator Woodley, who is in the chamber, knows—as do other members such as Senator Crane, who is the chair of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee—our committee has constantly been looking at the performance of AQIS. 
—Lack of performance.
—That is true, and in some areas we have been very critical of AQIS where they have deserved criticism. In their defence, they have been starved of the funds and resources they need to carry out their core functions. This government has an ideological obsession about market testing for outsourcing. You have to draw the line somewhere, and I plead with the government senators on this issue. It is unfortunate that none of the National Party senators are in the chamber at the moment to debate this issue. Senator McGauran is here, but the leader, Senator Boswell, is not here. The National Party should know the importance of AQIS's core quarantine services, and any suggestion that you would outsource those core services to the private sector is just an absolutely crazy proposition. How could you possibly even suggest it? But no, the government says, `AQIS have to market test these services to set them up for privatisation and outsourcing.' AQIS have been subject to some of the most rigorous reviews over recent years. Senators will recall the Nairn committee report. That committee was established by the previous Labor government to look at all the functions, operations and management of AQIS, particularly arising out of the meat substitution scandal. A lot of recommendations flowed from that committee and I know that the government—even this government—took that report seriously. You have to take it seriously because of the importance of the issues. In particular, that report recommended that governments:
... increase their commitment to budgetary funding of quarantine and quarantine related activities to reflect community expectations in line with the partnership approach to the development and delivery of effective quarantine.
Further, it said:
The committee recommends that the government increase its commitment to quarantine and quarantine related activities.
How can you carry out those recommendations if you are going to slash the funding year by year and if you are going to outsource the core services? This is a crazy proposition and it should be consigned to the bin.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-11-02,"—I congratulate Senator Forshaw: it is a great change to have a policy debate in this discussion on taking note of answers. I thank you. Senator Forshaw's remarks are based on an article in the Sydney Morning Herald today.
—I didn't refer to the article once.
—Senator Forshaw, the government has no intention to privatise the border security programs. Rather, there is an intention to do what is most efficient. In the past, the government has reviewed its AQIS program, and AQIS has, for many years, worked to ensure that it delivers its services in the most efficient way. The results are obvious in many of its programs, such as meat inspection where costs to industry have fallen from $80 million when the government took office to $50 million this year. The government does not have any preconceived views on the outcomes of any reviews of the border security programs. Senator Forshaw said that this government is ideologically obsessed with market testing and market forces.
—Where's their ideology?
—Thank you, Senator McGauran. That is just what I needed. Better that than have no ideological compass and simply be based on pragmatism, opportunism and populism. The opposition pick up an issue and, every time they think there is a vote or two in it, away they run with it. 
—This is not about votes.
—Senator Forshaw, I accept and the government accepts that quarantine is an extremely important issue. What always concerns me though, Senator Forshaw, is that the opposition's form on these issues is so poor. They talk about our ideological obsessions consistently, yet they cherry pick liberal democracy; they pick the good ideas, and then say, `Ah, they won't sell, so we won't reform them.' What about the GST and roll-back? You do not have any credibility on any issue to do with reform. The opposition has said nothing in recent times about any single issue of major reform facing this country, whether the issue is tax reform or welfare reform.
—Senator Forshaw, I forecast that, within your time in this Senate, the Australian Labor Party will adopt mutual obligation as their underlying philosophy in social welfare. They will do it because they will have no choice. In all these debates the ALP lean towards liberal democracy but hold back when they do not think there is a vote in it for them. This is particularly the case with taxation reform: they sat there and criticised this government's reforms, knowing that this great country needed the reforms. They did not do it because they did not think there were votes in it. What is disgraceful about what the opposition did is not that they opposed it, but that they opposed it knowing, after 20 years of debate, that it was good policy for this country. That is what the government objects to about Labor Party policy. I am sure that, in Senator Forshaw's time in this parliament, mutual obligation will become the benchmark for Labor Party policy. There is no way, for example, that the Labor Party can continue to hand out welfare—whether it is for Aboriginal people or for any other people in Australia—in the same way they have in the past. The debate in this country is leaving the ALP behind. Do you know why, Senator Lightfoot?
—Tell the Senate, please.
—The reason is that they have no moral, ideological or policy compass. They stand for nothing. At least Mr Whitlam stood for something. He may have got it wrong, he may have been surrounded by Vietnam generation trendies, but at least he stood for something. All this lot stand for is pragmatism and opportunism.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I thank Senator Mason for his usual humorous interlude, but perhaps we could get to the question at hand and not have to listen to the rantings that we have just heard. I am interested in addressing the comment by Senator Kemp following the questions to Senator Alston when he suggested that we might have `kept the best for last'. How could that be? How could one have had a more sublime—from the opposition's point of view—response to questions than that presented by Senator Alston? I think he spent more time looking for his brief and particularly debating with Senator Calvert whether the document he was trying to hand him was the document that he needed to answer the question, because he clearly had no idea.
But let us get to the subject of the matter. Yes, there was an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald about quarantine and outsourcing. Yes—and this is the point that Minister Alston was not prepared to concede—there is a document within AFFA, in the form of speaking notes, which provides an admission that part of the motivation for the process that Senator Alston conceded is being undertaken is that AFFA has suffered a $7 million reduction in its budget allocation for this year as a penalty for failing to implement the government's outsourcing and privatisation agenda fast enough during 1998-99. What assurances do we have? `Oh, we're not looking at outsourcing border protection.' Not yet, maybe! The fact of the matter is that there is no doubt about what happened when the government took back into AFFA responsibility for Australia's biosecurity and took from AQIS the quarantine import risk assessment process. They had in mind that, at the end of the day, there would not be much left of AQIS; that, after it had been outsourced, after it had gone through this process, after the department had been penalised and forced to undergo this process, there would basically be nothing left. What we see with the first step—that is, the taking into the department of Biosecurity Australia—is a blueprint for what this government is going to do. Perhaps the government will be saying to the states, `You can have your border security controls—we'll do some deal with you to do that—but we'll take that away from AQIS as well.' 
I noted a comment from the thoroughbred industry about border security control, because it is a critical question in this country. Those who observed the quarantine measures which were used for horses for the Olympics and for horses that have come here for the Melbourne Cup will understand the precautions that have been taken to protect a very valuable industry. That is just one small example of the importance of AQIS and border protection control to this country.
We are seeing a process where this government is more concerned about outsourcing and privatisation than about the issues of importance to this country. Why else would they be seeking to impose pressure on the department to further outsource AQIS? Or was it that the minister's hatred of trade unions meant that if there was within AQIS any part of its workforce that was organised then pressure ought to be put on them to outsource it, to privatise it, to cost people their jobs, just as when the Prime Minister was talking about the Burnie dispute and the wharfies in Burnie were guilty by association because they were members of the MUA and then deserved to be sacked? Is this the same case—that the Prime Minister and this minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry are all of the view that any part of AQIS is available for sacrifice because they are guilty by association for being members of their organisation? Is that what it is all about?
—It's not a union driven—
—It is not a union driven thing? Perhaps Senator McGauran when he jumps up will explain why Minister Alston focused on it so much. Why did he focus on it so much in his answer if it is not the driving passion behind this government to punish these people and to punish Australia because of this ideological obsession of the government's? That is what it seems to me to be all about. Frankly, from the body language of this minister at the end of question time, he knew he had made an absolute mess.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2000-11-02,"—It is really futile debating this, because the simple answer is that AQIS is not for sale. That was made very clear. But what is driving it again—and the senators on the other side speak of some ideological obsession—is the ideological obsession that the opposition have with the union movement and the union movement being their masters here. The problem is that AQIS has 1,800 staff members who belong to the Community and Public Sector Union. Anything that is likely to impinge upon that area, the opposite side take unbelievable exception to. It is not because Australia does not have the best inspection system in the world. The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service is the best system in the world, and we need it. We are an island nation. We do have special circumstances that require us to have world's best practice with our quarantine service, and we do.
The Sydney Morning Herald article and the statements made here today by Senator O'Brien and by Senator Forshaw are simply wrong. AQIS is not for sale. But what we are trying to do—just as we have in fact lowered the costs of meat inspections from $80 million down to $50 million in a relatively short time, given the time that we will be here and that we have been in office—is to see whether we can spend better, more wisely and make the money go further without any diminution in the quality of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. That is what it is about. It is not about reducing the ability or the standards or the world's best practice that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service provides for our agricultural imports and some of our agricultural and farm exports as well, as you would be quite aware, Madam Deputy President. 
Let me say again: there is no intention to privatise our extensive border security programs, and they are extensive. We have one of the biggest coastlines in the world. It is often of course undefended. That is why when boats come in from Indonesia—a practice of bringing illegal immigrants here that I am diametrically opposed to—those boats are burned. That is why we have one of the most stringent inspections, even from state to state, because the states do play a large role in the prevention of some agricultural diseases that are in one state and not another. I often wonder whether this is not magnified by those states in order to perhaps enhance the product that they produce—cherries are one of those things, of course.
In terms of the opposition saying that AQIS is going to be somehow sold off and some of the other derogatory remarks that were made, that is not correct. Outsourcing I believe in. I believe that we have a responsibility in government that where we handle the taxpayers' dollars we must do it with the utmost regard to those prudential and other responsibilities that we have. All the government is saying is that where there can be savings made without impinging upon the world's best practice, then those savings are going to be identified and implemented.
In terms of the other reason that Senator O'Brien uses—the ulterior motive—there is this element of scare tactics on the other side that comes from the trade union movement. We know that they use this to the detriment of Australia. This is not a good thing for Australia, to put Australian agricultural people in doubt as to whether AQIS—world's best practice inspection service—is in fact the best. It is categorically the best. I acknowledge that, and the other side would do well to acknowledge that as well. It is simply one method—a tedious method—that they use to try to bring discredit upon this government. I do not think that is fair, and I do not think that is at all reasonable. I remember the scandals that involved the trade union movement in the Territory when an export abattoir was shut down for a couple of years. That is just one example of the trade union movement acting against the best interests of Australia.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-11-02,"—It is not very often in question time that we get to see a minister make such a complete fool of himself. Today Senator Alston exposed himself as knowing so little about what is going on in his own government. He did so when he was unable to respond to Senator Forshaw's question regarding the $7 million that AFFA has lost as a result of not being able to participate in the IT outsourcing program. For Senator Alston's benefit, I would like to inform him and others on the other side of the chamber that this is not an affliction peculiar to AFFA. In fact, the coalition government's IT outsourcing program imposed a series of budget cuts across most of the agencies and departments in the federal government a number of years ago now—in the 1996-97 budget and in the 1997-98 budget. Since then, those departments have lost money every financial year. In AFFA's case it is $7 million. We did some calculations some time ago which demonstrated that the department of health had in fact lost $6 million from their budget allocations in anticipation of the coalition's IT outsourcing program.
So what has happened? Today we asked a question about the financial pressure being brought to bear on AFFA and about what is going on. The point I would like to make is this: the vast majority of government agencies and departments have lost money in their budget allocation in anticipation of what the government claimed would be savings for outsourcing their IT. Unfortunately for the departments, and I would say predictably, that IT outsourcing program has been a dismal failure. As a result of the performance audit by the Australian National Audit Office, titled `Implementation of whole-of-government information technology infrastructure consolidation and outsourcing initiative'—a big title—we know that the savings anticipated with respect to those budget cuts were not realised. We know that because this Auditor's report says it.
So even if AFFA had been able to get their IT outsourcing up and running, the chances of them realising the savings and backfilling the $7 million gap left were pretty low anyhow. Where does that leave us? It leaves AFFA in a situation where they are having to find money from other programs to backfill that loss. That puts pressure both on the public servants required to deliver services and on the management of that agency to allocate their funding within that area in a suitable and meaningful way. 
The other point I would like to make is about this insistence that somehow this antagonism and opposition to outsourcing have something to do with trade unions or indeed with Labor's ideological approach to outsourcing. It in fact has nothing to do with either, other than representing a genuine respect for the workers that deliver these services within the Public Service. That will always be the case, and I stand by a legitimate concern to represent the working people of this country. Labor will never back away from that.
But let us look at ideological agendas. I would like to quote now from the annual report of the Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing, released just yesterday in this chamber. It exposes every denial on the other side of the chamber about this market testing not occurring as being absolutely false. Let me quote from page 30, on the market testing and contracting out program announced in this year's budget:
During 1999-2000 the team has been working directly with agencies to increase the uptake of CTC—
that is, competitive tendering and contracting—
through market testing of corporate and other relevant services. Several agencies are undertaking activities for market testing.
I now quote from page 31, on `Working with industry':
Industry capacity to respond to market testing in contracting out is critical to the success of the project. The MTACO team—
the market testing and contracting out team—
has developed a strategy to gather intelligence on market capacity, including discussions with key industry representatives. Tools include a Register of Providers; and a market capability database ... will be used to provide agencies with access to this information. We are also seeking industry views on areas for improvement in Commonwealth market testing processes, with a view to identifying solutions that minimise the cost of tendering while still maintaining accountability and probity aspects.
This is what is happening here, and it is very clear, by virtue of the minister's ignorant response and Senator Forshaw's very astute question, that AFFA is tightly wrapped up and engaged in this market testing program.

"McGauran, Senator Julian",NP,2000-11-02,"—Having been on estimates committees with Senator O'Brien, I know only too well—as do others in this chamber—that he is a man who can talk under wet cement.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—Madam Deputy President, if Senator Lundy loudly says `don't lie' to me, she ought to be called to order.
—I was trying to call you to order because I was trying to listen to Senator McGauran. Senator Lundy, if you have said something unparliamentary, would you please withdraw it. I did not hear it.
—I suggested that they not lie about something.
—Please withdraw.
—I withdraw.
—Senator Ian Campbell, will you come to order and cease interjecting, because your interjections have been unparliamentary for some considerable time.
—I was making the point about Senator O'Brien being a longwinded contributor to committees and this chamber—
—Do not reflect upon other members in this place either, Senator McGauran.
—His sometimes very good contributions too, I might add. But my point is this, if I can make it: he actually conked out four minutes into his five-minute contribution today. He was making ridiculous points because there is really no take note of answer motion today. They could not find one. The Reith issue has fallen over—come Thursday; it did not even make the end of the week. The petrol issue is having no penetrating effect in this chamber, so they have raised this rather obscure issue about one of our finest performers, Senator Alston. Couldn't you have found an easier, softer target? The finest performer in this government, and they talk about the way he happened to answer a question concerning another minister's portfolio. Even Senator O'Brien could not puff it up for five minutes. He started making these ridiculous, obscure suggestions that the Melbourne Cup would be compromised because of a so-called headline in the Sydney Morning Herald. That was about four minutes into his contribution. It was an absurd contribution. The Sydney Morning Herald article, as the previous speakers from this side have said, is utterly wrong. It is in fact confused. AQIS is not on the market. What we are all talking about—on both sides of the chamber—is really motherhood. We all recognise the importance of AQIS and the role it plays. No-one is going to compromise AQIS's importance. 
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Could I have order from both Senator George and Senator Ian Campbell. If the Campbells would like to go to the Lowlands or somewhere and give us some quiet in here, it would be appreciated, thank you.
—This government has no intention of compromising its quarantine inspections. I would not even make that accusation in regard to the opposition, should they come into government. This is one of the most important services the government can offer. I need not go through the litany of its importance in regard to border controls. But to suggest that there cannot be reforms within the department is absurd. In fact the reforms that we have introduced since being in government have had tremendous cascading effects within the cattle industry, no less—an industry I know only too well. In quoting from the same Sydney Morning Herald article, Mr Justice Toohey, Executive Director, Cattle Council of Australia, said that the annual cost of the AQIS services to the beef exporters had fallen by $140 million to $50 million over eight years as the services had become more efficient.
I can even compliment the opposition. Of those eight years, we have been in government for some five years—that is where the bulk of the reform has occurred of course. But perhaps you did put in place some early reform processes that have brought huge savings—$140 million in savings. So reform is necessary; scrutiny is necessary. Are you suggesting that we just freeze and stand still? I know Senator Lundy would be one of those that would suggest that. She wants to put a cocoon around every department in Canberra, for quite obvious reasons.
Senator Alston raised the question of unions within departments and the protection of the Public Service through unions, which so often Senator Lundy comes into bat for. Why shouldn't he? If it can be done more efficiently with outsourcing—I am talking about all the departments across the whole of Canberra—then so it should. There should be no protection of Canberra's Public Service unions. There are more than just Public Service unions, Senator Campbell; there are private unions that benefit from outsourcing. It is a complicated and confused argument that you have placed before this chamber. To protect some 1,800 AQIS employees because some of them happen to belong to a Public Service union is to deny this country and this department proper reforms. Just for the record, the Sydney Morning Herald article is wrong. AQIS's Executive Director, Mr Brian Macdonald, said, `Let us assure you that AQIS is not on the market,' and the government supports those comments.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I present the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee entitled APS Employment Matters—First Report: Australian Workplace Agreements, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings, submissions and additional information received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This unanimous first report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry into APS employment matters deals with Australian workplace agreements. AWAs have been singled out for attention because the committee believes the APS approach to them to be in conflict with the community's values and expectations of an accountable Public Service. This report does not delve into the merits or otherwise of Australian workplace agreements as a means of setting terms and conditions of employment, as the views of all political parties are well known. It concentrates on an issue of cross-partisan concern—that is, the lack of transparency of AWAs in the Australian Public Service.
The foundation of the APS is a set of principles, values and ethical standards in the Public Service Act 1999. One of the most important of these defining characteristics is open accountability to the government, the parliament and the Australian public. The committee is not confident that APS values are being given any regard in the highly confidential environment in which AWAs are being made. The secrecy surrounding individual negotiations and setting of terms and conditions of employment does not promote a perception that equity and fairness are the prevailing considerations. This is of increasing concern because a shift is occurring from their use only within the Senior Executive Service to, in some agencies, AWAs being on offer to all employees, where the relative bargaining power of the parties in individual negotiations changes markedly.
It is evident that agencies believe that there is benefit in the ability to tailor individual agreements to the circumstances of the agency and the employee. However, the committee is concerned that encouragement, indeed championing, of the use of AWAs in the APS has not been accompanied by serious evaluation of their costs and benefits. The committee believes that more information and strengthened reporting requirements are needed to bolster the transparency and accountability of AWAs in the APS. This would also alert the APS to any unintended impact of individual agreements, such as on members of EEO target groups.
It is the committee's view that the level of confidentiality of AWAs maintained by departments and agencies is inappropriate for the public sector. There is nothing in the Workplace Relations Act to prevent either party to an AWA from disclosing its contents to whomever they wish. Indeed, agency heads have a responsibility under the act to ensure that their disclosure is not prohibited. The public benefit in disclosure of the conditions and remuneration going to public employees outweighs superficial privacy concerns. Principles of transparency already apply to other forms of agreements and determinations. Those setting remuneration and conditions for departmental secretaries must be published in the Gazette and collective agreements—certified agreements—are also publicly available documents. 
The committee sees no compelling reason for AWAs of public servants not to follow the same principle. The recent publicity about parliamentarians' entitlements has highlighted the need for openness and accountability in the expenditure of public money. The committee recommends in this report that the government, as the ultimate employer, direct agency heads that AWAs with SES and APS employees are not to be kept confidential. It also recommends that agencies make AWAs available on request.
A service-wide perspective has been lost in the devolution process. The current environment sees agencies competing not only with the private sector but with each other in terms of remuneration and conditions offered to staff under AWAs. The only agency with anything approaching a comprehensive database of APS AWAs is the Office of the Employment Advocate. In the committee's view, it is utterly unacceptable that APS information held by the OEA is not available to other arms of the service, particularly DEWRSB and the PSMPC. This would enable them to provide more rigorous and regular information about APS employment and devolved agreement making. The committee recommends that agency heads authorise the Employment Advocate to release APS AWAs to the Public Service Commissioner and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. The committee does not seek to have public sector remuneration practices wound back in time to conform to past `one size fits all' solutions. The committee wants decisions and outcomes to be reported openly and fully—flexibility with accountability is achievable. 
Once again the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee has examined the payment of secret individual performance bonuses and again states its strong view that one-off individual performance bonuses have no place in a Public Service. The Finance and Public Administration Committee again recommends performance bonuses be discontinued. Acknowledging that this may not be accepted, the committee wishes to place on the record its recommendations for an APS that continues to pay bonuses under the following terms: first, bonus payments must be for outstanding individual or team service, not for competent performance as some agencies have determined; second, the committee is particularly opposed to uncapped bonus payments and recommends they be limited in the same way as those payable to departmental secretaries; and, third, there must be complete disclosure of all performance bonus payments, SES and non-SES, in annual reports.
If APS pay rates are not compensation for satisfactory, or competent, performance, this should be dealt with in an open and transparent review, not by creative supplementation schemes. More accountability for non-monetary remuneration is also required. The committee is aware that the current fashion is to focus on outcomes, not dwell on inputs. Nonetheless, the committee still believes that the cost and performance of the Public Service is a vital element in the effective delivery of outcomes and must be open to scrutiny. The parliament has enforced transparency on executive remuneration in the private sector; logically, it should require no less of the public sector. Public sector annual and financial reporting requirements have been reduced in spite of legislative changes that increase the accountability of the private sector. The committee is concerned that this indicates that APS accountability obligations are out of step with community standards. It is unacceptable that less disclosure is required of the Australian Public Service than the private sector. 
The committee's inquiry into APS employment matters is ongoing. Submissions and witnesses addressed a wide range of issues under the broad terms of reference, not only those issues of interest in this report. On behalf of my colleagues, I would like to thank all witnesses, especially agency heads representing small agencies and some of the larger departments, for their frank contributions—in particular, the Auditor-General, Mr Pat Barrett; the Public Service Commissioner, Ms Helen Williams; the Merit Protection Commissioner, Mr Alan Doolan; the Secretary to the Department of Defence, Dr Allan Hawke; the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Ted Evans; First Parliamentary Counsel, Ms Hilary Penfold; the Director of ScreenSound Australia, Mr Ron Brent; the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Mr Ron McLeod; the Secretary to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Dr Peter Shergold; and the Secretary to the Department of Finance and Administration, Dr Peter Boxall.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-11-02,"—This report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee is an excellent report. It is thorough and it is persuasive. It is a report that captures in a coherent, articulate way views and concerns that have been simmering in the Public Service for the last few years. I congratulate its authors. While the focus of this report may seem limited—the use of Australian workplace agreements in the Australian Public Service and related matters—it goes to the very core of the role of one of the key institutions in our system of government. The committee have brought together a comprehensive range of inputs. They have offered all interested parties an opportunity to put their point of view. They have faithfully reflected those views, and the way they have synthesised those views and drawn conclusions from them is, I believe, worthy of the highest commendation.
Let me make a couple of predictions in relation to this report. First, the government will bag it as the product of a partisan committee with a predetermined agenda. They will conveniently ignore the fact that it is a unanimous report endorsed by both opposition and government members of the committee. Secondly, this report will quickly become a bestseller in the APS among all ranks. Why? Because it articulates persuasively the doubts, concerns and convictions shared by so many public servants about the damage being done to the Public Service by this government's ideological obsessions. This report exposes the government's cant about greater accountability, flexibility and transparency in the APS. It exposes the yawning gap between the Public Service values espoused by the government—but, of course, actually supported by the opposition—and the government's practice of secrecy, obstruction and centralised control. 
The committee has singled out the lack of transparency of AWA processes and contents because it believes the APS approach to be in conflict with community values and expectations of an accountable Public Service. This criticism can be applied to all three areas dealt with by the committee: AWAs, levels of Public Service remuneration and performance pay. It is ridiculous and unacceptable that parliament does not have access to detailed information about AWAs across the Public Service, particularly when the government is so intent on forcing AWAs on public servants at all levels—nearly 7,000 at last count. According to the new Public Service Act, the APS is required to be openly accountable to the government, the parliament and the public. Yet this inquiry has demonstrated that this is patently not the case. The report notes:
The only agency with anything approaching a comprehensive database of AWAs is the Office of the Employment Advocate. In the committee's view, it is utterly unacceptable that the information held by this agency is not available to other arms of the APS ...
Let me quote the report again:
The framework for establishing and approving these individual agreements involves no external scrutiny to ensure consistency with the APS values or other ethical standards, or that the rewards to individuals are fair or within acceptable limits ... The committee views the secrecy surrounding AWAs in the APS as unnecessary and detrimental to the establishment of open relations between management and staff.
I share entirely the committee's lack of confidence that APS values are being given any regard in the highly confidential environment in which AWAs are being made and its view that the secrecy surrounding individual negotiations and setting of terms and conditions of employment promotes a perception of lack of equity and fairness. The case studies the committee draws attention to are stark examples of best and worst practice. On the one hand, we have the practice of the Treasury and the Department of the Senate of publishing details of AWAs in the belief that, in the words of Treasury's secretary, Mr Ted Evans, `openness about pay outcomes will signal to staff what is valued, provide discipline for fair management decisions consistent with Treasury's expressed values and give credibility to management processes'. On the other hand, we have the attitude of the head of the agency in the vanguard of the government's Public Service `reforms', Dr Boxall, Secretary to DOFA, who says: 
... what might suit Treasury is their business; what suits DOFA is to proceed in the way we have done over the last three years, which is not to make public details of AWAs; moreover we do not believe we have a legal basis to do it.
Perhaps he should seek some advice from Treasury's legal advisers. In relation to levels of remuneration in the SES, the committee draws attention to the fact that there is no agency with responsibility for gathering and holding information on the content of AWAs, remuneration rates being offered, aggregated information across agencies and the whole APS, or comparative information in relation to other public sectors and the private sector. Thus there is no means of evaluating the position of the APS and individual agencies, detecting service wide trends over time, or even evaluating the effectiveness of changes in the APS employment framework. The committee quite rightly draws attention to the fact that `public sector annual and financial reporting requirements have reduced in spite of legislative changes that increase the accountability of the private sector' and its concerns that `this indicates that APS accountability obligations are out of step with community standards'. They certainly are, and they are becoming increasingly so.
The committee reserves its sharpest criticisms for performance pay—not surprisingly, given its history of opposition to this form of financial incentive. It reveals the widely differing practices in the APS from DOFA, where 95 per cent of staff receive performance bonuses which are limited by whatever the individual negotiates and kept secret, to Defence, whose secretary, Dr Hawke, informed the committee, `I do not approve of performance pay and do not have it in the organisations that I am in.' The committee quite rightly questions the applicability of the private sector remuneration model, with its performance bonus and incentives, to the public sector and points out that, while private sector executives can be expected to show measurable outcomes for their endeavours against which their rewards can be assessed openly, the majority of public servants cannot. The committee's starting point is:
Parliament has a right to know how public money is being used. Covert payments have no place in the public service. Parliaments have to judge agencies not only against their achievement of outcomes but also how appropriately they have used public funds allocated to them to conduct their affairs to progress towards those outcomes. 
The irony is that this is what the government publicly espouses. The tragedy is that the reality is so far removed from the government's public posturing, and this report really exposes the gap. But the committee does not content itself with outing the government for its rank hypocrisy on Public Service employment matters. It has several recommendations to make, and recommendations that will help rectify the serious damage that is being done to the Public Service: that APS agencies make AWAs available on request, with appropriate deletions to protect privacy; that a service wide system of reporting on agreement making and remuneration is instituted; that annual and financial reporting requirements for the APS be at least as rigorous as those applying to the private sector; and that ideally individual performance pay bonus payments be discontinued in the APS but that if they are to be continued they be capped and disclosed in annual reports. 
I repeat: this is an excellent report. It merits very serious consideration by the government and by all APS agency heads. It will receive serious and sympathetic consideration by the opposition. I congratulate Senator George Campbell, the committee, the committee secretariat, the secretary, Ms Helen Donaldson, and all those involved in its production. (Time expired)

The committee does not seek to have public sector remuneration practices wound back in time to conform to past `one size fits all' solutions. The committee wants decisions and outcomes to be reported openly and fully—flexibility with accountability is achievable. 
Once again the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee has examined the payment of secret individual performance bonuses and again states its strong view that one-off individual performance bonuses have no place in a Public Service. The Finance and Public Administration Committee again recommends performance bonuses be discontinued. Acknowledging that this may not be accepted, the committee wishes to place on the record its recommendations for an APS that continues to pay bonuses under the following terms: first, bonus payments must be for outstanding individual or team service, not for competent performance as some agencies have determined; second, the committee is particularly opposed to uncapped bonus payments and recommends they be limited in the same way as those payable to departmental secretaries; and, third, there must be complete disclosure of all performance bonus payments, SES and non-SES, in annual reports.
If APS pay rates are not compensation for satisfactory, or competent, performance, this should be dealt with in an open and transparent review, not by creative supplementation schemes. More accountability for non-monetary remuneration is also required. The committee is aware that the current fashion is to focus on outcomes, not dwell on inputs. Nonetheless, the committee still believes that the cost and performance of the Public Service is a vital element in the effective delivery of outcomes and must be open to scrutiny. The parliament has enforced transparency on executive remuneration in the private sector; logically, it should require no less of the public sector. Public sector annual and financial reporting requirements have been reduced in spite of legislative changes that increase the accountability of the private sector. The committee is concerned that this indicates that APS accountability obligations are out of step with community standards. It is unacceptable that less disclosure is required of the Australian Public Service than the private sector. 
The committee's inquiry into APS employment matters is ongoing. Submissions and witnesses addressed a wide range of issues under the broad terms of reference, not only those issues of interest in this report. On behalf of my colleagues, I would like to thank all witnesses, especially agency heads representing small agencies and some of the larger departments, for their frank contributions—in particular, the Auditor-General, Mr Pat Barrett; the Public Service Commissioner, Ms Helen Williams; the Merit Protection Commissioner, Mr Alan Doolan; the Secretary to the Department of Defence, Dr Allan Hawke; the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Ted Evans; First Parliamentary Counsel, Ms Hilary Penfold; the Director of ScreenSound Australia, Mr Ron Brent; the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Mr Ron McLeod; the Secretary to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Dr Peter Shergold; and the Secretary to the Department of Finance and Administration, Dr Peter Boxall.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-11-02,"—This report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee is an excellent report. It is thorough and it is persuasive. It is a report that captures in a coherent, articulate way views and concerns that have been simmering in the Public Service for the last few years. I congratulate its authors. While the focus of this report may seem limited—the use of Australian workplace agreements in the Australian Public Service and related matters—it goes to the very core of the role of one of the key institutions in our system of government. The committee have brought together a comprehensive range of inputs. They have offered all interested parties an opportunity to put their point of view. They have faithfully reflected those views, and the way they have synthesised those views and drawn conclusions from them is, I believe, worthy of the highest commendation.
Let me make a couple of predictions in relation to this report. First, the government will bag it as the product of a partisan committee with a predetermined agenda. They will conveniently ignore the fact that it is a unanimous report endorsed by both opposition and government members of the committee. Secondly, this report will quickly become a bestseller in the APS among all ranks. Why? Because it articulates persuasively the doubts, concerns and convictions shared by so many public servants about the damage being done to the Public Service by this government's ideological obsessions. This report exposes the government's cant about greater accountability, flexibility and transparency in the APS. It exposes the yawning gap between the Public Service values espoused by the government—but, of course, actually supported by the opposition—and the government's practice of secrecy, obstruction and centralised control. 
The committee has singled out the lack of transparency of AWA processes and contents because it believes the APS approach to be in conflict with community values and expectations of an accountable Public Service. This criticism can be applied to all three areas dealt with by the committee: AWAs, levels of Public Service remuneration and performance pay. It is ridiculous and unacceptable that parliament does not have access to detailed information about AWAs across the Public Service, particularly when the government is so intent on forcing AWAs on public servants at all levels—nearly 7,000 at last count. According to the new Public Service Act, the APS is required to be openly accountable to the government, the parliament and the public. Yet this inquiry has demonstrated that this is patently not the case. The report notes:
The only agency with anything approaching a comprehensive database of AWAs is the Office of the Employment Advocate. In the committee's view, it is utterly unacceptable that the information held by this agency is not available to other arms of the APS ...
Let me quote the report again:
The framework for establishing and approving these individual agreements involves no external scrutiny to ensure consistency with the APS values or other ethical standards, or that the rewards to individuals are fair or within acceptable limits ... The committee views the secrecy surrounding AWAs in the APS as unnecessary and detrimental to the establishment of open relations between management and staff.
I share entirely the committee's lack of confidence that APS values are being given any regard in the highly confidential environment in which AWAs are being made and its view that the secrecy surrounding individual negotiations and setting of terms and conditions of employment promotes a perception of lack of equity and fairness. The case studies the committee draws attention to are stark examples of best and worst practice. On the one hand, we have the practice of the Treasury and the Department of the Senate of publishing details of AWAs in the belief that, in the words of Treasury's secretary, Mr Ted Evans, `openness about pay outcomes will signal to staff what is valued, provide discipline for fair management decisions consistent with Treasury's expressed values and give credibility to management processes'. On the other hand, we have the attitude of the head of the agency in the vanguard of the government's Public Service `reforms', Dr Boxall, Secretary to DOFA, who says: 
... what might suit Treasury is their business; what suits DOFA is to proceed in the way we have done over the last three years, which is not to make public details of AWAs; moreover we do not believe we have a legal basis to do it.
Perhaps he should seek some advice from Treasury's legal advisers. In relation to levels of remuneration in the SES, the committee draws attention to the fact that there is no agency with responsibility for gathering and holding information on the content of AWAs, remuneration rates being offered, aggregated information across agencies and the whole APS, or comparative information in relation to other public sectors and the private sector. Thus there is no means of evaluating the position of the APS and individual agencies, detecting service wide trends over time, or even evaluating the effectiveness of changes in the APS employment framework. The committee quite rightly draws attention to the fact that `public sector annual and financial reporting requirements have reduced in spite of legislative changes that increase the accountability of the private sector' and its concerns that `this indicates that APS accountability obligations are out of step with community standards'. They certainly are, and they are becoming increasingly so.
The committee reserves its sharpest criticisms for performance pay—not surprisingly, given its history of opposition to this form of financial incentive. It reveals the widely differing practices in the APS from DOFA, where 95 per cent of staff receive performance bonuses which are limited by whatever the individual negotiates and kept secret, to Defence, whose secretary, Dr Hawke, informed the committee, `I do not approve of performance pay and do not have it in the organisations that I am in.' The committee quite rightly questions the applicability of the private sector remuneration model, with its performance bonus and incentives, to the public sector and points out that, while private sector executives can be expected to show measurable outcomes for their endeavours against which their rewards can be assessed openly, the majority of public servants cannot. The committee's starting point is:
Parliament has a right to know how public money is being used. Covert payments have no place in the public service. Parliaments have to judge agencies not only against their achievement of outcomes but also how appropriately they have used public funds allocated to them to conduct their affairs to progress towards those outcomes. 
The irony is that this is what the government publicly espouses. The tragedy is that the reality is so far removed from the government's public posturing, and this report really exposes the gap. But the committee does not content itself with outing the government for its rank hypocrisy on Public Service employment matters. It has several recommendations to make, and recommendations that will help rectify the serious damage that is being done to the Public Service: that APS agencies make AWAs available on request, with appropriate deletions to protect privacy; that a service wide system of reporting on agreement making and remuneration is instituted; that annual and financial reporting requirements for the APS be at least as rigorous as those applying to the private sector; and that ideally individual performance pay bonus payments be discontinued in the APS but that if they are to be continued they be capped and disclosed in annual reports. 
I repeat: this is an excellent report. It merits very serious consideration by the government and by all APS agency heads. It will receive serious and sympathetic consideration by the opposition. I congratulate Senator George Campbell, the committee, the committee secretariat, the secretary, Ms Helen Donaldson, and all those involved in its production. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,19,2,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
As I am taking note of 1999-2000 annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation my colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald may like to continue his speech after me, it was so good. Some of us watched the Sunday program last weekend with some interest because it was devoted absolutely to the ABC. I thought it was a bit of a hatchet job by Channel 9. I was even upset for Senator Alston at one stage, who was interviewed on the program. One of the techniques in an interview is to do what they call a noddy—that is when the camera goes behind the interview and you nod your head a couple of times and they splice it in. On this occasion they left Senator Alston with the interspersed question nodding for 30 to 40 seconds looking like an absolute goose. It was not his fault; he was cooperating. I must say I do not agree with that as a technique used by current affairs programs.
I found it interesting that some of the glitterati of conservatism were interviewed there, and didn't they come up short? First of all we had Professor Judith Sloan interviewed. First tough question and what happens? She walks out. She said, `Don't ask me any more questions,' and then disappeared to the back of the room trembling, telling them to turn the camera off. Where is the courage of this board member, the person who year in and year out wrote these nasty little articles on labour market reform telling everyone else how to behave from the pristine halls of a university? That is the sort of quality, apparently, we have on the board. First shot of the grapeshot and she disappeared and would not answer questions. I would not mind it if it did not contrast so much with her bitter denunciation of workers, unions and everything else that stands for decency in this country. It was a pathetic performance. 
We also had interviewed that other champion, that other sycophant of the Liberal Party, Christopher Pearson from South Australia. He writes for the Financial Review every Monday and 90 per cent of the time he gets the party line right for the Liberal Party. The other 10 per cent of the time he is so ill-informed that he does not get it right. Some journalist in this morning's paper wrote that he looked like Toad from Toad Hall. I am not going to repeat that. Have a good look at me, I am not going to cast aspersions on anyone. But again here is someone who pretends to be an intellectual of the Right. Yet the first time he got a tough question we had to wait 30 or 40 seconds for him to even vocalised one word, and even then he could not answer the questions. So it was a very poor performance by those who try to defend the government's or the board's position on Australian broadcasting.
The third character there was Mr Michael Kroger. I was one of the few on the Labor side who did not criticise Mr Kroger's appointment to the board, because I think it is quite often valuable to have a political activist, especially one who has the same opinions as a conservative government, there to explain to the board who all the characters are around the place and on occasions—and I am sure Michael Kroger would do this—go and argue to the government what the ABC board's case is. It is not wrong to have a Michael Kroger on the board, although I did notice he was a bit too smart to be interviewed by Channel 9 for this particular program.
Even though it was a hatchet job, certain issues were raised on that Sunday program, especially about the travelling habits of the new managing director and the large party they took to the European hot spots of media and the sorts of conditions—laying out such things as redundancies and golden handshakes. If that is true, it really does throw the spotlight on the board. It is one thing to say you are going to rationalise or, as Senator Macdonald said, get the same result with less resources, as long as we can be satisfied that those resources are being well spent. If they are being thrown away on hush money, redundancies, extra salaries and more top end positions, we will not be convinced that Mr Shier's reforms are in fact going to work. That Sunday program at least raised a lot of those issues. I repeat that I was not totally happy because I think it was very one-sided. The performances of the glitterati of the Right—how pathetic were they; Professor Sloan, no longer at the university, on all these company boards—folded the first time a tough question came.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I wish to make a couple of comments on the ABC that I was unable to earlier in the general business debate. I wish to raise what I regard as an extremely concerning issue, but before I do I briefly turn to the issue of the ABC and what is happening. I noticed with some trepidation that the National Party's Senator Boswell has invited Jonathan Shier to regional Australia. I think that is a good initiative and I congratulate both Senator Boswell and Mr Shier for accepting his invitation. But I warn Senator Boswell that the last time a major CEO went out to regional Australia, Dr Ziggy Switkowski, we lost 10,000 from Telstra. So I would be pretty careful where I took Mr Shier if I were Senator Boswell. But I do want to congratulate him for that initiative.
As the regional services shadow minister I do, not surprisingly, a lot of regional media, particularly ABC media. There are several critical issues at the moment in regional Australia, particularly petrol, GST, roads, Telstra and so on. In my conversations over the last three to four months with ABC journalists based in regional Australia—who I think do a terrific job—they have told me that they are being approached by members of the coalition in marginal seats. They are being told that these members are unhappy with the way that these stories are being presented, and on many occasions and with increasing frequency—and this is extremely serious—they are being threatened. There is no other way to state this other than to say it: the way they are being threatened is to be told that if they do not pull their heads in—or words to that effect, although I suspect not quite so polite—then the coalition member concerned would get onto their `mates on the ABC board', some of whom Senator Ray referred to, or their mates in the management of the ABC and so on.  
This is an extremely serious allegation, and I have desisted from raising it in the parliament so far, because these journalists have asked me not to. I will not name the members concerned, not for their sake but because that would identify the journalists. People from any political party who do this sort of thing are despicable cowards. It is outrageous that people, particularly certain coalition backbenchers, are doing this. I raised this with Mr Shier in a meeting he had with Labor Party members recently. He evidenced some surprise and responded in what I regard as a fairly reasonable way. He undertook to the Labor Party that he would write to all the regional journalists to assure them that the section of the ABC charter dealing with independence was inalienable and that, if any such activity or behaviour was evidenced by any member of any political party as we move into an election cycle, those journalists were to feel free to contact him or ABC management. I hope Mr Shier does do that. He has given an undertaking to the Labor Party to do that. We are eclectic about this. We are saying that this behaviour is unacceptable in any politician, not simply coalition members. I have to say, though, that my experience talking to ABC journalists indicates that they have been coalition members, but that is not exclusive—I am sure there have been people from the Labor Party in the past. This behaviour is unacceptable. I welcome Mr Shier's commitment to action and I say to the Senate that we on this side of politics will be monitoring to ensure that this sort of behaviour stops. If there is a repeat of this monstering and bullying of regional ABC journalists we will be raising it in the parliament, in the Senate, with Mr Shier and, obviously, with Minister Alston.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2000-11-02,"—In this motion to take note of the ABC report I wish to make a point that I was about to make in the general business debate, and that is that certain elements within the ABC realise that a cut in the budget for regional radio or news and current affairs is particularly powerful politics from their point of view. That was first clear to me in the 1997 debate about potential cuts to the ABC budget and also now. They know that it will create a howl of protest from all of us who live in and represent regional areas. This happened, of course, when the ABC had the budget cuts in 1997 and regional radio stations—about 45 of them at that time—were threatened. In my experience, regional ABC radio stations already operate on a shoestring. Those of us who deal with those stations are very aware that the person on air is frequently the person who answers the phone and who makes the coffee out the back. There is no fat in the regional ABC stations as such. They have a budget of around $1 million a year. It seems to me that we get very good value for money.
At the same time, regional radio stations continue to provide wonderful community interaction. I cannot say that I agree with all they do, with their humour or with their preoccupation at certain times with talkback radio. Talkback on the ABC tends not to be talkback in the way we understand it. It tends to be a 60-second gripe session when very self-interested, uninformed people have the capacity to make outlandish statements. The ABC announcer is generally so well mannered that they say, `Is that so?' But that is a role they play and a decision they make. My own local ABC station in Tamworth, the New England North West, has one of the largest footprints, in terms of the number of listeners it covers, in the country and it is a top example. It is a good, balanced station and it provides a wonderful community service. I do not think anybody would disagree with that. We could not live without it, and all the staff need to be congratulated.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title>,Documents,21,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-11-02,"—I would like to make a short contribution in response to Senator Ray. It is always hard to follow Senator Ray because of the bitterness and bile, but I feel I must stand and defend Professor Sloan. I did not see the interview, but to criticise her personally on her performance in an interview on television is unjustified, especially for someone with such a good name. The truth behind it all is that Professor Sloan has written many articles and was at the forefront of reform with regard to industrial relations. For many years she wrote about a more flexible labour market, and this government did pick up most of her ideas. I think she even acted in an advisory capacity to this government, and that is really what is behind Senator Ray's attack. It has nothing to do with her ability or capabilities to go onto the board of the ABC. I think he should have kept to that.  
But, as I say, I did not see the Sunday program, although unquestionably we have all heard about it. I must say I did see the Four Corners program last Monday. Maybe we cannot say that the ABC is as biased as Senator Carr would have us think. We picked certain incidents, Senator Carr, over time, which we are perfectly justified in doing. I for one have never heard anyone in the government say that the ABC overall, as a culture, is biased. Unquestionably there have been reports within their current affairs division which we are entitled to complain about. But I am told that the Sunday program made another error, which I would like to correct. It is in regard to their pushing the point ad infinitum that certain parts of the ABC—namely, their web site—would be privatised. Even though it was denied by this government, the Channel 9 program continued to press that point. There is absolutely no plan for any part of the ABC to be privatised, nor has this government, as Senator Alston has said in question time many times, any influence over that. It is the role of the board to take those sorts of decisions, and there is no such plan.
As my colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald rightly said, the National Party has spoken to the new managing director. He made a point about current affairs, and I think it is a worthy point to make. When the cuts first were announced in the 1996 budget, every government department had to face cuts of around 10 per cent, and the ABC was no different. The managing director's point was that, within the ABC, every department took cuts except current affairs. The 7.30 Report, the news services and the gallery up here took no cuts at all when the first round of cuts were introduced. The managing director made the point that that meant other areas of the ABC took heavier cuts—some 13 per cent and some 15 per cent. But current affairs was not affected at all in the first round of cuts. So in many respects they are due for a cut. He suggested—in very broad terms, I will admit—that no show such as the 7.30 Report will be axed, but internal savings can be found. That is the commitment he made.
—You rolled over.
—I did not roll over. The area the National Party is most concerned about is the 48 regional radio stations. To that end, we have a commitment: they have been quarantined from further cuts.
—Don't worry about anyone else; just look after your own. Just look after the regional ones—don't worry about anyone else!
—Senator Ray obviously has never been out into the regions, otherwise he would know the importance of these regional radio stations to the rural and regional areas. They will be quarantined from cuts. Unquestionably, further savings can be found within—you can always do better, and I think that is the broad philosophy of the new managing director. I do not know why there is this sudden criticism of the ABC coming from the opposition. The ABC happens to be much loved by all Australians, and they are doing very well. Look at their performance in the area of sport when they covered the Paralympics.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-11-02,"—I rise to speak on the same matter, the motion to take note of the ABC report. Obviously Senator McGauran did not listen to the general business item today which was moved by the Labor Party in regard to the ABC. This is an opportune time to remind him. The motion reads:
That the Senate, noting the charter of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) as Australia's national broadcaster: 
	(a)	calls on the Board of the ABC to:
	(i)	maintain its commitment to news and current affairs programming, and
	(ii)	resist any political interference by the Government in its decision-making processes and deliberations; and
	(b)	calls on the Managing Director of the ABC, Mr Shier, to provide to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee for its estimates hearings:
	(i)	a complete and detailed account of his organ-isa-tional restructure, and
	(ii)	a detailed account of his budgetary reallo-cations within the ABC.
What we have heard expressed throughout this afternoon quite clearly demonstrates the deep antipathy of this government to the ABC. We are reminded that Senator Alston in opposition maintained his deep hostility. We had put to us just a few moments ago that there was no evidence that anyone had said that the ABC was biased. You have built your political careers on that mythology. Again and again the evidence points to your preoccupation with this notion about the ABC.
—I like the ABC.
—You like it in so far as it supports just the regional radio stations where you can run out your lines. When you move out of your hotels in Collins Street and go out to Gippsland to look at the former estates of the great McGauran family, you want to run out a bit of a press release to ABC regional radio. That is your idea of what the ABC should be about.
The truth of the matter is, however, that the National Party have demonstrated yet again how completely incompetent and ineffectual they are as a political force in this country. You said at the beginning of the week that, when Mr Shier turned up with his smoke and mirrors routine, you were going to `stand firm'. What was the first wall to crumble? The National Party. They rolled over—the great doormats of this coalition. Their role in politics is to roll over. `Roll me over in the clover McGauran' is what we ought to say about this senator. What it also proves is the old adage: you cannot put brains into a statue. That is exactly the problem with the National Party: they are a bunch of statues trying to represent themselves as the people's friends from the bush. The truth of the matter can clearly be demonstrated to be something else. The privatisation proposals have not been rejected. On the contrary: this minister has said repeatedly that there is nothing in the ABC charter or the current act, in his opinion, that would prevent privatisation—the structural separation of the ABC. That is what he has been saying all week. The problem is that not only are they statues—and you cannot put brains into a statue—they are also incredibly deaf. They cannot understand the most simple political message that their masters are delivering to them. That is why you are so hopeless at representing the people that you claim to represent. You are not capable of understanding the most basic political message, and the message is that you are being shafted. You do not understand that.
What you are seeing now is a new management structure put into the ABC to do the things that this government has said for many years it was going to do. It said that it believes the ABC was biased, that the news and current affairs was too much—there was too much news and current affairs; we want to tone all that down! Too much economics! What we need is more business news; we need more participation from the big end of town—and, apparently, from a very small end of town, from the McGauran family in regional radio in Victoria!
—They used to be a big business.
—They used to be a very big business. They used run half of Gippsland. They no longer do that.
—It's a small business these days.
—It is a very small business. Of course, the real problem here is the National Party have not understood the political agenda of their political masters, and that is essentially to wind back the ABC. In an election year you ought to understand that more acutely than you do. Their intention is essentially to wind it back and make sure that the ABC is irrelevant, to marginalise it and to pursue these extraordinary campaigns. I am reminded yet again of when in 1997 two senators here—Senator Coonan and Senator Eggleston—ran out those notes from the Prime Minister's office attacking the ABC, Kerry O'Brien. Remember at the estimates? You ought to just remember the more recent history of your attempts to be part of a campaign to actually denigrate the ABC. 
—Accountability. A bit of accountability.
—Your basic problem, Senator McGauran, is that unfortunately you just do not have the political brains to know what is actually going on.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title>,Documents,21,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-11-02,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I want to speak on the same matter.
 (Senator Calvert)—Senator Conroy, I would remind you that we are discussing the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, not the McGauran family.
—Certainly, Mr Acting Deputy President. Like Senator Carr and many before me tonight, I rise to speak about the longest running political vendetta in this country's history. For seven years now this conservative mob over the other side have been out to get Kerry O'Brien. They have never forgiven Kerry O'Brien for what they perceived was a biased interview in one of the debates in 1993 with Paul Keating. That is at the heart and soul of this mob's attempts to destroy the integrity of the ABC. Can anyone seriously believe that they are genuine in saying, `We're not really trying to attack the news and current affairs'? They have been out to get Kerry O'Brien since 1993.
They vetoed Kerry O'Brien from being the moderator in the 1996 federal election debates. In 1998 they took it off the ABC. They refused to have the ABC; they refused to have Kerry O'Brien. This is the longest running vendetta in Australian political history—publicly out to get one individual. They finally found the tools. They stacked the board with their mates. They stacked the board with people who understand what their mission is—to deliver on this vindictive vendetta. The ABC's charter is about delivering news and current affairs, and the coalition have set out to deliver silence. They do not want the scrutiny of an independent broadcaster. They like to be able to call up the Kerrys—Packer and Stokes—and say, `Here's what we want you to do for us, and here is where we'll roll over, and we'll give you digital TV for free, and we'll give you as much as we can.'
I say to you, Senator Mason and Senator McGauran: you have short memories. We recently had a similar state government that followed the same sort of practice, the Kennett government. It set out to vilify and destroy any outlet that criticised it. It destroyed the Sunday Age. It destroyed the Age as best it could. Senator McGauran, you have many times come into this chamber and attacked the Age. It nobbled Today Tonight. It nobbled the local 7.30 Report. Jeff Kennett said, `No minister of mine will go on the ABC's 7.30 Report.' Did the voters reward Jeff Kennett for this? They did not. The voters of Benalla did not thank Jeff Kennett for this behaviour. Senator McGauran, you have a short memory if you think this will go down well, because people know what it is about. They know you are trying to silence genuine discussion.
You may ask, `What is Senator Conroy doing on his feet?' The 7.30 Report has never been kind to me personally. I have had two 7.30 Reports done about me, and they certainly were not flattering portrayals in the eyes of the journalist who was doing them.
—I could not agree with you more, Senator Bartlett—how could they do an unflattering portrayal of me? But they did. They were prepared to be independent and they had a go at me. Even though I was unhappy about it and the programs did not even bother to contact me once to say, `By the way, we are going to do a job on you tonight,' that is fair game in politics. You get the good with the bad. But you lot are pursuing a vindictive short-sighted attack on someone you hate. You put your mates in there to get him, and you have set out to wind up the 7.30 Report. That is what you want. How far are you prepared to go to achieve your vindictive and small-minded goals? What you guys have been up to here is an outrage. Can I say that I am not one who actually watched the Sunday program and thought there was killer evidence. Unlike some of my colleagues, I thought that the Sunday report was a lot of talk and not enough delivery for its allegations. I am not one who is sitting there and signing up to say some of the things that were said. But I think that you guys should have a look at yourselves. 
—A very poor performance by Judith Sloan.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-02,"—This is an important report. There was some debate on this when it was tabled in this chamber yesterday. My colleague Senator Stott Despoja and I, who were the two signatories from the Democrats on this report, have some additional comments in here that I think set out some important matters. They are not exhaustive, but they highlight some of the key issues for the Democrats. In her contribution yesterday Senator Stott Despoja expanded further on those.
I think it is appropriate to draw to the Senate's and the public's attention a couple of other areas of this very important issue. Yesterday, when the report was tabled, we had spray from Senator Knowles—who is always taking the government line inflexibly, without diverting a millimetre—that somehow or other it was irresponsible of the Senate to take time to do this report and to take time to put forward amendments. That is an unfortunate approach of saying, `All the state governments have agreed with this. We have put all this time into it. You should just roll over and let us do it.' This is a continuation of the undermining of the role and importance of the parliamentary process.
Some of the issues that were raised were incredibly important and very significant to many people in the community. But unfortunately there is a minority report from government senators—something they are quite entitled to do obviously; I do not have a problem with that—that specifically says in a couple of places `the government believe'. It does not say `we believe' or `government senators on the committee believe'. That is the state Senate committee reports are starting to get to—we are actually just getting the government inserting their position.
There is one issue here which I find quite sad actually in terms of the lack of consideration given. A key issue is whether or not there should be full cost recovery. The government's policy is that the Gene Technology Regulator should meet all its operating expenses by charging fees for people that apply for use of gene technology to get licences. It was raised repeatedly throughout the inquiry, by people who are both positive and negative about gene technology—by people from large and small industry groups, that this would pose a real danger of the regulator ending up being captured by the industry and of only the largest and most well resourced operators, businesses and corporations being able to afford to use the regulatory system that is put in place. They were very serious concerns. 
The sole response from government senators was that, `while government senators recognise that there is a degree of anxiety about the issue of cost recovery, the policy is 100 per cent cost recovery'. That is a great argument—it really convinced me! It shows the unfortunate lack of listening to the serious concerns about this issue in the community from people who are supportive of it. As the Democrats have said a number of times, we are very supportive of developing and encouraging innovative research, but it has to be done with protection and in a precautionary way, and done in a way that accepts and acknowledges the concerns of the community. Some people who are involved in this matter and who are supportive of gene technology in food and other areas are starting to recognise this, including some of the big industry players—that is, that they have played it really badly in terms of convincing the community and making it aware of this technology.
Everyone, when they first hear about this technology, has a natural cautionary feeling about it. It feels like it might be dangerous. That is quite a reasonable fear. If it is not done properly, it will be dangerous—it could be catastrophic. If it is done properly, there could be great opportunities. The attitude is: `We know what we are doing; we have sorted it all out'—through the usual process of compromise and arm wrestling that you get between state and federal governments when they work out all the things—and `We have come up with a model and therefore we are not going to listen to anybody anymore.' All that attitude is going to do is reinforce community concerns. I really urge the government to take a more open-minded approach than their senators did in this committee report.
Issues such as the precautionary principle are crucial to the Democrats. The object of the bill is to protect the health and safety of people and to protect environment by identifying risks posed by, or resulting from, gene technology and managing those risks through regulating certain dealings with GMOs. The Democrats support these objectives, but we believe that stipulation in regulation of relating principles is required to adequately ensure the protection of public health and safety, and the environment. We maintain that environmental protection and public health and safety are synonymous. You cannot set them up as conflicting objectives. So the precautionary principle really must be reflected in the objectives and licensing provisions of the bill.
The differing forms of the precautionary principle adopted around the world and in various legal theory also impact on the scope of the principles application, with some conventions and statements limited to toxic substances control, while others include any government policy with a potential to cause environmental degradation. Epidemiologist and biochemist Dr Judy Carmen, of the Public Health Association of Australia, commented on the current use of caution and a precautionary approach and the approval of genetically modified food products by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in an interview with the Age. She stated that the precautionary principle could best be described as `unsafe until proven to be safe'. It has been around for centuries to guide us in conditions of uncertainty, yet the food authority has officially adopted the opposite approach—that is, they permit 18.7 million Australians to eat GM foods based on a safe until proven unsafe philosophy.
It is an answer, I should remind senators, that will continue even if this bill is passed unamended, which hopefully it will not be. We will continue to be in that position of overseeing, of regulating and of monitoring genetically modified organisms in that area of food. The Democrats believe that the precautionary principle is crucial. We question strongly the adequacy of the regulatory system that is stipulated by this legislation and related bills to effectively review and access declarations by parties with commercial interests in the technology. 
A number of other issues that are raised in the report are worth reading, and I encourage anybody who is actually concerned about this issue and interested from whatever perspective to do so. This is one of those areas where you can get incredibly passionate defences of the technology from expert scientists and you can get other expert scientists to give you an equally passionate ringing of alarm bells about it, which obviously put legislators like us in a very challenging position. But it also means that you have to proceed with caution, as the report suggests. A number of issues that the Democrats have flagged in our statements include our support for the ability of state governments to opt out of gene organisms, if they so desire.
We have also raised issues such as animal welfare regulations and legislation. The majority report notes that existing codes of practice under the National Health and Medical Research Council are in place to address national welfare, and it is good that they are. I have personal concerns about how adequate those codes of practice are. I also note that they are just codes of practice; they are not enforceable. The Democrats believe that, if we are going to recognise proper animal welfare standards in any sort of research as an issue, as I think all of us would do—and obviously some parts of genetic research and technology development involve the use of animals—then we need to make sure that animal welfare standards are properly recognised as part of any activity like that and recognise that reliance on codes of practice that do not have any enforceability is problematic.
The overall issue of the regulation of biosafety is also an important one. The Cartagena biosafety protocol of the international biodiversity convention is something that has been focused on a little bit and was raised in the process of the committee inquiry, which was a broader one than just the Gene Technology Bill. It looked at broader issues of community concern. I know that the Treaties Committee, which I am also a member of, is looking further at this protocol at the moment. It is amazing that, when people try to put in place protective mechanisms internationally that might provide a better opportunity for environmental safety issues—and in this case the transboundary movements of living modified organisms, such as those contained in pharmaceuticals—then somehow or other this is seen as a potential impediment to free trade and a potential impediment to the movement of goods. This is presented as an appalling interference in such a basic principle and an interference in all the things that get pulled out about national sovereignty, et cetera, but as soon as you try to look at trade issues through the World Trade Organisation and try to ensure that it operates in a way that protects the environment rather than encourages the destruction of the environment, then again you get the argument that, somehow or other, we have to take the so-called purist approach to international agreements and let it only deal with economics.
I refer people again to the speech that Anita Roddick gave at the Press Club yesterday about responsibilities of citizens and corporations in particular to look beyond just pure economic value for everything. This gene technology issue is another area where we must make sure that the economic opportunities and the economic forces that are driving it are not allowed to get out of control and that other issues, such as public health and safety, environmental protection and social justice issues, are not overridden. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-02,"—This is an important report. There was some debate on this when it was tabled in this chamber yesterday. My colleague Senator Stott Despoja and I, who were the two signatories from the Democrats on this report, have some additional comments in here that I think set out some important matters. They are not exhaustive, but they highlight some of the key issues for the Democrats. In her contribution yesterday Senator Stott Despoja expanded further on those.
I think it is appropriate to draw to the Senate's and the public's attention a couple of other areas of this very important issue. Yesterday, when the report was tabled, we had spray from Senator Knowles—who is always taking the government line inflexibly, without diverting a millimetre—that somehow or other it was irresponsible of the Senate to take time to do this report and to take time to put forward amendments.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2000-11-02,"—In recent weeks, I have been alarmed by reports in the Sydney and Hobart press detailing the objectionable actions of certain members of the New South Wales state parliament. The actions, which have quite rightly caught the attention of the media, are those whereby some sitting members of the New South Wales parliament are claiming retirement benefits even though they are still members of the parliament and actively engaged as such. I personally believe that this is far from being moral or ethical behaviour, although I understand it is alleged to be quite legal. The issue was brought to the public's attention when a leaked report from the New South Wales Government Actuary, Mr Peter Gerrard, was obtained by the— 
—Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Normally, I would not have to do this to Senator Watson—and I seek your ruling on it—but I understand that it is contrary to the standing orders to reflect upon the integrity of a member of this parliament or another member of parliament. I believe Senator Watson's remarks so far are contrary to that standing order.
—On that point of order, Madam Chair, I do not think Senator Watson has said anything that would draw him to question particular members of parliament and name members of parliament. It seems that very often in this chamber other members of parliament in other jurisdictions are mentioned. Certainly we would not want to mention Queensland members of parliament today particularly. I do not think Senator Watson has, and I would urge you to dismiss the point of order.
 (Senator Crowley)—The point of order is well taken as a point of order, but I cannot say that it applies in this particular case. Senator Watson, I will listen very carefully because I was not able to catch everything you said. If you could take account of that caution and continue your remarks.
—Yes, indeed. I will be most careful. I am looking at the standing orders of the Senate and I refer to rules of debate, 193, and I do not believe I am using offensive words against the house of parliament but believe I am drawing attention to a series of actions which I think are not acceptable in relation to a superannuation matter which is very close to my heart. I am now quoting from a leaked report from the Government Actuary, Mr Peter Gerrard. That report incidentally was not tabled in the New South Wales parliament. Mr Gerrard described the double-dipping scheme as `undesirable' and strongly recommended that it be reviewed, and I strongly agree with him on both counts. I therefore call on the New South Wales government as a matter of urgency to change the trust deed of the scheme or, if required, have the legislation amended to ensure that this outrageous entitlement be outlawed.
We had one particular member of parliament who after turning 65 years of age, even though he was still in full-time employment, admitted in the press that he was collecting a pension in addition to his salary as a state parliamentarian. The first press story noted that actually five New South Wales members of parliament had acted on this loophole in the laws. Then it was reported last week that another member of parliament actually admitted having applied for and accepted a lump sum under the scheme. In fact, he apparently received hundreds of thousands of dollars in this case not as a pension, in addition to his salary, but as a lump sum after paying only a small proportion of that into the scheme himself. The rate of tax applicable could have been as low as 10 cents in the dollar, and under the rules of the scheme there is no longer a requirement to make any further payment.
It appears that members of a number of parties have taken advantage of this so-called loophole. It is very difficult to reconcile the actions of these people with any concept of moral or ethical public service.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I am reluctant to rise on a point of order against Senator Watson, who usually takes a very high moral position in most of the contributions he makes in this house. Senator Watson is clearly contravening 193(3), which states:
. . . .all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.
Given that those individuals have been named in the media and people would properly draw the conclusion that those are the individuals Senator Watson has referred to, Senator Watson is clearly in contravention of the rules of debate, 193(3). I ask you to rule accordingly.
—On the point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President, Senator Watson quite clearly has not named any member of any parliament. If Senator George Campbell knows someone that that might refer to, that is a matter for Senator George Campbell. I certainly have no idea who Senator Watson is talking about and neither would anyone else in this chamber and, accordingly, it is certainly not relevant under standing order 193. 
—Further to the point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President, the purpose of the rules of debate in standing order 193 is to look at conduct that might be considered to be highly disorderly. To actually refer to Senator Watson as being highly disorderly is approaching high farce with the way in which he has approached the debate this evening, because he started his remarks by saying that he made no allegation, no imputation at all, of anything being illegal and what in fact he was referring to is a published report. He appears to be speaking within the confines of that report, and doing it in a totally appropriate way. If we in this place cannot discuss a report in the way in which Senator Watson is approaching it, I just do not know what is going to happen to free speech in this country because, certainly, the way he has approached it does not, in any way, convene 193, which is directed specifically at offensive behaviour, offensive words, and imputations against individuals. That cannot be said to be the case here.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, it was in respect of 193(3) that I made the original point of order.
—But you've been ruled against.
—I will take that interjection. If you listen to the comments from the Chair, it was made very clear that the Chair would listen very carefully to what was said further by Senator Watson.
—Then you should have no trouble with it.
—I am taking a point of order and I will continue with it. My concern, and what I believe the concern of the chamber should be, is the reference in the standing orders to:
... imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers ...
The standing orders do not require, as I read them, that an individual be named. In my view, this is at the stage where there has been an imputation of an improper motive against members of the New South Wales parliament. The fact that Senator Watson said that it is not illegal or that they are not doing anything wrong strengthens the point I am making. He said that, then went on nevertheless to clearly make an improper imputation against those members. I would have no difficulty if he were commenting on the scheme and its operation without reflecting upon the members of the New South Wales parliament.
—Having listened to the argument, I think Senator George Campbell and Senator Forshaw are right. There is an imputation here and, Senator Watson, you are, according to the standing orders, out of order where there is a reference to members of another house or another parliament. As Senator Forshaw has said, you may properly speak about the scheme but not mention members or members of another house. As everybody has said, you are the person least likely to be described as disorderly—which is sometimes taken to mean something more than just being outside standing orders—but I do draw your attention to the fact that, at this stage, if you refer to the people involved or to the people as representatives of the chamber, you are out of order.
—I thank you for your ruling but, when the first point of order was raised, I was merely agreeing with a matter in relation to the scheme that was raised by the actuary in his comments. All I said was that I agreed with his comments.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Watson has the floor. Senator Watson, I take your point. By way of further clarification, I agree that, while you are speaking of the scheme, there is no offence against the standing orders. When you refer to members or representatives of another chamber or another parliament, there is.
—Thank you. I will quote the chairman of the New South Wales scheme's trustees, Mr Paul Whelan. He believed that it was acceptable because it was legal. I see no offence in that. But what I am concerned about is that, over the years, there has been a great deal of public criticism about the level of retirement benefits paid to some members of parliament in particular circumstances. Much of this criticism has been based on the changing nature of the workplace, where very few Australians now have the type of security or the longevity of employment of earlier years. Many would say that those who leave parliamentary life with much of their working lives still ahead of them should share conditions more closely related to those experienced by other working Australians. This is the problem with the scheme that is operating in New South Wales: it does not line up with what Australians and perhaps parliaments expect of their members. It is incumbent on the trustees to get this matter right and to put it more in tune with community standards than is the case now. We all know that reforms in this area must reflect the changing circumstances in this area, and I draw the Senate's attention to a report of the Senate select committee that I chair, which made a number of recommendations.  
It is important that the scheme is not perceived to have benefits that are outside what people consider to be the normal accepted practice. I have concerns that the scheme currently operating in the New South Wales parliament is perhaps exceedingly generous, and that naturally incurs the ire of the ordinary person. Other members of parliament who work under less generous schemes carry some of that stigma. The scheme as such is deemed by the authorities quoted so far as being legal, but that does not mean that there is not a case for the trustees or the Premier to bring about a change to bring it more into line with community accepted standards so that the parliamentarians will not be brought into disrepute. I feel for those parliamentarians in New South Wales who have not taken advantage of this sort of situation and I give credit to them. We have to be very careful about a cynical public in relation to parliamentarian entitlements and, therefore, I take this opportunity to express my desire that the New South Wales parliament, having so many examples before it now, does act very quickly to expedite the situation. The New South Wales government must move immediately to change this entitlement, which is certainly outside community norms in this more enlightened era in which we live today. I thank the Senate.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. You have ruled that Senator Watson, without mentioning anyone but talking about what is obviously a rort in the New South Wales parliament, was making imputations about a member of another parliament. Yet, for two weeks now in both chambers here those sorts of imputations have been made against a member of the House of Representatives. It has gone on and on without interruption from either Presiding Officer. Madam Acting Deputy President, I wonder if we could ask you by way of precedent to have your ruling checked, and perhaps you could provide a written indication of why you have made this ruling in relation to what Senator Watson said so carefully, so appropriately, when the Presiding Officers have allowed a member of the House of Representatives to be impugned with impunity over the last two weeks?
 (Senator Crowley)—Senator Macdonald, I certainly will take note of what you have asked, and I will seek some clarification from Madam President's office as to whether there is anything further to add. As for my decision about Senator Watson, I think the Hansard will reveal that he referred to certain members behaving immorally, and that does contravene the standing orders.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>New South Wales Members of Parliament: Superannuation</title>,Adjournment,23,1,speech
