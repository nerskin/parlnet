"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I note before the debate gets under way on this amendment that Senator Cook referred to a potential amendment that Joel Fitzgibbon was suggesting we may move. However, it has been announced by the government—good sense prevails on their side of the chamber—that they have decided to take up Mr Fitzgibbon's ideas, which is welcomed by the opposition. We would like to see more of the government recognising the error of their ways and adopting Mr Fitzgibbon's suggestions. So we welcome that. But we have had this debate before—
—Are they the amendments circulated?
—We are just dealing with the first one. We are dealing at this stage with the disclosure of the GST on receipts, which I understand has been amended. 
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order! Senator Conroy, it is a bit hard to speak to an amendment if you have not already moved one. 
—I would be happy to move that amendment.
—Is it No. 1?
—No. 1, the disclosure of GST on receipts, which has been circula-ted, I understand. With the other ones I am like Senator Murray; I am not sure if they have been circulated yet. People are shaking their heads, so I am assuming that we are just on this one for the moment. It is disappointing that this government continues to refuse to allow Australian consumers to see the GST clearly on dockets. Some stores have, it is true, now decided to ignore the government's requests and directives. They intend to dis-close the GST in certain ways on the dock-ets. But it is no thanks to this government. 
It is not because this government wants true and frank disclosure on the impact of the GST. We have seen this government defeat this amendment at least three times and attempt to use the ACCC to force companies not to show the true impact of the GST. This government is running scared. It is running scared and hiding behind a $420 million—that is just the meter to date—and increasing propaganda exercise to try to convince ordinary Australians that this tax is good for the country and that this tax is good for them.
—Sena-tor Conroy, I am sorry to interrupt but are you moving amendment No. 1 dealing with taxable supply in relation to the GST act?
—That is not my first amendment.
—That is amendment No. 1 on the running sheet we have—1804.
—I apologise. I am mov-ing No. 1(b), which is `to assist in minimising price exploitation when a corporation supp-lies a consumer with a receipt or dock-et'. I thought that was No. 1(a) and the only one that had been circulated.
—To make life easier, perhaps you could move Nos 1 to 4 and speak to them generally and circulate the other amendments at a later date. Is leave granted? Leave is granted. 
—Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I will take your advice. I move: 
(1)	Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 7), after item 1, insert:
1A  Section 75AT
Insert:
taxable supply has the same meaning as in the GST Act.
(2)	Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 7), after item 1A, insert:
1B  At the end of section 75AU
Add:
	(3)	To assist in minimising price exploitation, when a corporation provides a consumer with a receipt or docket issued in respect of a taxable supply, the receipt or docket must separately include:
	(a)	the price of the goods or services excluding the GST;
	(b)	the amount of the GST; and
	(c)	the total price of the goods or services including the GST.
(3)	Schedule 1, page 6 (after line 5), after item 8, insert:
8A  Section 75AT of Part 2 of the Schedule
Insert:
taxable supply has the same meaning as in the GST Act. 
(4)	Schedule 1, page 6 (after line 5), after item 8A, insert:
8B  At the end of section 75AU of Part 2 of the Schedule
Add:
	(3)	To assist in minimising price exploitation, when a person provides a consumer with a receipt or docket issued in respect of a taxable supply, the receipt or docket must separately include:
	(a)	the price of the goods or services excluding the GST;
	(b)	the amount of the GST; and
	(c)	the total price of the goods or services including the GST.
This government is running scared that the true impact of the GST would be revealed if ordinary Australians were able to stand there and look at their dockets and say, `This is not what the government told us. They told us prices were only going to go up by 1.9 per cent.' Last week we saw the ACCC expose the government when it produced its price calculator which it had circulated to all Australian households. I will come back to that because there is some very important information that Australians should be aware of in the ACCC's calculations—but let them stand for the moment as testimony to the government exposed.
We have asked consistently the ACCC, we have asked consistently Mr Howard, we have asked consistently Mr Costello: `What would be the real price impacts?' They said that they could not imagine anything reaching the price of a 10 per cent increase. And what did the ACCC find in their—might I say `flawed'—study? They found that 45 items of the 200 items they produced went up by between eight per cent and 10 per cent—and such obscure items as electricity, gas, clothing and books! These are the sorts of items that this government sought to hound small businesses about. You will all remember the famous case of Gleebooks—a small bookshop on Glebe Point Road in Glebe. Apparently Senator Alston bought a book from Gleebooks, and upon receiving the docket he saw that it stated that the book prices would go up by 10 per cent. What did he do? He wrote to Mr Hockey. And what did Mr Hockey do? Mr Hockey referred this matter across to the ACCC, and the ACCC fired off its standard intimidation and fear letter to try to force small businesses not to reveal the true costs—and a political debate ensued. This government and the ACCC insisted that book prices would not go up by anywhere near as much as the book companies and the bookshops were claiming. But what did the ACCC calculator come up with last week: 8.5 per cent. That is, as I said, on a very flawed analysis which I will come to in subsequent contributions.
—I will take that interjection from Senator Campbell, because when this government, which is running scared at the moment, finally calls an election, the choice that this country will have is either an opposition committed to rolling back the unfair parts of the GST or a government that is committed to rolling forward the GST on to food and upping the rate. That is what this government is about. John Howard, Senator Campbell and the Treasurer have said one thing that everyone should keep in mind: they want a GST on food. So if they are voted for again in the next election, they might even promise you that they would never, ever do it on food, but do not forget that they said that they would never, ever do a GST. This is a government that is committed to rolling the GST forward; it is committed to seeing more GST put on more ordinary products, and then as always—as we all know, prices are already going up—the GST rate will not stay where it is. The GST rate will go up. We all know that. It has happened in every single country in the world that has introduced a GST: the rate has been put up.  
So there should be no pretence by this government that the rate will not go up and, worse, they want to roll this GST forward on to food. It is their stated position. It is the Treasurer's preference; it is the Prime Minister's preference; and it is Senator Campbell's preference. If you want to put it into a simple debate: we will roll it back; we will take some of the unfairness out of it. You can never fix this GST, but we will take some of the unfairness out and we will make it simpler—not the nightmare that this government are currently foisting on small business, not the fear and intimidation that the government are using with their lap-dog, the ACCC, to run around and terrorise ordinary Australian businesses and ordinary Australian companies. That is what this government are engaged in. This amendment is part of it.
Why won't the Democrats support displaying the tax on the docket? I look forward to Senator Murray's contribution on this. I know that Senator Murray has spoken on this before. Like him, I am keeping a record of the reasons they vote against it each time—and each time the reasons get thinner and thinner because they know that Australians want this information. They know that Australians would like to see the GST costs on the dockets. The consumer groups in this country want to see it, and ordinary Australians you talk to in the streets would like to know. Why does the ACCC use its powers to force companies not to have `before and after' price tags? From last week, we have permission from the ACCC.
Last Friday before Senate estimates, I asked the ACCC on what basis they believed they had the legal, enforceable power to ban a company displaying a docket of any type it wanted. They said, `It could be false and misleading.' I said, `If a company has calculated the true cost of the increases and wants to continue to have a dual price tag after 30 June, why shouldn't it be able to? Why shouldn't an ordinary consumer be able to see what the price of the good was before the GST and after the GST?' What could possibly be wrong with that, Senator Campbell? But no, the government has made sure that the ACCC are enforcing a guideline that is not the law, as we have shown after the ACCC have tried for six months to pretend that their guidelines were law. The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, my opposite in the other place, issued a press statement saying that the guidelines are the law. We all know it is not the law.
Finally, Professor Fels admitted last week that the guidelines were simply a guide the courts could look at—that is all: just a guide. But that has not stopped them threatening and intimidating. It has not stopped them trying to stop shops putting the GST before and after prices. This government is consistently refusing to disclose the true impact. It dodgied up some modelling and misled the Australian public before the last election. Remember the 1.9 per cent? There was no 1.9 per cent in the ACCC's figures last week. The government continues to try to pretend black is white, and it continues as it did before the last election with what now seems a trivial amount of money—only $19 million—that it spent in three weeks before the last federal election was called, promoting the so-called benefits of the GST. Now it is hiding behind the most obscene advertising campaign in terms of content and expenditure this country has ever seen.  
What was the Democrats' view? `It is all the Labor Party's fault that they need to spend this money, because they have caused so much confusion.' Senator Murray, you have the opportunity to stand up here and give us your view on whether you believe $420 million in education and advertising is necessary, and we will look forward to your contribution. I will be keeping the Hansard for posterity on this one, Senator Murray, because I am looking forward to you justifying, like your leader did, the government's outrageous misuse of taxpayer funds. You are in on the deal; you are in on the fix. You will not be supporting this, as you have not in the past. You will be happy to vote for an amendment to give $10 million to the Packer family, that struggling, small, Victorian business at the casino. A high-roller amendment at $10 million? No problem. Tell consumers what the impact of the GST is? Not a chance. That is where the Democrats have got to in this debate. They have become so in thrall to the government that they are prepared to support, any way possible, the government's attempts to cover up the true impact of the GST. 
The Democrats have a long and proud history of transparency, Senator Murray. The government continue to claim that they are abolishing the hidden wholesale sales tax. So why are they trying to hide the GST? At least you don't have to get caught up in that piece of hypocrisy, Senator Murray. You can say you are against the hidden WST and also the hidden GST. You have the chance to stand up and be counted and not get into the web of deceit that this government are involved in. You do not have to say, `Oh, no, we think that the old WST system was hidden and there were all these flaws in it, but we are prepared to support the government in it, hiding behind an advertising campaign to disguise the true impact of the GST.' 
We urge the government and the Democrats to support these amendments and put some honesty back in the GST debate, so that we do not have to try to calculate the GST when we are walking around the supermarket. The government says, `It is simple.' Allan Fels says, `Consumers will be able to tell us whether or not there is price exploitation.' He keeps saying, `I have got 18 million consumers out there, and they are all looking at the GST.' Senator Campbell and Senator Murray: what is one-eleventh of $47.30? It should be simple. You are standing there at the shelf, and the price of something is $47.30. How do you calculate the GST? Take your calculator to the shop because you are going to need it. That is the only way Allan Fels will be able to rely on you giving him accurate information. What is one-eleventh of the price? I do not know; I do not carry a calculator and I am not a mathematician. But apparently Allan Fels is prepared to run with the rubbish that consumers will be able to tell how much the GST is affecting their goods and they will be able to work out what one-eleventh of every single item they buy is. It is the only way to work out the GST. That is how stores do it. They have computers and cash registers, but ordinary punters—unless they are carrying their laptop around with them—have no way of knowing, unless this government and the Democrats are prepared to support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-05,"—As usual, there was a lot in there, and I think there are some points worth responding to. Before I do that, I would like assistance to circulate these documents, and I will seek leave later on to have them tabled. 
The first thing I need to say, and it is a matter of honesty, is that Senator Conroy would know that you are judged equally by what you do as by what you say. Senator Conroy, with respect to putting the GST on food, I remind you that, three times at divisions called by me, you and the rest of the Labor Party voted for a GST on food. It is on the record, it is in the Hansard and it has never been repudiated by your party. Your party have never said, `Gee, we are sorry we voted three times in divisions for the GST to be on food,' and I am expecting that, unless you do repudiate it as part of your policy platform, you will be going to the next election advocating that you will roll back the GST on one or two items but you will roll it forward on basic food. The Labor Party will put a GST on food, as they have voted three times to do so in the GST debates. 
Let us move to the question of whether taxes should be on price tickets and on final receipts and dockets. This issue has been covered extensively before. The fact is that the law does not prevent that happening. Mr Temporary Chairman, I seek the permission of both the Labor Party and the coalition to have this tabled so that we can discuss it during my address.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Do you want it tabled or incorporated?
—Whichever is the easiest.
—Is leave granted for the document to be incorporated in Hansard?
Leave granted.

—I want to use this as a sample, because it has been sent to all parliamentarians. This is a sample docket which, under the new tax system, will be issued by Woolworths Ltd to customers. I am not sure of their market share, but I suspect it is close to 20 per cent of the entire Australian market in the categories they deal with, so this is a very good example of a business which has very substantial Australia-wide coverage.
This docket has listed beef-steak pies, which are asterisked as a GSTable item; Bulla Ice Cream, also taxable; free range eggs, not taxable; Tim Tams, taxable, Jumbo olives, not taxable, antiperspirants, taxable; brown onions, not taxable; light Philly cheese, not taxable; Coca Cola, taxable; toothbrush, taxable; and carrots, not taxable. In this sample docket, it totals the price of those items at $33.72, and it indicates at the bottom that the total GST to be charged on that docket is $1.76. This means that every customer who goes into Woolworths will know exactly how much GST they are paying in total on that docket. I remind the Senate again: there is nothing in the law which prevents any retailer from showing GST; secondly, the law requires retailers, or any business which sells to another business, to advise those businesses what the GST component is. For instance, if you were a law firm buying these goods from Woolworths, and you wished to claim them as an input to be deducted, you would need to know that figure. So the first point to make is that consumers will be able to readily identify from retailers how much GST is on dockets. The second point is that the existing taxes—most of which have been put into law under Labor governments, both state and federal—are not shown on dockets. The wholesale sales tax, for instance, has never been shown on dockets. No Labor government anywhere in the country has ever agreed to, wanted to or advocated putting wholesale sales tax on dockets.
Payroll tax is something that is supported by all Labor governments. The payroll tax component of costs are not put on dockets, neither is excise and neither are all the other taxes which are hidden within every price that every Australian pays. What I am doing here is exposing the essential hypocrisy of a policy which seeks for the very first time to do something which the Labor Party has never agreed to do with any form of taxation in any receipt or invoice. Secondly, through this example of the Woolworths Ltd docket, I am showing how retailers will be telling every consumer in the country exactly what GST they have paid on the items they have bought. To me, it makes these amendments both duplicitous, deceptive and unnecessary. 
The main area of remarks made by Senator Conroy relate to the advertising campaign that the government has conducted. None of us, the Labor Party included, ever deny that governments need to provide information and to advertise their policies and their programs. With regard to this particular section of advertising, the question is: is it a rort, is it political, is it a problem? The precedent was originally set by the Labor Party in its term of office, it has been carried on by the coalition in its term of office, and it has been exposed to a vast extent in this latest round of advertising. I think the Labor Party's case would be served far better if it did not exaggerate, because I think it does have a case, But, in exaggerating its case, it has diminished the impact of what it has done.
I have the pleasure—and it is a pleasure—of sitting in the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee estimates process. Senators Ray and Faulkner, quite frankly, are an example to all senators as to how to conduct that process. I might remind some senators here: very seldom do they stray into impolite or abusive behaviour, strong as their points might be.
—I agree with Senator Conroy that I can learn a great deal from those two, because they really do it very well. But the fact is that, in the exposure of this matter, they have under questioning exposed the fact that—and I do not have the exact figures—a couple of hundred million dollars of this $420 million you refer to has been specifically given to organisations that have to implement the new tax system—in other words, to conduct training, seminars and information campaigns of their own. As the Labor Party know, those organisations include such luminaries as the ACTU—supporters of the Labor Party—and many other organisations of that ilk. So there is $200 million worth of practical implementation programs which, frankly, are much needed. I think the government's choice of community, business and union organisations to put the implementation of this new tax system out to their members and to apply it practically is an extremely intelligent choice. Otherwise, the implementation would never have been able to progress as it has. The second component in that $420 million of advertising, as I understand, is that it is a four-year figure. The third point to make is that the remaining amount of money includes amounts necessary to advertise and promote the changes being made to business taxes, not just to the GST, which has attracted such attention.
So when we come down to a core figure of perhaps somewhere between $40 million and $50 million, the question we have to face is whether the government has gone too far—is there a political and propaganda component in it? I think the Labor Party have done an excellent job in highlighting that there has been that element to it. One might well use Senator Ray's examples of large poster campaigns or relatively uninformative TV campaigns as just going too far on the propaganda side; however, the leaflet campaigns and the newspaper print campaigns, for instance, are highly informative and, in my opinion, quite objective. So there is a balance somewhere in between. 
The Labor Party are very good at raising heat and showing that there is a problem but not in suggesting a solution, because when they get into power—which surely they will one day, as the cycles go—they want to do exactly the same thing as the government is presently doing, and that is always the case. The Labor Party will complain vigorously about the standards of the Prime Minister's code of conduct, but they will do nothing to change the system to provide a solution. They will complain vigorously about whether appointments to boards, authorities or committees are independent, and we will put up proposals and they will reject them, they will throw them out, because they want to do the same when they are in government. The essential weakness of the Labor Party position is that they show—and rightly show—that there are problems with what a government is doing, but they will not do anything to resolve those problems. In answer to Senator Conroy's challenge to me, I will develop a solution to this and I will put it to you. I will be very surprised if you vote for it because when you are in office you will want to be doing exactly what the government is doing. I will be very interested to see whether or not that is the case. 
The last point I want to make is that the government's very extensive expenditure on the implementation of the new tax system has to be put into perspective. Multibillion dollar changes are being implemented and, therefore, you need to do take some sort of ratio approach to it. Secondly, there has been from some in the media and from all of the ALP a scare-a-day campaign which the government has had to counter. The Labor Party have probably done a good job in trying to put the finger on wherever any problems exist, but in the process they have so confused and so perturbed so many sectors of the Australian population that the government has had to counter it with an unusually large—in fact, historically extraordinary—information and advertising campaign. But, having done so, I have no doubt that once we have passed 1 July we will join the three-quarters of the countries of the world that have a GST or a VAT. We will join the billions of people in the world who have a GST or a VAT. We will join the tens of millions of business in the world that have a GST or a VAT. And the Labor Party, where they are in power in the states, and if they ever get back into power in the Commonwealth, will be absolutely delighted that there will be a broad based tax which will deliver them much higher revenue.
The challenge the government throws to the Labor Party is: where is your policy? If you are against the new tax system, you should be obliged to go to the election and say that you will withdraw it. If you are not against it, then you should indicate exactly what reforms you intend implementing. Our position as Democrats has been clear: we believe that lower rates and broadening the base will produce more revenue for all the states and for the Commonwealth to use much more effectively for the services that all Australians need. The Labor Party are going to have to face up to that when they face up to the next election. ",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I would like to say something in relation to what Senator Murray said about the advertising campaign. He said, `The Labor Party has conducted a big campaign about the GST and has put its case,' and that is right. He then said, `To counter that, the government has to go through a campaign,' and I think that is a fair proposition. But the difference is that the Labor Party has paid for its campaign, whereas the coalition has the taxpayers' money to pay for its campaign.
So, if you take what is being said to its logical conclusion, it is this: at the time of the next election, the Labor party will conduct a campaign and it will go out and put its propositions forcibly so that it goes against the government. Now, on the logic that has been put here today, since Labor will have done that, the government should be entitled to use taxpayers' funds to run its next election. That is the proposition that has been put: if there is a campaign against the GST, to counter that there has to be a campaign for it and therefore the government is justified in using taxpayers' money. On the present logic, it will be quite all right for the government to spend taxpayers' money to run its next election campaign. That just cannot be right.
The next proposition I want to put is about the GST, where it has got to and what is being said as to why the Labor Party does not, in effect, abolish the GST after the next election if it is so concerned about it. This is ignoring what I call the My Fair Lady syndrome. Perhaps I can explain what happens. You will remember that Professor Higgins takes Eliza Doolittle off the street outside Covent Garden, where she had been selling flowers. She is a particular sort of person. Professor Higgins takes her away and makes her somebody entirely different: she becomes a lady and she develops in society in a particular way. Having thus changed her, Professor Higgins says, `Well, you're leaving the house.' She says, `What can I do?' and he says, `You can go back to being a flower girl.' In theory that is right but the situation is so changed—she is so changed, the society she has gone with has so changed—that is not a reality. It is the same sort of thing with this GST: once it is introduced, once it becomes enmeshed in society and once things have changed, it is going to be very difficult to go back.  
The next thing I want to talk about is the sample docket that Senator Murray has put into the debate. It seems to me to be perfect evidence that this can be done. This is what the amendment is asking for:
	(3)	To assist in minimising price exploitation, when a corporation provides a consumer with a receipt or docket issued in respect of a taxable supply, the receipt or docket must separately include:
	(a)	the price of the goods or services excluding the GST—
which is what the Woolworths sample docket does—
	(b)	the amount of the GST—
which is what the sample docket does—
	(c)	the total price of the goods or services including the GST—
and which is also what the sample docket does. This docket provides evidence that what the opposition, the Labor Party, is contending is absolutely feasible. If this were to become law, then, as this docket shows, that law could be carried out quite succinctly. What may need to happen is that people may need to be provided with machines to do it, and it might be fair to provide those machines. That has been argued again and again. So I would suggest to Senator Murray that his introduction of this docket confirms that what is proposed to be done in the amendment is feasible and certainly fair. Why shouldn't people be obliged to show what they are charging—what they are paying by way of tax and what they are charging by way of goods?
One other thing, a tangent to this, arises from discussions we had at the weekend. Another GST is going to be imposed on fees charged by legal firms. I will get Senator Campbell to get confirmation of this later on if he would. I am led to believe that now lawyers cannot do pro bono work or cannot reduce prices to relations and that what they will have to do is charge the full fee, whatever that may be, and put the GST onto that. If they do pro bono work or do work for relatives or friends at a reduced rate, they have to pay the GST themselves on the basis that the full fee has been charged. If I could get that checked by the parliamentary secretary, that would be good.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-06-05,"—With regard to the process that we are going through—and I suppose that we will continue to go through for some time because of the very interesting comments that have been made by Senator Murray with regard to advertising—I have to say to you, Senator Murray, that I listened with great interest to what you said. With regard to the document you circulated, it is a very interesting concept that you are arguing that gives some justification to the Democrats' position. I did note—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman Ferguson—that Senator Murray argued that we somehow supported the GST on food. The only reason we ever voted for a GST on food was that we wanted the Democrats to vote against the GST full-stop. That is what that was for; that is exactly why we did that.
Of course, we now know that this is going so badly that the government has had to spend about $500 million on an advertising campaign that contains little or no information. It is really outrageous. If you were really on about informing the public, then you at least ought to give them some information about it. Even when ads do contain a little information, it is very limited.
These bills relate to the powers of the Trade Practices Act, and 10 per cent is 10 per cent is 10 per cent—or, as I think Senator Conroy said, you have to take your calculator along to work it out, especially if it is one-eleventh of the price. It is all very interesting, because 10 per cent is not 10 per cent is 10 per cent. The ACCC really will not have the power to prosecute, and that has become apparent during the estimates process and in the previous questioning with regard to these bills. There have been proposals for significant penalties—I think it is $500,000 in the case of an individual and $10 million in the case of a corporate body—which are way above those which have current application. It is a matter of interest that, as we change the tax system, we have to have much higher penalties for exploitation or misleading activities on the part of business. 
An area that has come to light with regard to the effect of the GST is rent and the possibility for rent increases under the GST. We know that some increases in household rent are expected as a result of the changes under the GST. What landlords are supposedly not allowed to do is, say, to increase the rent by 10 per cent or more and then blame it on the GST. That somehow would be considered to be misleading conduct. But we have discovered in this issue alone that, in the case of rents—if the landlord does not have an ABN, and perhaps even if he does—the ACCC has no power under price exploitation law and it only has some power with regard to misleading conduct. My point is this: a landlord can put the rent up by 15 or 20 per cent if the landlord so wishes, and the ACCC can do nothing about it. If the landlord says that the 20 per cent is due to the GST, then the ACCC—again, I am not quite sure whether being registered with an ABN or not is relevant—may be able to do something about that. Statements back on 14 February would indicate that maybe it can do something in respect of misleading conduct.
Of course, that provides us with a very interesting analysis of how this thing is going to operate with regard to price exploitation. The ACCC has been conducting surveys of the prices of about 600,000 items over a period of time. It has also recruited the services of about 350 contractors to survey prices in 176 cities around the country, and it probably has another 400-odd people surveying petrol prices. What I find interesting about that is this: consumer groups around the country, who are also doing surveys of prices, are saying that prices are already going up—before the GST. Going back to Senator Murray's reference to Woolworths, I understand that the ACCC is embarking on an action against Woolworths for encouraging their suppliers to put up prices pre-GST so that they can maintain a net dollar value. That is a very interesting set of circumstances. So I do not base too much faith on a receipt that contains at the end of it just a single amount for GST. And if it is the case that prices are going up, it would be interesting to hear from the government what they intend to do about that. What are they directing the ACCC to do? I recall a statement issued on 15 January from Mr Hockey, Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, titled `Hockey directs ACCC on GST', which said:
The Minister for Financial Services Joe Hockey today directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10%.
Where are you now, Mr Hockey? Where is the minister now? We know that there have been significant price movements in very recent times. We know that there have been charges of profit taking and price fixing. So I would be very interested to hear from Minister Hockey now. Of course, the ACCC must have some knowledge of this. If it has been doing its surveys of 600,000 items, it must have some knowledge that the prices have been going up. This is all relevant to the process of this government implementing a new tax system. We have provided the ACCC with about $94.8 million for the GST program.
It is a very interesting situation if you want to make a complaint to the ACCC. During the course of estimates, I asked the ACCC about their complaints processes when people have concerns about exploitation. They provided us with a very nice folder that contained information about the processes and how they will operate. I think it was a single sheet called `GST Talk 4' that went to the question that I was talking about earlier relating to rent increases. It said that you could ring the 1300 number—I cannot off the top of my head remember the specific number—and you could ring a range of state and territory offices relevant to rental controls. I did ask the ACCC whether or not they had in place a range of agreements with the state bodies, and they said, `Yes, we have. We have spoken with them and we have an arrangement in place.' 
I recall saying to the ACCC, `Look, I would like to test the veracity of that,' which I did. I took the opportunity to make a phone call to the ACT consumer affairs office. I have not got the documents with me but I made some handwritten notes about this. Before I rang the ACT consumer affairs body I rang the ACCC 1300 number, which I found a very interesting process to be involved in. As I informed the ACCC later, it took me some 8½ minutes to actually get to speak to someone. I got a recording at the outset that informed me that I had actually rung the ACCC prices hotline number. It then made a reference to a couple of numbers, that if I had a particular complaint to ring this number or that number, but otherwise to wait. I waited. Then I had to press a number and it put me through to another recording which said things like, `Thank you for calling. Your call is important. If you require this information or that information,' and on it goes. 
—This is just a joke.
—Senator Campbell, I take that interjection, that this is a joke. What is important is that the consumers of this country have been given information about ringing up particular phone numbers for information and lodging complaints if they believe there is a case of price exploitation. So what is important to the consumer is that they can do that and know that they will have a process that they can get through on. That is what is important here. I say that this would be well worth Senator Campbell taking on board, as the ACCC did, because they may need some more money to actually provide a bit better service than they have currently got going, because it does take a long time. 
I raised questions about rental increases with the person I eventually got to speak to. I said, `I am paying, as an example, $100 a week rent. The landlord has said to me that the rent is going up to $110 a week and it is because of the GST.' I was told, `The landlord really can't do that. They can't say that.' I said, `Can you give me an indicative increase that you think I should actually pay?' The ACCC have made a claim that the maximum rental increase that people should expect to pay is around 2.2 per cent. That figure was the maximum, so I could expect between zero and 2.2 per cent. On $100 I could probably expect about a $2 or $2.50 increase per week. The person on the ACCC inquiry desk could not specify it to me. Indeed, the person said that it should be something less than 10 per cent. I do not know what less than 10 per cent amounts to. How is a consumer going to make any judgment about what savings a landlord has made? On what basis do they proceed to do that? How do they actually know?
I then rang the ACT organisation. I got another recording that said, `Thank you for ringing the consumer affairs office,' and so on. I went through the process of listening to the music. Indeed, I was told that my wait could be an extensive one due to the large number of calls and that I would experience periods of silence, which I did, and they were very lengthy periods of silence. But I stuck with it and I actually got to speak to someone in the end. I said, `Are you the person who can give me some explanation with regard to rental increases and the GST?' The response was, `No is the short answer. I suggest you ring the GST hotline.' I said, `Do you know anything about rent increases and the GST?' `No, not really. I have read that they should not go up very much. But can I suggest that you ring the specific rental organisation that deals with public sector rents.' They gave me the two numbers to ring and said, `You can ring those between nine and 12.' I found that to be a very unhelpful exercise.
This information I have conveyed to the ACCC. It is important for consumers. If you are bringing in a major change that is going to have some effect on prices and the process through which you are going to do that, you have to have something in place. How is the ACCC ever going to prosecute anybody if you cannot get through to talk to somebody who actually understands exactly what the problem is? That is a major difficulty here. The minister said he directed the ACCC before. I would like to hear from him what we are doing about it now. Prices are going up even prior to the implementation of the GST, and we have got to move on and do something about it. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-05,"—I might just record from the outset that we have now been going for nearly an hour. We have heard a series of contributions, each lasting their full time, except for Senator Cooney, who probably spoke a little bit under his time. This is in the wake of a commitment from the opposition when we were last sitting that the bill would be passed during this session before question time today. I am certainly hoping that the opposition spokesman will keep to that commitment he has made, and that he will not further delay this important piece of legislation. 
There have been amongst those opposition speakers an array of appalling misrepresentations about the new tax system, and their appalling misrepresentation of the new tax system is a very important reason, as Senator Murray has made clear, that we have a high quality, high impact, cut-through campaign to ensure that the people of Australia know what is happening with the significant changes to the tax system.
Nearly an hour ago, Senator Conroy tried to make the point about a future government bringing in a GST on food. I will not delay the Senate very long, but it is very appropriate that Senator Conroy, Senator Murphy and others, most importantly the general public, know the history of the Australian Labor Party when it comes to taxes. Here they are saying that some future government might bring in a tax on food. What is the Kim Beazley tax policy? Senator Murray would know very well the hidden Labor taxes on some of the items on the Woolworths list that he incorporated. If they were fair dinkum about showing indirect taxes on receipts, they had 13 years to do it. I say to them, `Do not come in here and move an amendment saying that you should have GST on receipts. Start filling in the blank policy paper, the Beazley policy paper, the blank sheet of paper.' You could make one commitment here today. You could start at the top of a page—`Our tax policy', `Kim's tax policy'—and say, `The first time parliament sits after the election, we will bring in an amendment to ensure that the GST has to be shown on dockets.'
 (Senator Crowley)—Order! Senator, in the future, please refer to Mr Beazley by his proper title.
—I am not referring to a person; I am referring to a new document.
—You did refer to `Kim's document'.
—`Kim's tax policy.'
—Please refer to Mr Beazley by his proper title.
—He does not have a tax policy, so I will call it `Mr Beazley's tax policy'—if he ever has one. I suspect, Senator Murray, it will not be Mr Beazley's tax policy; it will actually be Mr Crean's tax policy, and it should have on the top of it, `We will bring in a law which says that the GST has to be shown on dockets.' But they will not do that because they will not want to do what this amendment does; that is, ensure that hundreds of thousands of businesses across Australia, who are at this very moment complying with the law—
—You're the government. What a joke!
—No complaints, if you're going to filibuster like this.
—Order, senators on my left!
—The opposition just demonstrate the rank hypocrisy that applies to their side of the Senate. You get a whole hour of the Australian Labor Party's misrepresentations, lying and deceit about a tax policy, and then when I get up to make one short point, all I get is—
—We could have had this vote by now.
—I sat here quietly for one hour and interjected only once in an hour. I have now been constantly interjected upon by senators opposite, by Senator Conroy and his comrade Senator Murphy, with no interruption from the chair at all. I am seeking to make one point and I will make it.
—There will be no complaints if you keep wasting time. 
—Order, senators! With respect, I have already rebuked the senators on the left and I think it is important that we stay with the facts. Senators on the left, can we allow Senator Campbell a clear hearing? He has been speaking legitimately, only within his time.
—Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman. When it comes to tax policy, the Australian Labor Party could do one thing; that is, actually make a commitment. They could fill in the top line of a blank sheet of paper and say, `We'll make sure you have to put GST on dockets.' But they should not do it for the same reason that this amendment should be defeated; that is, that small businesses are complying with the law. They are now implementing the tax system. They have a choice under this tax system. As Senator Murray has shown very clearly, they can have the choice of bringing in a tax invoice which shows the GST or they may not. Many of them will not want to. Many of them certainly will not want some interfering Labor Party politicians in Canberra forcing them to do it when they do not want to be forced. They will figure out how to do it themselves. The other thing that needs to be put to rest is Labor's history of taxing food. If you go through the Woolworths docket which Senator Murray had incorporated, you will see ice-cream on the list, which was taxed under Kim Beazley.
—It is confectionary.
—Ice-cream is not food? You go and tell Senator Murray's kids and grandkids that ice-cream is not food. What are Tim Tams? Are they not food either? When my staff are having their chocolate attack this afternoon, I will tell them, `It's okay, you can go off your diet; it's not food. Eat a Tim Tam.' There we have it, Senator Murray. When the Labor Party rolls it back, they are going to put Kim Beazley's hidden tax on Tim Tams. 
Dog food is not food, unless, of course, you are a dog—I will resist my temptations in relation to that, Senator Murray. Cordial is not food. What are muesli bars and health foods? They are not food either. Of course they are not food! But Labor likes to tax them at 22 per cent. Potato chips are not food. Popcorn is not food. Pretzels are not food. Cheese and bacon balls, I guess, are not food either. But Labor likes to put taxes of between 12 and 22 per cent on all of those foods.
They talk about books and the Gleebooks shop. They want to pretend that they really care about this clever country, about the information economy, building a globalised information economy, but what do they do to achieve that? Senator Conroy said, `You'll need to take a laptop into the supermarket to work out the costs.' What is Labor's great policy on the information economy? I ask Senator Murray through you, Madam Temporary Chairman: how will they encourage people to get connected to the Internet? They say to you, `We want to put a 22 per cent tax on your laptop, a 22 per cent tax on your CDs, on your CD-ROM drives, on your modems and even on the paper that you need to print out'—printing paper, 22 per cent. As the ACCC's document that was posted to households shows, the price of all those items will come down and the Internet Industry Association and the Computer Society will all tell you that the cost of the hardware you need to get connected will come down between eight and 12 per cent. 
This bunch of people opposite say to school kids, `We want to roll back the GST.' They will not tell you where they will roll it back; they say, `We are going to have a roll-back.' I contemplate Kim Beazley and Simon Crean sitting in an old 1972 Charger or an old Monaro trying to roll it back and put it in reverse to get it started. The roll-back policy makes me think of these 1950s and 1960s retro-politicians who are going to roll back a policy. They are not going to tell you how until after the election, I heard on the weekend. We might not know what their tax policy will be until after the election. They will go to the people of Australia saying, `We are going to roll it back. We will not tell you where or how, but we are going to roll it back.' They will jump into the old Monaro, stick it in reverse, roll it down the hill and hope it bloody—Excuse me, Madam Temporary Chair, I withdraw that word. They will hope that it splutters into life. You are going to have to try harder. 
I want to talk briefly about the hypocrisy of Labor in relation to tax on books and tax on educational requirements. When kids go to buy all of their requirements for school—when they buy sketch books or project books—they pay a 22 per cent tax on them. When they buy exercise books, paper, erasers, marking pens, compasses, protractors and rulers, Mr Beazley—the clever guy, the information guy, the education man—says, `We are going to tax you on those.' When it comes to computers or anything you need for education, Labor already has these taxes in place. They have taxes all through the supermarket shelves. Senator Murray, your Woolworths invoice, now incorporated in the Hansard forevermore, shows that Labor's taxes on coca-cola and toothpaste are 22 per cent. They want to charge a 22 per cent tax on toothpaste, orange juice, Tim Tams and antiperspirants. The tax on all of those items is coming off.
It is the total at the bottom of the tape that matters, they used to remind us in the good old days. On the TV ads, back in Kim Beazley's and Simon Crean's days, they reminded us that it was the total at the bottom of the tape that mattered to the mums and dads who were shopping. The cost of that basket of groceries is going to be less. Labor do not want you to know that—
—There should be no more complaints about time wasting.
—I finish where I began. It is quite okay for Senator Conroy opposite to spend a whole hour spewing out irrelevant and misleading facts about tax policy, but when I get up for a few minutes to rebuff some of it, he says he cannot take it. You are going to have a debate about tax policy, and we will debate you everywhere.
—I am happy to have a debate; you were complaining about the time wasting.
—What Labor have to do, if they want to be part of that debate, is actually have an alternative. You will get by, every now and again, with a scare a day. You will get by by attacking advertisements. You will get by by carping, whingeing, whining and being negative. You will get by by bringing down new ideas and by attacking people with the ticker to bring in a new policy. But sooner or later you will have to have your own policy. I will be very surprised if you even produce it before the next election.
When you repudiate your policy to keep your tax on four-wheel drives and to bring in your retrospective capital gains tax, that will be a start. But you have to get the blank bit of paper which is Kim Beazley's policy at the moment and you have to fill in the first line. You need one line. It takes just a little bit of ink on the paper—there is a 22 per cent tax on the paper and a 22 per cent tax on the pen—to write the first word. You need `Kim Beazley's tax policy' at the top—four words—and then you can start writing.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-05,"—I have a question to the mover of the amendment. If I look at item 2 on 1804, it says:

Does that mean that businesses or organisations or entities making a taxable supply who are not corporations will not have to do this? Do you know how many there are?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-06-05,"—It does show the amount of the GST where it says `1.76'. But I understand Senator Conroy says that that ought to be broken up to show how much the GST is on each individual item such as the Coke, the toothbrush, the antiperspirants, the beef steak pies and the Bulla ice-creams. That is a reasonable proposition. The percentage of GST it shows on the goods is just a little over nine per cent. It would be useful to know how much is on each item. It would also of course be useful for a tax department to know how much Woolworths or anybody else had collected, to see how much should be paid over at the relevant time. The docket you have there shows the amount of the GST, but Senator Conroy's proposition is that it ought to show the amount of GST on each item as distinct from the total amount.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-05,"—One of the areas of concern which I have expressed and which I discussed with the ACCC last week—I think, Senator Murray, you had already had to leave—was the fact that the ACCC seemed to believe that they have a new way of interpreting the law: that is, allowing averaging. Whereas the tax law and most of the law that we deal with is on individual items, the ACCC seem to believe that they have the power to give permission for companies to break the law in their guidelines. In my view, the fact of their guidelines allowing averaging of GST across items is the very reason we need to have the individual items itemised. My apologies to Senator Cooney. We are being more specific than the Woolies document at the moment where just a total of GST is incorporated at the bottom. That does not allow you to make the decisions you need to.
More importantly, if companies have averaged out costs in their calculations that will not be revealed. You could actually not be able to work out how much GST increase has happened because the ACCC are advising companies that they have the ACCC's permission to average out their costs across different items—in my view, in breach of the law. They are not prepared to specify what the items are. They are not prepared to identify how it can happen or whether there is an upper or lower limit. They are not prepared to do a whole lot of things on this issue other than spuriously refer to the fact that there is a section that says `any other relevant matters'. This was a debate which I had with the ACCC at some length on Friday.
In our amendment, we seek that each individual item have the price and have the GST amount and then totals as well. That is the intent of where we are going. We move it in the form we have for the very reason that the ACCC are, in my view, encouraging companies to break the law.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-05,"—Senator Conroy, I am a bit unclear as to what the phrase `the amount of the GST' in paragraphs (3)(b) of items (2) and (4) means. Does it refer to each individual item or to a total?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-05,"—That would require that it indicates an individual item, as per standard. We are referring to the amount of the GST per `taxable supply', which is an individual item. This is why, as I say, I think the ACCC are actually outside of the law and are recommending to companies that they breach the law—not their guidelines but the law. 
Amendments not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-05,"—by leave—I move:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 12), after “commerce”, insert “, for the purpose of price exploitation”.
(2)	Schedule 1, item 9, page 6 (line 10), after “commerce”, insert “, for the purpose of price exploitation”.
I am sure that the government did not intend this, but it is possible with this legislation as it is currently worded that free speech and debate could actually be caught up. For example, Gerry Harvey is consistently making his views known on the impact of the GST and he is just making general comments. We are seeing a lot of robust debate in the public domain by retailers. Dick Warburton has two hats in this debate: he has his hat as chair of David Jones and he has a hat as chair of the Business Coalition for Tax Reform. With this amendment we are seeking to ensure that legitimate debate by Mr Warburton or Mr Harvey or anybody else is not caught up in the `false and misleading' provisions of this amendment. By saying `engaged in trade and commerce', both Mr Warburton and Mr Harvey could be swept up in an all-encompassing way for some of their statements. It may be that they believe some of their statements. I think Mr Harvey is in today's papers saying people should have bought computers and other things—funnily enough, Senator Campbell—and other electrical items prior to 1 July because he believes, on his information, that the prices will probably go up. He may be right; he may be wrong. It is a legitimate argument for the ACCC, for Senator Kemp, Senator Campbell and myself, to engage in that debate outside this chamber. But it is not legitimate for him to possibly be caught up because of the trade and commerce provisions of this amendment and be attacked by the ACCC and beaten into silence because he has engaged in legitimate public debate about the impact of the GST.
This is an amendment that is designed to try and protect freedom of speech and try and protect legitimate debate on this issue. I am sure the government do not intend for Mr Harvey's or Mr Warburton's comments to be captured by the legislation. But on our understanding, our reading and our advice we are concerned that individuals, because of their having more than one hat, could actually be caught up. I am interested in any government advice or interpretation on this. I am interested in Senator Murray's views. Hopefully, we can get this resolved so that there is no confusion.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-05,—The provision is quite clearly restricted to conduct in connection with the supply of goods or services. It is not aimed at political comment.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-05,"—Senator Conroy, I appreciate that you and the Labor Party have been exceptionally busy over the last two weeks but it would have been helpful if we had received these amendments prior to this occasion. To make a decision on them quickly is difficult.
Essentially, if I understand you correctly, you are saying—and unfortunately I do not have the Trade Practices Act with me—that this is a free speech amendment and you do not want to unnecessarily restrain organisations, whether business, community or any other, from making statements about the new tax system. Frankly, I would need some advice on what this means. I would need a fuller response from the parliamentary secretary, who has his advisers nearby, on the true effect of this and whether there is any downside. I would need a fuller response from my own adviser. Frankly, I would like to hear a little more of an exposition from you, Senator.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I will take up Senator Murray's invitation. We are concerned that Mr Fels has been for some time now accusing various groups, be they business or other community groups, of being engaged in a propaganda campaign of their own about the compliance cost issue, for instance; about how much the embedded cost savings can be passed on. I am concerned. Last week I asked Mr Grant from the ACCC, `What compliance costs did you include as a percentage of costs in your calculations?' He said, `It is about 0.1, maybe 0.2. We are being flexible.' I asked, `What happens if it's more?' And he said, `They could not be—we have seen no estimates.' 
Many business groups, from Mr Ray Regan to the Business Coalition for Tax Reform, have pointed out that both the estimates of the ACCC and the government of the true compliance costs of introducing the GST are far beyond the government's or the ACCC's current calculations. I would hate to see a situation where companies are afraid of speaking out, as is the case now. A number of companies have contacted me in recent times. They would like to debate the ACCC on their level of compliance costs but they are terrified that, if they stand up and say, `Our compliance costs are much greater,' they will have the wrath of the ACCC brought down on them and the threat of $10 million fines. Therefore, unfortunately, we are seeing a situation in Australia today where legitimate debate is being stifled because people are afraid to stand up to the ACCC and argue with the ACCC about the level of compliance costs. 
The question of embedded costs comes into it, as well. Many companies are coming to us, Senator Murray, and possibly even to you seeking Democrat assistance in these issues. I am sure you are open-minded on these sorts of issues. They are saying that the sorts of estimates that are being tossed around by both the government and the ACCC are an absolute nonsense. They are not going to make these cost savings in six months or 12 months. Some of these costs may take years to come through, but they are being told that they have to anticipate the costs. They want to engage in public debate but they are afraid of the ACCC and the sweeping nature of these powers.
What this amendment is seeking to do is not too complicated. It is just simply saying, `If you are making comment that is not involved in the trade and commercial aspect of your business—in other words, it is not a brochure being published in the Sunday Telegraph or advertising on the television; it is just engaging in public comment—then the law differentiates between public comment in the newspapers and being actively engaged in promoting your goods through trade and commerce.' We are simply seeking to a degree to curtail Allan Fels's capacity to intimidate business—which is what many businesses are saying is happening at the moment in terms of the impact. So we are keen to ensure that legitimate public policy debate is not unduly influenced by the threat of Allan Fels and $10 million fines. We are certainly receiving comments along those lines about how they are being threatened by Allan Fels and by other officers of the ACCC. We do not believe that there is any place for that in a democracy. We should be able to have businessmen, charities or any other organisation having public policy arguments with the government. We do not want to see them constrained by the legislation.
This is a very small and simple amendment. We do not believe it is highly controversial. I know the government has got up and said, `No, there is no need for this. They couldn't possibly be captured.' Brave people like Harvey Norman and Mr Harvey are standing up and saying, `This is the case; the government line is wrong.' Michael Delaney from the Motor Trades Association is saying that the government and the ACCC's line is wrong, but if the ACCC choose to interpret the powers as they stand, they risk prosecution. We are seeking to differentiate between trade and commerce and public comment and public policy debate.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-05,"—My question is to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister in the Senate. Does the minister recall the Prime Minister proclaiming in 1995:
I can promise you that we will follow policies which will ... bring down the foreign debt.
Given this very clear commitment, how does the minister explain that since his government took office in 1996 foreign debt has grown from $194 billion to a staggering $256 billion, the highest ever on record? 
—What about as a percentage of GDP, Peter?
—About 43 per cent. How is it that the government has allowed the debt burden on each Australian to increase from $10,000 per person, which Peter Costello railed against in 1995—
—Mr Costello.
—which Mr Costello railed against in 1995—thank you, Madam President, and here is the punchline—to $13,433 today?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Foreign Debt</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I ask a supplementary question. I note that the minister did not actually answer the first part of my question.
—Yes, he did.
—No, he did not. The question is: does the government's promise to bring the foreign debt down still stand? Are you going to stand by that promise, or has it been shelved? If it still stands, can the minister nominate a time by which the foreign debt will actually start coming down rather than continuing to increase?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Foreign Debt</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-06-05,"—Madam President—
—It is a pretty good punchline when you have to say when it is coming.
—That is what I was going to say. It is a pretty good punchline if you have to announce it as the punchline. It does remind us, however, of Labor's appalling economic record in government. All Australians will understand that, when this government came to office, it inherited a domestic deficit of over $10 billion.
—Answer the question.
—Order! Senator Cook, you have asked a question, a few seconds have passed and you are shouting out, `Answer the question.' Either you do not want to hear what Senator Hill has to say or you are just not giving him an opportunity to answer. 
—I was just putting this in context in terms of Labor's deplorable record which we inherited—$10 billion of deficit, $80 billion of debt run up in the last five budgets of the Labor government. That is what the Howard government inherited. But the Howard government has taken the difficult economic decisions, which have resulted in strong economic growth since then—
—Senator Carr, to say you are shouting would be an understatement. You are disorderly. 
—Those decisions have resulted in strong economic growth, strong jobs growth, low interest rates, low inflation—an economic success story which has been the envy of the world. That is what Senator Cook is trying to talk down today: an economic success story that is the envy of the world. This government got through the Asian economic crisis without a hiccup because it had taken the hard economic decisions, reined in Labor's excesses in expenditure and got the accounts in order. For Senator Cook, who takes something of an interest in these matters, let me start with the current account deficit and I will finish with the foreign debt, to put it in context, which I think he would like. 
Australia's current account deficit has been falling in trend terms and is expected to be lower in 2000 and 2001. Exports are growing strongly, and this is forecast to continue. The outlook for export prices is also positive. That is all good news on the current account deficit. I will move across to the issue of foreign debt, the most important measure of which—and I can remember Labor talking to us about it—is the foreign debt servicing ratio. The foreign debt servicing ratio, which is net debt interest repayments as a proportion of exports, was 10.2 per cent in the March quarter 2000, around half of the peak level of 20 per cent reached under Labor in the September quarter of 1990. If ever the Senate wants a demonstration of how the economy has improved under the coalition government, that is a great figure—it has been halved since this government has been in office. It has averaged 10.4 per cent since March 1996 compared with 13.9 per cent under Labor in the previous 13 years. 
Under Labor, net foreign debt as a proportion of GDP increased from 14 per cent in June 1983 to 38 per cent in March 1996 and was 41 per cent in the December quarter of 1992. What a deplorable background to which Senator Cook asks his question. Under the coalition, net foreign debt as a proportion of GDP has risen much less significantly, from 38 per cent in the March quarter to 41 per cent. Since the government came to office in 1996, I remind the Senate, it has repaid around $50 billion in general government net debt. So the story of this government, which put the accounts in order by reining in excesses, is that it has been able to repay some $15 billion of the debt that it inherited from Labor.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-06-05,"—It was Labor in office that continually set targets and was embarrassed by targets. A target that you do not intend to keep in government is not worth a thing. What is important is to put in place sound economic policies which result in record economic growth, strong jobs growth, low interest rates and benefits to all Australians. Yes, the foreign debt has risen slightly because the dollar has weakened slightly, as Senator Cook knows. But, as I said, the debt servicing ratio, which is the important guideline in this regard, has not.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) to questions without notice asked by Senators Lundy, Murphy and Senator Conroy today, relating to the privacy of information contained in applications for Australian Business Numbers.
Today, we find ourselves viewing a very serious situation relating to public trust by the businesses of this country who find themselves mandatorily required to provide details about their businesses. That information being collected by the Australian Taxation Office has managed to find its way into the hands of private companies. It is a tale of two departments: the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.
The issue is this: there is information publicly available online now that relates to the details of those small businesses. There is also information publicly available for purchase that is not available on the web site: it is able to be sold to people for $20 per record. There is additional information that is supposed to be kept confidential by the Taxation Office. Deciphering the misinformation and the mess through three different estimates hearings and here today in the chamber should not take too long, despite the government's best efforts to confuse and cloud the issue and to protect themselves from what is very obviously one of the most serious breaches of public trust. In business in this country there has been a dramatic loss of the faith and trust they had in the Taxation Office to keep information confidential.
What we have heard to date through the Senate estimates process is that Dun and Bradstreet and the Commonwealth Bank were provided two weeks ago with up to 10,000 records of companies. The database they used to compile this data was launched by Minister Reith some two weeks ago and is called ABNsearch. It was a joint venture between the Commonwealth Bank and Dun and Bradstreet. That data was released by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business two weeks ago, prior to any of that information being available on the Internet. In fact, the government only launched the Internet site, this Australian Business Register, last Thursday, 1 June. When the department stand up, when the tax office stand up and when small business stand up and say, `We did not release anything that was not publicly available,' they are not telling the truth. That is because at that time that information was not available on the Internet. It only became available on the Internet on the first of this month, according to estimates evidence.
If that is the case, what was made available to Dun and Bradstreet and the Commonwealth Bank? We know now that the information available on the web site is quite limited. It allegedly does not include street address, email address or ANZIC code, which is the industry classification. We know that because we have been to the web site now and had a look. Our question to the government is: what was provided to Dun and Bradstreet and the Commonwealth Bank? We are of the view—and they are yet to inform the Senate of the truth of the matter—that additional information was supplied, including that which is available for sale but which is not on the web site. By that we are talking about the email address, the contact address and that ANZIC code.
We also know, by virtue of very specific complaints received from a constituent here in the ACT and anecdotal complaints that we are receiving from around the country, that people have been contacted via their personal, private and confidential phone numbers by Dun and Bradstreet. We very clearly allege—and the government are yet to disprove it—that this information was distributed initially by the tax office to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and to Dun and Bradstreet. There is a long and convoluted pathway to follow. We want to know whether the email code of conduct has been breached, because we believe it has.  
The government have been desperate to retain some sort of e-credibility with regard to email and laws relating to the information economy. This is the key issue. This information is more than just available through a search mechanism on the web site; the government have said they will distribute it, for an administrative fee, in the form of a consolidated database on a CD-ROM or via download. We heard that in the estimates committee from the department of small business. They have not made that knowledge available to small business and they have breached public trust.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2000-06-05,"—Senator Lundy, in her eagerness again to attempt some futile attack on the government, shows how completely misinformed she is on this issue. She need only have listened to the information provided by the Australian Taxation Office to know that she is completely misinformed and is yet again, as the opposition have been over weeks and weeks now, attempting to scaremonger in relation to the introduction of the most beneficial tax changes that have ever been initiated in this country's history. All the Labor Party can ever do about it is scaremonger, scaremonger, scaremonger and create false information.  
The tax office itself has given the lie to the allegations that the Labor Party made in question time today and that Senator Lundy has just repeated in her remarks. No less an authority than the tax commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, has said that reports suggesting that privacy laws have been breached are completely false. Of course, what was being misunderstood initially in the Labor Party's attack on this issue was the difference between the Australian Business Number, the Australian Business Register and the business entry point. What needs to be understood is that the Australian Business Register is a register of all businesses and other entities which have an ABN. It also identifies whether a business is registered for the goods and services tax, is an income exempt tax charity or is a deductible gift recipient. It has always been made clear, and indeed it is provided in the legislation, that some public information on the Australian Business Register would be available to the public to allow people to find out who they are dealing with in terms of registered entities, whether those entities are registered for the GST or whether those people are making gifts to legitimate charities. If people are going to comply with the new tax system, business to business, they need to have this information available to them.
As I said, the 1999 A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act has always provided for the public availability of this information. This is explained in writing in the guide on pages 8 and 9 to those seeking Australian Business Number registration. It is also explained in the business entry point web site as to where businesses are able to register electronically for an Australian Business Number. It is important to understand that on the web site the only business information available to the public is the Australian Business Number, its status, its legal name, the trading names if any, the state or territory in which the business is registered, its postcode, whether the entity is registered for the goods and services tax or has gift deductible recipient endorsement and, in the case of companies, the ACN or ARBN. It is important to note that this information does not include phone numbers. So, quite clearly, there is no breach of privacy with regard to the information that has been provided to people with regard to the ABR and ABNs.
The reason that the Labor Party raises yet another furphy is because it is completely confused with regard to issues of taxation and issues of tax reform. Only yesterday, we had another representative of the Labor movement, the well-known Doug Cameron of the AMWU— 
—He's not well known.
—He is too well known, unfortunately, this militant unionist Doug Cameron. He told Meet the Press that the GST should be rolled back a long way. They now want the GST to be rolled back a long way. In particular, he favours a complete exemption for clothing and a range of GST rates, not a single rate GST. Rolling back the GST to exempt clothing would cost $2 billion. Do the Labor Party tell us where the money is going to come from? Remember that they have guaranteed that the states will not lose any revenue out of their roll-back. Of course they have not. We know very well that that money is going to come from an increase in other taxes and, importantly, an increase in income taxation. It is no wonder that opposition finance spokesman Lindsay Tanner has warned the Labor Party about committing themselves in government to further roll-backs of the GST because it would leave them short of funds for their proposed social programs. As I said, this particular roll-back proposed by this union heavy would cost some $2 billion in revenue. It is also important to note that the Queensland Labor government state Treasurer, David Hamill, delivered an embarrassing blow to federal Labor when he pleaded with the present government not to widen the GST-free net.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-05,"—The great lie in this debate is that the government have broken no laws. They have had the taxation commissioner putting out statements telling everybody that no protected taxpayer information would ever be sold by the tax office. That is not what this debate is about. I found it astonishing in Senator Kemp's answer today that three days after this very issue was raised he had no briefing. It was because he did not want to get a briefing.
I have here a copy of a paper released just last month, in May, by Minister Joe Hockey called Building consumer sovereignty in electronic commerce: A best practice model for business. In it there is a litany of commitments that business should practise in e-commerce. They include:
... enhances Consumer Sovereignty by giving consumers information on what businesses should do when dealing with consumers over the Internet. The Best Practice Model aims to set out best practice for business.
...	...	...
It involves four key elements: protection, information, choice and redress. The Best Practice Model aims to increase consumer confidence in business to consumer ... electronic commerce.
Adoption of the Model will help to ensure that consumers are adequately protected and have confidence in making online transactions.
...	...	...
The adoption of the Best Practice Model will contribute to ensuring that consumers have effective protection and confidence in making online transactions.
It goes on and on and on. The specific clauses that deal with the debacle this government has got itself into in its mindless pursuit to spend billions of dollars of ordinary taxpayers' money to sell the GST, to break the Commonwealth electoral laws by taking illegally the Commonwealth Electoral Act in the tax office, and finally to breach its own privacy guidelines and its own e-commerce guidelines to sell this GST at any cost are stated quite clearly here for commercial email in section 23, `Advertising and marketing':
23.1	Businesses should not send commercial e-mail except:
23.1.1	to people with whom they have an existing relationship; or
23.1.2	to people who have already said they want to receive commercial e-mail;
How could any consumer who supplied the tax office with their email address in the last six months have possibly consented to any of those? It gets worse for the tax office. Section 23.2 goes on to say:
23.2	Businesses should have simple procedures so that consumers can let them know they do not want to receive commercial e-mail.
That is colloquially referred to as `spamming'. It is quite clear; they are simple procedures. 
All we have heard from the other side and Senator Kemp is waffle, because they know that you had to dig through eight pages of the booklet that accompanied the ABN form. It is not on the ABN form. There are no simple procedures. Eight pages through they tell you that some information may be on-sold. They do not tell you what it is. They do not give you the option the government is telling businesses to give—to tick in the box saying, `Yes, I am prepared to have my information on-sold.' What happened yesterday to Peter Reith on the tele? He got pinged good and proper. What did he say? He said, `We've got the Privacy Commissioner having a look at it.' What did Senator Kemp and Senator Alston say today? They said, `No, he's not.' Any lie, just to get out of being caught on national tele misleading the Australian public. He went on to say, `I'll certainly be having a close look at it.' What have we heard today? Nothing. 
—Are you sure that wasn't Joe Hockey?
—No. Even Mark Paterson, the government muppet on the GST, said, `Most individuals would not have understood they were an entity. I would not have thought an individual receiving this would have believed their home address was going to be publicly available.' This is the government's main muppet on the GST. It is the one person they push out every day of the week to support the GST.
The tax office assistant commissioner in charge of the ABN, Greg Dark, said on Friday, `We've been observing the law. The law says the email addresses will be available on the register for a $20 fee.' Well, where is the choice? Where are the government making the tax office stick to the same rules they want business to stick to? They are hypocrites on this issue. They know they are at fault. Senator Kemp took the question on notice. He has had three days to find a copy of the government's own best practice guidelines issued just last month. He could not do it because he knows they are in breach of their basic requirements. These are the absolutely basic requirements of e-commerce best practice.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-06-05,"—The other day I was looking at a book written by the member for Werriwa, Mr Latham, Civilising Global Capital. In the foreword, Mr Whitlam says that the Labor Party has always been a party of reform, that it has always renovated ideas of public policy throughout the history of this nation.
—It used to.
—It used to, indeed. That is quite right. It no longer does. It is simply the party of reaction. I was sitting here scribbling some notes down and I thought I would give a general outline of Labor Party policy before I get to the issue of privacy. I was thinking to myself: Ben Chifley used to talk about socialism, Whitlam used to talk about social democracy then Keynesianism, Mr Hawke used to talk about corporatism and consensus, then Mr Beazley used to talk about pragmatism. Now what is left? The ALP only talks about opportunism and not much else.
This is another scab lift. The ALP is again trying to extract as much political gain as possible from necessary reform. I accept that the privacy issue is a vital one in the country. In fact, I am delighted because it is great that the Australian Labor Party is again adopting liberal democratic ideas. It is a good thing. We on this side have always said that the state should serve the individual rather than the individual serve the state. For that reason we have always been great protectors of privacy. It is concurrent with our ideology: the individual is always above the state.
Senator Chapman spoke directly about issues relating to privacy in the Australian Taxation Office. He put it very well and very lucidly. Perhaps the most important thing he mentioned was that the legislation—that is, the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999—has always provided for the public availability of this information. This was explained in writing in the ABN registration guide and is also on the business entry point web site where businesses register for the ABN.
Senator Kemp and then Senator Chapman mentioned the full extent of the publicly available information which will be held in the ABR and will be available from 1 July only to those paying $20 per record for an extract and 10 cents for any additional pages. That is really the point. There is nothing new about this. It is just another scab lift. That is the depressing part about this. These are the things available: ABN, date of effect of the registration, legal name, entity type, trading or business name, postal address for service of notices and correspondence, main business address, email address for service of notices and correspondence, Australian company number or Australian registered body number, name of the public officer or the trustee of a trust, GST registration status and date of effect, deductible gift recipient status and date of effect, date of effect of reinstatement to the Australian Business Register and industry code. 
The Australian Labor Party are Australia's oldest political party. They were a great party of reform. But since my time in the Senate—11 months now—all they have had to offer to the Australian people are rejections of things they know this country has to have. The greatest threat to Australian democracy is not, in fact, a Labor victory; it is an Australian Labor Party victory by default, because they have nothing left to add. The Australian Labor Party know there has to be indirect tax; they know there has to be a reform of the taxation system, and deep in their hearts, if they are returned to government, they know that they will sell Telstra—we know that and they know that. 
—You know that is not true.
—That is the sad thing about it. I would not mind if we had an honest policy debate here. Senator Carr and I disagree on a lot of things but I will say this: at least he stands up for something. The ALP stand for absolutely nothing in this place except objections to policy that in their heart of hearts they actually believe in.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I think we are discussing, in response to the so-called answers from Senator Kemp to my colleague Senator Lundy, the revelation of the making available of a range of new data to anyone in this country, or overseas for that matter, that was not available prior to the introduction of the goods and services tax in the format—and I think that is very important to understand—that is available through the tax office. Up until this point in time, I was not aware that we had in this country a database involving 2½ million individuals involved in business, most of whom were not on a business database up until this time. Through that access a range of information is available including, most importantly, email addresses. The contributors to this debate, including Senator Kemp in his attempt to answer the questions, fairly glibly read out the list of information that was available. Some of it is innocuous but the provision of email addresses is quite critical, I think, for fairly obvious reasons. The use of email is a massive new marketing tool in this country. Why else would the companies that have purchased this material want it other than to access the email database?
With the GST and the registration for ABN numbers we have got well over two million individuals and businesses, for which this information is available, being registered for the first time. The old wholesale sales tax that is often derided by the government was simple, at least in terms of the number of collection points. But we have now well over two million new tax collectors. I think that is one of the important issues in this debate about the availability of information. This will be a very powerful marketing tool for the commercial organisations that choose to access the information.
But there is a second and very important related issue to this. It is taking the data that is being made available by the tax office and then cross-marrying that information with other publicly available records, particularly telephone numbers. So we have 2½ million ABN numbers, presumably close to that number of email addresses available for the first time in this form, together with the marrying of other information. This will form a massive new marketing and promotional tool.
It would not be so bad if the businesses that were registering for an ABN number knew about it, but they did not. I have the form here, an eight-page form, an application for registration for the new tax system. Without filling in this form and completing it, you do not have an ABN number. Of course you can refuse to do it, but then you will be hit with a 48.5 per cent tax. So effectively you have to complete this form otherwise there is a severe tax penalty. 
We can put aside the issue of 2½ million mainly small businesses and individuals having to fill out this form. It is eight pages long. It says on the back of the form that it should take you 40 minutes to complete. But nowhere on the form that these people have to fill in does it make it clear—it just does not tell them—that their email addresses will be made available or sold to promotional companies. Nowhere does it even refer to the public access to this information. That is a critical point. You should not have to go to the guide to registration or go to another document. We all know the reality for most small businesses—they are struggling to keep up with the GST paperwork, let alone having to cross-reference, to more documentation, more paperwork.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
—I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The statement read as follows—
Madam President, the report I have just tabled is the result of a lengthy and sometimes frustrating inquiry.
The reference to the Committee concerned the proposed spot purchase of 50 house-and-land packages by the Defence Housing Authority, the DHA, in a housing development called Parap Grove in Darwin.
These houses were to provide Australian Defence Force personnel and their families a secure suburban environment with good access to community facilities.
The reference estimated the cost of these house-and-land packages at $17.5 million at July 1999 prices.
This reference to the Committee took place only after the DHA approached the Committee to consider having the project exempted from the Committee's consideration.  This was in the context of an urgent need to provide housing for Defence personnel in Darwin.
The Committee was unable to agree to this request.  The Public Works Committee Act provides for grounds for exemption and these were not met.
After the Committee was referred the proposal, the Committee held a public hearing in Darwin in October 1999 and a later hearing with DHA in Canberra during February this year.
In early March, the DHA advised the Committee that the DHA did not want to pursue the Parap Grove development.  The DHA's reasons for not continuing with the proposal were given as:
the appointment of a voluntary administrator to the project home developer, Bayview Homes;
additional responsibilities given to DHA by the Department of Defence; and 
the urgency that drove the need for this development was no longer a critical factor.
The Committee explored these reasons further.  This included asking the then Head of Defence Personnel Executive, Major General Peter Dunn, to appear before the Committee.  This occurred on 16 March this year.
At this hearing, Major General Dunn informed the Committee that the DHA Board had not approved the Parap Grove project.
In the Committee's opinion this reference has been poorly managed and it has therefore recommended that the Australian National Audit Office examine the matter.
In conclusion, Madame President, it would appear that this proposal was developed in the context of perceived urgency.
Whether or not there is a perceived urgency for works, the Committee's response is always the same—every reference from Parliament will be thoroughly investigated.

The Committee explored these reasons further.  This included asking the then Head of Defence Personnel Executive, Major General Peter Dunn, to appear before the Committee.  This occurred on 16 March this year.
At this hearing, Major General Dunn informed the Committee that the DHA Board had not approved the Parap Grove project.
In the Committee's opinion this reference has been poorly managed and it has therefore recommended that the Australian National Audit Office examine the matter.
In conclusion, Madame President, it would appear that this proposal was developed in the context of perceived urgency.
Whether or not there is a perceived urgency for works, the Committee's response is always the same—every reference from Parliament will be thoroughly investigated.

Response by Dr Malcolm Colston to Senator Ray's Second Reading Speech on the Norfolk Island Amendment Bill 1999 [2000] 9 March 2000 
In Senator Ray's speech mentioned above, in part he stated that I “went over to Norfolk Island, stayed with the Administrator and claimed travel allowance”. At no time did I stay with the Administrator. I appreciated the Administrator's hospitality when, accompanied by Mrs Kerr, he took my wife and me to a local restaurant. I recall I also attended a group function at his residence and, with other members of a joint parliamentary committee attended a dinner, also hosted at his residence. I stress, however, that at no time did I stay at the Administrator's residence. On my visits to Norfolk Island, I resided in either a guest house or in self-contained accommodation and paid normal commercial rates.
Senator Ray also mentioned that Senator Faulkner rejected my “supplications” about the position of Administrator of Norfolk Island on the basis that Senator Faulkner regarded me “as a time-serving place seeker”. It is not my intention to reveal details of private conversations unless I feel I am compelled to do so, but that was not the impression I gained from Senator Faulkner. Suffice to say that Senator Faulkner's predecessors in the Territories portfolio, Mrs Kelly and Senator Richardson, gave their full support and my first visit to Norfolk Island resulted from Mrs Kelly's suggestion that I should do so.
Senator Ray stated that “the citizens of Norfolk Island certainly made their views known by signing a petition — 800-odd, I think — pleading with us not to appoint the then Senator Colston”. I do know there was a petition circulated on Norfolk Island to extend the term of the then Administrator, but I have no knowledge of a petition as described by Senator Ray. In fact, I doubt that such a petition exists other than in the imagination of Senator Ray or those who advise him.
During the course of his speech, Senator Ray claimed that I “did a grand tour of all the territories to see which one he [Colston] would like the most”. The latter part of this assertion is incorrect. I would remind honourable senators that a joint committee of which I was a member had a reference in relation to three external territories, namely Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island. The committee was obliged to visit each of these territories and I do so in company with other members of the committee and support staff.

That the Senate take note of the report.
The Senate referred this inquiry into Gulf St Vincent to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on 26 August last year. The reference reflected concerns over the environment of Gulf St Vincent and the quality of the gulf's waters. Gulf St Vincent is the smaller of the two gulfs in South Australia and one which, I might say, was not at all familiar to me prior to embarking on this inquiry. However, having done so, I can say that many of the issues raised were similar to those that might be raised anywhere else in Australia where we have cities close to the coast—and that is most of our cities. It is a valuable asset to the state. In recent years there has been greater awareness of environmental issues facing Gulf St Vincent, but the inquiry found that more needs to be done to protect the gulf from further environmental degradation. In this respect, one of the main recommendations of the report calls for an increase in the level of resources currently available for raising awareness of the environmental threats to the gulf from all levels of government. Further, governments need to increase resources for community education programs about possible solutions to some of the pollution and degradation problems. 
The committee acknowledges that the role of the South Australian Environment Protection Agency is paramount to the protection and enhancement of the gulf environment. The committee therefore urges the South Australian government to give enhanced statutory powers and greater flexibility and independence to the EPA to enable the latter to take appropriate action to protect Gulf St Vincent more effectively. In the view of the committee, the Environment Protection Agency could achieve more positive results if it were given enhanced powers to act independently of government in environmental matters. The committee was persuaded by the argument put forward by South Australian environmental groups that South Australia should update its coastal management legislation. The committee notes that other states have already updated their equivalent legislation and recommends that the South Australian government consider this option.
A number of the report's recommendations call for increased Commonwealth funding, especially in the areas of strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation of programs related to the gulf. In particular, the committee recommends that the Commonwealth provide funding through the Coastal and Marine Planning Program for the Environment Protection Agency of South Australia to develop a planning strategy for Gulf St Vincent. Increased Commonwealth funding is also sought for the Adelaide Coastal Waters Study. In addition, the committee recommends that the Commonwealth and South Australian governments increase funding for the monitoring and evaluation of programs aimed at cleaning up the waters and environment of the gulf. The South Australian government and local government agencies are of course ideally placed to enhance protection measures in relation to the gulf environment, especially through increased cooperation. To this end, the committee recommends improved mechanisms for liaison between state and local government agencies in relation to the management of gulf waters and the coastal environment of the gulf. The committee also believes that improved communication between representatives of the catchment water management boards, local councils and relevant state government agencies through regular meetings would lead to a more effective, integrated approach to programs aimed at improving water quality and the general environment of the gulf.
The committee also makes some specific recommendations in relation to a number of current environmental concerns affecting the gulf environment. These include an embargo on pumping from wells or bores on coastal dunes and adjacent regions until an investigation into the ground water reservoirs has been undertaken, making the licence to be issued to the Pelican Point power station conditional on measures being taken to prevent thermal pollution, carrying out an independent assessment of the effects and future potential of prawn fishing in the Gulf St Vincent area, and prohibiting the use of tributyl tin on small craft.
In conclusion, water quality problems in the gulf are well documented. Many of the problems are impacting on the gulf and even the solutions are already well known. The Commonwealth has approved $1.9 million in funding for rehabilitation programs and projects in the gulf region over the past three years. Ultimately, however, it is fundamental for the state government to be driving the process of the gulf's environmental protection and enhancement, and committing to specific tangible outcomes, such as coordinated public education, statutory planning, agency agreements, capital works and enforcement programs. For its part, the Commonwealth should continue, and indeed enhance, its support to the efforts of the state and local governments to protect the environment of Gulf St Vincent.
I would like to thank members of the committee for delivering to the Senate a unanimous report—the second for the day, I understand—and also the committee secretariat: Roxane Le Guen, Stephanie Holden and Angela Mututu. I thank Senator Bolkus for his excellent photograph, which appears on the cover of the report. I also thank those who made submissions.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I also rise to speak on this report. I make it clear from the start that when Senator Allison refers to my photo it is not a photo of me, it is a photo of something much more attractive: a number of dolphins in the gulf. Once again, I think the committee agrees with that assessment. I would like to start by thanking the Senate staff and other senators for the attitude and approach they have taken in respect of this issue and the time they have taken to go through the evidence, to hear the witnesses and to come up with, once again, a unanimous report of this committee.
It is opportune that we are tabling this report into the state of the environment of Gulf St Vincent today, because today is World Environment Day. The subject of this inquiry and report is an example of an unsustainable use of a resource. This morning in Adelaide, which lies on the shores of the gulf, the Deputy Director of the United Nations environment program, Mr Kakakhel, addressed the South Australian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry at a World Environment Day breakfast. In a pretty strong speech, calling for leadership from Australia, the Deputy Director told his audience that `Australia can reverse the adverse trends' and warned us that the `world is watching Australia'. Speaking to both industry and government, he went on to say:
... if Australia cannot manage to change, how can the rest of the world be expected to change?
That is quite a strong message and one that is quite appropriate here, because this is an example of where governments need to lift their game and deliver on the environment. In the area discussed in the report, the environment department has reduced spending on coasts and marine environments from some $53.3 million last year to some $46.5 million this year. It is expected to fall to only some $3.5 million once the Natural Heritage Trust runs out. This is no way to ensure responsible, long-term environmental protection of our coastline. Although the inquiry was specific to the gulf, there are lessons that we can take from this inquiry to apply to all coastal environments and indeed all environments under pressure. Governments and communities must start to work more closely together. The federal government can and must take a leadership role to reverse adverse trends.
In August last year, I moved that the Senate refer the state of the environment of Gulf St Vincent for inquiry by this committee. I did so for a number of reasons. One, the state of the environment in the gulf is deteriorating rapidly. Two, the community was concerned and continues to be concerned that the environment is not being protected. Three, industry is concerned about decreasing fish stocks. The gulf is essentially Adelaide's back yard. Like most other South Australians, I am appalled that the decline has been allowed to continue unchecked for so long. The evidence we heard about the current environmental damage and impending decline in Gulf St Vincent was compelling. The current management regime is clearly failing the gulf's ecosystems and the communities which live and work around the gulf. The gulf is a valuable asset to South Australia and one that we cannot afford to neglect. It supports an abundant aquatic system, provides an important sea link to other cities, produces fish and seafood. and provides the basis for a wide range of recreational activities including attractive beaches and coastal scenery. But it has been the dump for sewage effluent and sludge, industrial effluent, urban run-off, dredging material and other unwanted material.
One problem is that there is no information available on the cost of this pollution to the marine environment from loss of fisheries production, effects on biodiversity, nuisance and loss of amenity and access. There are increasing pressures for its resources between various users. The most significant marine areas under threat in South Australia are in Gulf St Vincent and in particular the Adelaide metropolitan coastal water zone. With Kangaroo Island at its mouth, the gulf takes up to 100 days to flush through and it takes longer for pollutants to disperse. Twice a month, the gulf can experience dodge tides, where tidal movements almost cease. Its highly saline water often acts as an inverse estuary. All of these impacts combine to make the gulf less able to cope with the pressures of stormwater run-off and other discharges. Yet despite these pressures Gulf St Vincent has a range of habitats and regions globally significant for temperate biodiversity. It has a high level of uniqueness of species and contains some of the most extensive areas of temperate mangrove forests and seagrass meadows in Australia. These habitats are of considerable ecological and economic importance. The gulf is used for fishing, shipping, boating, dredging, aquaculture, salt production, tourism, and recreation and heritage. Evidence presented to us during the inquiry illustrated quite clearly that the wide-ranging and serious nature of the impacts currently affecting the gulf cannot be allowed to continue unabated. It is quite clear that `business as usual' is completely inadequate.  
We received quite a number of submissions from a diverse range of organisations in South Australia. The Conservation Council of South Australia identified four major ongoing impacts on the ecological sustainability of the gulf. These are pollution, direct habitat damage and destruction, overharvesting of living marine organisations, and introduced marine pests. The Senate committee report that we are tabling today has taken into account much of the evidence, if not all of it. I think it is fair to say that we recommend that there needs to be urgent action taken with an increased funding commitment and a brand new approach to the management of the gulf. As I say, it is clear that `business as usual' is completely inadequate in dealing with the environmental protection of this gulf.
Senator Allison has gone through the various recommendations of the committee extensively. It is worth repeating one of two of them to give them emphasis. The importance of the Commonwealth providing funding for the development of a planning strategy for the gulf cannot be understated. The South Australia government needs to consider an overhaul of the current coastal protection legislation with the introduction of a new coastal and marine planning management act. It is important to ensure that there is an adequate monitoring of activities, and in that respect we have recommended that the South Australian government give enhanced statutory powers, greater flexibility and independence to the South Australian Environment Protection Agency to allow it to take action to protect the environment more effectively. There is a need for increased Commonwealth and state funding to provide for monitoring and program evaluation.
Other recommendations go into the role of AQIS in terms of marine pests from visiting vessels, and the need for additional funding for the Adelaide coastal waters study. It is important, as Senator Allison also indicated, that there be an embargo on pumping from wells or bores on coastal dunes. In the context of the Pelican Point power station, evidence was given to the committee to the effect that if Adelaide was to take care of its dolphin population then it could be as great a tourist attraction to it as the dolphins are to Monkey Mia in Western Australia. That sort of evidence was taken into account and we have made a recommendation that the licence to be issued to Pelican Point power station be made conditional on measures being taken to prevent thermal pollution. Another issue which continues to plague the gulf is the proposed Barcoo outlet. That outlet is something which I am sure the state government in South Australia needs to reconsider. It is almost offensive to go ahead with an outlet which will have already proven negative impacts on Adelaide's coastal marine environment.
Gulf St Vincent, like the River Murray, I believe, is an example of the failure of both state and Commonwealth governments to recognise and address environmental decline. In this case, the three tiers of government must work together to address issues of stormwater run-off, effluent discharge, marine pests, algal bloom, fish stock decline and the loss of sea grass and mangroves. That loss of sea grass and mangroves is affecting the state of the beaches close to Adelaide. 
We believe, and it is the view of the committee, that the Commonwealth can take a lead role in the restoration of the gulf and the setting up of appropriate mechanisms to ensure ongoing protection of the gulf environment. In fact, the state and Commonwealth governments must come together to fully develop a management plan and start implementing solutions. As I say, we cannot continue down the road that we have been going. `Business, as usual' is completely inadequate to handle the gulf's problems.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-05,"—While I am a participating member, I was not able to sit in on the hearings of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee. However I have frequently been in Adelaide and on the shores of Gulf St Vincent in recent years and am very aware of the environmental degradation that has taken place there, with the continual erosion of the environmental amenity of that important part of Australia's ecosystems. I commend the committee on the recommendations, insofar as they have gone. But I want to pick up on two which did not go far enough. 
The first is the one that Senator Bolkus just finished with, and that is the business of the Barcoo outlet. Yesterday I sat in on the World Environment Day ceremony in Adelaide. Senator Bolkus was there, but it was essentially a government function and Premier Olsen gave a speech at the start of that. Two things were notable there: firstly, that Coffs Harbour council won the award for excellence. Just five or 10 years ago I was at Coffs Harbour with protestors, including some of the now council members, fighting against a sewage outfall at Look-at-Me-Now headland into the beautiful waters just north of Coffs Harbour. That sewage outfall has been stopped and options have been taken up. That is one of the reasons Coffs Harbour council was getting an award for excellence. 
But here we have, in Adelaide, a $17 million proposal to simply pipe stormwater and treated sewage from further up the catchment out of the Patawalonga river system straight through the sand dunes into the sea and swimming environment 200 metres offshore at West Beach. Nothing could be more an affront to the environmental sensitivities of Adelaidians, and indeed Australians, as we go into the 21st century. To simply put in a pipe and allow stormwater to flow out onto the beach untreated whenever there is an overflow is early 19th century technology. That is simply not good enough. The recommendation should have been totally against that Barcoo outflow. Premier Olsen ought to take a leaf out of the book of the Coffs Harbour City Council and implement treatment of stormwater flow, as well as sewage coming down from the Heathfield plant, totally on land in the Adelaide environs. We have the technology. They did not have it 50 years ago but we do have it now. That treatment should be total. The nutrients from the sewage and stormwater ought to be recycled for use on land and the water ought to be returned to the system of the Patawalonga and its outflow, then as clean water to the beach.
The second thing is the AQIS recommendation. The committee recommends that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service take an active role in monitoring the possible introduction of marine pests from visiting vessels in the Gulf St Vincent area and appropriate action to minimise the problem. Those are waffle words. It is not just AQIS; it is the minister and the government in control who should be providing the amenity to protect not just Gulf St Vincent but the whole of the Australian littoral from the impact of imported pests which are going to cost this nation billions of dollars. There is reference in this report to the Mediterranean fan worm spreading in Port Phillip and suffocating the marine environment there and spreading to equally suffocate marine environments in South Australia. That happened because a ship brought it in as ballast, but ships sometimes bring in limpet species to Australian waters and it happens because we do not invest, as a nation, in ensuring that ballast water never gets here and that the hulls of ships coming here are clean of imported species. It is not just a matter of billions of dollars being saved in the nation's future by a more appropriate investment now, but of stopping our marine systems from being marauded and a whole host of species going to extinction. 
We are still in an age when, as this report says, we want monitoring and appropriate action to minimise the problem. We want the problem stopped. It can be stopped. If that means that people involved in trade have to pay a very marginal cost to ensure these pests are not brought into the country then commonsense dictates that is what we should be doing. This inquiry has enhanced the fears of South Australians that Gulf St Vincent's ecological systems are in a spiral down. It provides some of the answers as to how to stop that but it no doubt will take action at all levels from the community—and it seems local government in South Australia is way ahead of state government and of federal government—to ensure that this degradation and this spiral down are not only stopped but also reversed so that Gulf State Vincent gets the opportunity to have its natural ecosystems restored. That means an economic and job creation plus for the whole region and, as well, a lift in lifestyle values which is going to keep people in the region and, indeed, attract people to the region in the future.

It is opportune that we are tabling this report into the state of the environment of Gulf St Vincent today, because today is World Environment Day. The subject of this inquiry and report is an example of an unsustainable use of a resource. This morning in Adelaide, which lies on the shores of the gulf, the Deputy Director of the United Nations environment program, Mr Kakakhel, addressed the South Australian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry at a World Environment Day breakfast. In a pretty strong speech, calling for leadership from Australia, the Deputy Director told his audience that `Australia can reverse the adverse trends' and warned us that the `world is watching Australia'. Speaking to both industry and government, he went on to say:
... if Australia cannot manage to change, how can the rest of the world be expected to change?
That is quite a strong message and one that is quite appropriate here, because this is an example of where governments need to lift their game and deliver on the environment. In the area discussed in the report, the environment department has reduced spending on coasts and marine environments from some $53.3 million last year to some $46.5 million this year. It is expected to fall to only some $3.5 million once the Natural Heritage Trust runs out. This is no way to ensure responsible, long-term environmental protection of our coastline. Although the inquiry was specific to the gulf, there are lessons that we can take from this inquiry to apply to all coastal environments and indeed all environments under pressure. Governments and communities must start to work more closely together. The federal government can and must take a leadership role to reverse adverse trends.
In August last year, I moved that the Senate refer the state of the environment of Gulf St Vincent for inquiry by this committee. I did so for a number of reasons. One, the state of the environment in the gulf is deteriorating rapidly. Two, the community was concerned and continues to be concerned that the environment is not being protected. Three, industry is concerned about decreasing fish stocks. The gulf is essentially Adelaide's back yard. Like most other South Australians, I am appalled that the decline has been allowed to continue unchecked for so long. The evidence we heard about the current environmental damage and impending decline in Gulf St Vincent was compelling. The current management regime is clearly failing the gulf's ecosystems and the communities which live and work around the gulf. The gulf is a valuable asset to South Australia and one that we cannot afford to neglect. It supports an abundant aquatic system, provides an important sea link to other cities, produces fish and seafood. and provides the basis for a wide range of recreational activities including attractive beaches and coastal scenery. But it has been the dump for sewage effluent and sludge, industrial effluent, urban run-off, dredging material and other unwanted material.
One problem is that there is no information available on the cost of this pollution to the marine environment from loss of fisheries production, effects on biodiversity, nuisance and loss of amenity and access. There are increasing pressures for its resources between various users. The most significant marine areas under threat in South Australia are in Gulf St Vincent and in particular the Adelaide metropolitan coastal water zone. With Kangaroo Island at its mouth, the gulf takes up to 100 days to flush through and it takes longer for pollutants to disperse. Twice a month, the gulf can experience dodge tides, where tidal movements almost cease. Its highly saline water often acts as an inverse estuary. All of these impacts combine to make the gulf less able to cope with the pressures of stormwater run-off and other discharges. Yet despite these pressures Gulf St Vincent has a range of habitats and regions globally significant for temperate biodiversity. It has a high level of uniqueness of species and contains some of the most extensive areas of temperate mangrove forests and seagrass meadows in Australia. These habitats are of considerable ecological and economic importance. The gulf is used for fishing, shipping, boating, dredging, aquaculture, salt production, tourism, and recreation and heritage. Evidence presented to us during the inquiry illustrated quite clearly that the wide-ranging and serious nature of the impacts currently affecting the gulf cannot be allowed to continue unabated. It is quite clear that `business as usual' is completely inadequate.  
We received quite a number of submissions from a diverse range of organisations in South Australia. The Conservation Council of South Australia identified four major ongoing impacts on the ecological sustainability of the gulf. These are pollution, direct habitat damage and destruction, overharvesting of living marine organisations, and introduced marine pests. The Senate committee report that we are tabling today has taken into account much of the evidence, if not all of it. I think it is fair to say that we recommend that there needs to be urgent action taken with an increased funding commitment and a brand new approach to the management of the gulf. As I say, it is clear that `business as usual' is completely inadequate in dealing with the environmental protection of this gulf.
Senator Allison has gone through the various recommendations of the committee extensively. It is worth repeating one of two of them to give them emphasis. The importance of the Commonwealth providing funding for the development of a planning strategy for the gulf cannot be understated. The South Australia government needs to consider an overhaul of the current coastal protection legislation with the introduction of a new coastal and marine planning management act. It is important to ensure that there is an adequate monitoring of activities, and in that respect we have recommended that the South Australian government give enhanced statutory powers, greater flexibility and independence to the South Australian Environment Protection Agency to allow it to take action to protect the environment more effectively. There is a need for increased Commonwealth and state funding to provide for monitoring and program evaluation.
Other recommendations go into the role of AQIS in terms of marine pests from visiting vessels, and the need for additional funding for the Adelaide coastal waters study. It is important, as Senator Allison also indicated, that there be an embargo on pumping from wells or bores on coastal dunes. In the context of the Pelican Point power station, evidence was given to the committee to the effect that if Adelaide was to take care of its dolphin population then it could be as great a tourist attraction to it as the dolphins are to Monkey Mia in Western Australia. That sort of evidence was taken into account and we have made a recommendation that the licence to be issued to Pelican Point power station be made conditional on measures being taken to prevent thermal pollution. Another issue which continues to plague the gulf is the proposed Barcoo outlet. That outlet is something which I am sure the state government in South Australia needs to reconsider. It is almost offensive to go ahead with an outlet which will have already proven negative impacts on Adelaide's coastal marine environment.
Gulf St Vincent, like the River Murray, I believe, is an example of the failure of both state and Commonwealth governments to recognise and address environmental decline. In this case, the three tiers of government must work together to address issues of stormwater run-off, effluent discharge, marine pests, algal bloom, fish stock decline and the loss of sea grass and mangroves. That loss of sea grass and mangroves is affecting the state of the beaches close to Adelaide. 
We believe, and it is the view of the committee, that the Commonwealth can take a lead role in the restoration of the gulf and the setting up of appropriate mechanisms to ensure ongoing protection of the gulf environment. In fact, the state and Commonwealth governments must come together to fully develop a management plan and start implementing solutions. As I say, we cannot continue down the road that we have been going. `Business, as usual' is completely inadequate to handle the gulf's problems.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-05,"—While I am a participating member, I was not able to sit in on the hearings of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee. However I have frequently been in Adelaide and on the shores of Gulf St Vincent in recent years and am very aware of the environmental degradation that has taken place there, with the continual erosion of the environmental amenity of that important part of Australia's ecosystems. I commend the committee on the recommendations, insofar as they have gone. But I want to pick up on two which did not go far enough. 
The first is the one that Senator Bolkus just finished with, and that is the business of the Barcoo outlet. Yesterday I sat in on the World Environment Day ceremony in Adelaide. Senator Bolkus was there, but it was essentially a government function and Premier Olsen gave a speech at the start of that. Two things were notable there: firstly, that Coffs Harbour council won the award for excellence. Just five or 10 years ago I was at Coffs Harbour with protestors, including some of the now council members, fighting against a sewage outfall at Look-at-Me-Now headland into the beautiful waters just north of Coffs Harbour. That sewage outfall has been stopped and options have been taken up. That is one of the reasons Coffs Harbour council was getting an award for excellence. 
But here we have, in Adelaide, a $17 million proposal to simply pipe stormwater and treated sewage from further up the catchment out of the Patawalonga river system straight through the sand dunes into the sea and swimming environment 200 metres offshore at West Beach. Nothing could be more an affront to the environmental sensitivities of Adelaidians, and indeed Australians, as we go into the 21st century. To simply put in a pipe and allow stormwater to flow out onto the beach untreated whenever there is an overflow is early 19th century technology. That is simply not good enough. The recommendation should have been totally against that Barcoo outflow. Premier Olsen ought to take a leaf out of the book of the Coffs Harbour City Council and implement treatment of stormwater flow, as well as sewage coming down from the Heathfield plant, totally on land in the Adelaide environs. We have the technology. They did not have it 50 years ago but we do have it now. That treatment should be total. The nutrients from the sewage and stormwater ought to be recycled for use on land and the water ought to be returned to the system of the Patawalonga and its outflow, then as clean water to the beach.
The second thing is the AQIS recommendation. The committee recommends that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service take an active role in monitoring the possible introduction of marine pests from visiting vessels in the Gulf St Vincent area and appropriate action to minimise the problem. Those are waffle words. It is not just AQIS; it is the minister and the government in control who should be providing the amenity to protect not just Gulf St Vincent but the whole of the Australian littoral from the impact of imported pests which are going to cost this nation billions of dollars. There is reference in this report to the Mediterranean fan worm spreading in Port Phillip and suffocating the marine environment there and spreading to equally suffocate marine environments in South Australia. That happened because a ship brought it in as ballast, but ships sometimes bring in limpet species to Australian waters and it happens because we do not invest, as a nation, in ensuring that ballast water never gets here and that the hulls of ships coming here are clean of imported species. It is not just a matter of billions of dollars being saved in the nation's future by a more appropriate investment now, but of stopping our marine systems from being marauded and a whole host of species going to extinction. 
We are still in an age when, as this report says, we want monitoring and appropriate action to minimise the problem. We want the problem stopped. It can be stopped. If that means that people involved in trade have to pay a very marginal cost to ensure these pests are not brought into the country then commonsense dictates that is what we should be doing. This inquiry has enhanced the fears of South Australians that Gulf St Vincent's ecological systems are in a spiral down. It provides some of the answers as to how to stop that but it no doubt will take action at all levels from the community—and it seems local government in South Australia is way ahead of state government and of federal government—to ensure that this degradation and this spiral down are not only stopped but also reversed so that Gulf State Vincent gets the opportunity to have its natural ecosystems restored. That means an economic and job creation plus for the whole region and, as well, a lift in lifestyle values which is going to keep people in the region and, indeed, attract people to the region in the future. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,31,2,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-06-05,"—by leave—Pursuant to standing order 78(1), I give notice that, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, I will withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 3 standing in my name for the next day of sitting for the disallowance of the Public Service Commissioner's directions and business of the Senate notices of motion Nos 1 and 2 standing in my name for four sitting days after today for the disallowance of the Public Service Regulations and Parliamentary Service Determination 1999/2 respectively. I seek leave to make a very short statement in relation to the withdrawal of these disallowance motions.
Leave granted.
—In giving notice of my intention to withdraw these disallowance motions, I wish to inform the Senate that the opposition has a continuing concern about chapter 5 of the Public Service Commissioner's directions. This chapter sets out the basic requirements for procedures to determine breaches of the Public Service code of conduct. The opposition regards the lack of detail in relation to these basic procedures as a breach of the spirit of the amendment made to the act following our negotiations with the government. The purpose of the amendment to the act on this matter was to ensure that there was maximum consistency across the APS in these procedures. There is already an unnecessary and growing divergence across the APS on how the procedures are applied. 
I have raised this matter with the government, along with a number of other matters of lesser concern to us. The government has indicated that it is not prepared to have the direction amended at this time. In the absence of a more detailed set of fair procedures, the opposition believes these matters will ultimately be argued out in the Federal Court through an appropriate case. This is not in the interests of the Commonwealth or APS employees. We are disappointed that the government has not agreed to tighten the directions in this regard, but have decided not to proceed with our disallowance motions in the interests of facilitating the already complex task of bedding down the new act in the Public Service. Instead we have asked the government to commit to a review of the new procedures within the next 12 months. We have also asked that interested parties be given an opportunity to contribute to this review. We are pleased that the government has agreed to ask the Public Service Commissioner to undertake such a review, and we look forward to the results with interest. Let me also assure the Senate that a future Labor government will give priority to addressing this deficiency in the government's current disciplinary framework in the Australian Public Service.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-05,"—I would like to make a short statement on Senator Conroy's amendments to the A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000. I responded to Senator Conroy's description of why he thought we needed the amendments. Senator Murray then explained that he had not really had enough notice of the amendments and was not really convinced of the need for the amendments but was willing to listen to further debate. 
Senator Conroy made the point just before we broke for question time that there was either a threat or a perceived threat from the ACCC if someone was going to make some comment on issues related to the implementation of the new tax system, particularly the GST. I think Senator Conroy said that some people may even be scared to debate the cost of compliance. I think even Senator Conroy would agree that compliance costs will differ from business to business, from industry to industry and probably from location to location. It will depend a lot on, for example, how computerised they are in relation to their accounting systems, pricing systems and so forth, how many outlets different firms have—a whole range of issues. 
It is a completely sensible debate to be had. It is quite appropriate that people debate all of these implementation issues. I think the point that Senator Conroy makes by talking about people like Mr Harvey and about people feeling threatened about talking about GST price implementation, price impacts and so forth is that, in fact, that debate has been raging. It has been going on in the community for the best part of a year or so, certainly from about the time the government announced the new tax system before the last election. Clearly, that debate has heated up and become a major part of the debate within the business press and the mainstream press as we move towards the 1 July implementation. The real point that is made by Senator Conroy, even though he may not have sought to make it, is that, if people are feeling as if they have been threatened by the ACCC, it is hard to blame this legislation, because it is not actually in force yet.
That debate has been raging and it is a debate that should be had, but there is nothing in this legislation—and certainly nothing in any existing legislation—that would threaten in any way people commenting on issues as to costs of compliance and cost issues. In fact, there has been a raging debate in the last few days since the ACCC's price guide came out about what the price effects will be. Certainly no-one that I have seen in the business community seems threatened; if anything, the business community is engaging in a very healthy, worthwhile debate. I think most people in Australia are very well and truly aware of prices and the fact that there will be price impacts. Most people are aware that a lot of prices will go up; people are less aware of the prices of many items that will come down. So, as I said in my last intervention in the debate, I think the amendment is unnecessary and I hope that Senator Murray in particular agrees with our proposition.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-05,"—I am a little perplexed, frankly. I appreciate the evidentiary remark that the parliamentary secretary has made and that, if this is to be explored at law, you would have had to have specific intent; I think that is the understanding of what `purpose' would mean. As I understand Senator Conroy's proposition, this is about freedom of speech issues and, not wishing to close down the ability of businesses and organisations in particular to express an opinion about these matters, I am sympathetic to that approach. I am just not sure where we end with that particular word. If that word is the issue, then perhaps there is another way of dealing with it, but I am still of the opinion that I do not want to see business organisations prevented from expressing opinions about legislation. The real issue, the real purpose, of price exploitation legislation is to attend to the business, the enterprise, not to attend to its representative bodies, be it the Australian Industry Group, ACCI, the small retailers— 
—The ACTU or anyone.
—Or indeed the ACTU. I am quite sure they have business activities of their own. So, Parliamentary Secretary, I must say I am inclined to the view that the intent of the legislation should be supported. I would search for assistance if the word is such that it may have legal consequences.

This is an attempt to ensure not only that there is some honesty and integrity in the policing of the business community but that we are able to get some honesty and integrity in the government's advertising, as has been debated at some length already in good faith by Senator Murray. There is a lot of controversy about these ads. The government have maintained for some time that they believe that these ads are a fair and accurate representation of the GST package. If that is the case, they should have nothing to fear and they should accept these amendments, because they do nothing more than bring the government under the same umbrella that they are asking the business community to be under. I look forward to hearing the government's view and position on this.
During Senate estimates last week, a number of issues to do with the accuracy of the government's advertising were taken up with the tax office by me and by other Labor senators. Senator Campbell, you may or may not know that we were asking whether or not there was any authorisation on the big billboards that are throughout Melbourne. As my Comcar whizzed by late Friday night, I managed to have a look at one of them on the western ring road. There did not seem to be any government authorisation on the one that I saw. Senator Ray informed me that he managed to avoid an accident on the Tullamarine freeway while looking at one and that there may have been a Commonwealth government logo on it. We are interested in ensuring that the ads represent accurately the government's position and, most importantly, the facts. We took up a number of issues to do with the advertising last week. What is health when you say that health is GST-free? What are all Australian taxpayers? There was a farcical situation last week—Senator Murray, I am not sure if you were with us—when we took up the issue of whether all taxpayers were getting a tax cut. There are about 80,000 taxpayers that do not pay tax. We suddenly had guffaws of laughter from the other side of the table and from some people sitting behind the table. `What an absurd statement! How could there be 80,000 taxpayers who did not pay tax?' Tragically, the tax act defines anyone receiving an income as a taxpayer. But let us not worry about what the tax act says; we were only talking to the tax office! The tax office were in a position where they did not even seem to understand who a taxpayer was or wasn't. We know who they let off: we know that struggling, small Melbourne business, the Packer family and Crown Casino. They are a taxpayer occasionally but they are successful in avoiding a reasonable amount of tax, as you will see if you read the papers. Hopefully, the High Court will rule in the tax office's favour. The Packer family does not seem to pay much tax; maybe they do not think they are a taxpayer either and are therefore not worth chasing! I am being somewhat flippant there. We questioned the tax officials on the accuracy of their ads to do with health and on whether or not tampons were a health product. We questioned them on whether or not bandaids were a health product—and I am sure Senator Crowley could list many other health products— 
—I'm ready to list a few too!
—Senator Sherry is offering to take up the challenge and expand further.
—None of those Tasmanian bush remedies.
—That is right, Senator Murray. There are many different styles of health care that are not exempt from the GST. I know that the Democrats have had concerns in those areas over this package also.
—Didn't do much about it.
—This is the `be nice to the Democrats' five minutes, all right?
—Order, Senator Conroy. Please address the chair.
—If the government honestly believe that they have nothing to fear, that all of their ads are truthful and not deceptive or misleading, they can vote for this and they do not have to worry.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-05,"—by leave—I move the following amendments to Senator Conroy's opposition amendments:
(1)	After subsection 75AYA(2), insert:
	(2A)	A political party registered under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 must not engage in advertising or the distribution of promotional material, at any time during the period starting when this section commences and ending at the end of the New Tax System transition period, that:
	(a)	falsely represents (whether expressly or impliedly) the effect, or likely effect, of all or any of the New Tax System changes; or
	(b)	misleads or deceives, or is likely to mislead or deceive, a person about the effect, or likely effect, of all or any of the New Tax System changes.
(2)	Omit subsection 75AYA(3), substitute:
	(3)	As soon as practicable after each 30 June and 31 December, the Commission must prepare a report detailing any breaches of subsection (2) by the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth that occur during any part of the preceding period of 6 months that is within the New Tax System transition period.
	(4)	If, at any time during the New Tax System Transition period, the Minister believes that the Commission may have breached subsection (2), the Minister must ask the Auditor-General to prepare a report on the possible breach.
	(5)	The Commission or the Auditor-General must give the Minister a written report prepared under subsection (3) or (4).
	(6)	The Minister must cause a report received under subsection (5) to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after he or she receives it.
The Australian Democrats have for two decades now pursued an issue which is best described as truth in political advertising. That particular doctrine has indeed been briefly in Commonwealth law in 1984, but it does reside in South Australian law, and very successfully. What we see here is a desire to improve the way in which advertising is undertaken by the Commonwealth, under any government. Unfortunately, the particular amendment put up by Senator Conroy deals with the new taxation transition period rather than applying as a standard principle throughout. Nevertheless, it has merits in view of both the controversy surrounding these issues and the need for these matters to be above reproach. However, we had to move fairly quickly, and I somewhat gently say to Senator Conroy that the late arrival of these amendments to the Senate, having been foreshadowed by the opposition more than two weeks ago, is not all that helpful. We in turn have had to react rapidly.  
We just do not think your amendment goes far enough. Of course, it is not just the Commonwealth which needs to be attended to, but any political party, frankly, that is registered under the Commonwealth act should also be included in these matters. We ourselves put out promotional and advertising material. I do not think it is appropriate that the government or anybody should be under particular scrutiny in terms of the truth of what they put out, if political parties are not also subject to the same considerations. I have been the recipient of quite a number of Labor Party publications and promotional material on this matter, and I am sure the Labor Party would say that those too should be subject to the same high standards and criteria that they are laying down in their own amendment. That principally is the intent behind my amendment to Labor's amendment, which is item (1) on sheet 1806.
Item (2) deals more with the reporting conditions. We think that those reporting conditions will considerably improve the way in which these matters can be dealt with, and be dealt with in an objective fashion, by the commission and by the Auditor-General. As an example, there is a clause which states:
If, at any time during the New Tax System transition period, the Minister believes that the Commission may have breached subsection (2), the Minister must ask the Auditor-General to prepare a report on the possible breach.
I have always thought the commission an objective if fierce body, and I am sure their report would be very good. I have the highest personal regard for the office of the Auditor-General and the way in which they report, as does my party. So we think that without these amendments (1) and (2) the amendment proposed by the Labor Party would be too limited, would distort their full intent and would be biased. Frankly, if you are going to go about these matters, you must do so in a way which pins everybody who could be affected by the matter at hand. That is all I have to say in support of my amendments to Senator Conroy's item (2).",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-05,"—We will not be supporting amendments that effectively make the ACCC arbiters of a political debate. There are claims and counterclaims made about the effect of any tax changes. They are genuine issues for debate. They are matters that could be debated in the parliament and debated in the public arena, and the government thinks it is entirely inappropriate for the ACCC to do that. We think it is, firstly, entirely ultra vires the legislative framework we are talking about. The Trade Practices Act is about the promotion of competition and fair trading and the provision of consumer protection; it is not about monitoring political debate. The TPA has always been confined to business activity and binds the Commonwealth and its agencies only insofar as the Commonwealth or agency carries on a business. 
I think it is worth pointing out that amendments to the bill will quite clearly only serve to further delay the passage of the bill. It will deprive the ACCC of the desired powers before 1 July and beyond. I think it is fair to say that this amendment is nothing more than a continuation of a political stunt that has been carried on by the opposition in particular. One can only expect a political party that has no policies to come up with stunts from time to time to try and distract political debate and distract attention away from its own paucity of ideas. It is a party that failed to do anything about building a modern tax system. After 1984, when previous Treasurer Keating made a serious attempt at it, with the support of Mr Beazley, virtually nothing else took place. We will not be accepting these amendments.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-05,"—I choose to regard the remarks of the parliamentary secretary as not addressed to my amendments to the amendments. Senator Conroy dropped a late amendment on sheet 1811 on us which means that my amendment should be adjusted slightly. I seek leave to amend my amendment No. 2. 
Leave granted.
—I refer those participating in the debate to item (2) on page 1806, where it says, `Omit subsection 75AYA(3)'. I wish to add the words `and (4)' so that my amended amendment now reads:
(2)	Omit subsections 75AYA(3) and 75AYA(4), substitute:
	(3)	As soon as practicable after each 30 June and 31 December, the Commission must prepare a report detailing any breaches of subsection (2) by the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth that occur during any part of the preceding period of 6 months that is within the New Tax System transition period.
	(4)	If, at any time during the New Tax System Transition period, the Minister believes that the Commission may have breached subsection (2), the Minister must ask the Auditor-General to prepare a report on the possible breach.
	(5)	The Commission or the Auditor-General must give the Minister a written report prepared under subsection (3) or (4).
	(6)	The Minister must cause a report received under subsection (5) to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after he or she receives it.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I have just been reading the Democrat amendments. Our amendments are to ensure that taxpayers' money is not spent in a way which could be false and misleading. Political debate is often robust, as this chamber is witness to. To ask the ACCC to judge political debate—I agree with Senator Ian Campbell—between the two political parties would be to put them in an invidious position. To ask them to judge the truthfulness of government advertising is, I believe, a reasonable thing to do. They have a long history of dealing with advertising on a factual basis—whether or not advertisements are true—and they deal with them every day. To put them in a position where they would be judging political ads in the context of an election campaign would place them in an intolerable position.
—Allan Fels could probably get himself elected president following an election campaign, but I am not sure even Professor Fels has that ambition.
—He is already up for a Logie.
—I will take that, Senator Quirke. He certainly is a proven media performer. I am interested in why you have deleted (3) where we talk about the fine. You seem to have deleted the fine, even if you find someone guilty. I am not sure what the purpose would be of finding someone guilty of something and then nothing happens to them. I would be interested in an explanation.
—Is this a Democrat amendment?
—Yes.
—That figures.
—You are found guilty, but nothing happens to you. I would be interested in the Democrats' explanation of why they sought to delete that section. ",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I have just had a very brief opportunity to look at the amendments you have moved. I think Senator Murray would make the political point that his amendments are a response to amendments that stand in Senator Conroy's name on behalf of the opposition—and they are very good amendments. That would be a perfectly reasonable political point for Senator Murray to make. Without having the amount of time to look as closely at these amendments as I would like, my instinctive reaction is that there are very real issues here in relation to freedom of political expression.
—Get Senator Bolkus to have a look.
—I appreciate that interjection because Senator Bolkus is an acknowledged legal expert in this area. I commend Senator Murray to give some consideration to that matter. And that point holds in relation to amendments (1) and (2) moved by Senator Murray to opposition amendment (2) on sheet 1791. In relation to amendment (3) which stands in Senator Murray's name— 
—That has not been moved yet.
—Let me not make my comments specific to that particular amendment because we now find out it has not been moved by Senator Murray. I make a general point to Senator Murray that even the worst critic of the opposition would acknowledge that the question of government promotion, publicity and advertising of the GST obviously has been the subject of very serious concerns which have been raised by the opposition in the public arena. The opposition is looking seriously at this abuse and misuse of public moneys in the unprecedented $420 million GST promotional campaign currently being waged by the government in support of its unpopular tax changes. As far as the opposition are concerned, we will look seriously at any proposal that comes forward in relation to government advertising. 
Senators might be aware that currently the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is examining the question of appropriate government advertising guidelines. I know Senator Murray, as a member of that committee, has an interest in the work of the sectional committee that is developing the proposed guidelines. The opposition, for its part, is seriously considering the possibility of introducing a private member's bill to see if the parliament will support the guidelines that the Auditor-General himself recommended to the parliament as a result of the Auditor-General's inquiry into the CEIP program, which occurred in the couple of weeks leading up to the issuing of the writs for the 1998 election. The report was brought down by the Auditor-General some months later, as a result of a formal complaint that was laid before the Auditor-General by the opposition.
I say to Senator Murray, through you, Madam Chair, that we do treat this issue seriously. We do appreciate a contribution made to positively try to address this serious issue of public policy that I think is foremost in the minds of Australians as they see their current government misusing public funds to an unprecedented degree. I do think it would be inappropriate to deal with or to support the sort of amendment that we have before the chair at this stage. You have an amendment that, for example, permits an advertisement which `relates to a community service', whatever that might be, and if `the non-publication of the advertisement would be to the public detriment', whatever that might be. These sorts of tests are of course very difficult and that is why there is a need for guidelines in this area.
The spirit of the amendment that Senator Murray is likely to move, amendment (3), I certainly understand. The reasons Senator Murray might want to move that amendment I understand. But I do respectfully suggest that this is worth some serious discussion between the Australian Democrats and the opposition. I indicate to the Australian Democrats that if Senator Murray would like to engage in that, then it would be my intention on behalf of the opposition to also seriously engage in such a discussion. These sorts of amendments, I do not care whether they are moved by government senators or opposition senators or Democrat senators, which are so far reaching in their consequences but are not far reaching in the amount of time that senators have to consider them—in other words, they are basically dropped on the table with just a few minutes for serious consideration—are not helpful in terms of the conduct of debate in this place.
While I think Senator Murray needs to seriously think about the impact on the freedom of political expression that the amendment before the chair might have, I do acknowledge that the question of government advertising is a very important one. It is uppermost in the public mind at the moment. We have a government willing to abuse and misuse government funds to the extent that we have never seen before in this country's history, and it is proper that this parliament give those sorts of matters very close attention. It is with that spirit that the opposition approaches the proposal that is before the committee at this stage. It is for those serious and substantive reasons that we cannot see our way clear, under any circumstances, to support amendments (1) or (2). 
In relation to amendment (3) or other matters relating to this question of GST promotion, publicity or advertising, which of course is occurring under the guise of so-called information campaigns, the opposition stands ready, willing and able to discuss these with you, Senator Murray, or with other members of the Democrats. We acknowledge the need for the parliament to act in this area to try to ensure that this unprecedented abuse of process, this unprecedented waste of public funds and this unprecedented politically partisan, political propaganda campaign that is occurring currently to promote the GST is something that does not become part and parcel of political life in this country.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-05,"—I thank the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate for his contribution. My amendments, to use Senator Faulkner's phrase, were in reaction to those that were `dropped on us' today by Senator Conroy—1791 revised and 1811. I will come later on to the question of government advertising in my amendment No. 3, but I should say to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate that he was absent from the chamber when I gave him and Senator Ray well deserved praise for the very thorough way in which they have pursued this issue. I might not agree with all of the mathematics that come at the end, but the fact is that you have put your finger on a very sensitive political point and I think you have done it with considerable skill.
Returning to my amendments (1) and (2)—again to quote Senator Faulkner, although he has not used the word today—in this respect the Democrats have `form'. We have form going back over two decades in terms of wishing to pursue the issue of truth in political advertising. We do not think that political participants should mislead or deceive people about political matters. If debate is robust or if there are alternative views, that is an entirely different matter. But `to mislead' or `to deceive' have distinct meaning in the ACCC's jurisdiction. They have distinct meaning under the Trade Practices Act. They have distinct meaning as established at case law. We do not think political parties should mislead or deceive in the political marketplace.
When I say we have form, the propositions we have put at items (1) and (2) are propositions we have put before and we have resurrected them for the purpose of this debate. Frankly, we are of the opinion that without them item (2) of sheet 1791 revised will be deficient. It will be defective. It will be short of content. It will be biased. That is why we have pursued the route we have.
The second question that I can recall you having put, Senator Conroy, is that you have asked why we have suggested in our amendments that we should omit item (4). Frankly, we find the prospect of the Commonwealth being fined ludicrous. That would end up in taxpayers being fined and having to pay for it. I think you are right to pursue this; you just have not gone far enough. The real issue here is being reported—having the political impact of an adverse report being made against the government or against a political party for having misled or deceived the population. That is far more powerful than any fine. If we put down a fine of a billion dollars, the government could pay it. But if we said that a government misled or deceived the people of Australia, that would be sufficient to cause enormous outrage, particularly if it were the commission or the Auditor-General expressing that view or, indeed, if they said the same of any political party. You are driving here for better standards. We are just taking you through that extra hurdle and trying to make sure that it is even handed. That is as much of a response as I can give to your questions.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I would probably say I have always been a bit of an incrementalist, Senator Murray, and I am always prepared to take whatever I can get along the way.
—That doesn't sound like a transport workers man.
—You have to try and win your political battles a bit at a time, Senator Murray.
—One branch at a time.
—Whichever way you want to do it, Senator Campbell. I have usually kept my branches to the same political party. I know you have dabbled in a few. But I have always been willing to take what I can when I can get it, Senator Murray, and I would urge that you grab as much of this as you can at the time. Allan Fels grabs as much as he can whenever he can. 
—He's going to do a guest spot on Water Rats, I understand, as well, or is it Blue Heelers?
—Possibly either. Even though, as Senator Faulkner has indicated, we have some reservations about part of your amendments, Senator Murray, I would hope you would still be willing to pursue some of your amendments to our amendments. As I said, I have always been willing to take whatever I can in these situations and I hope that you will take up that challenge.
—Order! The question is that Democrat amendments Nos 1 and 2 on sheet 1806, as amended, to opposition amendment No. 2 on sheet 1791 revised and the amendment on sheet 1811 be agreed to.

—Are you seeking leave? Is leave granted to recommit the question in relation to the Democrat amendments on sheet 1806 to opposition amendment No. 2 on sheet 1791 revised and on sheet 1811?

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-05,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 3 on sheet 1806:
(3)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (after line 24), after section 75AYA, insert:
75AYB  Government advertising
	(1)	A person must not authorise:

	(b)	money in the custody or under the control of any person acting for or on behalf of the Commonwealth in respect of the custody or control of the money;
including such money that is held on trust for, or otherwise for the benefit or, a person other than the Commonwealth.
This is indeed a resurrection of an amendment which has previously been proposed in the Senate and defeated. The issue is always, of course, whether the provisions have all the coverage that is required. I accept the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate that there are aspects to the amendment which would require further legal interpretation and further guidelines. However, it is not uncommon for guidelines to be issued in regulatory matters to expand upon and amplify legislation. In fact, it is very typical with ASIC and the ACCC to do just that.
However, this is a topical and powerful issue. It is an issue to which the opposition in particular has devoted a great deal of time and probably, in a political sense, a successful time, in seeking to indicate that part at least of the government advertising program which is currently under way is political in content and not government information in the normal sense of the word. Those are matters of judgment, but I think there is a case that the government has probably gone too far in some of the poster and television advertising. As I said in my earlier remarks, the print, leaflet and computer media advertising have been very effective.
It is no good raising heat on these matters unless you provide a solution or you try to do something about it. Since this is a problem which is underway right now and will continue, we thought it necessary to act immediately to resurrect a form of amendment which we have previously put. I gather from the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition that this will be opposed. Nevertheless, it is a genuine attempt to deal with this matter and is a response to Labor's intention to bring on—all of a sudden, I might say—certain amendments themselves which attend to these issues.
I think this amendment, regardless of any inadequacies that might be thought to exist within it, takes us along a far better path than we have at present and will deal with many issues that need to be dealt with and is appropriately expressed. If, as I realise, the opposition like the intent but not the content, I will at some stage take up the offer by the Leader of the Opposition to consider these matters further. However, the Australian Democrats feel strongly that government advertising should be specified in law, that this is the appropriate act to do it in, and that there should be guidelines which support the advertising. If that is done, frankly, it will be to the benefit of the government going into the election and to the benefit of the people of Australia as a whole. If this is to be rejected, I do hope the government will nevertheless move to provide better legislation surrounding the contentious area of government advertising, particularly when it reaches into the very high figures it has recently.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-05,"—It was not my intention to speak on this matter and I will not speak for long. I had hoped we would progress to the legislation in respect to the new business tax system. I did unfortunately miss most of the debate that occurred earlier this morning on the bill that we are considering, A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000. We did have the Trade Practices Commission before us in estimates last week when a number of the issues that we are considering here by way of amendment were considered in terms of the current very substantial, massive, record—as some would term it—advertising campaign being run by the government in respect to the so-called new tax system. Certainly I, along with the rest of the Labor Party and the majority of the Australian community, believe it is an unprecedented, massive propaganda campaign primarily to convince Australians of the need for a goods and services tax.
We thought the campaign that was run prior to the last election was bad enough. I think it came close to $20 million, which—surprise, surprise, and coincidentally—I say that somewhat sarcastically because I do not believe it was a coincidence—was publicly funded and ended shortly before the election was called. The current campaign that is occurring is at least 20 times that in terms of the cost. The government should be aware that a number one premise of any advertising campaign is that you have to have a good product otherwise you run the risk of reinforcing the negatives and suspicions of the product you are trying to sell. I certainly think that is the case with respect to the current GST propaganda campaign. It is rare to get unsolicited comment back about these types of issues in the general community. Certainly, on the north-west coast of Tasmania over the weekend, a number of people remarked about the current size of the propaganda campaign. They made a number of points, including: if the GST is so good, why is it necessary for the government to spend more than $800 million convincing the Australian community it is so good? Secondly, the point that was made to me was that $400 million could be better spent in other areas. Indeed, I had occasion to have a discussion with some veterans about these GST matters and—
—You are not talking about Joe Cocker?
—No, I think they were fans of Joe Cocker, but they certainly were not interested in the music.
—He sang in tune.
—I do not agree with you. I think Joe Cocker has a unique music style. But they made the point to me quite validly that this money could be better spent on our scarce community services, not just for veterans but also in health and education. I will conclude my remarks there.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-06-05,"—The intent of the amendment suggested by Senator Murray is very good, that is, to ensure that money is properly spent in advertising. It is perhaps not as happily framed as it could be. For example, the amendment states: 
	(1) A person must not authorise:
	(a) under any law of the Commonwealth, the expenditure of public money on advertising
That could be interpreted as parliamentarians doing that, which would be a bit of a worry. In fact, I am not sure why those first six words are in part (a). Why doesn't it read `a person must not authorise the expenditure of public money on advertising'? Another thing is that it tries to bind future legislators as to what they ought to do, and I am not sure that you are able to do that. The more you look at this amendment, the more one thinks that it ought to be put in a budget bill rather than this sort of bill. I have never been keen on the Trades Practices Act being used for anything other than for the purposes it was intended, that is, to make sure that the marketplace is in the consumer's interest and is open. That is why I have always objected to legislation against unions and picketers being in this act. I say to Senator Murray that the intent is good, but the framing is most unhappy. It might be a good idea to go away and think the expression through a little better.

We believe that what is set out in these amendments is an opportunity to make the ACCC far more accountable than it has been. Everywhere I travel at the moment, surprisingly, the business community pat me on the back, Senator McGauran.
—Do they know about your industrial relations policy? 
—They say `Good on you. Someone has got to do something.'
—No-one knows about the National Party. You are irrelevant now!
—The National Party have now reached the status of a star in most polling, which is usually too small to actually be accounted for, especially in Benalla. The ACCC is a big issue in Benalla, let me tell you, Senator McGauran. I have said before, and I will say it again, that I think you could have been the candidate to pull Benalla out of the fire for the National Party. You could have come in on your white horse and calmed the fears about the ACCC in Benalla!
—He would have done it too.
—Thank you, Senator Woodley. I think you are right. This is an amendment which, I think has been indicated, we will be defeated on.

For instance, legislating for the chairman of the ACCC to appear before a House of Representatives standing committee is not necessary. Both houses do have the right to subpoena and both houses, if they wish, can make people appear before them. Professor Fels and other members of the commission appear before the Senate estimates, and I am told they enjoy every moment of it.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-05,"—These bills cover various separate subject areas agreed between the government and the opposition as part of the business tax package. The bills cover refunding of excess imputation credits, removing the intercorporate dividend rebate on unfranked dividends, providing an income tax exemption for venture capital distributions from pooled development funds to Australian superannuation funds, the pooling of depreciation allowances, and consequential amendments flowing from the reduction in the rate of company taxation.
Since 1998, Labor has repeatedly called for bipartisanship on business tax reform. After much urging by the business community, the government finally conceded the importance of such an approach. The Treasurer finally accepted our offer of a common approach, to the benefit of the business community and the nation. Business needs certainty in its tax arrangements that goes beyond one electoral cycle, and that can only be achieved through support by the only two parties that can form a government. Labor has delivered that certainty and has honoured its word concerning support for the government's legislation, including swift passage through parliament. That is what occurred last year with the first business tax package, and we continue that facilitation tonight. 
However, cooperation is a two-way street. Despite the measures in last year's package and the important measures in these bills, vital integrity measures remain unlegislated. Three key areas where parliament is awaiting legislation are: dependent contractors, non-commercial losses, and the entity taxation regime. These are essential to meet the tests of revenue neutrality. At least two of these—dependent contractors and non-commercial losses—must be introduced this week, and the entity taxation regime must be introduced for passage by 30 June to meet the timetabling commitments made by the Treasurer. The Treasurer's agreement with Labor promised not only that he would deliver the above measures in name but that he would deliver measures that would raise the substantial revenue that he promised. We want the Treasurer to sign off on that legislation so that it produces the same result as was included in the government's calculations at the time of the release of the package. There is no room to fudge for the Treasurer, no room to wiggle. He has a binding obligation to deliver; yet, of course, we are still waiting. 
It is a matter of great regret that, instead of focusing fully on business tax reform—on bedding down the legislation and informing the business community of the new regime—the government has been obsessed, and is now swamped, with trying to explain its nightmare on main street: the Howard-Lees GST. This obsession with the GST is about to impose a massive burden on business, especially on small business. It will be difficult enough for small business to cope with the changes in the business tax package, some of which are potentially very large, but they will also have to cope with the GST, the new pay-as-you-go system, and a host of other issues as well. Labor argued this was not all necessary, and again we have been shown to be correct. Unfortunately, there will be many small business casualties from the government's debacle known as the Howard-Lees GST. The Treasurer has been caught out, time and again, misleading the Australian public over the GST price effect. He has consistently said that, under the GST, prices never go up by 10 per cent. 
—More than 10 per cent.
—He said it could never go up by 10 per cent. He said that it could not happen, but it has. We saw the example of Big W and the polar hockey children's suit. Is it any wonder that the Treasurer fought so hard to avoid dual tagging being allowed by the retailers? Is it any wonder that he fought so hard to keep the truth from being revealed? We know the truth hurts, and this government dwells on dishonesty at the expense of truth—aided and abetted by the Australian Democrats. The Treasurer has told the parliament repeatedly that he did not know that this was happening. If the Treasurer of the nation, who has introduced this regressive tax, does not know what is happening, how does he expect the Australian public to know what is happening? 
It does not end with the polar hockey suit. There are now endless stories of pricing up off the back of the GST. For all its bluster, when did the ACCC act and come out publicly on the Big W issue? It was only after Labor raised it in this parliament. It would appear that the only investigations it ever makes is when Labor has raised them in the parliament. We only have to look at the Big W issue and at the Accor hotel group for proof of that. 
There are hundreds of horror stories in this dog of a tax. Big W and children's clothing is just one of them. The Chairman of the ACCC, Professor Allan Fels, will jump in front of a television camera as soon as you can blink, but he is very reluctant to turn up to Senate estimates to be asked questions about the capacity of the ACCC to police this dog of a tax. He very rarely attends. Appearing before the very committee to which the ACCC is accountable is much too lowbrow, it would seem. He is more than happy, though, to be in front of a television camera, threatening business with $10 million fines for telling the truth about the GST.
Let's look at what happened to Big W. The ACCC forced them, at government insistence, to remove the dual tags. But do we know whether Big W had priced their goods correctly or not? It is a very important question. No, we do not. Has the ACCC informed the public whether Big W had done the right thing or not? Another important question. No, we do not know. All we get is the government using the ACCC to harass and threaten business for telling the truth. The ACCC is now the government's price censor. Whenever a business tells the truth about the GST, send in the ACCC price police to tell them politely they have got it wrong, because the government has said so. 
If people doubt that this is the approach of the government, it is telling that, after the Prime Minister wrote a `please explain' letter to Mr Roger Corbett, the CEO of Woolworths, which owns the Big W chain, we had on cue Woolworths writing back to the Prime Minister saying, `Sorry, we got it wrong. Prices are now going up by only 1.1 per cent.' So, before the issue became public, prices were going up by 10 per cent, but after the Prime Minister wrote a `please explain' letter and the ACCC shock troops were sent in, a major chain the size of Woolworths all of a sudden decided it had made a mistake. I say to Woolworths and Big W: `Don't insult our intelligence, but I understand fully why you have tried.'
This government has sought to deliberately mislead the Australian public on the price effects of the GST, but it has been found out. The public knows that prices will go up by the full 10 per cent Howard-Lees GST, but Treasurer Costello continues to believe in the fantasy that no price will go up by the full 10 per cent. The Treasurer must be the only person in the country who believes the GST will not lift prices by 10 per cent. The government said that the inflation impact of the GST would be 1.9 per cent. There is a big difference between 1.9 per cent and 10 per cent, yet the compensation package is based on a 1.9 per cent inflation outcome, not 10 per cent. Consumers will be dudded twice—dudded through higher prices and dudded through inadequate compensation.
We have the Prime Minister telling his colleagues in the party room to hold their nerve, `Don't go out and break ranks; don't back down.' We had Minister Anthony in the other place saying that the 10 per cent tax is a great new thing, yet he is telling his electorate that he is trying to get it eased from caravan parks. This is a minister who speaks with a forked tongue. He says one thing in parliament and another thing in the electorate. Minister Anthony is the epitome of hypocrisy. Given that he represents a marginal rural and regional electorate, is it any wonder that he resorts to hypocrisy to try to save his political skin? One thing is for sure—the GST will not. The GST will be Minister Anthony's death knell, and he knows it. All those thousands of caravan park residents cannot wait to sound it at the next election.
But there is more than just the GST. What else has the Treasurer promised the electors of Richmond? Let us look at what the Treasurer wants to do to the people who live in rural and regional electorates. At the top of his list is a desire to cut wages and put up their petrol at the same time. This is the deal that the Treasurer, with the support no doubt of Minister Anthony, has promised regional and rural Australia—lower wages with which to pay for the GST and lower wages with which to buy more expensive fuel. What a great deal for regional Australia that is! The Treasurer's concern for rural and regional Australia is demonstrated by how often he visits—rarely. But, when he does, it is in a Commonwealth car with tinted windows, behind which he can hide from the electorate. He knows, as does Minister Anthony, that the GST is rat poison in the bush, so when he travels there on those rare occasions, he is less than keen to be recognised as the person responsible for the GST's introduction.
Turning back to the issue of the ACCC's harassment of business, we now know it was not only Big W that was threatened and harassed by the government and the ACCC. There was also the Accor hotel group. It has since come to light that there were some very agitated phone calls to the Accor group from the government. Once again, another business was threatened and harassed by the government for being honest when they produced a post-GST price list which showed that the full 10 per cent Howard-Lees GST was going to be fully passed on. 
We were told by the government, `If Accor put up its rates by the full 10 per cent, you don't have to stay there.' The Treasurer obviously does not see the need to heed that advice, because he is booked into the Accor Novotel at Brighton-le-Sands. He is booked in there for the Olympics. The Treasurer has a booking for something like 20 days in the King's Suite, all paid for, GST and all, by the Australian taxpayer. This is despite the Treasurer telling John Laws that he will be at home in front of the tellie with a pizza. When will this man's deceit ever end? I suspect a pizza ordered from the King's Suite costs considerably more than one ordered from the local Pizza Hut. 
The dual price-tagging system has demonstrated that, once people are shown what the impact of this GST will be, they will realise how much money is being ripped out of their pockets every time they make a purchase, and how much they have been deceived by this government. The opposition has tried on four different occasions to have an amendment passed that would ensure that the GST is disclosed on customer receipts, but the government and the Democrats have opposed it each and every time. The opposition asks: what do they have to hide, particularly in light of Coles-Myer's decision that they will be mandating full GST disclosure on the receipts they issue?
I will now turn to the specific proposals contained in the bills. Firstly, the bills provide for the refunding of excess imputation credits. The dividend imputation system ended the previous double taxation of dividend income and was a major business tax reform introduced by Labor in 1986, under which companies paid dividends out of income on which they have paid company tax. These are known as franked dividends. This means that the company tax paid on the income is available as a credit to the shareholder. The tax credit can then be used to offset the income tax payable by the shareholder. Although imputation credits can be used to reduce an individual's or superannuation fund's income tax liability to nil, excess credits were of no value to taxpayers. This bill proposes to refund to taxpayers any excess imputation credits that may be left after offsetting the credits against their income tax liability. The classic example of such a situation is a low income person who earns a little investment income—for example, a full-rate age pensioner. They face no income tax liability on their income and therefore cannot obtain the benefit of the excess franking credits attached to the small amount of dividend income they receive. Under this proposal, they will obtain a refund of their income tax from the Taxation Office, which represents the excess imputation credits. Labor included this proposal in our taxation policy prior to the last election. Therefore, we have no difficulty supporting the proposal because it is our policy. It builds on the major reform accomplished by Labor almost 15 years ago and it improves the current taxation system faced by low income investors, especially retired Australians.
Secondly, there is the removal of the intercorporate dividend rebate on unfranked dividends. Currently, public companies obtain a rebate, known as the dividend rebate, on dividends they receive whether they are franked or not. This rebate leads to tax avoidance opportunities which cost the revenue several hundred million dollars per year. The bill proposes to remove the rebate except where dividends are paid within a company group. This will bring public companies into line with the treatment of private companies. The measure will close significant tax avoidance opportunities, and is strongly supported by Labor. This measure replaces an earlier proposal, deferred company tax, which was rejected by the Ralph inquiry because of the possible impact on foreign investment in Australia. The measure will raise significant revenue: around $600 million over the next five years, which is about $400 million less than the deferred company tax proposal that it replaces.
Thirdly, there is the provision of an income tax exemption for venture capital distribution from pooled development funds to Australian superannuation funds. The bill proposes to provide a significant stimulus to venture capital investment by Australian superannuation funds. This is achieved by providing a special rebate that allows superannuation funds to receive venture capital gains free of tax where they are earned through investments in a pooled development fund. This is a significant reform and it is in line with Australian Labor Party policy. It will provide a significant incentive to superannuation funds to invest in Australian ventures. The measure should increase the retirement income of superannuation fund members over the long term as they will have access to high, long run returns in the developing segments of the Australian economy.  
Labor supports, and indeed has long advocated, a business tax system which fosters investment, job growth and innovation, including greater investment in venture and patient capital and in research and development. We support the greater commercialisation of Australia's R&D and innovative effort. This measure will assist that goal. But we have also argued that more is needed than simply changes to taxation. We need to develop a venture capital-innovation culture in this country. Venture capital is an area for which we were able to get bipartisan support from the day the government announced their business tax package. The reason for that of course is that Labor took to the last election a proposal in relation to venture capital whereby we recognised the need to attract overseas pension funds to this country. Those overseas pension funds operated in their own countries in circumstances in which the capital gains tax was much lower than applied here. Of course, if it were lower than here, why would they invest here?
Our argument—because evidence had been put to us that we were missing out on investment opportunities in the development of this country, and of course the name of the game has to be about jobs and the building of our industries, and about new industries in particular—was that this was a vital area that needed to be attracted. So we proposed, going into the last election, changes to attract the US pension funds. But the notion was not just to attract their capital; there was also the notion that, if you have got their capital, you would also attract their expertise: the people who actually manage the investments—manage the venture capital—and who have experience in taking up the idea and working it through the start-up phase to commercialisation. We also require that these funds invest in partnerships with Australians so that we can instil that culture and develop the networks of expertise so that we can keep more of the inventions and the research here and develop them more here to the nation's advantage. 
This is an area in which countries like the US have had a long period of experience. We had to tap it and we needed to make the tax system, along with other programs, ensure that we did. The US has probably had some 30 years of experience in this area, and it is not an experience that can be obtained overnight—although it is very interesting that a country the size of Israel has made huge inroads into this area, as has Ireland. Both of those countries have understood the importance of attracting not only the capital but also the expertise—the means by which the capital is managed wisely. So it is against that background that we welcome the initiatives in terms of the overseas pension funds, because there was a barrier to venture capital coming to Australia.
It is also interesting to note that when we took this issue to the last election the government rubbished us on this measure—the measure that they are now agreeing with us on. They said then that it would not work. At the time, they had obviously not considered the detail. It was too much of a knee-jerk response and too much of a rejection of the notion that we should develop a bipartisan and agreed position on a number of these areas. Now they have come to the party. The government have picked up our suggestions. We legislated the foreign pension fund measures last year, and today we are dealing with the concession for Australian superannuation funds. We welcome these measures. The next area is the pooling of depreciation allowances.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-05,"—This is one of those occasions on which there is going to be cross-party agreement. Frankly, I was surprised that these bills—the New Business Tax System (Miscellaneous) Bill 1999 and the New Business Tax System (Venture Capital Deficit Tax) Bill 1999—did not go into the non-controversial section. The Democrats are known to support these measures, and there has not been any controversy attached to them. 
Senator Cook, in the relevant half of his speech, outlined the provisions quite well. Briefly speaking, the bills deny the intercorporate dividend for unfranked dividend payments between resident companies that are not members of a company group. They allow refund of excess dividend imputation credits. They exempt from tax franked dividends paid to resident complying superannuation funds and similar bodies by pooled development funds. They allow items with a value of less than $1,000 to be pooled for the calculation of depreciation deductions. They also, through the venture capital deficit tax bill, impose formally a tax on a deficit in a pooled development fund's venture capital franking sub-account and provide for the calculation of the amount of tax payable.  
Having said all that, I am sure that, if  anybody was bothering to listen or was observing this debate, their eyes would have glazed over. It can be frighteningly boring. Nevertheless, these measures affect probably hundreds of millions of dollars and they are a useful addition to the anti-tax avoidance measures that the government are introducing. They are a consequence of the Ralph business tax review. I think it is highly commendable of the government to have introduced these measures as rapidly as they could. 
The one last remark I would make is that it is notable that the government has introduced a set of amendments. That is another example of how complex and difficult this legislation is—that even where it is agreed, there is always some need to review it and to make it even more applicable and more wide ranging. None of this legislation is easy for any but people familiar with tax legislation to read, and we must always be conscious of that difficulty which is there for the profession and for us with bills of this sort. That is all I want to say. The Democrats will support it and we will be supporting the government amendments. (Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (MISCELLANEOUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-05,"—The legislation we are considering is the New Business Tax System (Venture Capital Deficit Tax) Bill 1999 and I intend to make a few remarks about the legislation. Briefly, the bill covers five main areas: firstly, the refunding of excess imputation credits; secondly, the removal of the intercorporate dividend rebate on unfranked dividends; thirdly, providing a tax exemption for venture capital distributions from pooled development funds to Australian superannuation funds; fourthly, pooling of depreciation allowances and, fifthly, some consequential amendments flowing from the reduction in the rate of company tax. This is a part of the government's business tax reforms which the Labor Party is supporting.
It is the third area—providing a tax exemption for venture capital distributions from pooled development funds to Australian superannuation funds—that I intend to make a few remarks about. The bill itself proposes to provide a significant stimulus to venture capital investment by Australian superannuation funds. This is achieved by providing a special rebate that allows superannuation funds to receive venture capital gains free of tax through a pooled development fund. One of the more obvious reasons that Labor are supporting this legislation is that it is in line with Labor policy. I stress that: it is in line with Labor policy. It is a policy that we took to the last election. I note in passing—I do not want to be overly negative—that the current government criticised our policy at the time in the lead-up to the election and claimed that it was unnecessary and unachievable. I note in this evening's debate that it has decided to adopt something very similar. This change will provide a significant incentive to superannuation funds to invest in Australian ventures and the measure should increase the retirement income of superannuation fund members over the long term. I will say a little more about that later.
Before I make some detailed comments about superannuation funds and some more general comments about venture capital, I want to emphasise that the consequential amendments on the reduction in the rate of company tax relate to the dividend imputation system and the tax concessions applying to infrastructure borrowings, known as IB, that need to be adjusted when the company tax rate is changed in order to maintain the current effective treatment of the dividend imputation system and the IB concession. I make the fairly brief but firm point that it is often claimed by the current government that Labor did not carry out any major changes to the Australian tax system during its 13 years in government. That is simply not correct. There are numerous examples of significant change, and dividend imputation is one of those very important changes that the Labor government implemented when in office. It was a very important change to the company tax system which the Liberal-National parties could not find the will or determination to support when in office prior to Labor taking government in 1983. Before passing from this issue to the next issue, we should note that prior to 1983 the current Prime Minister was Treasurer of this country for a significant period of time, but Mr Howard did not tackle this issue and other major tax issues during the period when he was the Treasurer of this country. 
I would like to turn to the issue of superannuation funds and address it in a little more detail. I firstly want to make the point that the existing national superannuation system in this country is a result of Labor policy and Labor initiatives in government. I do not want to speak in too much detail on this, but I want to note that the Labor Party made significant, positive changes to superannuation when in government during that period from 1983 to 1996. One of the major changes was the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge. It is currently at seven per cent, going to eight per cent from 1 July and moving up to nine per cent by 2002. It ensured that all Australian workers could have superannuation. At the time, in 1983, about 40 per cent of Australians had superannuation. This was a very important initiative that spread superannuation to almost every Australian employee, and it has very important consequences for long-term retirement incomes. I noticed in the media tonight some data about life expectancy in Australia. After Japan, Australia has the second longest life expectancy of any nation in the world at 73 years of age on average. That carries very significant implications for Australia's future retirement incomes policy. So it was Labor that established an effective, comprehensive superannuation system in this country—a major reform, a critical reform, that has left us in a far stronger position to tackle the issues associated with that ageing population than most comparable economies in the world. 
As the pool of superannuation funds continues to grow for the reasons that I have touched on—the superannuation guarantee, in particular—we currently have some $360 billion in superannuation funds in Australia, and this figure is rising quickly.
—Tremendous growth.
—It is tremendous growth. I might say in response to the interjection from Senator Kemp that, in contrast to the very negative approach of this government to superannuation in two important areas—
—Because of the superannuation guarantee, not because of anything you have done, Senator Kemp. I was provoked, Mr Acting Deputy President. I want to mention two important areas that the current Liberal-National government have neglected in superannuation. Actually, `neglect' is the wrong word: they have made changes that have been counterproductive for Australia's superannuation savings pool. One, of course, is the so-called superannuation surcharge—tax by another name—which broke the election promise made by Senator Kemp and others in the lead-up to the 1996 election of no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes. There is a range of other problems in respect of this matter that I have spoken about on other occasions. The Liberal-National parties are fond of talking about the l-a-w law tax cuts that Labor converted into a superannuation co-contribution of some $4.5 billion, which the current Liberal-National parties pledged to maintain. They then converted that into a savings rebate. That savings rebate was passed into l-a-w law, and it lasted all of six months. What happened to those moneys that were supposed to go into, firstly, superannuation and then into some sort of long-term savings initiative? They were delivered in the form of tax cuts—they helped to fund the tax cuts—needed to attempt to bribe the Australian population to accept the goods and services tax. So the superannuation contribution has had a very interesting history. It started out as income tax cuts. It then became a superannuation contribution for long-term savings. Under this current government, it became a savings rebate, and then it was turned into bribes to tempt people to accept the GST. It is an interesting square that those tax cuts have travelled. 
With the rapid growth of superannuation funds in Australia, it is important that we have available a mixture of asset classes for that growing pool to be invested in. It is important that there is a range of diversified alternative options that are made available to those superannuation funds. In Australia, superannuation funds typically invest between two and three per cent of assets in capital. In the United States, that figure is more than double the Australian percentage.
Labor identifies three types of opportunities in this area. The first is growth. A business has essentially exhausted its existing capital resources and needs additional funds to expand, and obviously young, growing companies fit into this category. The second is in the area of structural change, such as a management buy-out or a management buy-in, and the third, very importantly, is in the area of start-up capital. It is also important, as part of this measure, that where necessary—and I stress `where necessary'—because Australia is a net capital importer, we are able to attract such capital from overseas, particularly from the United States. As was highlighted by my colleague Senator Cook today in question time, we have only got to look at the state of Australia's national debt, the 40 per cent increase in Australia's national debt under the Liberal and National parties, to realise that it is very important to be able to attract capital from overseas. 
It is interesting to note that recently a number of pooled investment funds have been launched. At least four new major funds have been announced and opened to subscribers. Whilst obviously it is not my role to promote such funds, I think it is important to briefly touch on those that have recently been established. We have Wilshire Global Advisors, one of the largest funds in the world. They aim to raise between $100 million and $200 million. We have the Mercantile Mutual Investment Management fund, which aims to raise about $100 million; Macquarie Bank, $125 million; and the Development Australia Fund, known as DAF2, which is aiming to raise some $300 million. That is a total of about $600 million to $800 million. It is interesting to note that up until 1997 total investment in Australia and New Zealand in this area came, by comparison, to a figure of approximately $346 million. Briefly, in respect of the last fund I mentioned—the largest, the Development Australia Fund of $300 million—it is important to note that this is largely being funded by four industry superannuation funds: C-BUS, ARF, STA and HESTA. These funds and others in that industry sector make a very important contribution to capital accumulation and investment in Australia. It is a sector that the current government wrongly claims is union dominated. That is not correct. They are trustee funds with joint employer-employee trustees who have a blocking veto over each other. They are well-run funds and they are funds that this government is anxious to destroy. That is another issue that I will not go into detail on today.
Why is it important to make this tax change in the area of investment capital? I touched on the three types of opportunities that are available. It is also important that we enable businesses to remain in Australia, to grow here and, if possible, to avoid having to relocate overseas. It is very important to provide a stimulus, particularly in knowledge intensive businesses such as software, biotechnology, semiconductors, communications and Internet services. This is not an exclusive list; there are also other areas that I have knowledge of with respect to primary industry and manufacturing, particularly value adding in the manufacturing sector, where these funds can play an important role. To ensure the growth of the Australian economy and our ability to commercialise intellectual property, to convert ideas into positive, productive outcomes, it is very important that we maximise our opportunities in this particular area. As I mentioned earlier, Labor acknowledged this in its commitments prior to the last election, particularly with respect to attracting overseas capital from the United States, where there are very significant savings in what is known as 401K retirement income funds. There is some truth in saying that the capital gains tax regime does inhibit growth in some of these areas. I accept that that argument has some validity. But at the same time we must remember that the capital gains tax is an equitable tax, introduced by a Labor government, I might say, and one which I would strongly defend. The capital gains tax is an equitable tax and it is a necessary part of an equitable tax system.  
The legislation that we are considering is very important. I do understand the concerns that Senator Murray expressed earlier that sometimes when people—not too many tonight, I note—are listening to debate they get somewhat bewildered by the tax changes that we sometimes consider. I have to say to Senator Murray that I cannot blame him for thinking that in respect of the GST. We have been here on that issue hour after hour, day after day. Senator Kemp well knows the estimates process we have just been through—many hours of considering GST matters. It is certainly not a simpler tax system, and there are a lot of other problems besides that. Anyway, my colleagues and I have commented on aspects of the GST and we will continue to comment on many issues to do with it for some time to come.
In summary and in conclusion, the changes we are considering are good for business. They are necessary for business. They will encourage diversity, innovation and growth and I think also, importantly, will give some stimulus to funding that is an alternative to the banking system. It will be good for fund members whose money is invested in this particular area. I note that these types of funds do generally have a higher investment return than is averaged through other types of investment. That is a good thing. It is a good thing to maximise returns to fund members. Finally, I think it will have an effect on Australian ownership and on the Australian economy. It is good for growth and good for jobs, which is why the Australian Labor Party is supporting this legislation.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (MISCELLANEOUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-05,"—`Good for growth and good for jobs' were the last words that we heard from Senator Sherry. At the end of a somewhat long and, in many ways, tedious speech, it was good to hear his great enthusiasm—
—It was relevant.
—I will indulge myself slightly at the end and make a few observations on your comments, Senator, which I think you would expect. The government welcomes the strong support which the New Business Tax System (Miscellaneous) Bill 1999 and the New Business Tax System (Venture Capital Deficit Tax) Bill 1999 have received from the chamber. I do not always have the option of making that comment during the second reading debate. We welcome that support. Obviously, we are very pleased to be able to legislate business tax reforms such as those in this legislation. As all senators will be aware, the significant business tax reforms being introduced by this government are based on the Ralph review of taxation. This review undertook probably a unique consultation with industry and the business community before coming to its final recommendations. Naturally, the government carefully considered those recommendations and a wide range of measures representing the first two phases of the government's response to the recommendations were announced in September and November. The government has acted quickly to legislate these measures so that benefits such as lower company tax rates and capital gains tax reforms can be delivered in a timely fashion to Australian businesses. The measures in these bills build on the improvements made in legislation previously considered in this place. These measures will encourage investment, reduce compliance costs and improve the structure and integrity of the business tax system. Refunds of excess imputation credits will provide considerable benefits for many investors, particularly self-funded retirees. The proposed government amendments will extend this measure.
Another measure in these bills will encourage investment that is providing for imputation credits where pooled development funds pay dividends to Australian superannuation funds from gains made on venture capital investments. The pooling scheme for low cost items of plant introduced in this legislation represents a significant diminution in compliance costs for many businesses, which all of us in this chamber will certainly welcome. In particular, the measure will benefit businesses which hold many items of plant that either cost less than $1,000 or have been written down to a value of less than $1,000. The single pool will replace the multitude of individual records that businesses are currently obliged to keep for this type of plant. Removing the intercorporate dividend rebate on unfranked dividends is an important integrity measure. Finally, the bills contain amendments to the imputation system and the infrastructure borrowings rebate to reflect lower company rates. 
Let me make a number of observations on some of the matters that Senator Sherry raised. First of all, I welcome at last the concession from Senator Sherry. Only I in this chamber will know how important that concession is. Senator Sherry knows exactly what I am going to say. Senator Sherry is now on record as recognising the really very strong growth of the superannuation industry in Australia.
—Because of the superannuation guarantee, and don't quote me out of context.
—Senator Sherry, you are so sensitive for a senator. Allow me three minutes to make the point. Only I know how significant that statement is from Senator Sherry acknowledging the great growth in the superannuation industry under this government. One of my first jobs as Assistant Treasurer was to withstand a withering attack from Senator Sherry on the superannuation surcharge. This was before Senator Sherry reversed the policy, which the opposition now supports. Senator Sherry said that this would destroy confidence in superannuation, that people would not invest in superannuation. Senator Sherry took some very careful advice on this, but because time is short, I will not even mention his advisers in this area. Thank you, Senator Sherry; at last you have conceded that there has been great growth in superannuation. Then Senator Sherry said he was unhappy with the surcharge. The Labor Party supported the surcharge in the lower house and opposed the surcharge in this chamber. Then it reversed its position and went to the election supporting the surcharge. As far as I know, support for the surcharge remains Labor Party policy. All I can say to Senator Sherry is: if you do not like the surcharge, you have had an enormously long period of time in which to propose an alternative. As Senator Conroy said, you spend 96 per cent of your waking hours thinking about this surcharge.
—That's not true anymore.
—That is not true anymore. He has gone down to 85 per cent of his waking hours. Never has more thought been given to a measure with less obvious work coming out. It was an astonishing period with utter confusion and a particular lack of work and activity. If the Labor Party wanted an alternative, they certainly did not produce it in the last election. They have now had some three years to come up with an alternative system and have utterly failed—a very lazy effort from the Labor Party.
Then Senator Sherry mentioned co-contribution. Excuse me, but I don't think that was Labor Party policy at the last election. It is a bit rich to attack us for not having a co-contribution policy when it was not the policy of your own party. Senator Sherry made some outrageous comments on the government's attitude to industry funds. Those comments are quite untrue. The government see a valid place for industry funds.
—Rubbish. You can't wait to get your hands around their necks.
—Senator Sherry, it may suit your narrow union agenda to talk like this, but this government does not hold the views which you attribute to it. Finally, let me make the very obvious point that the major reform in superannuation is to provide choice.
—How is that going? 
—Just hold on and wait. Of course, it would have all got through had the Labor Party been allowed to keep its promise. Senator Sherry opposes a major reform in superannuation. Let me go on record as saying we will have a debate on this issue at a different time.
—Exactly. 
—Senator Sherry, I share more confidence in the capacity of the Australian worker and indeed the industry funds than you do. Choice is a very good thing for workers. 
—This is not important. I didn't go on about this.
—You did go on, Senator Sherry, and I am just responding. I conclude by noting once again that I understand all senators in this chamber support the reforms that this government is bringing in in this bill.
—They did until your speech.
—Senator Evans, I will not even talk about your flip-flops recently, which were embarrassing. I commend this very important legislation to the chamber.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bills read a second time. ",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (MISCELLANEOUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-05,"—This bill amends the National Health Act 1953 to expand the types of gap-free policies that health funds can offer by allowing a new category of ministerial ministerially approved gap cover schemes which are not subject to contracts but which must comply with a variety of conditions. This bill has been actively sought by the Australian Medical Association as their preferred option for expanding the availability of gap cover health insurance policies. In return, the AMA has strongly endorsed the extension of informed financial consent so that parties are told in advance of any costs of treatment in excess of the schedule fee.
The impetuses for gap-free health insurance were the amendments introduced by the former health minister Carmen Lawrence and the motion moved last year by Senator Harradine during debate of the private health insurance rebate legislation. All health funds are required to offer at least one no gap or known gap scheme by 1 July 2000 if they are to retain eligibility for the 30 per cent rebate direct payment option. The major funds have already developed no gap products under the Lawrence amendments to meet this requirement. These products have had reasonable success in the market and are attracting a growing number of doctors. However, the AMA has the perception that existing arrangements infringe on the doctor-patient relationship and has opposed expansion of the existing gap cover schemes. 
The opposition has consistently expressed its view that gap charges remain a major disincentive to people taking out private health insurance. Gap charges are an unacceptable burden to many people coming on top of their health insurance premiums and negate the benefit of having insurance in the first place. The opposition supports measures that will widen the availability of gap-free policies, provided this does not come at the expense of sparking a new round of medical fee inflation. The opposition's concerns about this bill are that the new schemes may allow a rise in medical fees which will flow through to higher health insurance premiums; the increased payments to doctors by the funds will not be offset by reductions in the gap payments paid by consumers, resulting in a higher overall cost to patients; the proposed form of informed financial consent may not be effective in ensuring all patients are aware in advance of any gap charges the doctor proposes to make; and the proposals may inhibit the no gap schemes already in existence. The most important concern we have is that the new schemes do not allow a new round of inflation in doctors' fees, which pushes up both the gap paid by patients and the health insurance premiums. 
The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee held an inquiry into this bill. Some useful submissions were received and a half-day hearing was held on Monday, 8 May. The committee's terms of reference were directed to some pretty specific questions. As a result, some important issues were clarified and debated by the major players. Everyone is in favour of wider availability of gap-free cover, but there are important differences between the funds, doctors, hospitals and consumers about how this can be achieved. There are also still some wide gaps in the agreed facts. The department estimates that privately insured patients paid around $215 million in gap charges for in-hospital medical services in the calendar year 1999. The AMA uses a higher figure of $249 million for all gap charges in 1997-98. The average amount paid is difficult to calculate, because of uncertainty about how many patients are charged gap fees. However, the evidence suggests that the average is between $120 and $200 per private patient and that some patients pay gap charges ranging up to thousands of dollars.
This bill takes the form of general enabling legislation, with the specifics of the scheme contained in the regulations. It is not possible to get a clear idea of what the intent of the legislation is from just reading the bill. The department emphasised the degree of discretion being left to the funds and said that it would not produce any guidelines on the form of the gaps cover schemes and would only discuss the schemes if approached by the funds. This is an unsatisfactory situation because the nature of the issue requires the legislation to be more specific about how gap cover schemes are intended to work. There is also concern that the department has advised the legislation gives no certainty that a person who purchases a no gaps policy will in fact escape a gap charge if they are treated by a doctor who is a member of that scheme. The best that the legislation can offer is apparently an increased likelihood that they will not be charged a gap. There is a need for the bill to broadly describe the objectives of gap cover schemes and contain the key elements of the process for approval and revocation of a scheme. If this were not the case, the powers given to the minister could be used very broadly indeed to authorise schemes which lie well beyond the scope of what the doctors advocating these amendments would have had in mind.
There was a common recognition, even among the scheme proponents, that success of gap cover schemes depends on them not resulting in doctors simply increasing their fees. The AMA recognised that there was an onus on doctors to make the scheme work in a non-inflationary way. Dr Brand summarised his views as follows:
If all it does is inflate fees and instead of putting money in patients pockets it puts money in doctor's pockets then the Minister, I am sure, will exercise the right that the Minister has to withdraw the schemes and put them back on the basis of a Lawrence style contract.
Unfortunately, past experience suggests there is a serious risk of fee inflation and the measures proposed do not sufficiently come to grips with inflation. It is important to distinguish the two kinds of inflation that contribute to the total cost for patients. Firstly, there are increases in total medical fees due to doctors increasing their charges in response to the higher rebates received. Secondly, there are the flow-on costs of increased rebates being recovered by increases in health insurance premiums. Both of these problems need to be solved. It would be easy for doctors to rationalise that, because they were now obtaining higher rebates from health insurers, significantly above the scheduled fee, they could still extract as a known gap a substantial direct contribution from their patient. Some have even tried to argue that both the doctor and the patient could be better off. This is a nonsense. The health system, the contributors to health funds and other doctors would all be worse off if such action was condoned. Any rapid escalation of medical fees would be a serious threat to the accessibility and affordability of health services. 
No satisfactory answer was given to the problem of gap fees increasing after the government introduced a special new Medicare item number for complex births in 1998 which was specifically meant to reduce gap fees. The reality is that patients are in a very poor position to bargain about charges when they are discussing surgery and there need to be some constraints to ensure that doctors' fees are not open ended. If the gap cover schemes established under this bill are predominantly used to offer known gap products where the total medical fees are significantly increased, then they will fail both the short-term and long-term objectives. The minister should be required to ensure that the proposed scheme will not have an inflationary impact on fees or total medical costs before deciding on the approval of the scheme. The current wording is very vague on this point and there is a need for a specific provision in relation to inflation in the legislation.
The department advised that if all existing gaps were covered by health funds, the estimated premium increase would be 6.2 per cent. It is important, therefore, that the schemes not simply transfer existing charges onto the bill or there will be a sizeable increase in the cost of health insurance and a flow-on cost to the government through the 30 per cent rebate. A six per cent increase in hospital benefits by the funds would add around $200 million to the expenditure by the funds and $60 million to the government's own costs. The major funds have indicated in their submissions that they have so far been able to extend their no gap contracts without any impact on their premiums. The 2000-01 budget proposes a new pooling arrangement to share the increased costs of gap schemes amongst funds through the reinsurance arrangements. The opposition continues to be very concerned that the government will not come to grips with the reinsurance pool issue. When we debated earlier legislation on Lifetime Health Cover I moved an amendment to require the minister to complete this process by the end of this month. At the time, the minister said this amendment was unnecessary and that the changes would occur, but I now understand that the process has stalled and there will be no changes in the short term to reinsurance arrangements apart from this particular stopgap change. I would again urge the minister to get serious about looking at the reinsurance pool arrangements that are holding back the efficiency of the sector.
A major concern of the opposition is the need to place a particular cap on the rate of increase in insurance premiums to discourage funds from engaging in behaviour which might drive up costs. The rate of increase in premiums is easier to measure, because of an opposition amendment in 1999, and is now transparent. The department of health is required to publish quarterly figures on movements and premiums. The committee heard evidence that a member of the minister's staff had urged the health funds to defer increases prior to next year's election for political rather than commercial reasons. This is of considerable concern because if this were done the funds would be acting without regard to their fiduciary responsibilities and the funds would be storing up a large post-election unpleasant surprise for their members. There is a need for this bill to set out in further detail how the inflationary impact is to be assessed and the extent of inflation that would trigger ministerial intervention. The benchmark is also required to determine the standard that the scheme must meet in order to gain approval. Direct comparison to the CPI is not necessarily the most appropriate measure. Other possibilities might be the ABS index for hospital costs, which is generally in excess of the CPI, an index of salary movements for other professional groups or a figure based on the cost index used for funding the public health system. The AMA proposes that the benchmark should be that the gap cover scheme should be no more inflationary than products under the MPPAs and the PAs. The Health Insurance Association suggested the measure should be the five-year average for that fund. 
The opposition's view is that the index and the method of measurement should be clearly spelt out so that there is a level playing field between the funds and no potential for premiums to increase excessively. The details of this can be left to the government to set by regulation, but it is unacceptable to the opposition for this bill to lack any definition of what an inflationary impact will be. Some funds have already reported pressure for increases in their fund rebate schedules to match the most generous of their competitors'. In other words, the competition to attract doctors to sign up for schemes is proving inflationary, as they will sign up for the best available rates and then demand other funds to match these. The bill needs to be amended to tighten up these aspects, or the objective of reducing costs will be swept aside by an inflationary surge in fees.
The second major issue—and it is one at the cornerstone of the new arrangements for known gap schemes—is this question of informed financial consent. In simple terms, this means that whenever practical patients should be informed in advance of the gap fee that they will incur either in dollar terms or as a percentage of the total fee. There is no definition of informed financial consent in the legislation and no obligation for doctors to provide patients with a proper statement of their expected bill. However, the doctors' representatives argue that they are firm believers in informed financial consent and agree that the logic is that it should apply to all patients and not just those dealing with the doctors under gap cover schemes. The AMA states that it strongly advises its members to provide informed financial consent, and other professionals support this view. The AMA also expressed its strong support for informed financial consent applying to all patients and not just those in gap free schemes.
The Consumer Health Forum saw a need to specify the nature of the advice provided by doctors including: that the advice to be provided in writing; that the principlal practitioner inform the consumer of the fees of other practitioners involved in the treatment; and that an explanation of the circumstances under which the fees might be varied be provided. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman provided considerable detail on his work to define informed financial consent and a draft set of forms on which consultation was proceeding for the preferred form of notification of patients of the estimate of fees. These highlighted the need for information held by the health funds to be confirmed to ensure the advice from the doctor was correct for the type of cover that the patient had. The MBF stressed the importance of gap schemes encouraging the participation of all doctors involved in an episode of care. 
The opposition believes that the obligation to provide informed financial consent should be entrenched in the legislation in the form of a requirement for medical service providers to give an estimate of fees where these will exceed the MBS schedule fee. The best way of moving towards better practice nationally is through guidelines and the education of practitioners. The AMA endorsed an approach of progressively increasing the proportion of doctors providing estimates of fees. In order to maximise participation providers should be given the option of providing the estimate of fees on behalf of other providers they know will be involved, or of each provider separately providing informed financial consent to the patient. The long-term goal should be simplified fee estimates to match simplified billing.
In conclusion, the opposition is broadly supportive of no gap coverage and we will be supporting this bill in order to encourage the wider take-up of this form of cover. There are a number of problems that I have canvassed which must be addressed when we come to the committee stage, in particular the need to ensure the schemes are not inflationary and the need to entrench informed financial consent. The onus will be on doctors to make the scheme work and to build on the market penetration already achieved by the medical purchaser provider agreements introduced by Labor. If doctors abuse the new arrangements then they will not last long because no government will be able to sit back and allow open-ended claims to be made. The health insurance sector will also need to work hard to ensure these schemes work because unless the public are offered genuine no gaps coverage they will become very disillusioned with what they are offered by private health insurance. I look forward to discussing the bill in more detail during the committee stage. ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I seek leave to incorporate my remarks and I have shown them to the government and to Senator Lees.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I will preface these remarks by firstly congratulating the minister for attempting to fix the vexing problem of gap payments and informed financial consent.
No one who have been following the issue of Private Health Cover in Australia would do anything else but applaud attempts to remedy an obstacle that has existed for some time regarding people taking out private health insurance.
Our views on the remedy to the Public Private Health mix are on the record and this is not the time to revisit the macro issues that debate.
While we agree with the general intent of the legislation here are some concerns I wish to raise.
Many health professionals still have some altruism left in the world created by the Howard government, that ranks compassion with weakness and for those still left, I applaud you.
However history has shown us there are also those that believe they have a right to charge what they desire. One of the concerns raised in the submissions received was that if full gap cover was offered some health professionals would lift fees even more.
This action, if it were to occur, is based on the naive assumption that if the patient is fully covered, then it will not cost them anything, it will cost the private health funds.
Any one with the most basic understanding of costs will realise increased costs do not disappear, they are merely shifted and if this bill results in the inflation of some health professional fees the most likely result will be premium rises.
Or in the worst case scenario, a refusal by funds to pay the entire gap due to unrealistic fees, thus resulting in a return to the past, out of pocket expenses.
This issue could be especially pertinent in my state Tasmania where due to the small number of some specialists and in some parts of the state GPS, an opportunity for inflated fees is very real. As the normal competitive factors that can lead to price control in major cities, are obviously not relevant when only one specialist exists and in some specialities, the specialist flies in from Melbourne.
We feel that there should be a clearly directive statement that ensures that there are no inflationary outcomes as a result of the legislation. Thus we have suggested that the minister be given the discretionary powers to ensure among other things that:
1. There is no possibility that the scheme will lead to increasing premium costs above the normal inflationary pressures in the general health sector.
2. That there will be a reduction in the average known gaps charged by the participants and no increase of total costs to fund members.
Additionally we recommend that an annual review mechanism include a prescribed format of reporting by organisations that have gap free schemes. If the scheme fails to meet well defined performance criteria rather, than we had better rush through something. The normal response of the Howard government we are suggesting some forward planning that does not come from the 1950's future that the Howard government calls vision.
To avoid the problem that was indicative in the nursing home fiasco, that meant, those inept or fraudulent providers were in some ways free from prosecution, some pre-emptive actions are suggested.
Essentially this would translate into a well set out policy of action should any scheme not measure up to the performance indicators.
This has obvious advantages for the industry, the government and most importantly the patient. The industry would know in advance what is expected of it, the department would have a well-defined action plan and the consumer would be protected from unscrupulous operators.
Another important matter explored in the inquiry was the issue of informed financial consent. In most other areas of service the client is given a quote that, within reason, is expected to be the final bill.
Thus the intent of this inquiry was to endeavour to find a reasonable format for implementing the same method of arriving at charges for the health industry. 
On the surface this may seem like a simple matter, it is certainly an important one. However in many operations, unforseen circumstances arise and it is often the case that surgeons are not sure what they will find until the operation reaches a certain stage. If the operation has unforseen complications this affects not only the surgeon's fee but also the theatre charges the anaesthetists charges and so the list goes on.
Thus in some instances it would be unreasonable to hold to the original quote.
This however should not preclude the expectation that the patient or the patient's representative should be provided with a reasonable estimate of what the episode of care should cost. This should, when ever viable, be given to the patient well in advance of the service being delivered.
A common complaint involves the number of bills the patient may receive after an episode of care. It is not uncommon for patients to be receiving bills from many quarters and sometimes over many months.
Accounts have been given to me of individuals receiving a bill from the hospital they pay it, then a few days or weeks later a bill from the surgeon, they pay it, then a few days or weeks later the anaesthetist bill arrives and so on it goes. As any one can understand some one recovering from an operation does not need the continual financial up and down indicative in this way of billing.
Thus we suggest when more than one health provider is involved in an episode of care, where practical that agreement should be reached between the providers enabling one nominated provider to be responsible for billing for the whole of the service. This would simplify the process for not only the patient but the provider as well.
With the Senates indulgence I would like to make some brief comments on the recently announced rural health package.
Due to the high quality of the volcanic soil found where I live, farming is one of the main industries in the North West. If my memory serves me, we are the biggest exporter of onions, potatoes and recently other crops such as poppies and pyrethrum.
Thus it was with more than a passing interest I noticed the work of the Australian Centre for Agricultural Health and Safety. The work I am commenting on concerns the dangers faced by those that put food on the tables of the nation. This work shows that farming is the most dangerous occupation, more dangerous than mining. So dangerous in fact that farming averages a death every three days.
James Houlahan the deputy director of the Centre for Agricultural Health and Safety also states that “somewhere between two hundred and six hundred injuries per one thousand farms require attention at rural hospitals each year” (source ABC rural News) This figure does not include injuries not attended to as farmers are renowned for leaving physical pain to the last moment.
One would be excused for thinking that due to need, rural and regional health centres should be well resourced and there should be a GP on every corner. This is unfortunately not the story.
An article in the Australian Journal of Rural Health titled rather aptly the “Inequitable Distribution of General Practitioners in Australia”, shows that there is not an abundance of rural GPs in the Mersey-Lyell region, my home region. As the article clearly shows, in the region of my constituents there is a full time doctor for every thirteen hundred people. However the ACT has a full time doctor for every eight hundred and seventy people. This compared with a state average in Tasmania of one full time GP for every nine hundred and forty one.
Not surprisingly ACT has the greatest ratio of GPs per person as a state average (after all they have people here to blow leaves off the footpath), but even within the Tasmanian context the city country divide is apparent with Hobart having one full time GP for close to every eight hundred people compared to the previously mentioned figure for the area I live, one GP for every thirteen hundred people.
Again the minister should be acknowledged for attempting to address the problem even if some of the policies most likely started on our side of politics, the bonded scholarships for example.
Unfortunately just painting the outside of a building that needs a complete overall has a limited chance of securing the viability of that building in the long term.
And that is what we have in the rural health package. When will the Howard government learn that with out the infrastructure to support the GPs and the families that move with them, they will not stay.
Without a vibrant public hospital where can they refer to, without vibrant schools, where do they send their kids, without decent child care how can their partners find work, without a vibrant social and cultural life the chances of the families of GPs enjoying or even participating in the community are slim.
None of the issues mentioned above have even been acknowledged let alone dealt with in this budget. Thus I suspect that after their bonded time is over most will return to the cities many of them came from feeling burnt out, bored and completely unfulfilled. 
This is one time I hope I am wrong, but I suggest unless National Well Being becomes as important as the National Gross Domestic Product for all the window dressing, nothing will really change in not only rural Australia, but also the whole of our nation.
My colleague, the member for Braddon today issued a press release on the lack of health funding in the Circular Head area. It reads:
Lack of rural health funding
Rural health funding in the Federal Budget does not go far enough, according to Braddon MHR Sid Sidebottom. Mr Sidebottom said communities in areas such as Circular Head were missing out. He said he was concerned that the failure to attract doctors and nurses to Circular Head may mean the loss of services such as obstetrics, and lead to a downgrading of the Smithton Hospital. He said he supported recent calls by the Circular Head Council for the Federal Government to provide greater financial assistance.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-06-05,"—The Democrats support the general purpose and thrust of this bill. Indeed, we have argued for years under successive governments that the issue of the gap was one of the key issues for those Australians who have private health insurance or, indeed, would like to have private health insurance. Out-of-pocket expenses, particularly those that the patient had no warning of, are a great deterrent to people keeping private health insurance and, once the word spreads that people are required to pay the gap—perhaps to doctors, perhaps to hospitals—for a range of different procedures, then soon it becomes a general deterrent for all. In some cases I think the rumours have spread to the point where, indeed, it is not as big an issue as some people may believe but it certainly is a major deterrent. It seems that the cost of the gap to health fund members is somewhere around $200 million a year. That is a very large sum of money for consumers and particularly a large sum of money once consumers have already paid their premiums. 
With successive governments we have argued for no known gaps. We have a legal action in South Australia that has found that patients do have the right to know when they are going to be charged an additional amount of money. This piece of legislation is another step down the road to limiting the out-of-pocket expenses for those Australians who choose to have private health insurance. We are aware of a range of schemes already available which seek to minimise or eliminate the gap for consumers. In particular in my home state of South Australia, Mutual Community has had some considerable successes with their particular gap cover schemes. I congratulate them on their achievements. I understand that they still have some way to go but they have certainly made some very positive steps. 
There is a difficulty for many doctors entering into any agreement that requires a contract. This legislation moves away from requiring contracts and it allows for agreements that do not actually require a signature on the bottom line. Medical practitioners, as represented by the AMA, have expressed support for this legislation. I also note that this legislation has support from the private health insurance industry and consumer groups. 
There were issues raised before and by the Senate Community Affairs Committee during the inquiry into this bill. I think these issues need to be addressed. We have picked up a couple of them. I note the Labor Party have picked up others. The first amendment that the Democrats will be moving addresses a concern raised during the inquiry that there is a potential for gap cover schemes to be inflationary. I think it is critical. It is going to cost the government a considerable amount under its present 30 per cent rebate scheme and, if premiums simply keep going up at basically the same amount as gap payments go down, we will have got nowhere. Consumers will not have benefited and the public purse will be by far worse off. The Democrat amendment will require health funds to provide to the minister for health enough information about their proposed schemes to satisfy him or her that the scheme will not have an inflationary aspect. 
The second Democrat amendment deals with the need for consumers to be fully informed about the details of the schemes. It requires that a person providing hospital treatment under this legislation must disclose to their patient any financial interest that he or she has in any products or services that they recommend the patient be provided with. This issue was raised by the ACCC in their report on anti-competitive behaviour among health funds and health care providers. They drew some comparisons between the issues raised by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in their recent commercial radio inquiry. We want consumers to be confident that their doctors are providing the best advice, which is unbiased by any commercial consideration. Obviously, the vast majority of doctors are very responsible and always have their patients' best interest at heart, but we believe that the consumers have the right to know when their doctors stand to gain financially from a specific course of action that that doctor is recommending. So they must be required to reveal to patients any relevant financial interest when recommending further treatment. 
We understand that disclosure of financial interests raises much broader issues than just direct financial interest that a treating doctor may have. With the increased corporatisation of medical practices, there are a number of potential conflicts of interests, and over time we are going to need to address these in some detail. These issues certainly go a lot broader than those dealt with by this bill relating to gap cover schemes. We will be seeking to move further amendments to general health legislation as it comes before us. I am pleased to see that the opposition are quite supportive of what we are proposing. I also acknowledge the concerns that the opposition raised during the Senate inquiry. We note that the opposition have put forward some draft amendments. I understand that we are not getting to the committee stage tonight, Mr Acting Deputy President. When we do get to the committee stage, we will be looking, in particular, at the opposition's amendment that requires a review of the act as soon as practicable after 1 July 2002. I think this is a very useful exercise when we are looking at a process such as this.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—We have no information that we will not get to the committee stage tonight.
—I think we will be facing some difficulties if we do, Mr Acting Deputy President, because we have different drafts of the opposition amendments. I understand that some are still under discussion and negotiation with the government. Perhaps at the end of the second reading stage, the parliamentary secretary would be able to advise the Senate as to the status of the specific amendments. We understand that, for example, the constitutionality of one of the amendments is under some further discussion. So we wait for the outcome of these discussions, but we do concur with the concerns raised by the opposition in relation to this piece of legislation. 
One final point is that, yet again, we have this government concentrating on private health insurance. We really look forward to some other legislation dealing more broadly with the health system, with the public health system, with a whole raft of different streamlining and proposals specifically dealing with some of the shortcomings. It is a matter of not just putting more money into our public hospitals and public health services but also giving some attention as far as legislation is concerned.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I rise to make some comments in regard to the Health Legislation Amendment (Gap Cover Schemes) Bill 2000. I would pick up from the concluding remarks of the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees, when she indicated that she would welcome some legislation coming forth from the government on other areas dealing with health. Whilst I will come back to that at a later stage in my contribution, I would reiterate that call. Whilst this legislation goes to the very important issue of covering gap payments, the government is found wanting when it comes to the big issues in health—and nothing could have been clearer than that in its recent budget.
The government has made a lot of noise about its supposed initiatives for rural and regional health in the budget, but when you examine the detail you find a scheme which is long overdue, picks up an idea the Labor Party advanced some time ago and, most importantly, only goes to a narrow area of the health debate. Interestingly enough, the initiative in the budget is directed at increasing the number of medical students who will ultimately be working in rural and regional areas.  
There are some major issues that impact upon health in this country. Unfortunately, this government has ignored them and in some cases has made the situation worse. The situation in our public hospitals is critical because of the policies of this government, which have focused almost exclusively on the private hospital system to the exclusion of the public health system, which is managed largely by the states. Since it has been in office, this government has ripped well over $1.5 billion out of the public hospital system. On the other side of the ledger, the government has introduced a scheme which provides a 30 per cent rebate for persons taking out private health insurance in an endeavour to lift the level of private health insurance. 
I have put this on the record before and I will say it again: I happen to have private health insurance. I have had it since I was old enough to pay for it myself and no longer had to rely on the insurance provided by my parents. I come from a tradition where I was in private health insurance, and I have kept it up. But many people in Australia have found that private health insurance has become increasingly expensive and has failed to deliver the coverage that they require. Everybody can relay their own stories, as well as examples from their constituents, about people with private health insurance still having to meet costs of thousands of dollars when they have a procedure in a hospital. We all know that the cost has always been the difference between the amount charged by the doctor or the surgeon and the rebate provided by a combination of Medicare and the private health fund. People have continuously and increasingly found that private health insurance has not been delivering. 
Whether you look at the area of medical coverage or at other areas, such as ancillaries, you will find, increasingly, that the value is not commensurate with the cost of the insurance, let alone the cost of the gap. Anyone who has private health insurance coverage today—and, under the current legislation, you effectively have to have it if your income is over a certain level, or you have to pay the extra levy—will find that in areas such as dentistry the difference between the amount charged and the refund received from the health fund is astronomical. 
The whole point of this is that we have a problem with private health insurance, and that is that it is simply not value for money. People have increasingly been prepared to take the risk and rely on the public hospital system. What has this government done to address this issue? Firstly, it decided that it would take funds out of the public hospital system, which is its primary responsibility, and transfer them as a subsidy to the private health insurance industry in an endeavour to lift their membership. Secondly, it has opened up a situation where people can take out the cheapest private health insurance coverage available, thereby qualifying for the rebate and avoiding the levy. They then continue to rely on the public hospital system. Thirdly, the government now proposes—as requested by the AMA—an ability for funds to provide known gap cover schemes. On the surface, that looks okay. If it reduces the level of the gap or—as I think is more likely—provides an incentive for doctors to advise their patients up-front what their fees are, that could be said to be a good thing. However, when you examine it closely you find that this proposal moves the balance, again, further towards the medical profession and their interests and away from the interests of patients.
When we were in government prior to 1996, honourable senators will recall that, under the then minister for health, Dr Carmen Lawrence, we sought to introduce a system whereby cover could be provided on a no-gap basis where there was an arrangement between the health fund and the medical practitioner. The basis of that was that doctors would enter into arrangements with medical funds, and hospitals would enter into similar arrangements. Patients could then go in for procedures, knowing that all of their costs would be identified up-front and would be covered by their policy. What was the reaction of the industry? The doctors would not have a bar of it. They said, `Hang on, this is in conflict with the privacy of the doctor-patient relationship.' I recall there were a number of hospitals that were not all that keen on the scheme, although in large measure hospitals were prepared to enter into these arrangements with health funds but the doctors were not. So an incentive to deal with the gap problem was rejected by the medical profession. 
It is in that light that you should consider this legislation. Whilst it is intended to increase the appeal of private health insurance and to improve the product by allowing gap cover schemes to be approved, in effect we are talking about known gap schemes—not no-gap schemes. That means that there will still be a gap. The only obligation on the doctor is to identify up-front the amount of that gap so that, when the patient has to undergo some procedure in a hospital, there will be an identified amount that Medicare covers and there will be a known gap that the patient will be up for. The opposition have already indicated—and Senator Evans covered this—that we are concerned that these proposals could trigger a new round of increases in the fees charged by doctors. It could have an inflationary effect; indeed, it could also lead to health premiums increasing. It has not been made clear how this legislation will prevent doctors from charging large gap fees. It will still be possible, provided that they disclose those fees in advance. If increases in doctors' fees do come about, insurance premiums and gap fees could continue to increase, leading to further pressure on an already overburdened public health system. We have some major concerns with this proposal.
I am also intrigued that the basis behind this proposed scheme is to give effect to what essentially has been argued for by the Australian Medical Association. I have a reasonable amount of respect for the AMA. I believe that, by and large, on many issues not only are they forthright advocates of their own particular interests but also they do, on many occasions, argue in support of matters of public policy. That is clear on issues like Aboriginal health and the impact of tobacco advertising, and I think it is certainly true in respect of their concerns to improve the delivery of health services in rural and regional Australia. I and many other members of parliament have taken the opportunity on a number of occasions to attend AMA breakfasts or briefings, when they have been held in this parliament, to hear from the former leader of the AMA, Dr Brand, and other spokespersons on their views on health matters. We welcome that.
I still find it rather ironic that legislation is being put forward by the government which has been pretty much developed as an idea by the doctors' trade union, the Australian Medical Association, which is pretty well a closed shop. I do not think membership is compulsory, but it is not far from it. I do not have any problem with the AMA seeking to represent the views of the medical profession in this country, along with the other relevant groups, but it is interesting to note that on this issue this government is quite prepared to adopt the views of the trade union for the doctors whereas on every occasion that you hear a government minister, particularly Mr Reith, speak about the interests of particular groups of workers, trade unions are anathema—they are to be avoided at all costs.
I make that point because every day now we seem to be hearing from Mr Reith about the evils of collective representation and of bargaining for the collective interest. That is what this scheme is really about: it is being put forward for the collective interests of doctors in this country to protect their incomes—probably even to enhance their incomes ultimately. If you read the second reading speech, the government talks about sitting down with the association to address further issues of concern with respect to the whole question of gap insurance. So let us not have any more of this two-faced hypocritical approach from this government when it comes to representing the views of sectional interests in this country.
I will conclude by drawing attention to the marked difference between the approach adopted by this government and that adopted by the New South Wales government recently in respect of health. The New South Wales government, in March this year and again in the budget, announced that they would be injecting in excess of $2 billion into the New South Wales health system—a substantial real increase. The package gives health professionals more certainty, greater funding and an opportunity to be involved in the planning and implementation processes. The New South Wales government—with very little, if any, support from the federal government—are addressing the real needs of providing extra funding and services throughout New South Wales, particularly in rural and regional areas. They are the real issues that this government should be focusing its mind on, and that is what this minister for health should be focusing his attention on. But it seems that, unfortunately, we have a minister for health who is more interested in doing the bidding all of the time of the medical profession, whether it be in respect of addressing the issue of gap payments—an important issue, no doubt, but not the most critical issue—or indeed in addressing something like the provision of MRI machines. 
With those remarks, I look forward with interest to the response from the federal government, particularly in the committee stage, to the important issues that have been raised by Senator Evans and Senator Lees to ensure that this legislation delivers real improvements to the patients who have to pay the gap rather than simply being a mechanism for increasing the fees of doctors and inflating health costs even further.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GAP COVER SCHEMES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2000-06-05,"—I rise to speak this evening on the Health Legislation Amendment (Gap Cover Schemes) Bill 2000. I appreciate and would like to second the comments of my colleague Senator Forshaw. I also appreciate him stepping into a gap that I was experiencing about 20 minutes ago. 
—That was a known gaps policy, wasn't it?
—We got together to cover the gap very well, thank you very much, Senator Quirke. If you read the report from the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on the Health Legislation Amendment (Gap Cover Schemes) Bill 2000, you will see on page 1 of the report:
Data for 1997-98 shows that the cost of medical gaps for in-hospital medical services provided to people with private health insurance was around $200 million. The average medical gap for an episode for a private patient in a private hospital was $151 and for a private patient in a public hospital was $69, though for some procedures the gap payment can be much higher.
Indeed, in other parts of this report the gap is reported to be in some cases up to $1,000—and we know that is the case. I have said it many times in this place, and we know how often we get letters from people who say things like: `I've had private health insurance for 30 years. I always thought it was the right and proper thing to do. For the first time in my life I've used that private health insurance and now I have a bill for $3,000. Senator, I'm a pensioner and I can't pay. What will I do?' 
I had hoped that over the years we might have gotten rid of gaps. But here we are legislating to cover the gaps, we think, by allowing doctors to charge an amount above the scheduled fee with no guarantee, of course, that that is where they will stop. No gap or known gap: `Good afternoon, Mrs Jones. You're in terrible trouble. I appreciate you are going to need an operation, and I am pleased that you've come to see me on referral from your general practitioner. I can tell you that if you do have that operation with me in hospital Z the gap will be $1,000. Are you in? The gap will be $150. Are you still in?' What are we talking about here: that a doctor will be able to say to a person with private health insurance—insurance which is supposed to protect them from big medical bills—`We'll discuss the agreement. Yes, medically you need an operation or a procedure. Yes, we are agreed that we can go ahead. Yes, a bed can be arranged for you in a hospital. Now what we have to do is talk about what is the no gap,' or, in many cases, the known gap. People who are now clearly aware that they need medical treatment will have to perhaps bargain or just cop it sweet, whatever the doctor says is the known gap: `I'm terribly pleased you are here. I'm very pleased to tell you that in my case the known gap is $200,' or $500 or whatever. I find this is a remarkable achievement by the medical practitioners of this world—extremely wonderful. What have they done to make it so acceptable? They have had a minister who has introduced $2 billion worth of rebate subsidy for those with private health insurance. The pain now will be considerably less because, should these gaps contribute to inflationary pressure on private health insurance, one-third of the tab is going to be picked up by the taxpayers anyhow for everybody. 
One of the things that the coalition government keep telling us is that they are good economic managers; in health care the example time and time again is that they are not. What kind of restraint on costs is it to subsidise private health premiums by 30 per cent? It turns out to be appalling economics. Indeed, we saw most of those prospective gains for people with private health insurance consumed immediately by rises in private health premiums. We have seen what happened when doctors, obstetricians, were granted by the government an increase in the Medicare rebate for complicated obstetrical procedures. What happened was that the gaps stayed the same and the doctors pocketed the difference. The increase went straight to the obstetricians. Being of the great medical profession, I suppose I am better able to speak than others about this matter. I am very proud of the medical profession and I would hate anybody to take my words to mean that all docs are out there making a quick buck. But we do know that this profession over time has established a precedent that, out of taking the money and not taking the money, many of them are in for taking the money. They are increasing the costs, pushing them up—and what is the benefit? Why on earth does it cost more to have the same procedure done in a private hospital than it does to have it done in a public hospital? The difference is stark if you compare both of those as private patients. On any examination, the costs of doing procedures in public hospitals should be more expensive. They have on-costs of education, of training doctors, of training nursing staff, of pathology services provided, of research dollars and so on. None of those costs are borne by a private hospital and yet the cost for the procedure in a private hospital is significantly more.
Nobody seems to be troubled by this. Nobody seems to ask why. I hope the patients of Australia can now start saying, `Why? Why can you do this to me, doctor, for a gap of $50 in a public hospital and a gap of $250 in a private hospital?' What I think we are writing in here is the prospect of real pressure on our public hospitals. We have not seen too much to this point. We do not know of any evidence to prove it but we do know that this is likely to make people say, `Very good, doctor, I will have this operation in a public hospital where you are telling me the gap is going to be less.' Same doctor, same procedure, different hospital—what is the accounting of this? Why on earth do the medical profession say that their gap has to be so much bigger in a private hospital where they do not have on-costs that are anything like the same as in a public hospital? I think these are major concerns, very significant concerns, and I am particularly troubled by the evidence of what has happened with the obstetricians: that the gap remains the same and the doctors have taken the increase. That is not going to reduce the pressure on private health insurance rebates. It is going to increase the outlays by the taxpayers of Australia, who are subsidising everybody with private health insurance to the tune of some 30 per cent. So there is not the same pressure to worry because, if the premiums do rise, one-third of the cost is being picked up by the taxpayer.
I am astounded that the minister for health, who might claim to be good at health economics, would allow such open-ended underwriting of uncontrolled, unrestricted, unlimited charges. In the end it does come back to what sort of health services we are providing. It does come back to who is paying. What is happening is that thousands—billions—of precious taxpayers' dollars are going to subsidise rebates for private health insurance and they are not going into our public hospitals. They are not going to provide an alternative to this private health insurance treatment process. Isn't it interesting that private health insurance was established to protect people from overwhelming medical bills—bills that would cripple a family, cripple a patient—because most people, if they are sent a bill by their doctor, will do what they can to pay it. So private health insurance was introduced to try to protect people from those kinds of crippling debts. We now have a system that does protect people. It is called Medicare. While I hold my breath on how sincerely they mean it, even the opposition now say Medicare is a good thing. 
—What?
—Yes, they do, Senator Calvert. 
—The opposition is saying that?
—Sorry—you, the coalition, thank you. There we are, Senator Calvert, I beg your pardon. I am glad you actually corrected me on that. The coalition even now says it supports Medicare.
—Sort of.
—I have some quotes where Prime Minister Howard is actually on the record as saying it, which is an extremely significant change from what he was saying not too long ago at all. But, if he now believes in Medicare, that is extremely good. I am very pleased that he believes in Medicare and I think it is one of those times when we will remind him, again and again and then again and again—ad nauseam—that he actually said on record that Medicare is a good thing and it should be protected.
—I just hope that it was not a core belief.
—One has a fear that it is not a core belief. One of the things that is so good about Medicare is that people do not have a gap. They do not have to worry about other costs; there is no gap. Many speakers from the coalition have stood up in this place and told us how important it was to increase private health insurance so as to assist people to get off waiting lists and so on. The more they said it the more the people marched away from private health insurance to Medicare, because Medicare gave them protection. Medicare gave them no gap. Medicare gave them good health services in our great public hospitals and they did not have a gap. I can hear my colleagues over there ranting and raving as they go on about all of this—`It was the Labor government plot to destroy private health insurance.' No, it was not. We introduced a marvellous alternative and the people made very reasonable choices. I find it amazing that, for having made those good choices, they have been described as all sorts of things but in particular they have been regarded as defective—`We must actually give them the option to pay lots of money for private health insurance premiums and then, when they get their surgical procedures and their medical procedures, they will have to pay even more, called the gap.' So I think that the coalition is very two-faced about its policies in health care.
—What about the waiting lists under your lot?
—You know that the waiting lists were a furphy then and are a furphy now. I am pleased with that interjection from Senator Calvert, because Minister Blewett, way back then, found $40 million to provide to private hospitals, together with the states, to get the doctors to reduce the waiting lists. In my own state of South Australia—
—I am too busy talking to listen to your rabbiting on, Senator. But if you give me a minute, I will finish my comments and then you might want to say something sensible. The private hospitals in South Australia were delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to reducing waiting lists, but the doctors refused to participate. And that, I have to say, is extremely depressing. In the Illawarra region, New South Wales, the doctors quite differently agreed to cooperate, and they reduced the eye waiting list for pensioners by operating in the private hospitals under this arrangement. There are some other very good examples of where it happened. The coalition does not want to know about that, but it did happen. Under a Labor government, we reduced the waiting lists.
Senator Calvert should know that there is no evidence that the increase in private health insurance numbers reduces any pressure on public hospitals. There is none—no evidence at all. What we do have is anecdotal evidence that people with private health insurance are not declaring it but are going to a public hospital where they know they will have no gap. The reason that this legislation is in here is that it has finally dawned on the coalition—they have finally accepted what has been said for years—that the gap has been a major contributor to consumer perceptions about private health insurance. Why would you pay the ever-increasing private health insurance premiums when what you cop is a big bill? If you are lucky, you only have one big bill. But many people, recovering from a procedure in hospital and not feeling well at all, have to cover not one gap but many gaps—bundles of bills that you did not know you would get, from theatre bills to whatever. Some of that is now being gathered together under a variation on legislation introduced by Dr Lawrence. And the screams then from the coalition in opposition on behalf of their medical profession colleagues! `We can't cop this. This is outrageous! This is shocking and terrible!' Now here they come with a piece of legislation that goes a long way to doing, more or less, what Minister Lawrence was then proposing. 
I have grave concerns about this legislation. As I said, on the evidence of the obstetricians I believe that trusting the doctors to set fees and to stick to them is an open-ended invitation to excess, if not greed. I certainly would not hold my breath for doctors to set those limits. I find it extremely disappointing that that is apparently the best that we can do. We have `carroted' and `sticked' people into private health insurance, and it seems that a few people have taken the carrot. More of them are being beaten, `sticked', into it as they appreciate the penalties that will occur to them if they do not do things before— 
—Say that again—beaten and sticked?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, there are some over there who seem not to understand this metaphor. They look to me as though they were probably in primary school when these things were commonly said, but if they do not understand it I can refer them to Mother Goose's nursery rhymes or some other similar kind of reading which should give them an understanding of it. People have been thrashed into private health insurance, `sticked' into it, for those over there who are not understanding. And what they are going to find, if they are lucky, is a known gap. We do not have, even still, a guarantee that that known gap will be properly and comprehensively explained to people before their medical or surgical procedure. It is a hope that it will be, but I would love to know how anyone is going to police it, to check up on it. `Mrs Jones, did Dr Smith tell you how much this was going to cost?' `No.' And Dr Smith will say, `I certainly did.' And people who are under pressure, who are ill, who are sick, may well not hear the information or, as in times past, may not be told the information.
It may be that we have got a differently informed medical profession, but some years back I chaired an inquiry into private health insurance. It was really edifying to have the surgeons come along to that committee and give evidence! I asked them questions like, `What is the gap? What would a person have to pay for an appendix operation in your clever hands, doctor?' They answered, `Well, that is a really good question, Senator Crowley. We don't know.' So I hope somebody is going to educate the surgeons of Australia, let alone the rest of the medical profession, about what the gap will be—not just what they are charging but what a person's private health insurance coverage will be. As the doctors said back then, the doctors might be very annoyed that they are going to have to do these calculations and sums. I would imagine that that is not an unreasonable thing—they are not supposed to be doing sums like that. They are supposed to be diagnosing medical conditions rather than assessing how much the gap is going to be. But if this is the legislation and this is the way that we are going to go, then I think it behoves the doctors to get it right and to give those facts to prospective patients.
I also think it is going to be terribly important to have a look at just what has happened in this legislation in a very short period. I would make a sunset clause of six months. I see that there are some proposals that we at least have a look at it in a year's time—and so we should. I remind senators again that the evidence of the obstetricians in very recent history should give people no comfort whatsoever. It is called in the end `Who's paying for all of this?' The medical profession insist on their right to contract between a patient and themselves. It is all a private contract, and it is largely taxpayers' money. Never forget that—despite the fact that people will want to say that if you have your procedure in a private hospital there is no taxpayers' money involved. Rubbish! Seventy-five per cent of the medical benefits schedule for that procedure is already covered by the taxpayer, and that will continue. A very significant cost in private hospitals is met by the taxpayer. And now that rebate for private health insurance is come-in-sucker money for private health insurance people and for people who want to put up the costs. This is one of the big concerns: as the gap grows, so will the pressure on private health insurance and so will the claims against those funds. It is clearly inflationary, and I think we should be very concerned about just how far we can let that inflation pressure go. But, as I said, if you have already had the minister set in place the rebate of 30 per cent to the tune of $2 billion, then this legislation is in its logical sequence. That, to me, is a very depressing way on which to finish. 
I do not hold my breath about this legislation doing anything to contain costs. In fact, it is clearly an indication that costs will increase because the known gap element means that doctors will charge and will be allowed to charge above the schedule fee. I ask the minister whether he or she, depending on who it is—if it is Senator Tambling, then he—could provide any information to me as to why a procedure costs so much more in a private hospital when that procedure is not associated with any of the on-costs that happen in a public hospital. I have asked this question before and been told that it was irrelevant.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-06-05,"—The Health Legislation Amendment (Gap Cover Schemes) Bill 2000 will provide an additional means by which private health insurance funds can offer gap cover to contributors for in-hospital medical care. This bill amends two acts, the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Act 1973. This piece of legislation is important, as it addresses one of the most intractable problems facing the private health insurance industry—the medical gap. The gap is the difference between fees charged by doctors for in-hospital medical services and the combined health insurance benefits and Medicare rebate. 
It is crucial to remember the significant role played by private health insurance in funding the hospital system in this country. This contribution is simply invaluable to the financial viability of the Australian health care system as a whole. The continued existence of the gap threatens this contribution, as it may lead to the perception by consumers that private health insurance does not offer value for money. Senator Crowley is a doctor and I would have thought she well understood this much more comprehensively. I find her comments very critical. After 13 years of Labor in government before the Howard government came into office, there was nothing in that term of office but a raiding on private health insurance and a changing of the funding of public hospitals. I can speak from personal experience. In 1998, I had an aortic valve replacement at a cost of over $40,000, where the economics of that were incredibly assisted by private health insurance, to the tune of about $30,000, while $8,000 was the Medicare rebate. Certainly my own contribution of $3,000 was very small in that area. 
While existing legislation allows funds to provide gap cover where the doctor has a negotiated agreement, either directly with the fund or with a hospital that has a negotiated agreement with the fund, there has been some resistance by the medical profession to this approach due to its contractual nature. The proposed bill addresses this apprehension by offering a no contract option to address the gap. This approach gives funds greater flexibility in their approach to gap cover. At the same time it aims to encourage a greater number of medical practitioners to participate in gap cover, and it will provide consumers with the choice of more products offering gap cover. This means better value private health insurance. The approach is entirely voluntary. Funds and doctors alike will participate on a totally voluntary basis. The schemes that funds will develop and that doctors will participate in will be those that are attractive to all parties: the funds, the doctors and the contributors.  
Importantly, this legislation does not jeopardise existing agreements that funds already have in place. The government is keen for funds to continue their current efforts to address the gap. It has been very pleasing to see the work of the funds and doctors so far to address the gap using the existing legislative framework. Those doctors already participating in agreements are expected to continue to do so under the current framework. This measure will complement the current legislation by providing a no contract means for funds to cover the gap. In this way it will appeal to doctors who are not currently participating in agreements and would not do so under any circumstances due to their objections to contracts. 
In order to ensure maximum benefits to consumers, the proposed gap cover schemes will be developed by private health insurance funds and will need to be approved by the Minister for Health and Aged Care before they can come into operation. Approval will be made with reference to a number of essential criteria set out in the regulations attaching to the bill. The regulations have been drafted in advance of the bill being passed to provide all parties with the opportunity to comment. In debate of the bill in the House of Representatives, the shadow minister for health referred to the fact that the bill provides for much of the detail concerning the approval and subsequent regulation of gap cover schemes in these regulations. It is precisely for this reason that the regulations have been drafted in advance of the passage of the enabling legislation, so that members and senators can consider the package in its entirety.
I will now turn to some of the key measures contained within the gap cover schemes legislative package. The approval process provided for in the legislation contains a number of protective measures that will ensure that gap cover schemes deliver maximum benefit to consumers. Most importantly, the legislation ensures that no scheme will be approved unless the health fund can demonstrate that it will not have an inflationary impact. This information will have to be provided to the minister in detail in the fund's application for scheme approval. It is worth noting that this legislation introduces protective mechanisms that do not apply to current agreements to address the gap. The current measures to address the gap which were introduced by the opposition do not address the issue of the inflationary impact at all. In contrast, this measure has been designed very deliberately to ensure that inflationary impacts are not felt throughout the health system as a result of measures to address the gap. To further safeguard the interests of consumers, the legislation enables the minister to review the operation of schemes at regular intervals, and he may also impose conditions on the continued approval of the schemes if necessary. Schemes will also be independently monitored by the Private Health Insurance Administrative Council to determine the extent to which they will generally reduce or eliminate gap payments by consumers. 
The legislation also provides for revocation of schemes if they are not delivering better outcomes for patients and do not meet the criteria as required. Revocation is considered to be a last resort. The regulations ensure that contributors are protected if a scheme is revoked, as they require funds in their application for scheme approval to demonstrate that contributors would not be disadvantaged if a scheme were revoked. As I have mentioned, the regulations attaching to the bill include a number of essential criteria that funds must address in their application for scheme approval. As well as the criteria that I have already outlined, funds are also required to show that their scheme provides informed financial consent and simplified billing and to ensure that the professional freedom of medical practitioners is maintained to identify appropriate treatments for their patients within the scope of accepted clinical practice.
I would like to discuss in more detail the requirements for informed financial consent and simplified billing. During the debate of this bill in the House of Representatives, both the shadow minister for health and the member for Fremantle made much of the fact that neither the bill nor the regulations contain a definition of `informed financial consent'. Informed financial consent is to be an integral part of gap cover schemes, just as it is for existing agreements between doctors and funds. The requirement for informed financial consent states that the medical practitioner is to inform the health fund member, before treatment if possible, or as soon as practicable after treatment, of any amount they may reasonably be expected to pay. 
Another criterion for the gap cover schemes is the requirement for simplified billing to be provided, where appropriate. In cases where there is no gap payment owed by the patient, it is obviously not necessary. The government is keen to encourage simplified billing and promote it where possible as a means to make private health insurance more efficient and attractive, but neither funds, hospitals nor doctors are currently required to participate in it, including under the existing gap agreement framework. This bill establishes a voluntary, no contract framework that will be attractive to the industry. It is now up to funds, hospitals and doctors to work together to produce arrangements that will make private health insurance more attractive to Australians. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-06-05,"—I rise to address two extraordinary attacks that Senator Murray has made on the Northern Territory in recent months. Senator Murray has twice this year attacked the system of governance in the Northern Territory, making the very serious allegation that the Northern Territory parliament is undemocratic. I have very deliberately described Senator Murray's comments as attacks on the Northern Territory because that is exactly what they are. They are not attacks on the parliament, they are not an attack on the government, they are not an attack on the Country Liberal Party; they are an attack on each and every Territorian.
The Northern Territory does have a democratic system of government. Just because Senator Murray does not support the government that the people of the Territory elect does not mean that the system is not democratic. Senator Murray is highly critical of the fact that the Northern Territory has a unicameral system of government and claims there is a lack of checks and balances through an upper house. He cites Queensland as being the only other state in Australia with a unicameral system but fails to note that there have been many changes of government in Queensland in recent times. Does he think the Queensland parliament is undemocratic or is it a bastion of democracy only because it has had changes of government? Why does Senator Murray not attack the Queensland parliament in a similar manner? Is it because he does not want to patronise and offend Queensland voters as he has Territory voters? Is he worried that his arrogant attitude may affect the vote of his counterparts in the Senate, Senators Bartlett and Woodley?
It is no surprise that the system Senator Murray advocates—the Hare-Clarke system—is notorious for throwing up anomalous election results which make it almost impossible for any party to govern in its own right and stifles decision making and development. The governments of New Zealand, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, all of which use this system, are almost moribund. It is no surprise that this system results in an increased number of `minor' party candidates such as those from the Democrats and Greens being elected, a fact, I am sure, which has not escaped Senator Murray's notice. Senator Murray talks about the need for checks and balances on the parliament and proposes a complex parliament that involves a cumbersome committee system and two elections just to appoint a Chief Minister. Imagine the cost to voters, let alone the confusion. 
In contrast, the Northern Territory parliament has many checks and balances but the most important is the will of the people. Every four years Territorians go to the polls and make the government accountable in the hardest forum of all, the ballot box. This is democracy in action. I am sorry if it offends Senator Murray that the Country Liberal Party keeps winning elections in the Territory. Perhaps he should consider that it is because the people want it to represent them. A further check is the fact that the Commonwealth parliament, as we have been reminded so painfully in recent times with euthanasia, has the power to overturn any legislation the Northern Territory parliament creates. This is the ultimate restriction placed on a democratically elected parliament, and one I hope will never be used again—particularly after the Democrats' political wrangling over mandatory sentencing. 
Senator Murray claims that a quarter of the Territory's population—Aboriginal people—is not represented in the Northern Territory parliament. I am sure that many people in the Territory would strongly disagree with this. The Aboriginal parliamentarians John Ah Kit and Maurice Rioli might have a right to believe that they are representing their people, as would most other members of the Legislative Assembly, particularly those with large Aboriginal populations in their electorates, such as Maggie Hickey, Peter Toyne, Sid Stirling, John Elferink and Tim Baldwin. It is interesting to note that following the recent redistribution of Northern Territory electoral divisions, the seat which saw the most constituent objections was Victoria River, now to be known as Daly. This seat has a significant Aboriginal population and is held by a Country Liberal Party politician, Territory MLA and minister, Tim Baldwin. The objections were from people in the Aboriginal communities of Lajamanu, Kalkaringi and Daguragu, who wished to remain in Tim Baldwin's electorate. Obviously, Mr Baldwin has been doing a good job of representing the people in his electorate, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. This makes a mockery of Senator Murray's claims. Perhaps if he bothered to discover anything about the Territory before going off half-cocked he would make a bit more sense. His paternalistic and patronising views regarding Aboriginal people are hypocritical in the extreme.
Senator Murray also bemoans the fact that there is a weak opposition in the Territory. This is no-one's fault but the Labor Party's. What is his own party doing in the Territory? To date, Territorians have rejected the few Australian Democrat candidates who have bothered to stand because their policies and personalities are not in tune with Territorians. They receive only a handful of votes because they are not in touch with Territory aspirations—as Senator Murray's ill-informed and ill-timed comments so obviously demonstrate at the federal level. On the other hand, if you want a superior statement of commitment and principles on Territory issues, take a good, hard look at the Country Liberal Party constitution and platform. An indication of the Democrats' true interest in the Territory and Territorians is the fact that their Territory web site goes straight to the Western Australian Democrats site. They cannot even be bothered setting up a Territory specific site.
It is interesting to note that, while Senator Murray is often very critical of the Northern Territory government, the economic data and other evidence all point to the fact that the CLP government has been achieving much for Territorians. The picture painted of the Territory from any objective use of statistics and facts is that of a young, vigorous and well-informed community. Let me briefly relate some ABS statistics, mostly based on the 1996 census but also on some more recent research, to give a snapshot of the Territory's social and economic situation.
The average age of Territorians is 28 years compared to a national average of 34 years. Unemployment in the Northern Territory averages about four per cent compared to a national rate of about seven per cent. As at September 1999, 73.7 per cent of Territorians participated in the work force compared to a national average of 64 per cent. Again at September 1999, Territorians aged 15 to 24 had the highest median weekly income in Australia at $193 and the nation's lowest youth full-time unemployment rate of 8.9 per cent. Territory participation in the arts is second only to that of the ACT. The Northern Territory has the third highest percentage of online households in Australia, with 16 per cent of households in 1998 having Internet access and 39 per cent of households frequently using a home computer. 
The Territory exported an estimated 453,000 head of cattle during 1999 worth almost $92 million. In 1999 the Northern Territory had the highest exports per capita of any Australian region at $1,571 per person. Total Australian exports per capita by comparison equate to $403 per person. In 1999 the total number of visitors to the Territory was 1.294 million. The tourism industry generates almost $800 million per annum for the Northern Territory economy. In 1998-99, defence accounted for 12 per cent of the Territory's gross state product and mining accounted for 13.8 per cent of the Territory's GSP. The Northern Territory's GSP increased by 7.6 per cent during 1998-99 to $6,460 million. The Northern Territory has averaged 5.6 per cent or $307.6 million growth in GSP over the past five years.
Senator Murray obviously believes that the Country Liberal Party has maintained the same policies, views and attitudes on every issue over the past 25 years to remain the most successful political party in Australia. The only thing that has stayed the same in that time is the commitment of the Country Liberal Party, which is to achieve the best for Territorians and the Northern Territory and to maintain the lifestyle that has made the Territory the envy of so many people in Australia—especially those like Senator Murray. The Territory and the Country Liberal Party have been leaders and pioneers in social policy across many fields: euthanasia; Aboriginal issues in education, health, and business and joint ventures; issues relating to remoteness; and, recently, mandatory sentencing. This innovation and drive is what makes the Territory great, and I am proud to be a part of the political party which has played such a large role in making the Territory what it is now.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Northern Territory: Governance</title>,Adjournment,36,1,speech
