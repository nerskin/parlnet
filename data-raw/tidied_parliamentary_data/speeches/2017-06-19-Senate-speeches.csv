Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:01):  I rise to continue my remarks on this bill, which the Greens see as a fantastic opportunity for the GST to be removed from tampons and sanitary pads. We have had statements from both sides of this chamber indicating that others too think this is a sexist tax whose time has come and that it should be removed. This is an opportunity for both sides of this chamber to support the removal of this sexist tax on women's biology.


When the GST laws were drafted—perhaps there were no women in the room—it was deemed that sanitary items were a luxury item for women. Guys, it is biology, it is no luxury, and this is something that should not have the GST applied to it. I spoke to that last week.


What I would like to do today is move a second reading amendment, which I understand has now been circulated in the chamber. Hopefully people have received that; if not, it will be coming very shortly. It is very brief and asks that the debate on this bill be suspended until such time as state and territory treasurers have time to consider the proposal to remove the tampon tax. Half the states and territories now support the removal of GST from tampons and sanitary items. The remaining states and territories last year did not support it, but with the revenue raised from this bill, which we understand will be going through the chamber with the support of both the old parties, the states would not fall short. They would be able to support removing the GST from tampons and not be out of pocket. This is a great opportunity for us finally to remove this discriminatory tax on women's biology. We have that opportunity today.


I want to acknowledge the broad support for this issue that we received over the weekend. We started a petition late last week, off the back of many, many years of campaigning on this issue. Over the weekend, 11,000 people signed a petition saying that we need to remove this sexist and discriminatory tax on women's biology—this tax on tampons and pads that was probably put on with a whole lot of men in the room, and, sadly, not enough women in the room, if any at all. We will be moving that second reading amendment, and I will do so shortly, to ask that this bill be delayed until such time as the states and territories can consider the good financial reasoning for removing this discriminatory tax. I want to thank the 11,600 people who signed the petition over the weekend supporting the removal of the GST on pads and tampons. I will flag that, whilst I do not have it with me at the minute, I will be tabling that petition later today. I am sure signatures will keep flooding in, but I want to thank those signatories who have done so. I move the following amendment, and I presume we will vote on it in due course:

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:05):  This is a bill whose time has at last come. The Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017 is a bill that I believe should have been introduced many, many years ago, to ensure that imported goods under $1,000 had the same tax on them as those same goods would have had if they were sold by an Australian retailer within Australia. For too long, our small businesspeople in Australia and the retailers in our country have had to put up with this very unfair competition; that is, they could sell a good—an item of clothing or some other well-used good in Australia—but they would always start 10 per cent behind the price that a foreign dispatcher of that same good could charge. Over the years, so many constituents who are in small business would complain to me about how our fellow Australians would go into their shop, have a look around, see the particular good they wanted and the statistics of that particular good, then walk out of the shop, go home, and order it online from overseas for at least 10 per cent less than my constituents in Queensland could charge.


To a degree, this is an issue that has impacted upon small businesspeople, particularly in Australia, for a long period of time. In our wisdom, the parliament in the past decided that goods over $1,000 in value would be subject to the GST, but we gave this exemption for lower value goods mainly, I suspect, because it was always thought to be too hard to collect money on hundreds of thousands—perhaps even millions—of goods that were acquired by Australians from overseas retailers at relatively low values. I can understand the concern that the Treasury and the public service would have had with that, but I come at this from the position of my constituents and the people who support our party—small business people—who have been unfairly disadvantaged for a long period of time now. I am delighted that this bill is at last going to address that. I tell somewhat humorously that the first person who raised this with me, three or four years ago now, was a local businessman in Townsville who had a number of businesses, but one of them was an adult shop. He came to me and he said that people were no longer using his shop because they could get the same goods much cheaper from overseas because he had to comply with Australian moral laws, but, more importantly, he had to comply with the GST laws. His sale items were always 10 per cent more than those of his competitors who were overseas, who could ship the goods in. According to him and others of my constituents who have raised it with me, within three or four days the goods would be at the residence of the buyer. In his business, that was another attraction. I only mention that because that was a graphic example of why reform was needed in this area.


I will briefly refer to Senator Waters' speech, in which she addressed a particular item on which she is introducing a second reading amendment. It would be good if we could remove the GST from everything. Australians would generally love that, but unfortunately the state governments—who get all of the revenue from the GST—would not be very keen on that. That is because the GST is the main revenue of the states. I say to Senator Waters: if she has an important issue there, I would think the first port of call for her would be to see the states and to see—




Senator Waters:
  I have done that, Senator Macdonald.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order. Please continue, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is another case where there is one rule for everybody else and one rule for the Greens. If I dare interject when Senator Waters is talking, you have everyone in the Greens political party taking a point of order. But as I say, there is one rule for everybody else and a separable rule for the Greens.


I do not want to spend a lot on that particular part of the debate. I simply say that if Senator Waters came with the agreement of every state government to that reduction in their GST revenue, then I think it is something perhaps the Commonwealth should look—although I doubt that it is in this bill that you would address something like that. Perhaps it needs a piece of legislation that is more specifically to the point. But I would be interested to hear from Senator Waters if all of the states have agreed to forfeit the revenue in the manner she proposes.


That does lead me just to emphasise that this is a GST bill. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the revenue raised is not particularly relevant—and I emphasise 'particularly'—because all of the money raised from this will go to the states. My own state of Queensland is a classic example. That state, which has been very poorly managed financially for a long period of time, certainly needs every cent it can get from whatever sources. The revenue raised from this bill, should it be passed, would be going straight to the state government.


I do have one concern with this bill that I may pursue further in the committee stage: that is, the method of collection. I have raised this with both the finance minister and the Treasurer. They have been courteous in their responses to me, but I find it difficult to understand why we have a method of collection on goods above $1,000 that I will refer to as the vendor method of collection. According to Treasury estimates, if we use the vendor method of collection—which is that vendors overseas will collect the GST and pay it to Australian government—then that would raise $300 million over the forward years. But I wonder whether every vendor in every country around the world is going to do this, particularly the little vendors. I can appreciate that the big vendors, the people who are in this as a major part of their business, would do the right thing, and if they are of the vendors they will charge the tax, will collect it and will send it to the Australian government. But, if for a little backyard operation sending goods by post to Australia, one wonders how that is going to be enforced. Will these smaller vendors in backyards in America, South America and Europe say, 'Yes, we're obliged to collect a 10 per cent tax on behalf of the Australian government, so we will collect it and, hand on heart, we will send that tax to the Australian government by the next post'? I am sure it does not work like that, but the principle does worry me.


It would seem to me far easier to get the logistics companies who bring these goods into Australia, be it Australia Post or any of the international transport organisations, to add the GST, collect it and pay it to the Australian government. Arguments have been raised that this would be very onerous for them, but they already do it, as I understand the system, on goods of over $1,000. They have their computers set up and they have their processes in place to add the GST at the delivery stage—to press a button on their computer, charge the additional GST, press another button to collect it all together and press another button to send the GST to the Australian government. I am not sure why we are changing the system for those goods under $1,000; I have not been convinced that it is a better way to go. 


KPMG, obviously, are employed by those vendors who do a lot of work in Australia. I acknowledge that have a purpose for it, and I am sure KPMG have been around to see everyone in this building, but I think they have a point: if we do it for goods above $1,000 with the delivery model, why not below $1,000? I find that difficult to understand. According to KPMG—and I make the qualification that they are a reliable organisation—if it was the logistics model, the delivery model, the revenue collected would be $1.8 billion, as opposed to Treasury's estimate of just $300 billion over the forward estimates. It would seem from the point of view of Australian governments' revenue collection that that would be a better model for the states. Again, this is not a matter for the Commonwealth government to be too concerned about in relation to revenue raised because all of the revenue goes to the state governments. But a collection of $1.8 billion as opposed to $300 billion over the forward estimate seems to me to be another reason why the government should seriously look at what is called the logistics model for the collection of this tax. My main concern is that we do it on goods valued above $1,000, and in that way we use the logistics model. But, for goods below $1,000, we are now going to say it is up to every individual vendor around the country to do the right thing by the Australian government. 


The big vendors—and again KPMG are working on behalf of the big retailers whose business is delivering goods into Australia—have indicated to us that they will comply with the rules, whatever the rules are, and I believe them. But what they are concerned about, of course, is that their competitors will not do the same thing, and there will be lots of little organisations set up that will sell the same goods as the big vendors but that will not be collecting the 10 per cent GST, and therefore the big vendors will become uncompetitive. I can understand that. I do need—and I will in the committee stage, if I get the opportunity—to try and clarify those issues. 


Can I point out that the Treasury say in their submission that, even when this scheme is fully implemented, the collection rate will only be 54 per cent. I understand that to be saying the Treasury expect that 46 per cent of small retailers who sell into Australia will not be charging and forwarding the GST collected to the Australian government. That in itself is a concern and makes me wonder about the efficacy of the arrangement. Perhaps I have this wrong, but, as I have said, I have spoken to both the Treasurer and the finance minister. There are a number of reasons that I would like the government to seriously consider whether the logistics model would not be better than the vendor model. I make this contribution as I always do: relying on my understanding of these things—not always accurate, but that is as I understand it. I am a little concerned at the way this is going. 


Having said that, I conclude where I started: this legislation is long overdue. It will put a little bit of balance back into the competition between the small retailers in Australia who were unfairly competing against retailers overseas, in that Australian retailers had to collect the 10 per cent GST, whereas their overseas competitors did not have to do that. Therefore, the overseas competitors could sell goods at commencement at 10 per cent less, and that gave them an unfair advantage over small businesses in Australia, many of whom are currently struggling for survival.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2017-06-19,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (10:21):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017 is indeed quite important, yet we see that it is being implemented and debated in this chamber just two weeks before its effective start date on 1 July. It clearly outlines the way in which the government has bungled the management of this very important issue from the outset.


The policy objective of ensuring overseas retailers are on a level playing field with Australian retailers when it comes to the GST has been around for a long, long time. I note that when Labor was in government, the Productivity Commission made it clear that this was something worth pursuing. Therefore, the objective is worthy. That was based on the economics of collecting the tax making sense: namely, that the cost of collecting GST from foreign retailers was outweighed by the revenue from those retailers, which, of course, makes sense. But, when we look at the government's solution to this problem—the legislation that is currently being debated—we see that this measure was announced in 2016 budget. Here we are after the 2017 budget, with the legislation only having been introduced last February.


It is simply unworkable that this legislation be in operation by 1 July this year. As we know, the bill seeks to apply the GST to goods with a value of less than $1,000 that are being imported directly by consumers into Australia. We know that these goods are exempt from the GST and that the government is seeking to have this measure take effect from 1 July. Under this legislation, overseas suppliers including platforms such as eBay and Amazon, and redeliverer services, with an Australian turnover of $75,000 or more in a 12-month period, will be required to register for and charge the GST. We note from the 2016 budget that this measure was due to raise $300 million over the previous year's forward estimates, and yet it still has not passed in this place.


Labor have an open mind on this issue. We are committed to fair taxation, and we support this in principle. It is about a level playing field for Australian businesses, which arguably the government intends to do with this legislation. But the details of it must be right, and plainly they are not. I note that my good colleague Senator Gallagher is moving amendments on behalf of the opposition to try to fix some of the bungles made by the government. We want to see a model that is workable, that retailers are able to comply with and that does not adversely impact on Australian consumers. So we have been concerned for some time about issues regarding this legislation's implementation, particularly how the GST would be collected. Let's talk through what a workable model needs to represent.


We note that submissions to the Senate inquiry raised a number of issues with the government's model. Electronic distribution platforms such as eBay, Etsy and Alibaba were critical of being liable for goods they simply served as a platform for, as opposed to owning or holding them, likening it to a shopping centre being liable for GST on goods sold by its tenants. They believe that the system would be complex and costly to administer, with the costs being passed on to consumers. You can see from this that a key problem with the legislation is that it is not platform neutral. We can see online retailers such as ASOS being concerned about the complexity of the measure, and the low level of compliance would provide less reputable firms with competitive advantage. We heard from freight companies and express carriers strongly opposing a system that required the collection of business numbers and vendor registration numbers, saying it would create complexity, resulting in unnecessary delays and increased costs which would be passed on to consumers. In terms of the impact on consumers, the Senate inquiry found that basically the measure would end up in increased prices. In addition, the costs of implementation were going to be passed on to consumers. There was also concern that some platforms might simply need to close their operations.


Lastly, on implementation, the Senate inquiry concluded that there would be significant challenges for some parties in implementing this measure. There were some submissions that were critical of the 1 July start date, ranging from saying it was impossible—with some vendors taking two or three years and express carriers another year after that—to saying that the time allowed for implementation was absurdly short. Here we are, just two weeks before the start date for this legislation. Ironically, we have the likes of Senator Macdonald here. Clearly the government senators have concerns among themselves, as Senator Macdonald's comments reflect. The Senate committee was in fact unanimous in its view that the start date should be delayed to 1 July 2018 to ensure the issues around the model, complexity and implementation could be worked through properly. So it seems extraordinary to me that it is up to the opposition to move amendments on issues like the start date, but I am pleased that Senator Gallagher is doing so, because it is only with those kinds of changes that this legislation is at all tenable. We can see that government senators made recommendations for the government's own legislation to be delayed.


Importantly, the opposition is also moving amendments that would see this provision reviewed by the Productivity Commission. If you look at the issues that I have already outlined in my speech in relation to a level playing field between different kinds of retailers and some of the complexities associated with it, it is very important that this measure be monitored from the outset and reported on so that further amendments can be made to this legislation in the future. Labor would support the government amending the legislation before parliament to reflect this recommended start date, and I hope they move with us to do so. This is a delay that will help get what we are doing in this chamber today right, and we want to work across the chamber in a bipartisan way to do this. Our principles on this issue have been clear from the outset: we need a level playing field for Australian retailers competing with overseas retailers while ensuring that there is a workable model that can easily be complied with by overseas retailers and online platforms, without any adverse impacts on Australian consumers.


In speaking to this legislation, I cannot let an opportunity to talk about the GST in this place go without mentioning the particular plight of Western Australia and the issues that confront our state's finances. It is directly relevant to this debate because, when we look at the states that are pulling their weight in raising revenue, Western Australia works very hard to do things like invest in its mining industry, which takes expenditure, in order that the Commonwealth is able to raise more revenue. In that context, revenue raising measures like this are also important because they will raise more revenue under the GST but will do so in a way that do not adversely affect people who are trying to pay for things like rent and food et cetera. But when it comes to Western Australia's fair share of revenue raising, it only gets 34c in every dollar of GST raised. The GST allocation system in this nation is broken. It is unfair that, when a measure like this is introduced, Western Australians, in buying online goods, will be paying GST on goods under $1,000 but will not be get any more than 34c back in a dollar to the state's finances and that is outrageous


The current collection and distribution method of GST in this country has a disproportionate effect on Western Australia, specifically in how it is being applied to remote areas and how gambling revenue is not assessed in the calculation. We desperately need a change in how the distribution is calculated so that it does not discriminate against WA. My priority is a better deal for WA whatever way we are able to make that happen.


Labor's priority is clearly about protecting living standards, jobs and providing a secure economic future for our nation, and this means a stronger economy that does not leave the people of my home state of WA left behind. I have to say, the unfairness of the GST distribution system, which was always unfair, is indeed being compounded by the mess made by the previous Liberal Barnett government in Western Australia. The state government is not only facing substantial budget pressures, which are a factor of the bad record of the previous government, but also the unfairness of the current GST distribution system. Reform to this system is desperately needed to alleviate some pressure on the state of WA. We should not bear the burden of paying back more debt and taking on the burden of more debt to cover the shortfall on GST.


The federal government clearly has a major problem with the tax system and it needs to be reformed. We have had a federal coalition government side by side with the previous state coalition in WA for some time that have taken no action on the GST. Liberal prime ministers have been playing a game where they promise Western Australia more GST without any jurisdiction but, ultimately, they have come up with no concrete plan or proposal, so Western Australia is very clearly being short-changed. When Western Australia does well, the nation does well. Currently, we are not getting our fair share of Commonwealth resources. WA is doing the right thing by the national economy by pulling its weight in raising taxes across the state by exploiting its resources in a way that helps the Commonwealth raise revenue and is being unfairly punished for that. The deterioration of iron ore prices and the mess of the Barnett government in Western Australia mean that Western Australia needs a fair go with the GST. Western Australia has done its fair share of the heavy lifting for the national economy, so reform on the GST distribution system is long overdue.


So, in closing, when we look at this issue and the fact that Western Australians will again, on either 1 July this year or 1 July next year, depending on whether the opposition's amendments are successful—and I note that our support for this legislation is contingent on those amendments passing—be picking up more of the burden of the GST. They will be getting back only 34c in the dollar of all the goods they buy that come from overseas that fall under the $1,000 threshold in this legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-06-19,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:35):  It does not matter whether you vote for Labor or the Liberals; either way, you get a government that sets impossible hurdles to employing the unemployed, you get a government that buries businesses in red tape, you get a government that raises the cost of living and you get a government that just loves to tax. When the GST was first introduced, Commonwealth tax, including the GST, was equivalent to $12,000 per person in current prices. Now it is $14,000 per person. But that is not enough for the Liberal-Labor unity ticket. With the bill before us today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017, the Liberals are extending the reach of GST to imports that are valued at less than $1,000, facilitated by platforms such as eBay and Amazon. And while Labor want to delay this extension, they still support the bill.


As well as raise revenue, the bill will bury platforms like eBay and Amazon in a mountain of red tape. How much red tape is anyone's guess. Unlike the dozens of tax bills that have been waved through this place since I have been here, this bill includes no regulation impact statement and hence has no estimate of the red tape burden being piled on. This is extraordinary. At the exact time that we need a regulatory impact statement, the regulatory impact statement goes missing. A cynic would suspect there is something to hide.


It is hard to imagine how eBay could possibly collect GST. Suppose Yankee John Doe is selling a product on eBay and Aussie Joe Bloggs is interested. Does eBay tell Yankee John Doe that he will receive only 10 elevenths of the winning bid if the winning bidder happens to be Australian? Or does eBay tell Aussie Joe Bloggs that if he puts in the winning bid he will have to pay 10 per cent more? And how is eBay to know whether what is being sold by Yankee John Doe is new or second-hand? Or do we just assume eBay takes a 10 per cent hit every time someone sells something to an Australian? Perhaps eBay should sell to Australians only goods that cost more than $1,000, so Border Force will be responsible for collecting the GST and not eBay.


Given this complexity, some platforms might just refuse to facilitate sales to Australians while those that have no presence in Australia will almost certainly just ignore Australian tax law. The ATO will not be able to do anything about it—and of course those platforms are not likely to bother with payment protection or other safeguards against scams. Either way, the Australian consumer loses. Even if the commencement of the bill is delayed—and I will support the motion to delay it—it would be the height of irresponsibility for the Liberals and Labor to wave into law this radical new approach to the GST, given the absence of any information on the resulting red tape burden and the costs for Australian consumers. To coin a phrase from a Senate colleague, please explain.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-06-19,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (10:39):  I endorse some of the comments that Senator Leyonhjelm made in respect of the botched policy process that has led to the Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017 coming before the chamber. Senator Leyonhjelm has talked about the lack of a regulatory impact statement which is just one of the problems associated with this bill.


I want to make some introductory comments in relation to the fact that this unfortunately is not the first time that this government has botched a consultation process and a policy process. In fact, it is beyond my comprehension that many people in the media consider the coalition to be the more credible economic managers. That mythology is not supported by the facts. I have made it my mission in this place to highlight some of the areas in which this government has been shambolic and chaotic when it comes to economic management. I have mentioned on a number of occasions the mythology that this government is always going to levy less tax on the Australian taxpayers, and how this mythology—which they always try to perpetuate—does not stand up to scrutiny. There is the fact, that since 1980, ten of the years with the lowest level of tax as a proportion of GDP were Labor government years. When it comes to the highest years since 1980 with tax as a proportion of GDP, eight of those 10 years were under the coalition. So this is another area of mythology. 


When it comes to orderly development of tax policy in this country, we had some glimmer of hope under the previous Treasurer that we would have a tax white paper and a tax green paper following the Intergenerational report, and that there would be a holistic look at the tax system. But, lo and behold, we find that upon Mr Turnbull coming into the office of Prime Minister that was all scrapped, and all of the effort that was put into putting together a holistic review of our taxation system, which I think everybody was welcoming, was basically scrapped in the name of political expediency. At the time, the Chairman to the Board of Taxation, Mr Michael Andrew, talked about the fact that the process had cost at least $7 million in terms of working towards a tax white paper. In addition, we see the wasting of time, effort and money of 1,000 Australian stakeholders and business organisations who contributed to the review of our taxation system. Having basically scrapped that process, Mr Turnbull—who promised that he would have more credible economic leadership than his predecessor—floated ideas about increasing the GST, about the states assuming taxation powers and about the Commonwealth walking away from funding public schools. This was chaotic economic management. 


When it comes to the issue of spending, I have said on a number of occasions in this place—and I remind the chamber constantly—that the International Monetary Fund working group identified the profligacy in the Australian system as being on the government side not on the Labor side. In fact, it was Prime Minister Howard who was found to be profligate in his spending in two periods of his term of office. When it comes to spending, I know there are senators on the other side who shake their heads that in 2013 one of the early acts of economic management of this government was to remove Labor's gross debt cap of $300 billion. Last week we crashed through the $500 billion mark. We expect to go through the $600 billion level at the end of this decade, and we are expecting to hit $725 billion in gross debt in 10 years time, with no peak in sight. So, when it comes to economic management this government's record is in tatters, and I hope that the mythology associated with the coalition's economic record is finally debunked.


Once again, as I said, the Treasurer has botched the policy process and it falls to Labor to step in and fix up the mess. Coalition governments, under both Prime Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Turnbull, derailed a genuine process that was started under the previous Labor government. The end result after all these years is a bill with numerous problems and plenty of unanswered questions about whether it is the best way to lower the threshold for the GST on online purchases. 


It is a shame that after the backpacker tax debacle we have to have another piece of legislation put forward by the Treasurer that, again, has so many problems. I want to make the point that Labor supports the concept of evening up the playing field as regards Australian online businesses and overseas online businesses. In principle, that is something that should happen. This bill is not the answer to that problem. To fix this low-value GST situation, Labor will be moving amendments to delay the commencement of the legislation by 12 months while requiring the Productivity Commission to conduct a short inquiry on implementation and other GST collection models. 


I want to note the sensible comments made by Senator Macdonald in relation to the delay of the commencement of the legislation. I also note his concerns about the method chosen in this bill as to whether it is the right method. On our side of the chamber, we certainly see that that is a problem with the bill. The Productivity Commission is well placed to review the package and ensure that we have a framework where compliance is high and there are no significant adverse consumer outcomes. 


Before going into the detail of the bill, for the benefit of the Senate I think it is appropriate to state for the record a few points about the history of this issue. There has been some good work done previously, which has been recklessly abandoned. The Senate Standing Committee on Economics' inquiry identified many of the problems with the bill. The outcome was that we had a government-dominated committee, the Economics Legislation Committee, which supported a delay. And of course, Labor's sensible position—supporting the legislation—provided that there be a 12-month delay and a Productivity Commission review. Those are very important caveats.


The bill has a long history and was reviewed by the Productivity Commission in 2011. In their report, Economic structure and performance of the Australian retail industry, the commission highlighted the need for tax neutrality while also collecting the levy:


As the GST is a broad based consumption tax the LVT should, in principle, be reduced to a low level to ensure tax neutrality. But the costs of collecting additional revenues must be balanced against the gains from removing the distortion.


This led to a strong recommendation to establish a task force to find a workable model. The recommendation was very clear:


The government should establish a task force charged with investigating new approaches to the processing of low-value imported parcels, particularly those in the international mail stream, and recommending a new process which would deliver significant improvements and efficiencies in handling. The task force should comprise independent members, with the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Custom), the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), Australia Post and the Conference of Asia Pacific Express Carriers providing advice.


Following the Productivity Commission report, a task force was established and a final report delivered in July 2012 that considered a number of options and issues that needed to be addressed. To show how detailed that report was, it stated:


In considering which of these potential solutions may fit within an integrated package of reform, assessments at both the initial and detailed costing stage are undertaken based on criteria derived from this investigation's terms of reference. The criteria include cost, efficiency, implementation, competitive neutrality, risk, revenue impact and legislative impact. Regard is also given to Australia's interaction with the digital economy and Australia Post's profitability. Not all criteria are relevant to the assessment of every solution, nor are they applied prescriptively.


The report then went on to supply a new, streamlined model of GST collection by logistics companies, a so-called 'logistics model'—which I note Senator Macdonald has some sympathy for—although this simplicity does not give credit to the substantial amount of analysis and the detailed recommendations that sit behind these words.


The previous Labor government then took steps to develop and implement this model in 2013. What we saw from the coalition government in 2015 was a U-turn on all that work. The then Treasurer issued a media release stating:


At the meeting the Commonwealth Treasurer put forward a proposal that relies on a vendor registration model as a method of collecting the GST for the states and territories. As goods would not be stopped at the border, administering a vendor registration model would have a relatively low cost.


The so-called logistics model, with the backing of the Productivity Commission report and the task force report, was abandoned with little notice, and instead the so-called vendor model was embraced. No justification was offered for why this change had been made, and the Office of Best Practice Regulation stated that this announcement, without an accompanying regulatory impact statement, was in breach of their regulation guidelines—a point that Senator Leyonhjelm has identified.


Fast forwarding to 2017, in March the legislation was introduced into parliament. It is far from ideal when we have an announcement in 2015, yet in March 2017 the legislation is introduced and the start date remains 1 July 2017. It does not give much time for scrutiny or for stakeholders to prepare for this new measure. The government seems to have wanted the parliament to just wave this legislation through. Labor sensibly wanted it to be referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and this bill is a clear example of how important these committees are when we have a government and a Treasurer introducing legislation like this.


The work of the committee culminated in a hearing in April, where we heard from Treasury officials as well as stakeholders on all sides of the debate. To start, I confirm that the Treasury had still, in 2017, not released the regulatory impact statement, and Treasury also admitted that the lack of a RIS was in breach of the Office of Best Practice Regulation guidelines. It was very concerning to hear that the Turnbull government had botched its own policy process in developing this bill. The hearing started with this revelation, and the news only went downhill from there. No explanations were offered by the government for the decision to move away from the recommendations set out in chapter 7 of the 2011 Productivity Commission report Economic structure and performance of the Australian retail industry and the subsequent Low Value Parcel Processing Taskforce: final report. There are still no answers after all these years.


In relation to the 1 July 2017 start date, Treasury officials declined to answer questions about whether alternative start dates had been modelled. Witnesses from the Australian Retailers Association, online retailers, the Conference of Asia Pacific Express Carriers and the Freight & Trade Alliance all expressed concerns about the 1 July 2017 start date. Even the supporters of this bill have concerns. eBay claimed that Treasury officials had told them they expected a 25 to 30 per cent compliance rate from the model set out in this legislation. Treasury officials later stated that they expected this compliance rate in the third year of operation and that it would reach maturity in 2022-23 at 54 per cent. So the government has clearly overstated the benefits of this bill. If 54 per cent is the best that can be achieved, it does not appear that this bill actually delivers on the objective of levelling the playing field for Australian retailers, who are struggling.


In another worrying sign, some of the online platform companies did not rule out geoblocking Australians and preventing them entirely from purchasing from overseas vendors. eBay stated:


Because we do not want to violate the law, we may have to stop all overseas sellers from selling to Australians. Of course, it will hurt our business significantly. I want to make it clear that we are not threatening; I just want you to know how significant an impact this bill will cause to our business.


Etsy also made similar comments, stating:


Because of the scaling complexity of this task, quite honestly, we are left with a number of unfavourable options. It is absolutely our worst-case scenario that we would have to do this, because, as I mentioned earlier, the revenue from our Etsy sellers is essential revenue. These are typically women at home who are full-time carers. This revenue counts for them, so blocking them from being able to achieve a sale like that is, frankly, devastating for us and for our business model.


Alibaba made comments along the lines:


Alibaba Group has done some preliminary work looking at this bill, and is of the view that it may not be able to be applied to AliExpress. If that were the case, we would have no choice but to geoblock Australian users from using the AliExpress platform.


And they had not provided any costing in relation to that. These potential impacts of a reduced variety of products, reduced competition and higher consumer prices are clearly possible consequences of this bill, and it is important that adverse consumer outcomes like this are avoided.


There were not many friends to be found for this bill during the hearing. Even witnesses normally supportive of government policy, such as Dr Berg and Professor Davisdon, associated with the IPA, gave the tax zero out of 10. They said:


The idea that 3,000 firms are just going to voluntarily stump up on this policy when there is really no direct enforcement mechanism seems to us a bit fantastical.


On this point of compliance the ATO, lumbered with a vague plan by the government, were left to explain that jurisdictions like the USA and China will not enforce the measure on their behalf. Platform compliance is largely reliant on the goodwill of overseas operators. Even the Retailers Association, a strong supporter of this bill, noted in their submission:


Our main concern is the speedy implementation of the policy with proposed registration and other measures needing time to be set up and enforced.


The logistics companies concurred with this issue of the start date, given the need to have their information systems modified to comply with the legislation. The public hearing clearly showed that the Treasurer had failed to properly consult with stakeholders and develop a workable model for taxing low-value imports. The hearing exposed numerous problems with this bill, and it clearly was not good enough in its proposed form.


The outcome of that inquiry was that we saw a government-dominated committee requesting a delay. Clearly, the issues did not just concern the Labor Party. The final committee report, in an unusual move, recommended the commencement date be amended to 1 July 2018. Indeed, in the words of my colleague Senator Hume in the media:


I think a delay in implementation is probably a good compromise solution. It's quite understandable that those companies to whom it applies wouldn't be prepared or have made the necessary changes until after the legislation was actually passed.


The final report also notes concerns expressed about the proposed implementation date and the complexity of implementation and enforcement. It accepts that business may need more time and assistance to develop their systems to implement the measure.


Labor also set out in the report its bipartisan in-principle approach to this bill to delay the start date and to have a review completed so that the best model could be adopted, the playing field could be properly levelled and that suitable consumer outcomes could be maintained. We maintain our position today that we are willing to find a way forward to level the playing field for Australian retailers, to have a taxation system with high compliance and for suitable consumer outcomes to be maintained. However, given the state of the bill and its numerous problems, we have no choice but to step in and give the affected stakeholders, the government and the parliament another chance to fix the Treasurer's mishandling of the GST low-value threshold legislation. Given the Productivity Commission's previous work into the collection of GST on online purchases, it is well placed to review the model. The Labor Party stands ready to find a way forward on this legislation. It is important to get the policy right.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-06-19,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:59):  Let us not gild the lily: this is a great big new tax on consumers, no matter how the government wants to dress it up and the opposition says they do not support it—they do. This is going to result in higher prices for everyday Australians. I do not think that is justified. It is not about protecting or preserving the domestic retail sector, it is not about getting a better deal for the mums and dads of Australia; it is about providing more revenue to government, because they cannot and will not live within their means. My position, the Australian Conservative position, is quite straightforward: Australians already pay enough tax. We do not spend their tax dollars wisely enough to ask them to give us any more. The spendthrift nature of the former Labor administrations and the existing coalition administration is extraordinary and is doing a huge disservice to our country and our children. We are collectively accumulating hundreds of billions of dollars worth of debt, which we are going to ask future taxpayers to fund, and we are doing it because we are not prepared to live within our means today.


The government and the opposition will dress up this big new tax on consumers as an equity measure to protect the Australian retail sector. If they were serious about ensuring a thriving retail sector in Australia, they would look towards cutting the regulation and bureaucracy attached to running, owning and operating a business in this country, which are a direct result of the policies implemented by those on the other side and those on this side of the chamber. Government policy is directly responsible for the massive electricity prices affecting every business and every consumer around the country. You want a more effective and economic retail sector? Cut those regulations and allow their electricity and utility prices to be lower; cut the regulations and red tape attached to employing people and allow more competition.


If you want an example of competition, Coles and Woolworths do Australians a massive disservice in the retail sector. They were selling products at a massive mark-up, far higher than the pricing of their international peers. They are under pressure now because their inefficient models, which were ripping off consumers, have been exposed by the likes of Costco and ALDI. I went out to Costco last week. The shopping experience may be different, but the prices are lower, because they are more competitive. If you cut competition, you are going to have a more uncompetitive environment. We need more competition in this country. We need the likes of Amazon to come in here to keep our retailers honest. No longer is it acceptable for them to engorge themselves at the Australian consumer's expense, when we are paying much more for products than it would cost to obtain them internationally.


What is the response? It is not to cut regulation but to put a new tax that is going to be paid by the Australian people. I am absolutely in principle opposed to that. That is why I do not support this bill. It is also a problem with the concept surrounding this bill. After Bert Kelly—and I note the Modest Member society chairman here—rather unfashionably first did so, we have argued for decades that free markets are good and tariffs are bad; now we are back to arguing for a new tariff. You can call it whatever you like, but it is a tariff. It is a tariff on low value purchases from overseas.


More importantly, the tariff is going to be cumbersome and unwieldy to implement and is going to raise a whole range of questions. Who pays it? Is it collected by the retailer overseas? Should it be collected by the transport agency here? Is it going to apply to second-hand goods? I can game the system already: if I were an overseas retailer, I would transfer it to a second retailer and call it second-hand. I would even repackage it to save money. There are a whole bunch of ways this could be scammed and gamed, because government are trying to be too clever. What is it that the government have against people being able to obtain goods for less money? If they are that opposed to consumers' interests, my message to them is that they are once again putting their own inability to cut the cost of government and to cut the expenses and the programs of government ahead of the interests of Australian people.


This is wrong in principle. The concept of it is wrong and overturns what I thought was decades of learned wisdom about getting more benefits. It undermines the principle of competition, and the execution of this is, quite frankly, diabolical. Here we are with a big new tax where the government do not really know how they are going to collect it or how they want to collect it, and this new tax is only a couple of weeks from being implemented. That is why, when the opposition seek to delay this tax for a year, I will be supporting that delay. I am happy to delay it for 10 or 12 years if it helps them to get to a better answer and a better outcome. But, ultimately, I will be voting against this bill in whatever shape or form it is. I am not here to put taxes up; I am here to cut the cost of regulation for businesses and for consumers. I am here to drive prices down so that people get better value not only from government—where we should be lowering taxes—but from the retailers, who have been feasting at our expense for a very long time.


Anyone who has been overseas and has gone into the apparel industry in America or Europe knows that you can buy things for much less there than you can in this country, and it is not because they are made in America or in Europe; it is because the regulations attached to selling those items allow for a more competitive environment and a more competitive market. I believe Australian consumers deserve better value from their retail sector. It is up to government to provide that environment by cutting the cost of doing business, not imposing new taxes on those who seek to get the best possible value for their money in a global environment.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-06-19,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:07):  I rise to speak today on behalf of the Australian Greens on the Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017. Consistency is very important in politics, and the Greens have always had a very strong position of voting against GST when it was implemented. It is not a progressive tax. Members right around the country play a very important role in our policy formulation, and we do not support taxes that are not progressive. GST is a regressive tax. Every time there has been debate and discussion in this place about broadening the GST or increasing the rate of the GST, the Greens have consistently opposed it. Rather than just opposition, we have always embarked on proposition. We have always found other proposals and other ways to raise revenue in this country, and we are all for raising revenue, but we would like to see it done in a fair and equitable manner. We do not believe the GST is a fair and equitable tax. Hence, on applying it to low-value goods, we will again take the consistent position that will be opposing this bill today. We do not support GST as a fundamental principle, and we will not be supporting the bill today.


However, I would like to say there are other reasons for this. Even if that were not our policy position, there are other reasons that we would not be supporting this bill today. We do not believe that it is the right model. It is very important to be clear about this. Low-value imported goods are currently exempt from GST because, to date, it has not been considered worth the effort to collect the tax. It has not been considered worth the effort.


When we talk about the efficiencies of policies we look at how much it costs to implement, administer and enforce them and weigh that against the revenue benefit and potential economic benefit to get some kind of metric on efficiency. The proposition that the government has in the legislation before us today, certainly on all the evidence that I have heard, is not an efficient tax by any stretch of the imagination. In Mr Hockey's own 2015 tax white paper, he explained:


The exclusion from the GST base for imported services reflects how difficult it is to identify the supplier and recipient in a transaction because it has not occurred physically and, unlike imported goods, cannot be stopped at a border.


Everybody is clear about this: this is a very complex area. To put this simply, the Australian Taxation Office has better things to do than to go chasing $10 or $20 of GST here or there from literally tens of thousands of suppliers all over the world. The problem with this bill is that it does not seem to address that key fundamental problem. The vendor model that this bill proposes would require each of those tens of thousands of online retailers from all over the world to collect the tax for the tax office and then pass it on. We have already heard some contributions in here today about how difficult that is going to be and how easily that system will be gamed. I think it is fair to say that, even when you look at the explanatory memorandum that has been provided to senators, it has still not been made clear exactly how the ATO will do this. We have sympathy for the idea of parity and equity between domestic businesses and overseas businesses, for trying to ensure that our domestic retailers are not at a competitive disadvantage. But, as noted in an article in The Conversation by Kathrin Bain, from which I will read very shortly, it is still unclear exactly how much parity between domestic retailers and overseas retailers this is going to achieve.


One of the golden rules of taxes is that they have to be enforceable, and efficiently so. The Greens believe that the government should go back to the drawing board with this tax and get it right. It has been raised in here already that the government-dominated Economics Legislation Committee also recommended that this legislation not be implemented immediately; that there be a 12-month delay on the implementation, subject to getting it right. I find it quite ludicrous that we are here today to pass legislation that everybody seems to agree is second-rate. Why wouldn't we just get it right and then bring it back so that we can vote on legislation that we are all happy with?


That brings me to Labor's amendment. We have a choice, as a party, between voting for legislation that the government is likely to get up and have the numbers on, which begins immediately with a second-rate model, or supporting Labor's amendment to at least delay the legislation for 12 months and get the Productivity Commission to do a study. Of course, that does not bind the government. As Senator Cormann in the chamber here today knows, the government will look at the Productivity Commission's report. It may or may not take those recommendations on board. It has the discretion, as the executive, as to whether or not it wants to do that. So essentially we are, today, voting for the legislation to be implemented. Even a delay is no guarantee that we are going to this fix this and get it right. We can only hope that, if the Productivity Commission does look in detail at the differences between the models—for example, between the logistics model and the vendor model—and properly costs what it will take to administer and enforce the various regimes, perhaps the government will change this legislation and put up an amendment for us to all vote on. We would rather see that happen now. We would rather see the government get it right and bring it forward.


With that proposition in front of us, the Greens will be supporting Labor's amendment today. At least it gives us the opportunity to fix some of the mechanics of this bill and get it right. And I would hope that the government would take on board any recommendations by the Productivity Commission in that regard. We do believe there is merit in looking at the logistics model, which would collect the tax through distribution channels. I have met with various online retailers and other stakeholders, and I understand that this proposition has been raised at the legislative committee level and directly with Treasury and government. The merit of a logistics model is that there is a much smaller number—more likely a handful—of businesses through which imported goods are distributed, which makes it easier to administer. The ATO's task would be much simpler under this model and the model is also more likely to ensure that all imported goods are captured, whereas, with the vendor model in the legislation we have in front of us, you could drive jumbo jets through some of the holes in it. If we are trying to achieve parity, then that is not going to be the case.


I would like to go into a bit more detail as to why the proposed legislation does not set out to achieve its aim of levelling the playing field for our domestic retailers. It unfairly imposes GST on goods purchased from some overseas sellers that would not be subject to GST if purchased from an Australian seller. Kathrin Bain wrote an excellent article in The Conversation, on 21 April 2017, that explained some of the key or fundamental problems with this legislation. She said:


Currently, low-value imports (those with a customs value of A$1,000 or less) are exempt from GST. If the legislation is passed, overseas vendors who sell more than A$75,000 of low-value goods to Australian consumers would be required to register for GST, and collect and remit GST on low-value goods to the ATO.


Those imports will continue to be stopped at the border with any GST, customs duty, and associated fees paid to Australian Border Force by the importer before the goods are released.


For sellers of low-value goods it will mean that an overseas supplier of both low and high value goods will be subject to two separate tax regimes. The requirement to collect GST will apply only to low-value goods.


   …   …   …


While extending the GST to these goods is meant to level the playing field between overseas and Australian vendors, treating the online marketplace or mail forwarder as the supplier of goods is inconsistent with the treatment of domestic transactions.


As eBay has stated in their submission to the Senate Committee: ""eBay is not a seller. eBay is a third-party online marketplace that simply connects buyers and sellers"".


For Australian vendors who sell items on eBay, it’s the individual seller who is responsible for collecting and remitting GST on products they sell (if they are required to be registered). A seller who uses eBay, but isn't carrying on an enterprise or does not meet the A$75,000 turnover threshold, isn't required to be registered and would not be required to collect GST on their sales.


She states further in regard to the proposed legislation we have before us today:


However, the proposed legislation does not treat overseas vendors in this way, by treating online marketplaces and mail forwarding services as the supplier of goods.


So it seems as though the legislation has missed the point. She states further:


… small, individual vendors should not (if their turnover of low-value goods into Australia is less than A$75,000) be required to collect GST merely because they use an online marketplace.


EBay has gone as far as stating in their submission that: ""Regrettably, the Government's legislation may force eBay to prevent Australians from buying from foreign sellers"". This is because they would not be able to comply with the requirements imposed under the new legislation.


We can talk more about the various amendments when we come to the committee stage. My colleague Senator Waters has moved an amendment already in relation to removing GST from female sanitary products, particularly tampons. We have had this discussion in here today and it is a very important issue for many Australians—nearly half. For some reason, the razorblades I used to shave this morning are GST exempt because they are deemed to be an essential item for my male hygiene, yet women's tampons are not considered to be an essential item under the GST law. Senator Waters has already given a great speech on this and we are very keen to see this issue fixed. Senator Dastyari, who is in the chamber at the moment, has raised this issue at estimates. I know it is something the Labor Party feels strongly about. We look forward to having a discussion on that in committee.


Lastly—I cannot let this go unchallenged—some WA senators in here today have used this as an opportunity to talk about how hardly done by Western Australia is under the current GST calculations, with horizontal fiscal equalisation. Senator Smith, I say to you, through the chair, that since Federation Western Australia has been a recipient of the generosity of the other states. This is what fiscal equalisation was set up to do. It is actually extremely complex in terms of the calculations and the assumptions we make, but the principle behind it is really simple. It is about equality around our country. It is about the wealthier states transferring their wealth to help the poorer states. At different times since Federation different states have been donor states under these calculations and different states have been recipients. Throughout nearly all of its history WA has been a recipient of GST and other revenue from the Commonwealth. Through two mining booms, suddenly they are a donor state. They are very likely to be a recipient state again shortly, I understand, Senator Smith. If you squandered the benefits of the mining boom, do not come crying to the federal Senate to try and fix this problem for you. I can tell you that in my home state of Tasmania, when the exchange rate went to $1.15 against the US dollar—we rely on exports from our state. It is ironic that we have an excellent Western Australian senator in the chair at the moment, and this is good.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator, to clarify the record, what do you mean by 'excellent'?




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I withdraw 'excellent' if it makes you happy, Mr Acting Deputy President.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am still Western Australian!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  We have this situation where my state, which relies on agricultural exports—and I know other states do as well—got severely punished during the recent mining boom thanks to WA's resource—




Senator Smith:
  On a point of order, I am wondering if Senator Whish-Wilson will give up some of his time on the clock so that I can respond to him, as I have not yet actually made a contribution to this debate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  It is a very spurious point of order. Am I to understand that Senator Smith does not have time to speak today?




Senator Rhiannon:
  He has been gagged.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  He has been gagged by his side, has he? It is a bit rich—pardon the pun—for Senator Smith and all Western Australian senators to come in here and whinge that they have been hard done by, when since Federation they have been looked after by wealthier states. If anyone had a reason to have a whinge it would probably be New South Wales, one of the wealthier states. 


I have taken my great-grandfather's diary and walked his steps in the Somme and the battlefields of World War I, and I know that Tasmanian regiments fought for our federation alongside Western Australian regiments and other soldiers from different states. This is what federation is about. It is about the wealthier states supporting the poorer states at the right time when it is needed. That is why we are a federation. They would roll in their graves if they knew that Western Australia was being so greedy. The point I was making before, before I got distracted by Senator Smith, was that Western Australia had this mining boom. It hurt my state. That exchange rate—call it Dutch disease, whatever you want—impacted Tasmania quite severely. It really did hurt our agricultural exports. But we were not out there complaining and demanding money from Western Australia, which was reaping the benefits of the mining boom. It should have been better invested, may I say—



Senator Smith interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Senator Smith, if you want more revenue, here is my suggestion: fix the bloody petroleum resource rent tax, the PRRT. Fix it! That $238 billion of tax credits that we have given, predominantly off the coast of Western Australia, to some of the largest and wealthiest petroleum companies in the world—$238 billion and counting. Every dollar they spend on exploration or operational expenditure they get to uptick at rates of 15 per cent plus the bond rate, or five per cent plus the bond rate for operational expenditure. They can even claim the clean-up costs of oil spills. $238 billion of tax credits that they can write off against future income. Even if you tweak those numbers slightly, you will be able to raise tens of billions of dollars, which I am sure would help Western Australia and the rest of it. All it takes is a little bit of political courage to take on the big end of town. Do not try and take on my state and take money off Tasmania. We are doing very well at the moment, thank you very much. Our economy is doing quite nicely, because we have sailed through the difficult period when Western Australia made it very difficult for us, thanks to the high exchange rate, and we are now emerging from it. It is times like this that we can look and say, 'The system works; the system works very nicely, thank you very much.' And it has worked since our forefathers fought next to each other for our Federation in those overseas conflicts. That is why we are a Federation. The whole principle that was set up is the principle of equity. It is designed to transfer revenues between states—with the Commonwealth taking responsibility for that—to try to remove inequality around our country. That is what it was set up to do. It just happens to be your luck, Senator Smith, that your state—and Western Australia is my state too, in many ways—through the luck of the draw happened to inherit some of the richest mineral wealth in the world, underneath the ground and underneath the soil.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Smith, on a point of order?




Senator Smith:
  Senator Whish-Wilson has the rare distinction of being the only Western Australian arguing against GST distribution reforms.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.





Senator Dastyari:
  What about the poor people of New South Wales?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Dastyari, no-one needs your help.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  That was another spurious point of order. Nevertheless, I am a proud Tasmanian. My father is Tasmanian; my mother is Western Australian—I will put that on record. However, Senator Smith, the half of me that is Western Australian is very happy for you to be giving GST money to the other half of me that is Tasmanian. I make that very clear. But my point remains that for Western Australia and for the Western Australians who are lucky enough to live there, the soil under their feet—and under your thongs, Acting Deputy President Sterle—happens to contain some of the biggest mineral deposits in the world. It is just your luck that you happen to be born there and happen to be lucky enough to live there. 


There are other parts of the country that do not have those natural advantages, and I would have thought it was perfectly natural that you would want to share those with the rest of the country. Perhaps you were a Young Liberal, Senator Smith, and we all know what they say about Young Liberals: the one thing that they have in common is that they learnt not to share. That is what they say about Young Liberals, and perhaps Senator Smith has inherited such a trait. I am not saying that is the case, but it is possible. Federation is about sharing within our fantastic nation, supporting each other and giving each other a leg-up. On that note, I will get back to the bill. The Greens will not be supporting this bill today for the reasons I have outlined. We will look forward to further discussion during the committee stage on various amendments.

I did go into this in some detail in my speech during the second reading, but Labor is proposing these amendments basically to deal with the mess that would be otherwise created if the Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017 were to pass unamended.


These amendments are really about trying to provide the best possible outcome for Australian consumers and retailers. They go to dealing with the issues and concerns that have been raised since these new arrangements were announced and indeed through the Senate process. It is largely around the government's proposed vendor model—how complex and costly it would be to administer—as well as the potential unfavourable impacts on consumers, with the cost of the implementation of this model being passed on, and other issues surrounding compliance, and I think we heard Senator Macdonald raise some of those during the second reading debate this morning.


The amendments the opposition is moving today are really to delay the commencement, firstly, by 12 months, to 1 July 2018. I think it is just inconceivable that the arrangements are in place for low-value goods to be subject to GST within the next 10 days. I do not think anyone is pretending to believe that is actually the case. So, this would deal with that problem which is looming before us. It would also allow for a short Productivity Commission inquiry into the legislation's proposed model of GST imposition on low-value imported goods and other, alternative models, with a short inquiry to report by 31 October 2017, which would allow, again, the time to be provided both to the government and to this chamber or the parliament if there are further issues prior to the commencement of the arrangements on 1 July 2018. These are very important amendments—people genuinely want to see GST being levied on low-value goods, but in a responsible way that will not create chaos. 


Can I just respond briefly to comments that Senator Whish-Wilson made in his second reading contribution around the fact that whatever this Productivity Commission's findings might be they are not binding, and there is no commitment that changes would be made. When you look at the amendment we have drafted, it would be a very brave government that would ignore any findings or recommendations from the Productivity Commission about the imposition of these arrangements. That is why we have put them in as we have. We think that will assist the government and, more importantly, these amendments will responsibly deal with a problem that has really been all of the government's own making and try and put in place a reasonable way forward for a principle that we support but an implementation we cannot support. They will deal with those very significant concerns. Even though they do delay these arrangements until 1 July, we are convinced there is no other way to clean up the government's mess.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:41):  I am inclined to agree with the substance of the amendments that are being proposed. I was a member of the Economics Legislation Committee that looked at this in some detail. Some of the concerns that have been raised by Senator Gallagher were raised in that committee hearing. The committee, in its wisdom I think, unanimously recommended that the legislation be delayed for 12 months because, as Senator Gallagher said, it is almost impossible to expect people to get ready in the next couple of weeks to implement the arrangements. There does seem to me to be some merit in having a closer look at the issues.


This is a bill that must pass at some stage. I will not repeat what I said in my speech on the second reading, but it is important for small business, for Australian retailers, to have the playing field levelled so that competitors who live overseas do not automatically get a 10 per cent benefit on the sale of goods in Australia. The legislation is essential. As I said before, it is long overdue. I am sorry that supporting the delay for another year will mean another year that Australian retailers will have this unfair competition, but I do not see any other way.


I did want ask the minister, as I foreshadowed in my speech on the second reading, to again explain why the vendor model was preferred over the logistics model, bearing in mind, as I understand it, that the logistics model is already in place for goods imported into Australia of over $1,000 in value. If that is the case, wouldn't it be ever so much more simple just to extend that to goods under $1,000? Quite frankly, I understand that these days—I have not been involved in this—you press a button on the computer and it does it all. You press a button and it collects the money; you press another button and it sends it to the Australian government. I just cannot understand where the problem is, so I ask the minister why the vendor model was preferred over the logistics model, which common sense would tell me is better. Could the minister also comment on the things that, again, I mentioned in my speech on the second reading—that the logistics model would return $1.8 billion in revenue, whereas according to Treasury the vendor model will only return $300 million. Also, could the minister comment on the issues, as I understand them, that Treasury have calculated that by the time the whole scheme is rolled out the compliance will be only 54 per cent under the vendor model. I would be interested if the minister could mention those. That is the only part I will take in this debate. I am inclined at this stage to support the amendments being proposed by the Labor Party.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-06-19,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:45):   I thank Senator Macdonald for his contribution. Let me, on behalf of the government, indicate right at the outset that the government does not support this amendment. This issue has been reviewed many times over the years. All of the various collection models have been thoroughly assessed over the years and the government's judgement is that the vendor collection model is the most appropriate model to collect GST on low value goods as it takes into account who has the information to determine GST liabilities and prevents goods being held up at the border. The vendor collection model has been agreed to by the states and territories, as it is the most appropriate model to collect GST from overseas multinationals and to level the playing field for Australian businesses. Obviously, we will be concerned if the Senate were to vote to delay the implementation of this requirement. The advice that the government has in front of it from the relevant agencies is that the government is ready to administer this from 1 July 2017. 


Let me also say in relation to the vendor collection model that it is assessed as the most efficient and cost-effective model, which is why Switzerland, for example, has announced legislation to require vendors to collect GST of value added tax on low value imports from 1 January 2018. Within the European Union, vendors are already required to charge and collect GST on sales within the European Union. The OECD and the EU are also focusing on taxation of goods by the supplier at the point of sale. It is also important to note that the vendor collection model has already been used to collect GST on cross-border digital products and services, and this is the case in countries such as Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, member states of the EU, Switzerland, Norway, South Africa and, from 1 July 2017, Australia. 


We did consider the alternative of the logistics model whereby transport companies charge and collect GST. This model could provide a high level of coverage but it would also be very expensive to implement. Currently, transporters are removed from the point of sale and do not have complete information to assess the GST payable. This model would require the transport intermediaries as well as every vendor they deal with to provide additional data on the taxable or exempt nature of goods, as well as the consumer or business status of the importer, to calculate the GST. An important point in this context is that, according to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection data for 2015-16, more than 33 million consignments came into Australia with a value of less than $1,000. 


In relation to the specific question that Senator Macdonald asked about evidence by some stakeholders that the logistics model would deliver higher revenue, Treasury's view is that the administration costs associated with collecting GST on the logistics model are likely to largely offset the amount of GST revenue collected, even if the collection model generates greater participation and compliance. For example, Australia Post, in their submission, stated that they would require an estimated $900 million per annum to support a logistics collection model, which would completely offset KPMG's estimate of the potential revenue. The main issue with the KPMG analysis is that it does not account for the differences in administration costs under each collection model. As I have indicated, for these reasons the government will not be supporting these amendments.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:48):  Sorry, I said that would be my only participation. I have one final question. Minister, I hear what you say about the logistics model, but why doesn't that already apply to goods above $1,000? 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  That is my question, too.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Okay. I will save you asking it. If it works for goods above $1,000 and the end of the world hasn't come then, quite frankly, I do not mind if it does add a little bit of cost to the importation of goods, because, again, that suits the main issue I have with this bill in that it makes Australian retailers that bit more competitive against foreign imports by mail or otherwise. It does not worry me that it makes things a little bit more expensive; it does help the retailers.


If you walk down any street of any town in Queensland, you will see many retail shops vacant. One of the reasons given to me by people who used to be in those shops is that they simply cannot compete with the items coming in from overseas, for many reasons; the first of which is that their customers pay 10 per cent more than those same customers would pay if they ordered it online from overseas. Those customers get the good—I am told—in two or three days, because the logistics companies are so good these days at getting the goods to your door. That efficiency is quite remarkable. I struggle to find how those logistics companies would then find it at all difficult to collect and disburse the 10 per cent. This will be my last question: if it is okay for another thousand dollars, why not below $1,000?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-06-19,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:51):  For goods above $1,000, my advice is that they get processed through a border model. Goods get stopped at the border before Customs processing. Obviously, there is a much smaller volume, and the treatment of these higher value goods has always been quite different to the more efficient way that low-value goods are processed through the border. Essentially, the revenue per item above $1,000 is obviously higher; the numbers are lower; and there is already a process that takes place as part of the normal border and freight forwarding processes that does not apply to the 33-plus million products below $1,000. We would essentially have to set up a very significant process of stopping all these goods at the border in order to implement the sort of process that Senator Macdonald and others have suggested. 


In summary, this has been looked at by experts in all different directions for a very long time. Consistently, the conclusion that has come back is that to most efficiently administer this sort of proposal—to apply GST to products below $1,000—is through a vendor model. People are entitled to different views on these things but that has consistently been the advice to the government and we have not seen anything that would change our view.

Application



The amendments made to the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 by this Schedule apply in relation to supplies made on or after 1 July 2017.


This amendment aims to use this bill as an opportunity to abolish the tampon tax. It is pretty clear that the revenue that would be raised by this bill—which I understand has the support of both of the large parties and hence will pass—would be about $300 million. We have asked the Parliamentary Budget Office to cost how much removing the tampon tax would cost, and they said it would be about $115 million. So the states would still be $185 million ahead if they were to agree to remove the tampon tax. 


This is a great opportunity to finally address this sexist taxation of women's biology. For some reason, when the GST laws were written it was decided that sanitary items were a luxury item. It could not be further from the truth. There is no luxury at all to need to buy these products every month, and it is a sexist tax that applies only to women. When you look at the fact that condoms and lubricant are GST-free yet sanitary items are not GST-free, it is clear that women are being taxed for their biology. We have an opportunity to fix that here today. With this bill we have any opportunity to assure the states that they will not be short on money, that they will in fact have a revenue source that could compensate for the loss of revenue taxed off the back of women's biology. So this is a very important opportunity, and I would hope that both sides of this chamber would consider seriously this chance to rectify a historical wrong, which is in fact a sexist tax on women's biology. 


I would also like to flag that later today I will be tabling the petition I alluded to earlier, which over the weekend has already garnered more than 11,000 signatures from people who agree that this sexist tax on women's biology and women's bodies needs to go. Today is our chance to axe the tampon tax. This has been talked about for many decades, and I want to acknowledge that several decades ago it was members of the Labor Party who moved to abolish the tax. It was then Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja who moved in this place to abolish the tax—wouldn't it be great if today we could finally get that job done for the legions of Australia women who are balancing the budget off the back of their biology?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:55):  First, I have to correct the proposition that GST applies to those particular goods because they are considered luxury items. That is not right. GST applies to all goods and services unless they have been exempted through relevant means. That is the situation. 


The government undertook to raise the issue of the application of GST to feminine hygiene products with the states and territories and to seek their views on the matter. At the Council on Federal Financial Relations tax reform workshop on 21 August 2015, the states and territories considered a proposal to remove the GST from feminine hygiene products. As there was no unanimous agreement at the time, no change to the existing GST arrangements for these products will be progressed. I hasten to add that the usual process of dealing with a proposal to exempt any health goods from GST is through a determination by the Minister for Health, not through an amendment to a bill like this.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-06-19,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:57):  Labor certainly agrees that we need a way to fix the current arrangements around the GST and sanitary products, and we have certainly been clear about this in the past, but we do not believe an amendment to this bill is the way to fix it. We think in all fairness, considering how important the GST is for states and territories, and indeed the agreement that exists between the Commonwealth and the states and territories on GST arrangements, that these discussions about how this should be done and when it should be done needs to happen with all of those parties but also needs to be done at the start of the process, not at the end of it here in this chamber. 


We understand the Greens position on this issue. Labor has previously put forward the proposal that the additional GST on digital downloads be used to more than offset the cost of exempting sanitary products, and I think that was a condition that we urged the former Treasurer to take to the treasurers meeting to discuss and reach agreement on. I think at that meeting there were Liberal state treasurers who disagreed with that approach. Whilst we will not support this amendment this morning, we do acknowledge the intent behind it and certainly the Labor Party's view is that this is something that we need to look at further and we need to examine and discuss with all relevant parties how the removal of GST on sanitary products could be progressed with the agreement of all parties. At this point we will not be supporting this amendment to this bill.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:59):  I am very disappointed to hear that. I acknowledge what the minister said about health items, and that is indeed the point I am trying to make. By not listing tampons and pads and sanitary items as health items they are in effect being deemed as de facto luxury goods. How on earth can condoms and lube and sunscreen be called health products—which they should be—but not sanitary items? So thank you, Minister—you have reinforced the very point I was trying to make, although I do not think that was your intention. 


Yes, this was discussed at COAG in August 2015. That is almost two years ago now, and what a shame that we have had a continual roadblock. We have half the states and territories on board. We have since had a change of government in WA, so I would hazard a guess that we now have more than half of the states and territories agreeing to remove this sexist tax. I have written to the state and territory premiers and treasurers in the last week, urging them to reconsider their position and pointing out that there would not be any net revenue loss by virtue of the revenue that is likely to be raised from this bill passing with the support of each of your parties. I hope that they are considering that correspondence. I know that they are receiving a lot of calls from their own constituents, because people care about this issue. This is an unfair tax that penalises women, and there is no good reason for it to continue.


I am very disappointed that you say now is not the chance to fix it. We have very few opportunities to do the right thing in this chamber, and today is one of them. I find it really disappointing and not very persuasive that you are saying it is not a good idea to do it today. I do not buy that and I do not think the Australian community will buy that.


This is, of course, why we moved the second reading amendment, which said, 'Let's delay the discussion of this particular bill until those state and territory premiers can have a chance to consider the views of their constituents and, hopefully, get on board with the momentum to removing this sexist tax.' Unfortunately, we did not receive any support for that amendment. Sadly, it looks like we are not going to receive any support for this amendment either. I think Australian women will be incredibly disappointed with this chamber if that is how the vote goes and I urge both parties to reconsider their position before the vote happens.

Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (12:01):  The Nick Xenophon Team will be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Waters today on sheet 8156. Since the GST was introduced in 2000, the Australian government has slapped every Australian menstruating woman with a 10 per cent tax every time she gets her period. Women do not buy pads and tampons for pleasure or luxury; they are essential health items. It is an absolute absurdity that the government and opposition are continuing to support what is essentially a tax on women's bodily functions.


Condoms have been made GST-exempt due to their important health benefits, yet pads and tampons, which are essential for the reproductive health of an estimated six million Australians, are slapped with a 10 per cent tax. It is estimated that women use up to 30 individual pads or tampons during their periods, costing up to $15 per cycle. A woman can have 450 menstrual cycles over the course of her life, meaning she can spend close to $7,000 in a lifetime on pads and tampons, and this is multiplied in households with daughters. What message is the parliament giving to young women in circumstances where the tax on women's menstrual hygiene products is unfairly borne by women only because women bleed? Any argument about the budget bottom line flatly ignores what is fundamentally an issue of social and economic equity.


Women earn on average $261.30 less per week than their male counterparts and they are also statistically at greater risk of living below the poverty line. This tax also disproportionately targets those who may already be disadvantaged, including the homeless and the unemployed. We should not be continuing to force an underpaid or disadvantaged portion of society to pay more for basic essentials, and that is why the Nick Xenophon Team will be supporting this amendment.



The CHAIR:  The question is that amendment (1) on sheet 8156 as moved by Senator Waters be agreed to.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:01):  I rise to continue my remarks on this bill, which the Greens see as a fantastic opportunity for the GST to be removed from tampons and sanitary pads. We have had statements from both sides of this chamber indicating that others too think this is a sexist tax whose time has come and that it should be removed. This is an opportunity for both sides of this chamber to support the removal of this sexist tax on women's biology.


When the GST laws were drafted—perhaps there were no women in the room—it was deemed that sanitary items were a luxury item for women. Guys, it is biology, it is no luxury, and this is something that should not have the GST applied to it. I spoke to that last week.


What I would like to do today is move a second reading amendment, which I understand has now been circulated in the chamber. Hopefully people have received that; if not, it will be coming very shortly. It is very brief and asks that the debate on this bill be suspended until such time as state and territory treasurers have time to consider the proposal to remove the tampon tax. Half the states and territories now support the removal of GST from tampons and sanitary items. The remaining states and territories last year did not support it, but with the revenue raised from this bill, which we understand will be going through the chamber with the support of both the old parties, the states would not fall short. They would be able to support removing the GST from tampons and not be out of pocket. This is a great opportunity for us finally to remove this discriminatory tax on women's biology. We have that opportunity today.


I want to acknowledge the broad support for this issue that we received over the weekend. We started a petition late last week, off the back of many, many years of campaigning on this issue. Over the weekend, 11,000 people signed a petition saying that we need to remove this sexist and discriminatory tax on women's biology—this tax on tampons and pads that was probably put on with a whole lot of men in the room, and, sadly, not enough women in the room, if any at all. We will be moving that second reading amendment, and I will do so shortly, to ask that this bill be delayed until such time as the states and territories can consider the good financial reasoning for removing this discriminatory tax. I want to thank the 11,600 people who signed the petition over the weekend supporting the removal of the GST on pads and tampons. I will flag that, whilst I do not have it with me at the minute, I will be tabling that petition later today. I am sure signatures will keep flooding in, but I want to thank those signatories who have done so. I move the following amendment, and I presume we will vote on it in due course:

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:05):  This is a bill whose time has at last come. The Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017 is a bill that I believe should have been introduced many, many years ago, to ensure that imported goods under $1,000 had the same tax on them as those same goods would have had if they were sold by an Australian retailer within Australia. For too long, our small businesspeople in Australia and the retailers in our country have had to put up with this very unfair competition; that is, they could sell a good—an item of clothing or some other well-used good in Australia—but they would always start 10 per cent behind the price that a foreign dispatcher of that same good could charge. Over the years, so many constituents who are in small business would complain to me about how our fellow Australians would go into their shop, have a look around, see the particular good they wanted and the statistics of that particular good, then walk out of the shop, go home, and order it online from overseas for at least 10 per cent less than my constituents in Queensland could charge.


To a degree, this is an issue that has impacted upon small businesspeople, particularly in Australia, for a long period of time. In our wisdom, the parliament in the past decided that goods over $1,000 in value would be subject to the GST, but we gave this exemption for lower value goods mainly, I suspect, because it was always thought to be too hard to collect money on hundreds of thousands—perhaps even millions—of goods that were acquired by Australians from overseas retailers at relatively low values. I can understand the concern that the Treasury and the public service would have had with that, but I come at this from the position of my constituents and the people who support our party—small business people—who have been unfairly disadvantaged for a long period of time now. I am delighted that this bill is at last going to address that. I tell somewhat humorously that the first person who raised this with me, three or four years ago now, was a local businessman in Townsville who had a number of businesses, but one of them was an adult shop. He came to me and he said that people were no longer using his shop because they could get the same goods much cheaper from overseas because he had to comply with Australian moral laws, but, more importantly, he had to comply with the GST laws. His sale items were always 10 per cent more than those of his competitors who were overseas, who could ship the goods in. According to him and others of my constituents who have raised it with me, within three or four days the goods would be at the residence of the buyer. In his business, that was another attraction. I only mention that because that was a graphic example of why reform was needed in this area.


I will briefly refer to Senator Waters' speech, in which she addressed a particular item on which she is introducing a second reading amendment. It would be good if we could remove the GST from everything. Australians would generally love that, but unfortunately the state governments—who get all of the revenue from the GST—would not be very keen on that. That is because the GST is the main revenue of the states. I say to Senator Waters: if she has an important issue there, I would think the first port of call for her would be to see the states and to see—




Senator Waters:
  I have done that, Senator Macdonald.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order. Please continue, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is another case where there is one rule for everybody else and one rule for the Greens. If I dare interject when Senator Waters is talking, you have everyone in the Greens political party taking a point of order. But as I say, there is one rule for everybody else and a separable rule for the Greens.


I do not want to spend a lot on that particular part of the debate. I simply say that if Senator Waters came with the agreement of every state government to that reduction in their GST revenue, then I think it is something perhaps the Commonwealth should look—although I doubt that it is in this bill that you would address something like that. Perhaps it needs a piece of legislation that is more specifically to the point. But I would be interested to hear from Senator Waters if all of the states have agreed to forfeit the revenue in the manner she proposes.


That does lead me just to emphasise that this is a GST bill. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the revenue raised is not particularly relevant—and I emphasise 'particularly'—because all of the money raised from this will go to the states. My own state of Queensland is a classic example. That state, which has been very poorly managed financially for a long period of time, certainly needs every cent it can get from whatever sources. The revenue raised from this bill, should it be passed, would be going straight to the state government.


I do have one concern with this bill that I may pursue further in the committee stage: that is, the method of collection. I have raised this with both the finance minister and the Treasurer. They have been courteous in their responses to me, but I find it difficult to understand why we have a method of collection on goods above $1,000 that I will refer to as the vendor method of collection. According to Treasury estimates, if we use the vendor method of collection—which is that vendors overseas will collect the GST and pay it to Australian government—then that would raise $300 million over the forward years. But I wonder whether every vendor in every country around the world is going to do this, particularly the little vendors. I can appreciate that the big vendors, the people who are in this as a major part of their business, would do the right thing, and if they are of the vendors they will charge the tax, will collect it and will send it to the Australian government. But, if for a little backyard operation sending goods by post to Australia, one wonders how that is going to be enforced. Will these smaller vendors in backyards in America, South America and Europe say, 'Yes, we're obliged to collect a 10 per cent tax on behalf of the Australian government, so we will collect it and, hand on heart, we will send that tax to the Australian government by the next post'? I am sure it does not work like that, but the principle does worry me.


It would seem to me far easier to get the logistics companies who bring these goods into Australia, be it Australia Post or any of the international transport organisations, to add the GST, collect it and pay it to the Australian government. Arguments have been raised that this would be very onerous for them, but they already do it, as I understand the system, on goods of over $1,000. They have their computers set up and they have their processes in place to add the GST at the delivery stage—to press a button on their computer, charge the additional GST, press another button to collect it all together and press another button to send the GST to the Australian government. I am not sure why we are changing the system for those goods under $1,000; I have not been convinced that it is a better way to go. 


KPMG, obviously, are employed by those vendors who do a lot of work in Australia. I acknowledge that have a purpose for it, and I am sure KPMG have been around to see everyone in this building, but I think they have a point: if we do it for goods above $1,000 with the delivery model, why not below $1,000? I find that difficult to understand. According to KPMG—and I make the qualification that they are a reliable organisation—if it was the logistics model, the delivery model, the revenue collected would be $1.8 billion, as opposed to Treasury's estimate of just $300 billion over the forward estimates. It would seem from the point of view of Australian governments' revenue collection that that would be a better model for the states. Again, this is not a matter for the Commonwealth government to be too concerned about in relation to revenue raised because all of the revenue goes to the state governments. But a collection of $1.8 billion as opposed to $300 billion over the forward estimate seems to me to be another reason why the government should seriously look at what is called the logistics model for the collection of this tax. My main concern is that we do it on goods valued above $1,000, and in that way we use the logistics model. But, for goods below $1,000, we are now going to say it is up to every individual vendor around the country to do the right thing by the Australian government. 


The big vendors—and again KPMG are working on behalf of the big retailers whose business is delivering goods into Australia—have indicated to us that they will comply with the rules, whatever the rules are, and I believe them. But what they are concerned about, of course, is that their competitors will not do the same thing, and there will be lots of little organisations set up that will sell the same goods as the big vendors but that will not be collecting the 10 per cent GST, and therefore the big vendors will become uncompetitive. I can understand that. I do need—and I will in the committee stage, if I get the opportunity—to try and clarify those issues. 


Can I point out that the Treasury say in their submission that, even when this scheme is fully implemented, the collection rate will only be 54 per cent. I understand that to be saying the Treasury expect that 46 per cent of small retailers who sell into Australia will not be charging and forwarding the GST collected to the Australian government. That in itself is a concern and makes me wonder about the efficacy of the arrangement. Perhaps I have this wrong, but, as I have said, I have spoken to both the Treasurer and the finance minister. There are a number of reasons that I would like the government to seriously consider whether the logistics model would not be better than the vendor model. I make this contribution as I always do: relying on my understanding of these things—not always accurate, but that is as I understand it. I am a little concerned at the way this is going. 


Having said that, I conclude where I started: this legislation is long overdue. It will put a little bit of balance back into the competition between the small retailers in Australia who were unfairly competing against retailers overseas, in that Australian retailers had to collect the 10 per cent GST, whereas their overseas competitors did not have to do that. Therefore, the overseas competitors could sell goods at commencement at 10 per cent less, and that gave them an unfair advantage over small businesses in Australia, many of whom are currently struggling for survival.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (10:21):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017 is indeed quite important, yet we see that it is being implemented and debated in this chamber just two weeks before its effective start date on 1 July. It clearly outlines the way in which the government has bungled the management of this very important issue from the outset.


The policy objective of ensuring overseas retailers are on a level playing field with Australian retailers when it comes to the GST has been around for a long, long time. I note that when Labor was in government, the Productivity Commission made it clear that this was something worth pursuing. Therefore, the objective is worthy. That was based on the economics of collecting the tax making sense: namely, that the cost of collecting GST from foreign retailers was outweighed by the revenue from those retailers, which, of course, makes sense. But, when we look at the government's solution to this problem—the legislation that is currently being debated—we see that this measure was announced in 2016 budget. Here we are after the 2017 budget, with the legislation only having been introduced last February.


It is simply unworkable that this legislation be in operation by 1 July this year. As we know, the bill seeks to apply the GST to goods with a value of less than $1,000 that are being imported directly by consumers into Australia. We know that these goods are exempt from the GST and that the government is seeking to have this measure take effect from 1 July. Under this legislation, overseas suppliers including platforms such as eBay and Amazon, and redeliverer services, with an Australian turnover of $75,000 or more in a 12-month period, will be required to register for and charge the GST. We note from the 2016 budget that this measure was due to raise $300 million over the previous year's forward estimates, and yet it still has not passed in this place.


Labor have an open mind on this issue. We are committed to fair taxation, and we support this in principle. It is about a level playing field for Australian businesses, which arguably the government intends to do with this legislation. But the details of it must be right, and plainly they are not. I note that my good colleague Senator Gallagher is moving amendments on behalf of the opposition to try to fix some of the bungles made by the government. We want to see a model that is workable, that retailers are able to comply with and that does not adversely impact on Australian consumers. So we have been concerned for some time about issues regarding this legislation's implementation, particularly how the GST would be collected. Let's talk through what a workable model needs to represent.


We note that submissions to the Senate inquiry raised a number of issues with the government's model. Electronic distribution platforms such as eBay, Etsy and Alibaba were critical of being liable for goods they simply served as a platform for, as opposed to owning or holding them, likening it to a shopping centre being liable for GST on goods sold by its tenants. They believe that the system would be complex and costly to administer, with the costs being passed on to consumers. You can see from this that a key problem with the legislation is that it is not platform neutral. We can see online retailers such as ASOS being concerned about the complexity of the measure, and the low level of compliance would provide less reputable firms with competitive advantage. We heard from freight companies and express carriers strongly opposing a system that required the collection of business numbers and vendor registration numbers, saying it would create complexity, resulting in unnecessary delays and increased costs which would be passed on to consumers. In terms of the impact on consumers, the Senate inquiry found that basically the measure would end up in increased prices. In addition, the costs of implementation were going to be passed on to consumers. There was also concern that some platforms might simply need to close their operations.


Lastly, on implementation, the Senate inquiry concluded that there would be significant challenges for some parties in implementing this measure. There were some submissions that were critical of the 1 July start date, ranging from saying it was impossible—with some vendors taking two or three years and express carriers another year after that—to saying that the time allowed for implementation was absurdly short. Here we are, just two weeks before the start date for this legislation. Ironically, we have the likes of Senator Macdonald here. Clearly the government senators have concerns among themselves, as Senator Macdonald's comments reflect. The Senate committee was in fact unanimous in its view that the start date should be delayed to 1 July 2018 to ensure the issues around the model, complexity and implementation could be worked through properly. So it seems extraordinary to me that it is up to the opposition to move amendments on issues like the start date, but I am pleased that Senator Gallagher is doing so, because it is only with those kinds of changes that this legislation is at all tenable. We can see that government senators made recommendations for the government's own legislation to be delayed.


Importantly, the opposition is also moving amendments that would see this provision reviewed by the Productivity Commission. If you look at the issues that I have already outlined in my speech in relation to a level playing field between different kinds of retailers and some of the complexities associated with it, it is very important that this measure be monitored from the outset and reported on so that further amendments can be made to this legislation in the future. Labor would support the government amending the legislation before parliament to reflect this recommended start date, and I hope they move with us to do so. This is a delay that will help get what we are doing in this chamber today right, and we want to work across the chamber in a bipartisan way to do this. Our principles on this issue have been clear from the outset: we need a level playing field for Australian retailers competing with overseas retailers while ensuring that there is a workable model that can easily be complied with by overseas retailers and online platforms, without any adverse impacts on Australian consumers.


In speaking to this legislation, I cannot let an opportunity to talk about the GST in this place go without mentioning the particular plight of Western Australia and the issues that confront our state's finances. It is directly relevant to this debate because, when we look at the states that are pulling their weight in raising revenue, Western Australia works very hard to do things like invest in its mining industry, which takes expenditure, in order that the Commonwealth is able to raise more revenue. In that context, revenue raising measures like this are also important because they will raise more revenue under the GST but will do so in a way that do not adversely affect people who are trying to pay for things like rent and food et cetera. But when it comes to Western Australia's fair share of revenue raising, it only gets 34c in every dollar of GST raised. The GST allocation system in this nation is broken. It is unfair that, when a measure like this is introduced, Western Australians, in buying online goods, will be paying GST on goods under $1,000 but will not be get any more than 34c back in a dollar to the state's finances and that is outrageous


The current collection and distribution method of GST in this country has a disproportionate effect on Western Australia, specifically in how it is being applied to remote areas and how gambling revenue is not assessed in the calculation. We desperately need a change in how the distribution is calculated so that it does not discriminate against WA. My priority is a better deal for WA whatever way we are able to make that happen.


Labor's priority is clearly about protecting living standards, jobs and providing a secure economic future for our nation, and this means a stronger economy that does not leave the people of my home state of WA left behind. I have to say, the unfairness of the GST distribution system, which was always unfair, is indeed being compounded by the mess made by the previous Liberal Barnett government in Western Australia. The state government is not only facing substantial budget pressures, which are a factor of the bad record of the previous government, but also the unfairness of the current GST distribution system. Reform to this system is desperately needed to alleviate some pressure on the state of WA. We should not bear the burden of paying back more debt and taking on the burden of more debt to cover the shortfall on GST.


The federal government clearly has a major problem with the tax system and it needs to be reformed. We have had a federal coalition government side by side with the previous state coalition in WA for some time that have taken no action on the GST. Liberal prime ministers have been playing a game where they promise Western Australia more GST without any jurisdiction but, ultimately, they have come up with no concrete plan or proposal, so Western Australia is very clearly being short-changed. When Western Australia does well, the nation does well. Currently, we are not getting our fair share of Commonwealth resources. WA is doing the right thing by the national economy by pulling its weight in raising taxes across the state by exploiting its resources in a way that helps the Commonwealth raise revenue and is being unfairly punished for that. The deterioration of iron ore prices and the mess of the Barnett government in Western Australia mean that Western Australia needs a fair go with the GST. Western Australia has done its fair share of the heavy lifting for the national economy, so reform on the GST distribution system is long overdue.


So, in closing, when we look at this issue and the fact that Western Australians will again, on either 1 July this year or 1 July next year, depending on whether the opposition's amendments are successful—and I note that our support for this legislation is contingent on those amendments passing—be picking up more of the burden of the GST. They will be getting back only 34c in the dollar of all the goods they buy that come from overseas that fall under the $1,000 threshold in this legislation.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-06-19,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:35):  It does not matter whether you vote for Labor or the Liberals; either way, you get a government that sets impossible hurdles to employing the unemployed, you get a government that buries businesses in red tape, you get a government that raises the cost of living and you get a government that just loves to tax. When the GST was first introduced, Commonwealth tax, including the GST, was equivalent to $12,000 per person in current prices. Now it is $14,000 per person. But that is not enough for the Liberal-Labor unity ticket. With the bill before us today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017, the Liberals are extending the reach of GST to imports that are valued at less than $1,000, facilitated by platforms such as eBay and Amazon. And while Labor want to delay this extension, they still support the bill.


As well as raise revenue, the bill will bury platforms like eBay and Amazon in a mountain of red tape. How much red tape is anyone's guess. Unlike the dozens of tax bills that have been waved through this place since I have been here, this bill includes no regulation impact statement and hence has no estimate of the red tape burden being piled on. This is extraordinary. At the exact time that we need a regulatory impact statement, the regulatory impact statement goes missing. A cynic would suspect there is something to hide.


It is hard to imagine how eBay could possibly collect GST. Suppose Yankee John Doe is selling a product on eBay and Aussie Joe Bloggs is interested. Does eBay tell Yankee John Doe that he will receive only 10 elevenths of the winning bid if the winning bidder happens to be Australian? Or does eBay tell Aussie Joe Bloggs that if he puts in the winning bid he will have to pay 10 per cent more? And how is eBay to know whether what is being sold by Yankee John Doe is new or second-hand? Or do we just assume eBay takes a 10 per cent hit every time someone sells something to an Australian? Perhaps eBay should sell to Australians only goods that cost more than $1,000, so Border Force will be responsible for collecting the GST and not eBay.


Given this complexity, some platforms might just refuse to facilitate sales to Australians while those that have no presence in Australia will almost certainly just ignore Australian tax law. The ATO will not be able to do anything about it—and of course those platforms are not likely to bother with payment protection or other safeguards against scams. Either way, the Australian consumer loses. Even if the commencement of the bill is delayed—and I will support the motion to delay it—it would be the height of irresponsibility for the Liberals and Labor to wave into law this radical new approach to the GST, given the absence of any information on the resulting red tape burden and the costs for Australian consumers. To coin a phrase from a Senate colleague, please explain.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-06-19,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (10:39):  I endorse some of the comments that Senator Leyonhjelm made in respect of the botched policy process that has led to the Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017 coming before the chamber. Senator Leyonhjelm has talked about the lack of a regulatory impact statement which is just one of the problems associated with this bill.


I want to make some introductory comments in relation to the fact that this unfortunately is not the first time that this government has botched a consultation process and a policy process. In fact, it is beyond my comprehension that many people in the media consider the coalition to be the more credible economic managers. That mythology is not supported by the facts. I have made it my mission in this place to highlight some of the areas in which this government has been shambolic and chaotic when it comes to economic management. I have mentioned on a number of occasions the mythology that this government is always going to levy less tax on the Australian taxpayers, and how this mythology—which they always try to perpetuate—does not stand up to scrutiny. There is the fact, that since 1980, ten of the years with the lowest level of tax as a proportion of GDP were Labor government years. When it comes to the highest years since 1980 with tax as a proportion of GDP, eight of those 10 years were under the coalition. So this is another area of mythology. 


When it comes to orderly development of tax policy in this country, we had some glimmer of hope under the previous Treasurer that we would have a tax white paper and a tax green paper following the Intergenerational report, and that there would be a holistic look at the tax system. But, lo and behold, we find that upon Mr Turnbull coming into the office of Prime Minister that was all scrapped, and all of the effort that was put into putting together a holistic review of our taxation system, which I think everybody was welcoming, was basically scrapped in the name of political expediency. At the time, the Chairman to the Board of Taxation, Mr Michael Andrew, talked about the fact that the process had cost at least $7 million in terms of working towards a tax white paper. In addition, we see the wasting of time, effort and money of 1,000 Australian stakeholders and business organisations who contributed to the review of our taxation system. Having basically scrapped that process, Mr Turnbull—who promised that he would have more credible economic leadership than his predecessor—floated ideas about increasing the GST, about the states assuming taxation powers and about the Commonwealth walking away from funding public schools. This was chaotic economic management. 


When it comes to the issue of spending, I have said on a number of occasions in this place—and I remind the chamber constantly—that the International Monetary Fund working group identified the profligacy in the Australian system as being on the government side not on the Labor side. In fact, it was Prime Minister Howard who was found to be profligate in his spending in two periods of his term of office. When it comes to spending, I know there are senators on the other side who shake their heads that in 2013 one of the early acts of economic management of this government was to remove Labor's gross debt cap of $300 billion. Last week we crashed through the $500 billion mark. We expect to go through the $600 billion level at the end of this decade, and we are expecting to hit $725 billion in gross debt in 10 years time, with no peak in sight. So, when it comes to economic management this government's record is in tatters, and I hope that the mythology associated with the coalition's economic record is finally debunked.


Once again, as I said, the Treasurer has botched the policy process and it falls to Labor to step in and fix up the mess. Coalition governments, under both Prime Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Turnbull, derailed a genuine process that was started under the previous Labor government. The end result after all these years is a bill with numerous problems and plenty of unanswered questions about whether it is the best way to lower the threshold for the GST on online purchases. 


It is a shame that after the backpacker tax debacle we have to have another piece of legislation put forward by the Treasurer that, again, has so many problems. I want to make the point that Labor supports the concept of evening up the playing field as regards Australian online businesses and overseas online businesses. In principle, that is something that should happen. This bill is not the answer to that problem. To fix this low-value GST situation, Labor will be moving amendments to delay the commencement of the legislation by 12 months while requiring the Productivity Commission to conduct a short inquiry on implementation and other GST collection models. 


I want to note the sensible comments made by Senator Macdonald in relation to the delay of the commencement of the legislation. I also note his concerns about the method chosen in this bill as to whether it is the right method. On our side of the chamber, we certainly see that that is a problem with the bill. The Productivity Commission is well placed to review the package and ensure that we have a framework where compliance is high and there are no significant adverse consumer outcomes. 


Before going into the detail of the bill, for the benefit of the Senate I think it is appropriate to state for the record a few points about the history of this issue. There has been some good work done previously, which has been recklessly abandoned. The Senate Standing Committee on Economics' inquiry identified many of the problems with the bill. The outcome was that we had a government-dominated committee, the Economics Legislation Committee, which supported a delay. And of course, Labor's sensible position—supporting the legislation—provided that there be a 12-month delay and a Productivity Commission review. Those are very important caveats.


The bill has a long history and was reviewed by the Productivity Commission in 2011. In their report, Economic structure and performance of the Australian retail industry, the commission highlighted the need for tax neutrality while also collecting the levy:


As the GST is a broad based consumption tax the LVT should, in principle, be reduced to a low level to ensure tax neutrality. But the costs of collecting additional revenues must be balanced against the gains from removing the distortion.


This led to a strong recommendation to establish a task force to find a workable model. The recommendation was very clear:


The government should establish a task force charged with investigating new approaches to the processing of low-value imported parcels, particularly those in the international mail stream, and recommending a new process which would deliver significant improvements and efficiencies in handling. The task force should comprise independent members, with the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Custom), the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), Australia Post and the Conference of Asia Pacific Express Carriers providing advice.


Following the Productivity Commission report, a task force was established and a final report delivered in July 2012 that considered a number of options and issues that needed to be addressed. To show how detailed that report was, it stated:


In considering which of these potential solutions may fit within an integrated package of reform, assessments at both the initial and detailed costing stage are undertaken based on criteria derived from this investigation's terms of reference. The criteria include cost, efficiency, implementation, competitive neutrality, risk, revenue impact and legislative impact. Regard is also given to Australia's interaction with the digital economy and Australia Post's profitability. Not all criteria are relevant to the assessment of every solution, nor are they applied prescriptively.


The report then went on to supply a new, streamlined model of GST collection by logistics companies, a so-called 'logistics model'—which I note Senator Macdonald has some sympathy for—although this simplicity does not give credit to the substantial amount of analysis and the detailed recommendations that sit behind these words.


The previous Labor government then took steps to develop and implement this model in 2013. What we saw from the coalition government in 2015 was a U-turn on all that work. The then Treasurer issued a media release stating:


At the meeting the Commonwealth Treasurer put forward a proposal that relies on a vendor registration model as a method of collecting the GST for the states and territories. As goods would not be stopped at the border, administering a vendor registration model would have a relatively low cost.


The so-called logistics model, with the backing of the Productivity Commission report and the task force report, was abandoned with little notice, and instead the so-called vendor model was embraced. No justification was offered for why this change had been made, and the Office of Best Practice Regulation stated that this announcement, without an accompanying regulatory impact statement, was in breach of their regulation guidelines—a point that Senator Leyonhjelm has identified.


Fast forwarding to 2017, in March the legislation was introduced into parliament. It is far from ideal when we have an announcement in 2015, yet in March 2017 the legislation is introduced and the start date remains 1 July 2017. It does not give much time for scrutiny or for stakeholders to prepare for this new measure. The government seems to have wanted the parliament to just wave this legislation through. Labor sensibly wanted it to be referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and this bill is a clear example of how important these committees are when we have a government and a Treasurer introducing legislation like this.


The work of the committee culminated in a hearing in April, where we heard from Treasury officials as well as stakeholders on all sides of the debate. To start, I confirm that the Treasury had still, in 2017, not released the regulatory impact statement, and Treasury also admitted that the lack of a RIS was in breach of the Office of Best Practice Regulation guidelines. It was very concerning to hear that the Turnbull government had botched its own policy process in developing this bill. The hearing started with this revelation, and the news only went downhill from there. No explanations were offered by the government for the decision to move away from the recommendations set out in chapter 7 of the 2011 Productivity Commission report Economic structure and performance of the Australian retail industry and the subsequent Low Value Parcel Processing Taskforce: final report. There are still no answers after all these years.


In relation to the 1 July 2017 start date, Treasury officials declined to answer questions about whether alternative start dates had been modelled. Witnesses from the Australian Retailers Association, online retailers, the Conference of Asia Pacific Express Carriers and the Freight & Trade Alliance all expressed concerns about the 1 July 2017 start date. Even the supporters of this bill have concerns. eBay claimed that Treasury officials had told them they expected a 25 to 30 per cent compliance rate from the model set out in this legislation. Treasury officials later stated that they expected this compliance rate in the third year of operation and that it would reach maturity in 2022-23 at 54 per cent. So the government has clearly overstated the benefits of this bill. If 54 per cent is the best that can be achieved, it does not appear that this bill actually delivers on the objective of levelling the playing field for Australian retailers, who are struggling.


In another worrying sign, some of the online platform companies did not rule out geoblocking Australians and preventing them entirely from purchasing from overseas vendors. eBay stated:


Because we do not want to violate the law, we may have to stop all overseas sellers from selling to Australians. Of course, it will hurt our business significantly. I want to make it clear that we are not threatening; I just want you to know how significant an impact this bill will cause to our business.


Etsy also made similar comments, stating:


Because of the scaling complexity of this task, quite honestly, we are left with a number of unfavourable options. It is absolutely our worst-case scenario that we would have to do this, because, as I mentioned earlier, the revenue from our Etsy sellers is essential revenue. These are typically women at home who are full-time carers. This revenue counts for them, so blocking them from being able to achieve a sale like that is, frankly, devastating for us and for our business model.


Alibaba made comments along the lines:


Alibaba Group has done some preliminary work looking at this bill, and is of the view that it may not be able to be applied to AliExpress. If that were the case, we would have no choice but to geoblock Australian users from using the AliExpress platform.


And they had not provided any costing in relation to that. These potential impacts of a reduced variety of products, reduced competition and higher consumer prices are clearly possible consequences of this bill, and it is important that adverse consumer outcomes like this are avoided.


There were not many friends to be found for this bill during the hearing. Even witnesses normally supportive of government policy, such as Dr Berg and Professor Davisdon, associated with the IPA, gave the tax zero out of 10. They said:


The idea that 3,000 firms are just going to voluntarily stump up on this policy when there is really no direct enforcement mechanism seems to us a bit fantastical.


On this point of compliance the ATO, lumbered with a vague plan by the government, were left to explain that jurisdictions like the USA and China will not enforce the measure on their behalf. Platform compliance is largely reliant on the goodwill of overseas operators. Even the Retailers Association, a strong supporter of this bill, noted in their submission:


Our main concern is the speedy implementation of the policy with proposed registration and other measures needing time to be set up and enforced.


The logistics companies concurred with this issue of the start date, given the need to have their information systems modified to comply with the legislation. The public hearing clearly showed that the Treasurer had failed to properly consult with stakeholders and develop a workable model for taxing low-value imports. The hearing exposed numerous problems with this bill, and it clearly was not good enough in its proposed form.


The outcome of that inquiry was that we saw a government-dominated committee requesting a delay. Clearly, the issues did not just concern the Labor Party. The final committee report, in an unusual move, recommended the commencement date be amended to 1 July 2018. Indeed, in the words of my colleague Senator Hume in the media:


I think a delay in implementation is probably a good compromise solution. It's quite understandable that those companies to whom it applies wouldn't be prepared or have made the necessary changes until after the legislation was actually passed.


The final report also notes concerns expressed about the proposed implementation date and the complexity of implementation and enforcement. It accepts that business may need more time and assistance to develop their systems to implement the measure.


Labor also set out in the report its bipartisan in-principle approach to this bill to delay the start date and to have a review completed so that the best model could be adopted, the playing field could be properly levelled and that suitable consumer outcomes could be maintained. We maintain our position today that we are willing to find a way forward to level the playing field for Australian retailers, to have a taxation system with high compliance and for suitable consumer outcomes to be maintained. However, given the state of the bill and its numerous problems, we have no choice but to step in and give the affected stakeholders, the government and the parliament another chance to fix the Treasurer's mishandling of the GST low-value threshold legislation. Given the Productivity Commission's previous work into the collection of GST on online purchases, it is well placed to review the model. The Labor Party stands ready to find a way forward on this legislation. It is important to get the policy right.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-06-19,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:59):  Let us not gild the lily: this is a great big new tax on consumers, no matter how the government wants to dress it up and the opposition says they do not support it—they do. This is going to result in higher prices for everyday Australians. I do not think that is justified. It is not about protecting or preserving the domestic retail sector, it is not about getting a better deal for the mums and dads of Australia; it is about providing more revenue to government, because they cannot and will not live within their means. My position, the Australian Conservative position, is quite straightforward: Australians already pay enough tax. We do not spend their tax dollars wisely enough to ask them to give us any more. The spendthrift nature of the former Labor administrations and the existing coalition administration is extraordinary and is doing a huge disservice to our country and our children. We are collectively accumulating hundreds of billions of dollars worth of debt, which we are going to ask future taxpayers to fund, and we are doing it because we are not prepared to live within our means today.


The government and the opposition will dress up this big new tax on consumers as an equity measure to protect the Australian retail sector. If they were serious about ensuring a thriving retail sector in Australia, they would look towards cutting the regulation and bureaucracy attached to running, owning and operating a business in this country, which are a direct result of the policies implemented by those on the other side and those on this side of the chamber. Government policy is directly responsible for the massive electricity prices affecting every business and every consumer around the country. You want a more effective and economic retail sector? Cut those regulations and allow their electricity and utility prices to be lower; cut the regulations and red tape attached to employing people and allow more competition.


If you want an example of competition, Coles and Woolworths do Australians a massive disservice in the retail sector. They were selling products at a massive mark-up, far higher than the pricing of their international peers. They are under pressure now because their inefficient models, which were ripping off consumers, have been exposed by the likes of Costco and ALDI. I went out to Costco last week. The shopping experience may be different, but the prices are lower, because they are more competitive. If you cut competition, you are going to have a more uncompetitive environment. We need more competition in this country. We need the likes of Amazon to come in here to keep our retailers honest. No longer is it acceptable for them to engorge themselves at the Australian consumer's expense, when we are paying much more for products than it would cost to obtain them internationally.


What is the response? It is not to cut regulation but to put a new tax that is going to be paid by the Australian people. I am absolutely in principle opposed to that. That is why I do not support this bill. It is also a problem with the concept surrounding this bill. After Bert Kelly—and I note the Modest Member society chairman here—rather unfashionably first did so, we have argued for decades that free markets are good and tariffs are bad; now we are back to arguing for a new tariff. You can call it whatever you like, but it is a tariff. It is a tariff on low value purchases from overseas.


More importantly, the tariff is going to be cumbersome and unwieldy to implement and is going to raise a whole range of questions. Who pays it? Is it collected by the retailer overseas? Should it be collected by the transport agency here? Is it going to apply to second-hand goods? I can game the system already: if I were an overseas retailer, I would transfer it to a second retailer and call it second-hand. I would even repackage it to save money. There are a whole bunch of ways this could be scammed and gamed, because government are trying to be too clever. What is it that the government have against people being able to obtain goods for less money? If they are that opposed to consumers' interests, my message to them is that they are once again putting their own inability to cut the cost of government and to cut the expenses and the programs of government ahead of the interests of Australian people.


This is wrong in principle. The concept of it is wrong and overturns what I thought was decades of learned wisdom about getting more benefits. It undermines the principle of competition, and the execution of this is, quite frankly, diabolical. Here we are with a big new tax where the government do not really know how they are going to collect it or how they want to collect it, and this new tax is only a couple of weeks from being implemented. That is why, when the opposition seek to delay this tax for a year, I will be supporting that delay. I am happy to delay it for 10 or 12 years if it helps them to get to a better answer and a better outcome. But, ultimately, I will be voting against this bill in whatever shape or form it is. I am not here to put taxes up; I am here to cut the cost of regulation for businesses and for consumers. I am here to drive prices down so that people get better value not only from government—where we should be lowering taxes—but from the retailers, who have been feasting at our expense for a very long time.


Anyone who has been overseas and has gone into the apparel industry in America or Europe knows that you can buy things for much less there than you can in this country, and it is not because they are made in America or in Europe; it is because the regulations attached to selling those items allow for a more competitive environment and a more competitive market. I believe Australian consumers deserve better value from their retail sector. It is up to government to provide that environment by cutting the cost of doing business, not imposing new taxes on those who seek to get the best possible value for their money in a global environment.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-06-19,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:07):  I rise to speak today on behalf of the Australian Greens on the Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Bill 2017. Consistency is very important in politics, and the Greens have always had a very strong position of voting against GST when it was implemented. It is not a progressive tax. Members right around the country play a very important role in our policy formulation, and we do not support taxes that are not progressive. GST is a regressive tax. Every time there has been debate and discussion in this place about broadening the GST or increasing the rate of the GST, the Greens have consistently opposed it. Rather than just opposition, we have always embarked on proposition. We have always found other proposals and other ways to raise revenue in this country, and we are all for raising revenue, but we would like to see it done in a fair and equitable manner. We do not believe the GST is a fair and equitable tax. Hence, on applying it to low-value goods, we will again take the consistent position that will be opposing this bill today. We do not support GST as a fundamental principle, and we will not be supporting the bill today.


However, I would like to say there are other reasons for this. Even if that were not our policy position, there are other reasons that we would not be supporting this bill today. We do not believe that it is the right model. It is very important to be clear about this. Low-value imported goods are currently exempt from GST because, to date, it has not been considered worth the effort to collect the tax. It has not been considered worth the effort.


When we talk about the efficiencies of policies we look at how much it costs to implement, administer and enforce them and weigh that against the revenue benefit and potential economic benefit to get some kind of metric on efficiency. The proposition that the government has in the legislation before us today, certainly on all the evidence that I have heard, is not an efficient tax by any stretch of the imagination. In Mr Hockey's own 2015 tax white paper, he explained:


The exclusion from the GST base for imported services reflects how difficult it is to identify the supplier and recipient in a transaction because it has not occurred physically and, unlike imported goods, cannot be stopped at a border.


Everybody is clear about this: this is a very complex area. To put this simply, the Australian Taxation Office has better things to do than to go chasing $10 or $20 of GST here or there from literally tens of thousands of suppliers all over the world. The problem with this bill is that it does not seem to address that key fundamental problem. The vendor model that this bill proposes would require each of those tens of thousands of online retailers from all over the world to collect the tax for the tax office and then pass it on. We have already heard some contributions in here today about how difficult that is going to be and how easily that system will be gamed. I think it is fair to say that, even when you look at the explanatory memorandum that has been provided to senators, it has still not been made clear exactly how the ATO will do this. We have sympathy for the idea of parity and equity between domestic businesses and overseas businesses, for trying to ensure that our domestic retailers are not at a competitive disadvantage. But, as noted in an article in The Conversation by Kathrin Bain, from which I will read very shortly, it is still unclear exactly how much parity between domestic retailers and overseas retailers this is going to achieve.


One of the golden rules of taxes is that they have to be enforceable, and efficiently so. The Greens believe that the government should go back to the drawing board with this tax and get it right. It has been raised in here already that the government-dominated Economics Legislation Committee also recommended that this legislation not be implemented immediately; that there be a 12-month delay on the implementation, subject to getting it right. I find it quite ludicrous that we are here today to pass legislation that everybody seems to agree is second-rate. Why wouldn't we just get it right and then bring it back so that we can vote on legislation that we are all happy with?


That brings me to Labor's amendment. We have a choice, as a party, between voting for legislation that the government is likely to get up and have the numbers on, which begins immediately with a second-rate model, or supporting Labor's amendment to at least delay the legislation for 12 months and get the Productivity Commission to do a study. Of course, that does not bind the government. As Senator Cormann in the chamber here today knows, the government will look at the Productivity Commission's report. It may or may not take those recommendations on board. It has the discretion, as the executive, as to whether or not it wants to do that. So essentially we are, today, voting for the legislation to be implemented. Even a delay is no guarantee that we are going to this fix this and get it right. We can only hope that, if the Productivity Commission does look in detail at the differences between the models—for example, between the logistics model and the vendor model—and properly costs what it will take to administer and enforce the various regimes, perhaps the government will change this legislation and put up an amendment for us to all vote on. We would rather see that happen now. We would rather see the government get it right and bring it forward.


With that proposition in front of us, the Greens will be supporting Labor's amendment today. At least it gives us the opportunity to fix some of the mechanics of this bill and get it right. And I would hope that the government would take on board any recommendations by the Productivity Commission in that regard. We do believe there is merit in looking at the logistics model, which would collect the tax through distribution channels. I have met with various online retailers and other stakeholders, and I understand that this proposition has been raised at the legislative committee level and directly with Treasury and government. The merit of a logistics model is that there is a much smaller number—more likely a handful—of businesses through which imported goods are distributed, which makes it easier to administer. The ATO's task would be much simpler under this model and the model is also more likely to ensure that all imported goods are captured, whereas, with the vendor model in the legislation we have in front of us, you could drive jumbo jets through some of the holes in it. If we are trying to achieve parity, then that is not going to be the case.


I would like to go into a bit more detail as to why the proposed legislation does not set out to achieve its aim of levelling the playing field for our domestic retailers. It unfairly imposes GST on goods purchased from some overseas sellers that would not be subject to GST if purchased from an Australian seller. Kathrin Bain wrote an excellent article in The Conversation, on 21 April 2017, that explained some of the key or fundamental problems with this legislation. She said:


Currently, low-value imports (those with a customs value of A$1,000 or less) are exempt from GST. If the legislation is passed, overseas vendors who sell more than A$75,000 of low-value goods to Australian consumers would be required to register for GST, and collect and remit GST on low-value goods to the ATO.


Those imports will continue to be stopped at the border with any GST, customs duty, and associated fees paid to Australian Border Force by the importer before the goods are released.


For sellers of low-value goods it will mean that an overseas supplier of both low and high value goods will be subject to two separate tax regimes. The requirement to collect GST will apply only to low-value goods.


   …   …   …


While extending the GST to these goods is meant to level the playing field between overseas and Australian vendors, treating the online marketplace or mail forwarder as the supplier of goods is inconsistent with the treatment of domestic transactions.


As eBay has stated in their submission to the Senate Committee: ""eBay is not a seller. eBay is a third-party online marketplace that simply connects buyers and sellers"".


For Australian vendors who sell items on eBay, it’s the individual seller who is responsible for collecting and remitting GST on products they sell (if they are required to be registered). A seller who uses eBay, but isn't carrying on an enterprise or does not meet the A$75,000 turnover threshold, isn't required to be registered and would not be required to collect GST on their sales.


She states further in regard to the proposed legislation we have before us today:


However, the proposed legislation does not treat overseas vendors in this way, by treating online marketplaces and mail forwarding services as the supplier of goods.


So it seems as though the legislation has missed the point. She states further:


… small, individual vendors should not (if their turnover of low-value goods into Australia is less than A$75,000) be required to collect GST merely because they use an online marketplace.


EBay has gone as far as stating in their submission that: ""Regrettably, the Government's legislation may force eBay to prevent Australians from buying from foreign sellers"". This is because they would not be able to comply with the requirements imposed under the new legislation.


We can talk more about the various amendments when we come to the committee stage. My colleague Senator Waters has moved an amendment already in relation to removing GST from female sanitary products, particularly tampons. We have had this discussion in here today and it is a very important issue for many Australians—nearly half. For some reason, the razorblades I used to shave this morning are GST exempt because they are deemed to be an essential item for my male hygiene, yet women's tampons are not considered to be an essential item under the GST law. Senator Waters has already given a great speech on this and we are very keen to see this issue fixed. Senator Dastyari, who is in the chamber at the moment, has raised this issue at estimates. I know it is something the Labor Party feels strongly about. We look forward to having a discussion on that in committee.


Lastly—I cannot let this go unchallenged—some WA senators in here today have used this as an opportunity to talk about how hardly done by Western Australia is under the current GST calculations, with horizontal fiscal equalisation. Senator Smith, I say to you, through the chair, that since Federation Western Australia has been a recipient of the generosity of the other states. This is what fiscal equalisation was set up to do. It is actually extremely complex in terms of the calculations and the assumptions we make, but the principle behind it is really simple. It is about equality around our country. It is about the wealthier states transferring their wealth to help the poorer states. At different times since Federation different states have been donor states under these calculations and different states have been recipients. Throughout nearly all of its history WA has been a recipient of GST and other revenue from the Commonwealth. Through two mining booms, suddenly they are a donor state. They are very likely to be a recipient state again shortly, I understand, Senator Smith. If you squandered the benefits of the mining boom, do not come crying to the federal Senate to try and fix this problem for you. I can tell you that in my home state of Tasmania, when the exchange rate went to $1.15 against the US dollar—we rely on exports from our state. It is ironic that we have an excellent Western Australian senator in the chair at the moment, and this is good.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator, to clarify the record, what do you mean by 'excellent'?




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I withdraw 'excellent' if it makes you happy, Mr Acting Deputy President.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am still Western Australian!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  We have this situation where my state, which relies on agricultural exports—and I know other states do as well—got severely punished during the recent mining boom thanks to WA's resource—




Senator Smith:
  On a point of order, I am wondering if Senator Whish-Wilson will give up some of his time on the clock so that I can respond to him, as I have not yet actually made a contribution to this debate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  It is a very spurious point of order. Am I to understand that Senator Smith does not have time to speak today?




Senator Rhiannon:
  He has been gagged.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  He has been gagged by his side, has he? It is a bit rich—pardon the pun—for Senator Smith and all Western Australian senators to come in here and whinge that they have been hard done by, when since Federation they have been looked after by wealthier states. If anyone had a reason to have a whinge it would probably be New South Wales, one of the wealthier states. 


I have taken my great-grandfather's diary and walked his steps in the Somme and the battlefields of World War I, and I know that Tasmanian regiments fought for our federation alongside Western Australian regiments and other soldiers from different states. This is what federation is about. It is about the wealthier states supporting the poorer states at the right time when it is needed. That is why we are a federation. They would roll in their graves if they knew that Western Australia was being so greedy. The point I was making before, before I got distracted by Senator Smith, was that Western Australia had this mining boom. It hurt my state. That exchange rate—call it Dutch disease, whatever you want—impacted Tasmania quite severely. It really did hurt our agricultural exports. But we were not out there complaining and demanding money from Western Australia, which was reaping the benefits of the mining boom. It should have been better invested, may I say—



Senator Smith interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Senator Smith, if you want more revenue, here is my suggestion: fix the bloody petroleum resource rent tax, the PRRT. Fix it! That $238 billion of tax credits that we have given, predominantly off the coast of Western Australia, to some of the largest and wealthiest petroleum companies in the world—$238 billion and counting. Every dollar they spend on exploration or operational expenditure they get to uptick at rates of 15 per cent plus the bond rate, or five per cent plus the bond rate for operational expenditure. They can even claim the clean-up costs of oil spills. $238 billion of tax credits that they can write off against future income. Even if you tweak those numbers slightly, you will be able to raise tens of billions of dollars, which I am sure would help Western Australia and the rest of it. All it takes is a little bit of political courage to take on the big end of town. Do not try and take on my state and take money off Tasmania. We are doing very well at the moment, thank you very much. Our economy is doing quite nicely, because we have sailed through the difficult period when Western Australia made it very difficult for us, thanks to the high exchange rate, and we are now emerging from it. It is times like this that we can look and say, 'The system works; the system works very nicely, thank you very much.' And it has worked since our forefathers fought next to each other for our Federation in those overseas conflicts. That is why we are a Federation. The whole principle that was set up is the principle of equity. It is designed to transfer revenues between states—with the Commonwealth taking responsibility for that—to try to remove inequality around our country. That is what it was set up to do. It just happens to be your luck, Senator Smith, that your state—and Western Australia is my state too, in many ways—through the luck of the draw happened to inherit some of the richest mineral wealth in the world, underneath the ground and underneath the soil.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Smith, on a point of order?




Senator Smith:
  Senator Whish-Wilson has the rare distinction of being the only Western Australian arguing against GST distribution reforms.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.





Senator Dastyari:
  What about the poor people of New South Wales?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Dastyari, no-one needs your help.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  That was another spurious point of order. Nevertheless, I am a proud Tasmanian. My father is Tasmanian; my mother is Western Australian—I will put that on record. However, Senator Smith, the half of me that is Western Australian is very happy for you to be giving GST money to the other half of me that is Tasmanian. I make that very clear. But my point remains that for Western Australia and for the Western Australians who are lucky enough to live there, the soil under their feet—and under your thongs, Acting Deputy President Sterle—happens to contain some of the biggest mineral deposits in the world. It is just your luck that you happen to be born there and happen to be lucky enough to live there. 


There are other parts of the country that do not have those natural advantages, and I would have thought it was perfectly natural that you would want to share those with the rest of the country. Perhaps you were a Young Liberal, Senator Smith, and we all know what they say about Young Liberals: the one thing that they have in common is that they learnt not to share. That is what they say about Young Liberals, and perhaps Senator Smith has inherited such a trait. I am not saying that is the case, but it is possible. Federation is about sharing within our fantastic nation, supporting each other and giving each other a leg-up. On that note, I will get back to the bill. The Greens will not be supporting this bill today for the reasons I have outlined. We will look forward to further discussion during the committee stage on various amendments.

The speeches read as follows—



MAJOR BANK LEVY BILL 2017


The Turnbull Government is committed to Australia having a world leading financial sector.


Our banks must be unquestionably strong, but they must also be unquestionably accountable, unquestionably fair and our banking system must be unquestionably competitive. 


The Government is also committed to ensuring that Australia's largest banks are held to account and make a fair additional contribution to the Australian community which they serve. 


Australia's financial system is strong, stable and well-regulated and has weathered global volatility well. 


Nevertheless, the banking system in Australia – with a small number of large and highly profitable banks at its core – is highly concentrated. 


The Government and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) have taken, and continue to take, steps that will force banks to take greater responsibility for their own resilience and avoid the need for taxpayer-funded bailouts. 


The major bank levy will build on these critical prudential reforms by making stable and secure funding sources relatively less expensive. 


Importantly, it will also support competition in the financial system by providing a more level playing field for smaller banks and other providers of financial services who compete with the larger banks who enjoy cheaper costs of funding. 


Australia's five largest banks are highly profitable – earning more than $30 billion a year after tax – and benefit from a regulatory system that has helped to embed their dominant position in the market. For example, the major banks are accredited to use internal ratings-based models that allow them to reduce the amount of capital that they must hold, lowering their funding costs relative to the smaller banks who rely on standardised risk weights.


They also contribute to systemic risk through their scale and concentration to the financial system – risks that ultimately fall on the broader Australian community. 


Hence, from 1 July 2017 all Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs), foreign and domestically-owned, with greater than $100 billion in licensed entity liabilities will be liable to pay the major bank levy, which will include the Big Four banks. 


Unlike the previous bank deposits tax measure, which was abolished by this Government, smaller banks will not be liable to pay the major bank levy. The threshold will be indexed to growth in nominal Gross Domestic Product. 


The major bank levy will equal 0.015 per cent of each affected bank's licensed entity liabilities each quarter (0.06 per cent per annum), excluding Additional Tier 1 capital, deposits protected by the Financial Claims Scheme (FCS) and the quarterly average value of Exchange Settlement Account (ESA) balances held with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).


Unlike previous proposals considered by earlier Governments, this levy will not apply to everyday household deposits. Nor will it apply to banks' assets – such as mortgages. It will also not apply to other financial institutions, such as insurance companies or superannuation funds. 


It is not a levy on depositors or savers or mortgage holders. 


Liabilities captured by the levy include, for example corporate bonds; commercial paper; certificates of deposit; Tier 2 capital instruments; operational liabilities and non-FCS protected deposits.


Treasury estimates that the levy is expected to raise around $1.5 billion a year. This represents a fair contribution by the banking sector to the Australian community and contributes to a long term balanced Budget. 


To minimise additional red tape costs, assessment of the levy will largely rely on data already reported to APRA and will be payable quarterly to the Australian Taxation Office.


The Government is working with the banks to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime. To assist major banks to begin to comply with the levy, the first levy calculation and instalment will be delayed by three months – at no cost to revenue – to provide additional time for banks to make necessary systems changes. 


The levy will be administered by the ATO, with APRA's role being solely to assist with data collection. 


The levy will support efforts to improve financial system resilience. 


The Turnbull Government and APRA are working diligently – in line with the recommendations of the Murray Financial System Inquiry – to improve the resilience of Australia's financial system. This includes:


setting bank capital requirements such that Australian banks are 'unquestionably strong';


strengthening APRA's crisis management powers; 


improving bank liquidity and encouraging more stable funding; and


ensuring that our banks have appropriate loss-absorbing capacity.


The major bank levy will complement these important reforms.


By excluding Additional Tier 1 Capital and FCS-protected deposits from the levy base, the levy will work in tandem with APRA reforms. 


The effective exclusion of liabilities used to fund ESA balances held with the RBA will also ensure that the levy does not impinge on the operation of Australia's payments system. 


The levy is also designed to support competition. 


The House of Representatives Economics Committee's 'Review of the Four Major Banks', commissioned by the Government last year, concluded that Australia's banking sector is an oligopoly and that Australia's largest banks have significant pricing power which they have used to the detriment of everyday Australians. 


This is not a situation that the Government is willing to accept. 


In the 2017-18 Budget we announced a range of measures to improve competition in the financial system, including:


a reduction in regulatory barriers for new and innovative entrants in banking;


an enhanced regulatory sandbox, to support innovation; 


an extension of the Crowd Sourced Equity Framework, to help get new businesses off the ground; and


a commitment to Open Banking, to empower consumers to have control over their data and get the best possible deal.


We have also established a Productivity Commission inquiry into the state of financial system competition, to be supplemented by regular in-depth inquiries into specific financial system competition issues by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. 


These measures will support economic growth and deliver better outcomes for consumers and small businesses. The major bank levy builds on these reforms. 


The levy will help create a more level playing field for smaller banks and non-bank competitors. This will give existing and new players – including FinTechs – a better chance to grow their businesses and deliver improved services and experiences to all Australians. 


The major bank levy does not give any bank an excuse to increase costs for their customers. 


That is why the Government has directed the ACCC to undertake an inquiry into residential mortgage pricing. The ACCC will be able to use its information-gathering powers to obtain and scrutinise documents from any bank affected by the levy and to report publicly on its findings. 


Following the introduction of the levy, it is my expectation that, in setting their prices, banks will effectively balance the needs of borrowers, savers, shareholders and the wider community. 


The ACCC inquiry will illuminate how the banks respond to the introduction of the levy and give all Australians the information they need to get a better deal elsewhere from any of the more than 100 other banks, credit unions and building societies, as well as other non-bank competitors. 


The Turnbull Government has been a world leader in making sure that big companies pay their fair share of tax. 


To close, this Bill delivers on the Government's promise to ensure that Australia's largest banks are held accountable to the Australian community.


It is evidence of our Government's utmost commitment to long term budget sustainability and to ensuring that Australia's largest banks make a fair contribution to the community.


It builds on our program of prudential reforms, contributing to the resilience of our financial system and helping to ensure that banks can stand on their own two feet without recourse to taxpayers at times of financial stress.


Finally, it enhances competition – supporting economic growth and delivering better outcomes for Australian consumers and businesses. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum. 


TREASURY LAWS AMENDMENT (MAJOR BANK LEVY) BILL 2017


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Major Bank Levy) Bill 2017 is the second Bill to introduce the major bank levy. 


This Bill makes a number of amendments to support the effective operation of the major bank levy. These include:


setting out how to index the levy's $100 billion threshold to growth in nominal Gross Domestic Product, ensuring that only the largest banks are levied in the future;


allowing the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to collect the data necessary for the major banks to calculate the levy;


allowing APRA to provide information relating to the major bank levy to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to assist the ATO in monitoring compliance with the levy, and for the ATO to give information relating to the levy to APRA;


ensuring that when the major bank levy is payable to the ATO the ordinary collection and recovery provisions apply; and


introducing an anti-avoidance provision to protect the integrity of the levy. 


Full details of this measure and the major bank levy are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (13:58):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Major Bank Levy Bill. I will have to stop for question time, but when the bill comes back on I will speak further on it. From the outset, Labor will be supporting the bill. We do have a lot of fights with the government about many things, but we resolved quite early on that we would not stand in the way of the government on this measure. The state of the budget and the need for this measure in relation to budget repair has certainly assisted us in coming to this conclusion. Thanks to this government's budgetary mismanagement, gross debt smashed through the half a trillion mark last week, for the first time in the nation's history. With debt and the deficit blowing out under this government's watch, it would be irresponsible of Labor to take an alternative position. But that does not mean we are going to provide a leave pass for the incompetence of the government and the Treasurer.


These major bank levy bills give effect to the government's 2017-18 budget measure to impose an annual levy on the big four banks and on Macquarie. Applying to banks with liabilities of at least $100 billion, the government estimates the levy will raise $6.2 billion, which is claimed to be both a revenue raising measure and a competition measure. It is worth stepping through some of the issues that we have encountered since this measure was first announced in this year's budget. All of these issues clearly highlight the sheer incompetence of the government and, in particular, the Treasurer. To start out there was the leak to the Australian Financial Review before the budget lock-up commenced. Budget leaks and drops happen all the time—it is part of the usual operation of a government prior to a budget—but generally it is not something as market sensitive as this proposal. The Treasury secretary, when asked about this, said:


… on the basis of what we have been told by our staff, on the basis of informed discussions with my senior executives as to who knew what and when, I would be devastated. I reiterate, I would be devastated, if I had thought that one of my staff had been responsible for this.

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:01):  My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Yesterday it was revealed that the Turnbull government's own documents, reportedly provided to the Senate crossbench, indicate that Catholic schools stand to lose $4.6 billion under the government's education package. One Liberal MP has told The Australian that: 


It leaves me with a very sour taste in my mouth. I'm wondering if Minister Birmingham deliberately misled the partyroom when he gave his briefing.


I ask the minister: did Minister Birmingham mislead the coalition party room, or were coalition MPs and senators fully aware that under the government's package Catholic schools stood to lose $4.6 billion?

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:03):  In relation to the education package, the Liberal member for Menzies, Mr Andrews, says:


To do a deal with the Greens seems madness to me, that we’re hellbent on driving our own base away in return for votes from the Greens in which we’ll never be rewarded at the ballot box.


Is the member for Menzies correct?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:01):  The answer to the honourable senator's question is no. Senator Birmingham did not mislead the party room. As to the rest of the honourable senator's question, it is based on a series of false premises. It is false to suggest that Catholic schools will lose any money at all under the proposal that Senator Birmingham has brought to the parliament. In fact, over the 10-year period to 2027 funding to the Catholic system will increase by $2.8 billion. That is $2.8 billion of the $18.6 billion of additional money that will be spent on Australian schools under the proposal that Senator Birmingham is bringing before the parliament this week.


Let me make it as clear as it is possible to be: in addition to the existing expenditure on the Catholic system, Catholic schools will receive, over the 10-year period, an additional $2.8 billion in public funding. The Catholic system know that. That is why, for example, the Archbishop of Brisbane, Archbishop Coleridge, has said that Catholic parents have nothing to be concerned about in relation to what Senator Birmingham has proposed. They know, because there is an additional $2.8 billion for the Catholic system under Senator Birmingham's proposal.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, is there a supplementary question?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:04):  Senator Wong, I hope the Greens vote for our proposal. I hope all the crossbench vote for our proposal, because this is the best reform to school funding that Australia will have seen in a generation. We will be returning to the original vision of Mr David Gonski for genuine, transparent, nationally consistent needs based funding. 


So I would welcome the support of the Greens for this proposal that sees an additional $18.6 billion over the 10 years to 2027—$11.9 billion in extra money to government schools, $2.8 billion more money to Catholic schools and $3.8 billion more money to independent schools. Every single element of every single system within the broader school system will benefit from Senator Birmingham's proposal. (Time expired)

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (14:45):  That is a great segue from the question we just heard, where we had Senator Carr wanting to defend the industrialisation of Australia and wanting to defend jobs in Australia but, at the same time, being part of a party who, in their own climate action policy last year at the election, said they wanted to kickstart the closure of coal-fired power stations. And didn't the Labor Party get their wish!


In the last year we have seen two major coal-fired power stations close, cheered along by the Labor Party. 'How fast can we make these go?' was their view. 'Let's close them sooner, faster, more often.' Both of them have closed, and we have seen, in South Australia, a massive cost to the economy, with a statewide blackout, where a South Australian Labor government refused the price of $25 million to keep Northern Power Station going. Instead, it is now spending more than $500 million in response to their statewide blackout, including buying diesel generators to use over the summer to keep the lights on. It is absolutely absurd!


Likewise with the closure of Hazelwood. We have seen it put pressure on prices—that was the advice of the Australian Energy Market Operator—but we have seen that closure cheered on by the Victorian Labor government as well. They wanted that to close, and they got their wish as well. On this side, we are not embarrassed to stand behind the need for baseload, reliable power in our system. That does rely on using the natural resources that we have been given in this country, including coal and gas—resources that have powered this country for decades, for hundreds of years, and provided thousands of jobs to hardworking Australians. These are industries that we do want to support and keep going. That is why we are not shy about backing the use of our natural resources in this country to create wealth and keep power prices down for the users of power in households across Australia.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (14:47):  I do note, like the senator, mayor Jenny Hill's support for the coalition on this matter; she thinks we should support baseload power in North Queensland. We know, as I was saying, the Labor Party wanted to kickstart the closure of coal-fired power. Earlier last year Mark Butler, the energy spokesperson for the Labor Party, said:


Labor will introduce a framework to kickstart the closure of the older, heaviest polluting generators consistent with the principles set out in our policy documents.


That is their position, but we know that Anthony Albanese has a different view. Mr Albanese, the member for Grayndler, supports coal-fired power. He says on his website that he has had more than 70 references to supporting coal-fired power. That is another difference that is emerging there.


We have also had people like the state Labor member for Mirani, Mr Pearce, say that he supports a coal-fired power station. We have had Jo-Ann Miller, the Labor member for Ipswich, supporting a coal-fired power station. But we still have the federal Labor Party here wanting to kickstart the closure of reliable power in our country. (Time expired)

They are not shy about supporting coal-fired power either. I forgot to mention our favourite supporter of coal-fired power in this place, and that is Mr Bob Brown. He is also a big supporter of coal-fired power. There is an article here from The Mercury where coal-fired power is the 'best option' according to Mr Bob Brown. He is a big supporter of coal-fired power. But now what we have here is a religious objection to the use of coal from the Greens and the Labor Party teaming up, whereas what we are saying is that we should do what works. Let us do what works. Let us focus on what works for people so that we can keep them in a job, so we can keep their power bills down. We know that there are more than 300 plants around Asia that are being built or are under construction for coal-fired power, and that can bring emissions down as well as guarantee jobs.

The PRESIDENT
 (15:03):  Senators will recall that on 13 February this year the Speaker and I announced that Mr Phil Bowen, the inaugural Parliamentary Budget Officer, will be retiring from the position when his term ends on 22 July this year. After advising the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, we commenced the search for a new Parliamentary Budget Officer. We looked for a person with strong public policy experience and close familiarity with the Commonwealth's budget framework and fiscal policy issues. We also thought it important that the successful candidate had the capacity to operate in an independent and non-partisan manner with a high level of confidentiality, integrity and accountability to the Australian parliament. On 29 May we advised the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit of the outcome of the competitive selection process, and in accordance with the requirements of the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 sought the approval of the committee for our proposed appointment. The committee gave its approval on 15 June last. 


It is my pleasure to now inform the Senate that the next Parliamentary Budget Officer will be Jenny Wilkinson. Ms Wilkinson is currently the division head, Retirement Income Policy Division in the Treasury. Ms Wilkinson's term will begin on Monday, 24 July 2017. The Speaker and I look forward to working with Ms Wilkinson, and I am sure that all senators will join me in wishing her every success in her new role.


At this point I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge and thank Mr Phil Bowen for his service as Parliamentary Budget Officer. Mr Bowen has had a long and distinguished Public Service career, for which he was awarded the Australian Public Service Medal in 2006. In establishing and leading the Parliamentary Budget Office for five years, Mr Bowen has done an outstanding job undertaking his duties at all times with complete impartiality. The PBO's rigorous independent modelling and analysis has been of great assistance to members of both houses of the parliament and has improved the budget process.


I gratefully acknowledge his having remained in the role for longer than he originally intended, upon the request of the Speaker and I, continuing to provide a great service to senators and members, particularly during the costing of policy proposals in the lead-up to the last election. I wish Phil and his family well for his retirement.


In accordance with the requirements of the act, I now ask the Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, Senator Smith, to make a statement on behalf of the committee on the appointment.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:05):  by leave—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I am pleased to advise the Senate of the committee's deliberations and subsequent approval of the appointment of Ms Jenny Wilkinson as the Parliamentary Budget Officer. The Senate will be aware section 64XA of the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 requires the presiding officers to seek the approval of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit when appointing the Parliamentary Budget Officer. The committee welcomes the announcement of the President of the Senate today confirming the appointment of Ms Wilkinson and associates itself with his remarks.


The purpose of the Parliamentary Budget Officer is to increase transparency and support informed public debate by providing independent and non-partisan analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals. As the committee responsible for parliamentary oversight of the Parliamentary Budget Office, the JCPAA is of the view that Ms Wilkinson's appointment will continue the strong and astute leadership of the Parliamentary Budget Office. Following its meeting with Ms Wilkinson, the committee unanimously agreed to the appointment. The committee considers Ms Wilkinson's economic and fiscal-related background, complemented by a diversity of public-policy roles, will allow Ms Wilkinson to steward the PBO through its next phase. The committee is confident in Ms Wilkinson's knowledge, skills and expertise and believes that in the position of Parliamentary Budget Officer Ms Wilkinson will ensure the PBO continues to produce relevant work that affirms the independent and non-partisan nature of the PBO.


Since 2013 Ms Wilkinson has performed senior executive roles with the Commonwealth Treasury, including in the macroeconomic and fiscal groups. During her time as a Commonwealth public servant Ms Wilkinson has been responsible for delivering a number of high-profile economic reforms. Prior to joining the Public Service, Ms Wilkinson worked for the Reserve Bank of Australia, where she held various positions including that of Deputy Head, Economic Analysis Department.


The committee looks forward to working with Ms Wilkinson upon her commencement with the PBO. In welcoming Ms Wilkinson the committee would also like to acknowledge the very fine contribution made by Mr Phil Bowen, the inaugural Parliamentary Budget Officer, to the establishment and formative years of the Parliamentary Budget Office. Mr Bowen has led the PBO for five years since mid-2012.


At this important juncture it is worth reflecting on the tremendous achievement to our democratic discourse that has been provided by the Parliamentary Budget Office during Mr Bowen's tenure. The recent report of the independent review panel of the Parliamentary Budget Office undertaken by Dr Ian Watt AC remarked:


The PBO is regarded as an independent and non-partisan organisation that produces rigorous analysis relevant to public policy debate.


…   …   …


… the PBO has been a successful institutional development in Australian governance … and has filled a significant gap in Australia's public policy landscape.


On behalf of the committee I would like to thank Mr Bowen for his strong leadership and for his effective and faultless commitment to the office's effective operations since its inception. The committee wishes Mr Bowen all the best for his future endeavours.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:10):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) and the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senator Chisholm today relating to schools funding.


Senator Brandis and Senator Birmingham have continued in their attempts to justify what is a policy fraud. They are unable to substantiate the shift to a Commonwealth-only school education funding model, try as they might. I will use this opportunity today to highlight several aspects of that policy fraud.


The first is that this is the real Gonski. Let me quote from Mr Gonski in a speech he gave on 21 May 2014 when he said:


Lost in the discussion for more money were the central tenets of our review. We advocated:- A. Funding to be unified i.e. Given by state and federal governments to the different sectors together rather than states substantially only funding their school system and the bulk of commonwealth funding being as a consequence paid to independent and faith based schools.


This is why we continue to challenge the government embedding this 80-to-20 shift. This is the position that Mr Gonski took. Read as you might the comments by the Prime Minister or the verballing by Senator Birmingham, Mr Gonski has not changed his position. We saw this verballing continue today. We saw Senator Brandis verballing Archbishop Coleridge very much in the same form. The basic fact is that there has been no substantiation for the shift that this Turnbull cabinet has taken. I asked during the Senate inquiry if I could be directed to any academics, thought leaders or anyone else who could justify this significant shift in approach that will deny public schools the funding they need into the future. I was told no. The only thoughts on this shift available are cabinet in confidence. This is simply not good enough. It is not good enough for a policy measure that has been rushed through a Senate inquiry and that this government is attempting to rush through the Senate this week.


But let us look at the other elements of this fraud. There are the fantasy figures. We have all seen the Fairfax report on the fantasy figures that Minister Birmingham and his department have put out using their funding estimator. There is the fantasy of recreating the funds that schools get in the 2017 year on the basis of a formula that will never apply to that year. Now we are seeing the fraud of this government in attempting to rewrite the PBO figures that Senator Leyonhjelm received to his questions to the PBO. Thank God for the PBO, I say! Thank God we have a PBO that can provide some independence in these situations. I welcome its new head.


One further issue I should bring to the attention of the Senate is a correction that was received after the Senate inquiry into the bill on this. First, though, let me read Senator Birmingham's claims in this respect. He said socioeconomic data has been used in the school funding system since 2001 and has been 'refined, expanded and broadly accepted as a credible way to measure capacity to contribute'. This is a fraud. Gonski recommended that that model be reviewed and replaced. Indeed, the department tied themselves in knots when they sought to justify it. They were such a bad knots that Mr Tony Cook needed to subsequently write to the committee to correct his evidence. He attempted to justify the minister's claims by arguing that the measure had gone down to ABS mesh blocks. Of course, he had to correct that, because it simply is not true. There had been no response to the Gonski recommendation back in 2011 that the SES needed to be reviewed. 


Instead, now we have a government trying to make significant changes in ways that have not been properly tested, have not been properly modelled and have not been properly canvassed and that will damage a lot of our delivery of school education. Everyone, in their local area, in their local suburb, has a local primary school and usually a local Catholic school. The changes that this government is proposing will ensure that that education delivery cannot continue. (Time expired)

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:15):  I thank Senator Collins very much for that extraordinary outburst! I think that is the first time I have heard the word 'fraud' used with regard to Gonski. That is absolutely extraordinary—no, it was the word 'corruption'; the corruption of the original Gonski report—when you consider that the report was presented by the Labor Party in its original proposal. What the coalition has presented in its school funding reform package is in fact the original Gonski proposal, the original Gonski measures and the original Gonski meaning, which was genuine needs based funding—transparent, nationally consistent needs based funding. Every school and every element of the Australian school system benefits from the coalition's school funding reform. It has overwhelming public support, yet those opposite clutch at straws, desperately searching for an opportunity to criticise the coalition, which, overwhelmingly, is being supported for its proposals.


The Turnbull government is introducing genuine needs based funding. It will increase investment and it will give Australian students the quality education that they deserve. It is committing an additional $18.6 billion for Australian schools over the next decade, starting from 2018—an additional $18.6 billion. That $18.6 billion is distributed according to a model of fair, needs based, transparent funding tied to school reforms which are proven to boost students' results. This landmark Quality Schools reform package means Commonwealth funding for Australian schools will grow from a record $17.5 billion this year, 2017, to over $30.6 billion in 2027. More than $2.2 billion in new funding just in the next four years is included in this year's budget, and that follows on from an additional $1.2 billion in last year's budget. 


The coalition's school funding model has the imprimatur of David Gonski himself, who is also preparing an updated report for the government on how best to spend the money to improve student performance and improve student results. 


A child's education should never be dependent on any particular sector's lobbying abilities, yet under the previous government, the now opposition, there were 27 separate deals and special arrangements. The opposition did not have the political courage to deal with those particular lobbying groups, those particular sectors, and their demands. 


This coalition government has the political will and the political courage, and it has the imprimatur of David Gonski himself—and not just David Gonski but other members of the Gonski panel. Ken Boston was a Gonski review panellist, but he is also a very strong supporter of public education and is a former head of the New South Wales education department. Ken Boston said:


Five years after the release and subsequent emasculation—


they were his words—


of the Gonski Report, Australia has a rare second chance … 


There are no grounds for opposition to the schools funding bill in principle, and every reason to work collaboratively towards its successful implementation and further refinement in the years ahead.


He also said it would be a 'tragedy' if the government's bill is voted down. In fact another former panellist, Kathryn Greiner, said it would be a disaster if the current model remained in place.


A child's education, as I have said, should never be dependent on a sector's lobbying ability. It is imperative now that we grab the opportunity to implement the true Gonski reforms—fair, needs based funding—with both hands. I urge the opposition to reconsider its recalcitrance and embrace those reforms, if for no other reason than on the grounds of equity.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-06-19,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:20):  This is just another policy disaster from this incompetent government. The government's education funding reforms are now starting to come apart. If one were to listen to Minister Birmingham and the Attorney-General, one would think that all of the concerns raised by the Catholic system are unfounded; there is nothing to them; and somehow the Catholic education system is wanting more than its fair share of federal government funding.


This is an extraordinary accusation or insinuation to make in respect of this matter. What really illustrates the fact that this is not the case is that we find Senator Back coming out this morning on ABC television to highlight the point that he cannot support this change to the funding arrangements. He does not believe that the Catholic system is receiving a fair deal. If one of the government's own senators cannot bring himself to support this proposition, then why on earth should anyone else in this chamber come forward and support something which is obviously seen as a backward step for the Catholic system, which does pull its weight and does an extraordinary job around the country in educating young Australians.


With Senator Back standing up to the government, we also hear that One Nation are likely to support the government and support an unfair deal. I would express my disappointment with that announcement and ask our colleagues in One Nation to review and reconsider their approach. Senator Hanson seems to talk about the fact that it is not just money that is going to solve the problems. Of course, money alone does not solve problems, and having proper funding does not exclude attention being given to the standards in schools as well. These are not mutually exclusive objectives. We need to have both.


The Queensland government's education minister, Kate Jones, also knows the truth. It is not just the Catholic system, it is not just the government's own senators that have expressed concern—there are also some concerns about this in the public sector. Minister Kate Jones has referred to Gonski 2.0 as just 'smoke and mirrors'. What she is saying is that she is concerned that the Turnbull government, after promising at the last election that they would not walk away from the Gonski funding model, in fact did so. 'They tore up the six-year agreement and now they are saying we should trust them on a 10-year agreement.' Those are the words of the Queensland education minister. Queensland schools stands to miss out under this government. They are claiming extra funding, but really it is now just less of a deep cut.


Labor understands the importance of education and its links to the dignity of work. Labor has announced that we will restore $22 billion that the Prime Minister will cut from schools. Only a Labor government can be trusted with education funding, and only a Labor government can be trusted to properly equip the Australian people with the skills they need to meet the embrace of the economy of the future. We know that what the government is proposing is not fair. We notice that it is not sector blind and we know that it is not needs based. 


Just returning to Minister Jones's comments, she has pointed out that government schools across the state of Queensland will be $300 million worse off under the Gonski 2.0 changes, in contrast to the $1.43 billion surplus spruiked by the federal Minister for Education and Training, Minister Birmingham. Whilst Minister Jones has indicated that she is happy that the cuts will not be as deep as was flagged last year, the reforms will still result in a decrease in funding. This is an attempt, as Ms Jones has indicated, to trick schools and to trick parents in Queensland, so she wants to compare real dollars flowing to our schools right now to after June. A $300 million cut for Queensland public schools over the 10-year plan means that decisions get tougher. This government is no friend to Queensland schools.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-06-19,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:25):  I noticed Senator Collins mentioned the word 'fraud' in her brief presentation as the first speaker is this debate. The biggest political fraud I saw in this whole debate and issue was when, in 2013, the Labor Party—they were back to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd; yes, I think they had swapped back—promised this $80 billion that the coalition has supposedly cut out of education and health funding. The $80 billion was never there. It was never budgeted for. It was a promise. It was a good political ploy to take to each election so they could say, 'Here's a promise'—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Neither was yours, over four years. That is what you are doing now, over 10 years. It is no different.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  It was never budgeted for, and Senator Collins knows that. The money was never in the budget; it was never in the forward estimates. It was a promise, knowing full well that Labor would lose the 2012 election, which they did, of course. So now they keep saying that it is the coalition that is cutting the spending back. You cannot cut back on something that was never ever delivered. It was never funded. It was simply a political statement.


I find it amazing when we see the increase in funding in education. For example, in New South Wales, this year's funding for the government schools is $2.186 billion. For the non-government schools, it is $3.306 billion. So that is about $5½ billion of funding for New South Wales government and non-government schools this year. In 2027, that $5½ billion will go to more than $9 billion—almost double. In fact, that is an 83.1 per cent increase for the government schools and a 56.6 per cent increase for the non-government schools. So here we have the funding going up. If you look across Australia, the figures I have here show that there will be $17½ billion of funding this year for government and non-government schools and $30½ billion of funding by 2027, in 10 years time. So there will be a huge increase in funding by the federal government, and it is needs based funding, I might add.


It is about time the states looked at their education budgets. I know that in the last 10 years, in New South Wales, the federal government has increased spending in real terms—Senator McCarthy, that means above inflation—by 66 per cent. Many of the states have increased their funding to education by only six per cent and seven per cent, yet the liability of education falls on the state government. But we know who is doing the funding. It is the federal government doing the funding.


I have more to say on that briefly, as I watch the clock and see I have only a couple of minutes to go. The government is spending $18.6 billion on schools through real, needs based funds that are fair, transparent and consistent. Labor's alternative is based on 27 special deals that treat students in one state differently from the students in another state. Why would you treat students differently because of a state border? Our plan means that every Australian child, regardless of the state in which they live, is treated consistently based on needs. That is fair, and I say: life is about fairness.


The funding we are providing to schools is fully transparent—that is also fair. Funding to Catholic schools will grow by $1.2 billion over the next four years and $3.4 billion over the next 10 years. Catholic Education retains autonomy to distribute their funding however they please. In other words, a cheque is given to the Catholic Education management, and they allocate the funding where they consider it to be most important. We will continue to fund systemic schools in Catholic education and other parts of the non-government sector directly, and they will continue to have autonomy and accountability for how that funding is distributed. While we know that a strong level of funding is vital, we also know that what is more important is how that funding is used. That is why we have used David Gonski and a panel of education experts to provide advice on most effective teaching and learning strategies to improve student outcomes and school performance.


This is about improving student outcomes. For years we have put billions and billions more money into education and our literacy and numeracy standards have gone down and down and down. Perhaps a little bit more discipline in the schools would be a good thing. Perhaps a little bit more respect for the teachers would be a very good thing. Perhaps, in many cases, parental involvement and parental interest would be a good thing. Those three things—discipline, respect and parental involvement: what do they cost? They cost nothing at all. I think that is where we have really fallen down in our education system over decades: it is the lack of discipline, respect and parental involvement, to some degree. There is the problem in itself. The money is there but we need to do a few other things as well. (Time expired)

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2017-06-19,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (15:30):  This government's approach to education funding is certainly yet another example of their chaotic, divided and out of touch approach. Fairness it certainly is not. This is not some political argument removed from the lives of Australians. In fact, it is about a fundamental issue: the education of our children and who gets access to a decent, fair and equitable education system. Yet again, the Turnbull government is selling Australians short. They are doing it to our kids and our young people.


In the Northern Territory this attack on education, in a way, is about shattering the hopes and dreams of the education of our young people. It is actually starting to erode any thoughts of what our future will look like—in a positive way. How can Mr Turnbull's policy be needs based when the nation's most disadvantaged schools systems—our schools in the Northern Territory—get the least help. We just want a fair deal for our kids, but fairness is not what we are receiving. Instead of supporting Territory schools and students, the Prime Minister is punishing them.


One of the government's own, Senator Back, said this morning that he will cross the floor and vote against these changes—$22 billion in cuts to schools across the country. These are real cuts that will impact on the standard and delivery of education in our schools and that directly affect our children. To talk about needs based funding is almost laughable—if there weren't such serious consequences.


If you want to talk about need, let's continue to look at the schools in need in the Northern Territory. Every government school in the Northern Territory will lose money under the model put forward by the Turnbull government—151 government schools across the Northern Territory will lose funding. The Commonwealth's funding proposal will see federal funds cut to 20 per cent of the School Resourcing Standard. Currently, NT government schools received 23 per cent of the SRS. Under the Turnbull schools policy, all 151 government schools across the Northern Territory will lose funding, because they have been classified as over-funded


The coalition must be the only people in Australia who think Northern Territory public schools, on average the nation's disadvantaged, are overfunded. I visit a lot of schools across the Northern Territory and I know of the great work of teachers, principals and students in those schools. They deserve proper funding. More than 40 per cent of students in Northern Territory schools are Indigenous. We heard here in February that the Closing the gap: Prime Minister's report 2017 shows that none of the eight literacy and numeracy targets are on track. The gap will never close without adequate schools funding.


I ask again: how can this policy be needs based when the nation's most disadvantaged school systems, and particularly our schools in the Northern Territory, get the least help? Cutting the funding to the most disadvantaged schools and students with the most need is definitely not fair, not just and is certainly not reasonable. It is such a bad idea that even members of the Turnbull government are sceptical of supporting it. A senator from WA is prepared to cross the floor to vote against it.


But this is not the only cut this government is inflicting on education in the Territory. Federal disability funding to public schools in the Northern Territory will be cut by $10 million next year. Commonwealth funding figures for students with disability loading by state show that the NT's take of $27 million in 2017 will be cut by more than a third, to $17 million, in 2018. The more vulnerable you are, the more education funding the Turnbull government will take away from you. That is the message being given to the people of the Northern Territory. This government is about giving tax cuts to big business while making schoolchildren pay. Investing in schools is smart. What this government is doing is totally the opposite.

  The government welcomes the Australian Law Reform Commission's report. This foundation report was commissioned by the Attorney-General in 2013. Later that year, the coalition became the first major party to go to an election with a specific commitment to take action against elder abuse. Elder abuse may be physical, financial, psychological, sexual or social, and it includes neglect. It often occurs in circumstances in which people are reluctant to report it. It is therefore vital to raise public awareness of elder abuse and options to respond to it. The government supports the motion and welcomes the support of the opposition.

Senator LEYONHJELM:
  I table an explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Bill represents the first step towards removing the ban on the sale of e-cigarettes.


Currently the Commonwealth's Poison Standard has nicotine classified in Schedule 7, which relates to dangerous poisons. Exemptions are provided for a handful of products including products packed and prepared for smoking, such as cigarettes, and nicotine‑containing products for quitting smoking, such as gums and patches. 


The States and Territories rely on the Commonwealth Poison Standard when determining what can and cannot be sold. 


Because the Commonwealth Poison Standard provides an exemption for cigarettes but not e‑cigarettes, the States and Territories allow the sale of cigarettes, but not the sale of e‑cigarettes.


This makes no sense.


There is no evidence that e-cigarettes are remotely as harmful as cigarettes. A report commissioned by Public Health England concluded that e-cigarettes are in fact 95% less harmful.


And there is no evidence that e-cigarettes could lead more people to take up cigarette smoking compared to the number of people who could use e-cigarettes to quit cigarette smoking. What evidence there is suggests that e‑cigarettes would reduce the overall level of cigarette smoking.


Comparable countries around the world have allowed the sale of e-cigarettes. This includes the UK, EU, and the US, and soon Canada and New Zealand will be added to this list.


Right now, Australians are free to purchase e‑cigarettes, as long as they import them from a business overseas. They can't buy them in Australia from an Australian business. This is reverse protectionism. It hurts Australian businesses, misses opportunities to gather tax revenue, and prevents our regulators from regulating the sale of e-cigarettes for the good of consumers.


The bill would change the Commonwealth's Poison Standard so that e-cigarettes were classified in the same way as cigarettes. So whilst cigarettes remain exempted from classification as a dangerous poison in Schedule 7, e‑cigarettes would also be exempted. The bill also clarifies that smoking is distinct from vaping, so that the regulation of smoking at airports and the advertising ban on smoking do not affect vaping. 


The substance of the bill would not commence for twelve months, giving the Commonwealth Government an opportunity to make any regulations for e‑cigarettes within its areas of responsibility, and to start discussions with States and Territories on the treatment of e‑cigarettes in their laws.


This is a modest, sensible and practical bill, and I commend it to the Senate.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-06-19,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:05):  We need to understand why the Japanese pay less for our gas than we do. The Japanese consumer pays less for our gas than the Australian consumer. We need to understand why if we are to do something about it.


In May 2017 the price for gas per unit was, in Tokyo, $7.11; in Sydney, $10.05; in Adelaide; $9.34; in Brisbane, $9.82; and in Melbourne, $9.50. The fact that the Japanese consumer pays less for our gas than we do is even more shocking when you consider their price of $7.11 also includes things we do not pay for like turning the gas into a liquid so it can be shipped, the shipping cost and, finally, the payment of an import duty to the Japanese government.


Another shocking fact is that the Japanese government estimates it will over the next four years make $2.9 billion from the import duty on Australian gas while we make nothing with the exception of a royalty on the North West Shelf Project. Not only does the Japanese consumer pay less than we do for gas, but their government makes more than our government does on Australian gas. What has gone wrong? Can we do anything about it?


I asked myself how it is possible that Australia, as one of the largest exporters of gas in the world, has a gas shortage and the world's highest gas prices. The answer is simple. Firstly, we lack a disclosure regime which would require companies to provide information on average production costs, average sales costs and reserves based on a standard oil price. This means petroleum companies have all the information and the government has only part of the story, making it impossible to develop sound policies. The government and Treasury are overly reliant on what business tells them.


Secondly, we have given away our natural gas resources for peppercorns, with the results that the owners of our gas are foreign-owned multinationals and some Australian companies keep the domestic market just short enough of gas to maximise prices.


Thirdly, we accept a situation where foreign-owned petroleum multinationals pay more in political donations to the major parties than they pay in corporate income tax. In 2015-16 Chevron paid no corporate income tax, but they did manage to pay $53,365 to the Liberal Party and $44,950 to the Labor Party.


Finally, the government is reluctant to address failed policies of the past, because of worries Australia's reputation will be damaged by changing the rules after investment decisions have been made, even though foreign-owned multinationals have breached their social contract with Australia through decades of non-payment of corporate income tax.


The problem is we already have a sovereign risk because our gas and electricity prices are the highest in the developed world, causing loss of competitiveness and jobs. Once we lose manufacturing jobs, we will not get them back. The government needs to decide whether it will choose Australians over foreign-owned multinationals.


We are at a tipping point where high gas prices and uncertainty about gas supply are causing Australian manufacturers like brickworks to import bricks, and they are evaluating whether to move our production offshore—possibly to Malaysia.


The tragedy of high gas prices and shortages is that they could have been prevented. All we needed was good government policy, and I am here to say that it may not be too late, although we will never really see low gas prices again. I want to see a 10 per cent royalty regime put in place on all gas projects where none now exists. In this way, we will see some payment for our gas. I want to see an Australian domestic gas reservation policy introduced, which will mean that 15 per cent of all gas in Commonwealth waters that is not already covered by the Western Australian domestic gas reservation policy be provided to the government at cost price. This will increase the supply of gas in the long term and will lower prices.


We need to build import gas terminals so that we can bring cheap gas from areas of Western Australia to the east coast. I commend the AGL energy company for their feasibility study, which will see the first gas import terminal in Australia. Unfortunately, the gas they plan to import from other countries is cheaper than ours and will not be available until 2021. I ask the government to abandon plans to spend $60 million on unconventional and costly gas in the eastern states and to divert that money to encourage the building of another gas import terminal. In September 2016 the largest floating liquid gas plant and storage facility, Prelude FLNG, moored in Commonwealth waters. It is not too late to require this project to be subject to a domestic gas reserve policy, because they need government approval to anchor in Commonwealth waters. The policy of not ring-fencing Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, PRRT, credits to the exploration project where the expenses were incurred is costing us billions of dollars in revenue. Let's be clear that the mountain of PRRT credits owned by multinationals will mean that no corporate income tax will ever be paid for our offshore gas projects.


It is common knowledge that electricity and gas prices are increasing at a rate beyond the capacity of individuals and businesses to pay. If the government does not intervene in a meaningful way in the next few weeks then the Turnbull government will allow Australia to sleepwalk into recession.


Pensioners cannot continue to pay 11 per cent of their non-discretionary income on gas and electricity. Australians in work cannot manage electricity and gas bills that double from one quarter to the next. I am not interested in clean energy targets. I want gas and electricity prices brought down right now so that Australian businesses can stay in business and so that Australians will have jobs. Small businesses like a fish and chip shop cannot pay $7,000 a quarter for electricity and survive. Small hotels in rural towns cannot pay $17,500-plus a quarter for electricity and keep the doors open. We have a national emergency and drastic measures are required. Nothing is working, including the partnership between industry and government known as AEMO, the Australian Energy Market Operator. It is 60 per cent owned by government and 40 per cent by industry. AEMO has failed Australians and the government stands by and lets it continue. AEMO failed to change the electricity rule when China Light and Power, which owns 30 per cent of Australia's electricity generation, blocked the change from 30 minutes to 5 minutes, which means that Australians pay too much electricity. Once again, the sale of our precious assets to foreigners is costing us dearly. These critical assets should never have been sold and we must stop any future sales.


We face a national emergency. Will the government wait for an energy-policy-induced recession to occur in Australia or will it back now? I will be seeking the support of like-minded crossbench senators to take the necessary action to pull back from disaster. I will be discussing with them a jointly sponsored private senator's bill to enact a domestic gas reserve policy.


We hear it daily from people talking on our radios, people across the country, and just from talking to people in general on the streets: they cannot continue the way they are going. Businesses are shutting. The rising costs of electricity and gas are devastating to a lot of families, pensioners—everyone right across our country. I have sat down with and spoken to Minister Canavan with regard to this. He was enlightened on quite a few issues, because he knew nothing about them.


I think it is important, if we are going to be able to provide gas for all Australians and for industries and manufacturing—because manufacturing consumes about 30 per cent of all gas—that we provide it at a cheap, reliable, affordable price. We need to build more terminals and we need to be able to say: 'You want our gas from WA? You have to give us at least 15 per cent before you can actually ship it out of this country and make more out of it from other countries.'

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-06-19,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:15):  There is a great quote from American newspaperman HL Mencken: 'For every complex problem, there is an answer that is clear, simple and wrong.' And so it has been too often in this chamber in the debate about our energy crisis—because we are facing an energy crisis and we are facing a gas crisis. But, day after day, I have seen senators come into this chamber and point the finger at just one element of the problem. 


The truth is that the energy crisis will not be simple to solve, and the gas crisis will not be simple to solve either. The gas crisis has arisen as a result of complex causes over a number of years. What is needed is strong national leadership to respond to it. Unfortunately, with this challenge, as with so many policy debates, I have very little confidence that this government is going to be able to provide national leadership of that kind, because on energy, more than any other problem, this government seems unable to move beyond shallow, populist bickering towards a serious examination of the genuine policy challenges that face the nation. On energy, more than any other policy question, this government is drawn time and time again to debates and arguments which seek to prosecute a culture war rather than a policy solution. 


Unfortunately, in the last 12 months in particular, we have seen Mr Turnbull, who once styled himself as a rational person, a sensible contributor to the energy debate, leap back to this old and familiar mode of debate from the coalition when it comes to energy. Mr Turnbull's intervention in the energy crisis after the storms which hit South Australia was embarrassing—absolutely embarrassing. For a man who once prided himself on being a sensible contributor to Australia's energy debate to argue, as he was willing to do, that the worst storm ever recorded in South Australia had no role in the blackouts which faced that state but, instead, that those blackouts were a result of state government policy was a shameful and embarrassing contribution to the debate. But it is a contribution that has characterised the approach taken by the coalition at every point, at every opportunity, since.


Australia's gas market is in crisis. Our industry is paying far more than international prices for new gas—upwards of $20 per gigajoule, whereas it is just $8 per gigajoule internationally. It is not just a question of the cost of supply; there are some industrial consumers reporting they are unable to access gas at all, and this will have real consequences for Australian industry and consumers. It has impacts on the retail energy market. It is impacting not only energy prices and security today but also the viability of new gas-fired power stations. If someone were seeking to develop a new gas-fired power station today, they would have real doubts about their ability to secure long-term supplies at a reasonable price. There are many incentives, as Dr Finkel has documented, for gas plants to run on a peaking basis only, and that is impacting on the average price of electricity in the NEM. 


There are manufacturing processes which can only take place if gas is available as a feedstock. There is no substitute; unlike the NEM, there are no alternatives. We have been hearing cases of even large manufacturing companies being unable to get the supplies that they need. The chair of our competition watchdog, Mr Rod Sims, has said that this is now a worst-case scenario. He said:


I do think companies will go out of business because of this and I think that will be a crying shame.


There have been simplistic suggestions that the root cause of all of this has been some of the restrictions that have been placed on gas exploration at a state government level. As I have indicated, I think this is overly simplistic, but it is difficult to talk about gas without talking about the conflicts that have arisen in the past decade between landholders and resource developers. 


It is probably fair to say that many stakeholders who were seeking to develop their gas resources would have handled things very differently if they could have their time again. Ventures that are wishing to develop these resources need to engage seriously with both landholders and local communities. There needs to be a serious conversation about a fair return in exchange for access and there needs to be a serious conversation grounded in data about the risks that are presented to their assets and the impacts that developments may have. There needs to be a satisfactory resolution of the conflicts that have arisen between landholders and resource developers. But, in any case, allowing wholesale development of fracking would not solve this problem. We would not be able to get the resources on line in time and, in any case, this is not a simple supply problem. 


We are producing a lot of gas. Australia is presently the world's second-largest LNG exporter, and it is expected to become the largest exporter by 2020. This has come about because our suppliers are overextended. They are diverting gas from domestic markets in order to fulfil overseas contracts. In the eastern markets, we have gone from using approximately 700 petajoules a year to needing about 2,200 petajoules a year, and this is largely because of the huge export operations that are running out of Queensland. These operations entered into long-term overseas contracts as part of building a bankable case for the export facilities, but new ventures have not been able to produce sufficient gas to fulfil these obligations. They are buying gas that would otherwise have been used to supply the domestic market. This was not what was anticipated when these projects were first put forward. The environmental impact statement, for example, for the Santos project says: 


The project ... is not diverting gas from local markets to export markets ... the project has no direct implications for domestic prices.


That same venture now relies on third party gas from the domestic gas market for 60 per cent of its exports. 


The situation has been worsened by the uncompetitive arrangements in some parts of the eastern gas market. The ACCC conducted its review into the east coast gas market and released its report early last year, and the problems it identified are still in place. Transparent contracts remain the exception, not the rule. The Finkel review observed that no-one can really say what the current market price is, because there is no visibility on the contracting arrangements. There are issues with pipelines and networks. The ACCC said:


Pipeline pricing exacerbates the effect of supply tightness on wholesale gas prices. There are currently very few constraints on monopoly pricing by pipeline operators.


These are serious structural problems in the market and none of these factors is particularly new. This crisis should not have taken government by surprise, yet, as with so many things in the energy sector, they seem to have been taken by surprise—caught on the hop. The ACCC reported last year. Labor has been calling for action for years. At our last national conference back in 2015, we adopted a gas export national interest test. That test would commit a future Labor government to ensure that Australian suppliers would not be hurt by the LNG export industry. 


So this has all been on the table. It has all been known. These problems have been understood for some time, and yet we have from this government almost no response. We have the complete pretence that, through a casual conversation between the Prime Minister and some of the market participants, it would be able to resolve this. Well, nothing came of that—nothing at all. We now find ourselves with a domestic gas security mechanism proposed by the government that will be delayed in its implementation and that seems to have many features that suggest it will be fairly ineffective in responding to the problems that confront us now. My great concern is that the division within the government on this and the broader energy market will make it unable to respond to the crisis.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-06-19,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:25):  Following on from Senator McAllister and her comment about, 'Labor saw this in 2015 and we are going to do this and we are going to do that': I wonder if Senator McAllister has spoken to the Victorian Premier, Mr Andrews, who has put a total ban on all sorts of conventional and more modern ways of gas extraction?



Senator McAllister interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  They have. They have put a total ban on it. That is a fact. That is the way Victoria is treated under a Labor government: cut off the tap, cut off the exploration, do not do anything and all will be right, mate. Well, no, it will not, Mr Andrews—no, it will not. 


Why is Japan buying gas cheaper than Australia? That is a very good question. It all comes down to two things: demand and supply. In 2009 the then Labor government approved the construction of three LNG gas plants in Gladstone for export. I repeat: for export. Australia is now the world's second largest exporter of LNG behind Qatar, providing approximately 12 per cent of the world's gas. It is expected to become the world's largest exporter by 2020. The development of the gas export market has meant Australian producers have had to compete with overseas buyers. Australian gas prices have also risen because gas production is becoming more expensive and because of the reduction in supply due to moratoriums—by, as I said, Victoria, the we-will-not-produce-gas state. You would think at this time of the year you would want a bit of heating and cooking gas down there!


Respected independent industry expert EnergyQuest continues to report:


While the gas contract prices paid by most east coast gas buyers continue to be well below LNG prices, short-term gas prices have increased significantly.


International comparisons are not simple. Much of the public commentary about local and international gas prices does not provide an apples-for-apples comparison. Misleading commentary has been happening for a long time and is usually produced by anti-fossil fuel activists or parts of the manufacturing lobby. Critics usually compare landed spot LNG prices with Japan with delivered contract gas prices in eastern Australia. I will repeat that: critics usually compare landed spot LNG prices in Japan with delivered contract gas prices in eastern Australia. However, there is really no comparison between the short-term spot price of an LNG cargo and a long-term contract with guaranteed supply and prices. 


The LNG spot market in Japan is a global market with possible supply from up to 18 LNG exporting countries. In other words, when Japan sets its gas price, they have up to 18 countries exporting gas to Japan. Unlike eastern Australia, the global LNG market was oversupplied, so prices have been depressed—although they are now rising again. By comparison, the east coast spot market is a purely local market that lacks the liquidity and scale of Japan. It is essentially a day-to-day balancing market. Its prices reflect whatever relatively small quantities of gas are available on a given day. That is important. As such the spot price is not a good guide for long-term contract prices. 


Commercial and industrial users do not rely on the spot market to meet their ongoing gas requirements. The average price of landed—not delivered—spot LNG imported into Japan, contracted in May 2017, is AU$7.50 per gigajoule. Looking at the east coast spot price for gas delivered to the relevant capital city today, the prices are: $9.33 per gigajoule in Sydney, $8.69 per gigajoule in Adelaide, $7.24 per gigajoule in Brisbane and $10 per gigajoule in Victoria—the declared market. These prices include pipeline transportation costs, which are a focus of the Commonwealth led reform to lower pipeline costs. That is very important. To get the gas to the consumer, we need efficient pipelines and a reduction in costs there. 


The best way to ensure affordable and reliable gas for the domestic market is to increase gas supply, including from unconventional gas sources and improved gas market competition, transparency and operation. I want to focus on the unconventional gas sources—that is fine, but make sure we look after the environment. We have had a big argument in many regional areas of New South Wales and Queensland about coal seam gas. We in the National Party, along with our Liberal colleagues, have said, 'Make sure there is no interference with underground water, look after the environment and abide by the science and the EPAs of each state to see that it is all done correctly.'


In March 2017 the Australian Energy Market Operator released its 2017 Gas Statement of Opportunities, which drew attention to the domestic gas market's tightness and forecast shortfalls of between 10 petajoules per annum and 54 petajoules per annum in the residential, commercial and/or industrial sectors from 2019 to 2020 for New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In response to potential shortfalls of domestic gas supplies, Prime Minister Turnbull held urgent meetings with gas producers. Following these meetings the Prime Minister acted decisively and, on 27 April, announced the introduction of the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism, the ADGSM. 


Given the abundance of gas resources, Australians expect to have their gas needs met. It is unacceptable for Australia to become the world's largest exporter of LNG but not have enough to meet the gas needs of Australian households and business. The ADGSM takes effect from 1 July. I commend the Prime Minister for saying simply this: we are a huge producer of gas, but why export it all and leave a shortfall here for our domestic consumption? That is crazy. The ADGSM takes effect on 1 July. It will apply across all LNG producers and operates alongside other key gas market reforms underway, including the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's gas market transparency work and the peak supply guarantee given by gas producers. 


The ADGSM is a targeted and temporary measure of last resort designed to restrict LNG exports in the event that supplies are unable to satisfy domestic market needs here. In other words, this is a government intervention saying that if the market is failing here because of multiple reasons, such as the Labor government in Victoria, then it is time for the government to intervene. Any restrictions or offset requirements would only be placed on export operations that are, in effect, drawing down supply in net terms from the domestic gas market. LNG companies required to operate under restrictions will have flexibility to find commercial solutions that meet their domestic market responsibilities, such as swapping cargoes out of portfolios or on the spot market. All LNG companies will be treated the same. 


The exposure draft of the mechanism was released on 5 June 2017. The government is in the process of considering feedback from states and territories, gas producers, exporters and consumers, including large industrial gas users, before finalising regulations and guidelines. The government continues to strongly support the ongoing operation of Australia's world-class LNG industry and acknowledges the industry's commitment to work collaboratively on this issue of national significance.


As I said, it is about supply and demand. The MPI under discussion refers to Japan. There are some 18 countries competing for the market in Japan—lots of competition—hence their price is cheaper than ours. Several years ago I went to Narrabri to inspect the Santos project. They were under exploration. They had the gas coming out of the ground. It was flared out of a pipe. It was just being burnt into the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, because under state law they cannot flick a switch, turn on the gas-fired generator in Narrabri and power 300 houses. Instead, the gas is just flared out of the pipe and burns into the atmosphere and is wasted. That to me is a terrible waste, and that needs to change. 


Here we are, swimming in gas in Australia—we have heaps of resources. Down the east coast we have enough gas resources to power a city with a population of a million people for over 5,000 years. So, no matter what type of gas extraction we use, we need to do it properly, look after the environment and see to Australia's needs—because this gas actually belongs to the people. Under the state collection royalties, it is owned by the Crown. The people own the gas. To see a shortfall here in Australia is crazy.


I commend Mr Turnbull and his leadership for intervening in the market and saying: 'We're not just going to export it all overseas and leave a shortfall here. We need to take action to see that we have a big enough supply here so that all Australians have ample gas to get us through our wintertime, for cooking, for our motor vehicle needs or whatever.' I think it is a case of good government that we have intervened to ensure that we keep enough gas supply here until more supply is brought on the market here. It will no doubt reduce the price as well.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-06-19,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:35):  Acting Deputy President Reynolds. I happened to be over in your home state of Western Australia only a few weeks ago for a very important Senate inquiry which I initiated into the petroleum resource rent tax. That particular day—Senator Smith put in an appearance, if I remember rightly—we had some of the CEOs of the biggest oil companies in the world, operating out of Australia, come and give evidence on why they do not want the petroleum resource rent tax changed. You were also there, Senator Reynolds, I understand.


What was interesting about that day was two other things that happened that morning. The first thing that happened was the government released its own internal review into the petroleum resource rent tax at the exact time—9 am—that the Senate inquiry began. So none of us had time to read the government's review. Nevertheless, we had good evidence from companies. The second thing that happened was that the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, released the concept that he may have some kind of gas reserve or gas price here. What did the big petroleum companies do, both in the media and at the inquiry? They screamed blue murder. Why? It is simple: they do not like being told by the government what they should and should not do. They have not had a government interfering in their business in this country for many decades now.


Let me give you a good example. The petroleum resource rent tax came in in the 1980s. It was a tax designed essentially for petroleum products. Pretty much the only people that pay it in this country now are BHP and the international subsidiaries of multinationals that operate in Bass Strait. Although it was designed for petroleum products, it is mostly applied now to big LNG projects, the massive projects off the North West Shelf in Western Australia. Because it is so incredibly generous in the concessions that it gives these big companies, each year they get to compound all their exploration expenditure at 15 per cent plus the bond rate and every dollar of their operations expenditure at five per cent plus the bond rate. The situation we have in this country now is that $238 billion of tax credits are sitting amongst the big petroleum companies, so they do not want to change the petroleum resource rent tax.


Why is the government not stepping in and saying: 'That is a massive source of revenue. All we need to do is tweak those uplift rates and we'll bring in tens of billions of dollars'? This is the punchline: the government—and it is not just yours, Acting Deputy President; it is previous governments as well—are only interested in two things, and this applies directly to the gas policy here in this country. The first thing they are interested in is investment and the raw dollars they are bringing in investment into this country because it helps to balance the payments and the current account figures. Of course, that contributes to GDP growth, so those big numbers are important. Secondly, they are interested in jobs. They are interested in jobs that are attached to these investments. Are they interested in getting the taxpayer of Australia a good return on the resources that we essentially give to these companies? No, they are not.


So I ask the question: why are not we getting a bang for our buck? We are selling the gas, the oil, the condensate and the other products to these big multinational companies, right? That is what a royalty is. Incorrect. Under the PRRT, they have now clocked up $238 billion of tax credits. That means that the $238 billion of revenue that they may earn in the future they will not have to pay tax on because of these extremely generous concessions that have been in place now for decades.


But no-one wants to change them, because governments are interested in only two things: investment numbers in the current account and jobs. Well, if we actually took a far-sighted view or policy prescription we would say, 'No, we need a fair return as well on the resources that are owned by Australian people, and we need a fair policy for our domestic gas markets.' But that would require courage from the government to actually take these people on, and that is not something I have seen from the big parties since I have been in politics. On top of that, we have these layers of trade deals that make it extremely difficult for government to be discriminatory at all against foreign producers.


In fact, it attracts state-to-state dispute settlements as well as investor-state dispute settlements. Even in my home state of Tasmania, there was a furore when the price of rock lobsters went to over $100 a kilo because they were all being exported. Suddenly all the local restaurants and local punters had to pay that kind of money for their own rock lobsters. So, it is not just gas. This is the global world that we live in, and if the free market is our religion and our ideology then we are never going to change any of this. So, I think the government needs to be pushed and actually look at this, much more importantly, from a long-term perspective— (Time expired)

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-06-19,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:40):  The export gas industry in Queensland has really driven economic growth over the past decade. We have seen particularly in Gladstone the development of export facilities by a number of companies that have created thousands of jobs in that area and economic opportunity for the region. Since those facilities came into operation they have employed substantially fewer people than they did during the construction phase. That has also been the case in the downstream operations, largely in western Queensland, where they benefited from some booming economic activity during the construction phase.


It concerns me, having spent time in Gladstone and having seen what it was like while these facilities were booming, that some of these facilities have gone from employing a couple of thousand people to now fewer than 200. You get a sense of the economic downturn that has occurred as a result of these production facilities moving into operation. But we also are seeing a flow-on effect from these export contracts that have been signed to justify the development of these facilities. We are seeing a domestic shortage that is impacting on industry and affecting jobs. That is of significant concern to me.


I would like to acknowledge the contribution of Senator McAllister, who gave a very thoughtful analysis of the situation and also provided some solutions to the challenge we face. For me this debate highlights a couple of issues. One is the hypocrisy of Senator Hanson on this issue. I will deal with that in a bit more detail later, but I will just say that Senator Hanson is happy to say one thing in this chamber but another thing when she is in western Queensland and in communities that are being impacted by coal seam gas exploration.


This debate also highlights the emerging energy crisis we are seeing from the Turnbull government. They have no idea how to address it. We have seen no substantial response from this government to the Finkel review, which was delivered more than a week ago now, other than continued discussion and debate, which they are actually trying to pass off as business-like. Well, that is a different business meeting than any that I have ever been involved with, with the screaming match that has been reported in relation to former Prime Minister Abbott and one of his opponents. But we have also seen inconsistency from them over a number of months when it comes to the domestic gas issue. As recently as 6 March this year Senator Canavan was arguing against a gas reservation policy to alleviate the cost pressures in the domestic gas market. He was quoted as saying, about gas reservation:


I think they'd be a band aid solution which would be unlikely to be effective in the short term, and would be quite damaging in the long term. Let's hope we don't get there.


But less than two months later, on 27 April, we saw Prime Minister Turnbull announcing an Australian domestic gas security mechanism. To quote from his media release:


The Turnbull Government will secure domestic gas supply with the introduction of export restrictions to ensure the Australian market has adequate supplies before exports are permitted.


In their words, this government is applying bandaid solutions which they say can actually be quite damaging in the long term. 


Industry needs certainty and not knee-jerk crisis summits and constantly changing policy from those opposite. Again, as we have seen over the last two weeks in the response to the Finkel review that was handed down, the Abbott-Turnbull 'war', that is at the heart of this government, has led to policy paralysis on energy issues and also on gas. The government is responsible for the parlous state of the electricity sector and emissions policy in this country. Wholesale power prices have doubled under the Turnbull government and retail prices are shooting up due to investment uncertainty being fuelled by this government. What we have seen is the triple whammy under this government: power prices are up, pollution is up and jobs are down. That will be the lasting legacy of this government. It is more interested in internal party politics than governing and creating solutions to this issue which will affect jobs across Australia. 


It is important to reiterate the Labor policy on gas. Labor have been warning about the problems in the gas market for many years. Since 2015, we have advocated a gas export national interest test, and through 2017 we have been warning that more drastic measures were needed to address the short-term crisis that the Turnbull government has let develop under its watch. The government's policies on gas are not enough to secure supply certainty, reduce power prices and protect jobs for the long term. I believe that the gas shortage is going to get worse before it gets better. 


Labor has been urging the government to copy our policies and to adopt them, which are: a permanent national interest test for the gas market so that Australian businesses and households are at the front of the queue; establishment of a domestic gas review board to consider whether any new gas export facility or proposal to expand an existing one would meet Australia's national interest; and requiring foreign companies to say how much gas they plan to make available for local manufacturers and households. Indeed, my own union, the Australian Workers' Union, have been advocates for a domestic reservation policy for a number of years. I think their stance on this has been vindicated, unfortunately, by what we have seen over the last couple of months. 


What this motion also highlights, and what Senator Hanson's speech highlighted, is that One Nation will continue to sit on both sides of the fence when it comes to energy and coal seam gas. They hypocritically call for cheaper energy, yet also oppose coal seam gas exploration at the same time—they clearly want to have their cake and eat it too. One Nation's policy states—and this is directly from their website: 


One Nation opposes CSG Mining until there is substantial evidence that it does not affect people's health, the environment, our farming and water. 


Yet, here today, they are complaining about the price of gas that CSG mining creates. You would have to ask: where do they think the gas comes from? 


We also know of a topic that has substantial evidence that it does 'affect people's health, the environment, our farming community and water'. It is, of course, climate change. But One Nation do not care about that. It is CSG that they have focused on. Senator Hanson has had many different views on coal seam gas, even just in the last three years. It really depends on which parliament she is running for. In an article titled 'Hanson to lead One Nation against Lockyer CSG', on 16 December 2014, then candidate for the state seat of Lockyer Pauline Hanson argued against coal seam gas mining. The article says: 


Pauline Hanson has declared for the seat of Lockyer in the 2015 Queensland election saying she would fight for the farmers and against coal seam gas.


Ms Hanson, who returned recently to lead the One Nation party, made the announcement at a Crowley Vale farm in the electorate saying she was prepared to ""go in all guns blazing.""


This is the hypocrisy that we see from Senator Hanson on this issue: three years ago campaigning against this, ramping up community concerns about exploration, and now coming in here and bemoaning that it is being sold too cheaply overseas. While you cannot ignore the need for more exploration—sure it is not the most important issue in this debate—increasing gas exploration is one that is important if we are to see more supply to the domestic market. 


Then we have to look at Senator Roberts. I daresay a conversation between Senator Roberts and Senator Hanson on this issue would be quite an exciting one. Senator Roberts has said that when it comes to the Finkel review 'the only priority should be making energy as cheap and reliable as possible'. Then we see Senator Roberts responding to Josh Frydenberg on energy prices: 


Josh, the cause of power prices soaring is government intervention. The solution is not more government intervention.


You cannot get a consistent line from One Nation on this important issue. A tweet from Senator Roberts on 8 February this year condemns the 'gutless Victorian Liberals' who 'want to ban gas drilling'. He is happy to target the Victorian Liberals on this issue but ignores the concerns that Senator Hanson has expressed. I think it should make for an interesting party room discussion between Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts. One Nation needs to get some consistency on this important issue. But once again it just shows how out of touch One Nation are. This is an important issue to Queenslanders and Australians. Jobs are at stake. They need a consistent line on it.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:51):  It is always interesting to hear what the Labor Party might do, what they might talk about. We have heard what the Labor Party's policy was in 2015 and 2017. In both years they were in opposition and they could not do anything. But what the previous speaker forgot to mention was the Labor Party policy in 2009. That was the time when the Labor government approved the construction of three LNG plants in Gladstone for export. In 2015, and now in 2017, they talk from opposition—when they do not have to do anything—about other policies. But if you go back to when they were in government and could do something about it, were they doing what the Labor Party is now talking about? No. They were issuing licenses for LNG plants for export only. The problems that the previous speaker and other Labor speakers have identified is really one of the Labor Party's own making. It is so typical of the ALP. They have all these wonderful suggestions and great policy ideas now that they are in opposition and do not have to deliver. But, when they had the ability to do it, what did they do? They issued licenses for export only. Perhaps, if there are other speakers in this debate, they might address this. 


The potential shortfalls of domestic gas have been addressed by the Prime Minister. As most senators know, the Prime Minister held urgent meetings with the gas producers to try and resolve the issue without the government intervening. The Prime Minister then acted very decisively on 27 April and announced the introduction of Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism. Given the abundance of gas resources in Australia, Australians do expect to have their gas needs met; notwithstanding that the Labor government had licensed these gas producers for export only. It is unacceptable for Australia to become the world's largest exporter of LNG but not have enough gas to meet Australian households and businesses. The mechanism takes effect from 1 July. It will apply across all LNG producers and will operate alongside other key gas market reforms currently underway, including the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission gas market transparency work and the peak supply guarantee given by gas producers. 


It is a targeted and temporary measure of last resort and is designed to restrict LNG exports in the event that supply is unable to meet domestic market need. Any restriction or offset requirements would only be placed on export operations that are in effect drawing down supply in net terms from the domestic gas market. LNG companies required to operate under restrictions will have flexibility to find commercial solutions that meet their domestic market responsibilities, such as swapping cargoes out of portfolios or on the spot market. All LNG companies will be treated the same.


As senators know, the exposure draft of the mechanism was released on 5 June, and the government is currently in the process of considering feedback from states, territories, gas producers, exporters and consumers, including the large industrial gas users, before finalising the regulations and guidelines. Hopefully, that will address the subject of this debate on why gas is more expensive in Australia than it is in Japan. Of course, it is a bit simplistic to compare one with the other. As Senator Williams pointed out, you must compare apples with apples in this debate, and I am not sure the debate as proposed does that.


I was interested in the previous speaker's comments about the union that supports the gas workers—the AWU, I thought he said. They have been in favour of some domestic gas regulation for some time. I wonder why the AWU did not make that a condition of the money—the huge donation—they gave to Mr Bill Shorten when they got the money from the industry super funds. Remember the $53 million they got from the Australian super funds? That was the retirement nest-eggs of mums and dads and these super funds gave it to the AWU, which in turn passed it on to the Labor Party in a much publicised event in which the AWU gave that money to Mr Bill Shorten. If the AWU were worried about domestic gas reliability, perhaps when they initially gave the large sums of money to Mr Shorten for his election campaign they should have made it a condition that the Labor Party would do something about the gas market when they were in government. It is okay to say anything when you are in opposition, but take a look at what they did when in government.


This whole debate, of course, is about cheaper electricity—cheap power. Australians simply cannot afford the sort of luxury that you see in Victoria, where the Victorian government—the Labor government there—with oodles of gas sitting under the ground has banned even exploring for gas. That sort of thing does push up the prices. As Senator Williams said before me in this debate, it is a matter of supply and demand. If you cut off the supply, obviously the prices go up, and Labor governments in Victoria are cutting off the supply by stopping even exploration for gas. In Australia we used to be so lucky, because, of all of the nations in the world, we had the best reserves of high-quality coal, and we used to use them during the forties, fifties and sixties to produce cheap power, which I know for certain brought one Korean zinc company to Australia to manufacture their zinc here. Why? Because we had the cheapest form of power. It was reliable. It was always there. It was good quality coal. We were fortunate as a nation to have that high-quality coal. But we have the Labor Party running around with their mates in the Greens saying that 'coal' is a dirty word—that we cannot have it. I am delighted that, first of all, we have an unexpected ally in Dr Bob Brown, the former leader of the Greens political party, who said that the coal-fired thermal power was the best centralised option we have. I do not often agree with Dr Bob Brown, but I certainly think he was on the mark when he made that very forthright and forward-thinking comment.


I come from a part of Queensland where there are unlimited quantities of high-quality black coal. What needs to happen for Australia—for all those people who cannot afford electricity at the rate we are going in Australia because of Labor-Greens policies over the years—is that we need to get that coal out of the ground and use it to create cheap power for Australians. We are exporting it to other countries, including Japan. That might answer the question of why Japan has cheaper electricity prices than Australia—because they are using Australian black coal to create power that is very inexpensive, comparatively. What we need to do is start using that coal resource we have. Think of the jobs it would create for the miners. I can never understand why the CFMEU is so opposed to it. They have clearly become ideological, rather than being about looking after the jobs of their workers. 


I am delighted to see that Mr Tim Nicholls, the leader of the Liberal National Party in the Queensland parliament, made a firm commitment just last week to have, within 100 days of his election as Premier, a coal-fired power station, finally, with all of its approvals and hopefully based somewhere in the north of Queensland. I look forward to that. I know the Labor mayor of Townsville, Councillor Jenny Hill, joins me in welcoming that initiative. It will be great for the north, it will be great for Australia, and the sooner it happens the better. I wish the LNP leader in Queensland, Tim Nicholls, all the very best in his campaign and urge him to bring cheap electricity to my constituents in the state of Queensland.

If high gas prices are not addressed immediately, we will see a tsunami of job losses not just in my home state but across the nation. That is why, during the March negotiations for the enterprise tax plan bill, I negotiated a number of gas measures aimed at reducing prices. I want to talk about one of these measures, the restriction of gas exports. 


As mentioned by Senator Williams, the government is in the final stages of introducing an Australian domestic gas security mechanism, which empowers the minister for resources to restrict exports to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of natural gas for the Australian domestic market. A 2016 ACCC inquiry into the east coast gas market found that we have a distorted gas supply market and 'evidence of monopoly pricing' in gas transport. In that environment, we will not achieve reasonable prices by simply ensuring there is sufficient supply. In these circumstances, we need to ensure that there is an oversupply to counter the monopoly factors at play.


The draft regulations do not go far enough to ensure that we can achieve a domestic price which is comparable to or better than the Japanese long-term contract rate. The regulations must be amended to ensure that affordability, not just supply security, is a formal consideration. We cannot afford to tread softly. That time has well and truly passed, and on any test—a pub test, a national interest test, an economic benefit test—it is simply wrong and unsustainable that the price of Australian gas in Japan is actually half the price of Australian gas being sold here in Australia. We must address this as a matter of the utmost urgency.

Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:03):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia I rise to speak to the matter of public importance proposed by Senator Hanson. Look at the crocodile tears flowing in this chamber! There is only one party that is the party of cheap energy, and that is Pauline Hanson's One Nation. Currently, Australian consumers actually pay around 60 per cent more for our own gas than Japanese customers do in Japan. This is doubly difficult to understand, as, in order to be exported, Australian gas first has to be liquefied; that should increase the price by around 25 per cent. It is fine to hear Senator Xenophon, the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, and the Greens especially, talking about energy prices, but they caused this.


Coming back to gas, just like runaway power costs, Australian working families are being ripped off with sky-high gas prices due to overregulation forcing a decrease in supply and an increase in prices. Regulation also decreases competition, which leads to overcharging by a cartel of Santos, Origin and BHP. With less regulation, though, customers would pay less and companies would earn more. Further costs are being added by the quasi-monopoly control of gas transmission pipelines, mainly by the APA Group, which, from looking at a map, controls around 95 per cent of the gas pipelines in this country. Their return on equity for some pipelines is as high as 159 per cent—enabled by government regulation. No wonder they call Australia 'treasure island'. Why does this situation occur? Maybe it is because instead of tax, gas cartel members pay political donations to the major parties, as Senator Hanson itemised. 


We need to remove restrictions on supply and demand. That would encourage efficiency. As Senator Hanson has said, we clearly need to allow companies to build gas import terminals, including revaporising plants, on the east coast, to allow us to transport our own gas around the continent and then return it to domestic consumption. Transport costs from Western Australia to the east coast would be around 70c per gigajoule, and revaporising costs would be around 75c per gigajoule. This would allow us to import gas which is currently selling for less than $4 a gigajoule, in comparison to the Sydney spot price now of $10. 


The impact on our economy and living standards of runaway gas prices cannot be overstated. On top of the spiralling electricity prices created by the obsession with expensive, unreliable, intermittent wind and solar power, the current failed policies of the government, the opposition, the Greens and the Xenophon party must be changed as a matter of urgency before our economic growth grinds to a halt. Only One Nation is the party of cheap energy—Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (17:07):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Today, I introduce a Bill to amend the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (`GST law') to give effect to changes that were announced by the Hon Kelly O'Dwyer MP, Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, on 31 March 2017.


The Bill provides that entities buying gold, silver and platinum that have been supplied as a taxable supply for GST purposes will be required to apply a reverse charge. This means they will remit the GST to the ATO instead of the seller remitting GST.


In addition the Bill clarifies that precious metals are not second hand goods.


These changes will negate two types of avoidance activity by entities exploiting the different tax treatment applying to 'precious metals' and 'scrap metals.'


Precious metals are gold, silver, platinum and other prescribed metals meeting particular investment form and fineness requirements.


Generally, a supply of precious metals is not taxable, whereas a supply of scrap metals will be a taxable supply under the GST rules.


However, precious metals can be altered to turn them into scrap metals, for example by removing logos or brand markings, or chopping the metal so that it is no longer in investment form.


The first type of avoidance activity involves entities altering precious metals to turn them into scrap metals. On sale of the scrap metal, GST would be charged. However, the seller would go missing without having remitted the GST to the ATO, and the purchaser would still claim an input tax credit on their purchase.


To address the 'missing trader' scheme, the Bill applies a reverse charge to supplies involving these metals which ensures the purchaser becomes responsible for remitting the GST to the ATO. This removes the opportunity for the seller to keep the GST and go 'missing'.


The second type of avoidance activity involves entities altering precious metals to turn them into scrap metals, so they are treated as second-hand goods. The GST law allows entities to claim input tax credits for second-hand goods bought from the public, with the policy rationale that GST is embedded in the price when dealers purchase these goods.


However, scrap metals, broken jewellery and other items that are bought and later sold to refiners for their valuable metal content are very unlikely to have any GST embedded in the price.


Allowing an input tax credit in such situations is not consistent with the policy underpinning the second-hand goods rules.


The Bill clarifies the law to ensure it operates as intended and this avoidance, and at times fraudulent, activity is stopped.


The Bill will have effect from 1 April 2017, as announced.


To make sure this activity does not simply shift from gold to other metals, the amendments also apply to goods containing silver, platinum or other metals that may be prescribed.


The Government is committed to protecting the integrity of the tax system. By making these changes to the GST treatment of precious metals, the Government is securing necessary funds for States and Territories that provide crucial services such as hospitals and schools that Australians rely on.


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.




Senator PAYNE:
  I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (21:57):  I rise this evening to reflect on the fantastic work done in my home state of Victoria, specifically in Ballarat. As a senator for Victoria, it is an honour to represent the hardworking people of the Greater Ballarat shire as they shine in the state's sporting competitions, inspire cultural events in rural areas and drive economic growth in their communities.


But firstly I would like to thank two people who have interned in my office for the last eight weeks. They have both had input into this adjournment speech. Claudia and Finn, I would like to thank you for your good attitudes and your tremendous hard work. I have really appreciated your company and your good humour over the last eight weeks and I wish you all the best for the future. Go Pies!


I would like to begin by applauding the Ballarat Miners on their win over the weekend in the South East Australian Basketball League competition. It was tremendous news this morning to hear of the solid effort by the team to overcome the Hobart Chargers, with particular mention going to Mr Craig Moller for his impressive contribution of 26 points. This very impressive performance by Mr Moller and his team saw the Miners defeat their southern counterparts, the Hobart Chargers, by just five points. I must admit that I enjoyed holding this over my parliamentary colleague from Tasmania Senator Duniam at dinner tonight!


The efforts of the Ballarat Miners over the weekend and in the previous nine games throughout the competition are a reflection of the hard work that has been put in by the people of Ballarat and the rewards that the region enjoys from it. Ballarat's basketballers are not the only sporting stars from the weekend. The Sebastopol Vikings are celebrating after beating the Melton Phoenix 2-zip—very impressive—this Saturday, as are Ballarat City for their proud win of 4-nil in the National Premier League. Sport is evidently alive and well in the great city of Ballarat.


However, it seems that the great athletes of Ballarat are to share their sporting prowess with the rest of the world over the coming months. I was ecstatic to hear that both the Mount Clear College and St Patrick's College of Ballarat have secured the opportunity to host two international teams for this year's international AFL match. This August these two great schools will play host to teams from both Japan and China as they visit Australia once again to fight out the battle for the global title in AFL. The international visit will deliver an enormous benefit to local communities as fans from across the state, from across the country and now from across the world descend on the beautiful city of Ballarat. This is the second time that Ballarat has had the amazing opportunity to host the international competition, and I know that the businesses and the people of Ballarat will not disappoint with their hospitality. 


But of course sport is not the only domain that the people of Ballarat are excelling in. This year our marvellous sheep farmers in the Ballarat region have enjoyed some of the strongest prices seen since July last year, with lamb prices recorded as high as $240 a head. Not long ago these prices were half as low as that. I can assure you that Ballarat's farming families, such as the Mahers of Springbank, who were fortunate enough just last Saturday to capitalise on such strong returns, and the Frawleys of Leigh Creek, who last month boasted an even higher return of $250 a head, are thoroughly thrilled by the prices rewarding Ballarat's farmers. This is at the same time that Ballarat wool producers have seen prices increase more than 25 per cent in just the last six months. Our crop growers have enjoyed much-needed rain and our cattle producers have seen prices bounce back up in the last six months to almost 700c a kilogram. Returns like these and those received across much of Victoria are reflective of the great times ahead for Australian agriculture. I cannot begin to explain how thrilled I am to see the farmers in this very special region, this great part of Victoria—and indeed all of Victoria—feel some of those benefits. 


This prosperity is evident in Ballarat's thriving arts scene also. Just in the last three months Ballarat have had acclaimed pianists, an a capella group and artists from all over the world descend on Ballarat for a number of exhibitions and showcases. I would like to thank Caroline Almonte for her exquisite piece at the Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts last month and also the VOX capella group for their performances throughout Ballarat. Performers like these are examples of the phenomenal talent that exists within the region of Ballarat, and where better to showcase them than in the beautiful community halls this tremendous region has to offer. So it gives me great pride to represent such accomplished people and to share with you their amazing achievements. I thank the chamber for its indulgence.
