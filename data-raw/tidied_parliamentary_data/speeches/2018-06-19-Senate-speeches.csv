Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:02):  Last night, we were finishing up the issue of 'funder of last resort'. Can the minister provide any further information around the issue of defunct organisations, where the government isn't equally responsible? Has there been any further clarification overnight of how the 93 per cent figure was arrived at? Is there any confirmation of whether those survivors that were in one of those defunct institutions will or won't be covered?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:03):  I'm advised that the figure that's been used by the minister is a derived figure. I refer you to a document entitled Final information update: during our five-year inquiry. I'm not sure, Senator Siewert, if you have that document. In that document, there's a chart headed 'Proportion of survivors who told us they were abused in a religious institution'. When you look at that chart, you can see a breakdown, and I am advised that that chart assisted the minister and informed him in relation to that figure.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:04):  Not all survivors were abused in religious institutions and, in fact, I think it's likely that some of the survivors in defunct institutions will actually be in non-religious institutions. That's why I want to pursue this a bit further, to find out for those beyond non-religious institutions. I tried to ask this last night: are those survivors that were in defunct institutions, where the government doesn't have responsibility, not going to have access to redress?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:06):  Senator Siewert, it goes to the point that I was making yesterday evening. Until someone makes an application—let me just assume for a moment they say 'organisation X', and we don't know if organisation X is genuinely defunct. It's possible that organisation X may have transferred some of its property. It may be that there is a corporate structure associated with institution X that requires delving into with an examination. That was the point that I was making yesterday evening, Senator Siewert. I know the point that you're trying to make and I'm trying to assist you, but unless somebody comes out and says, 'This is my claim against this particular—'




Senator Pratt:
  You just don't want to fess up as to whether you're prepared to be a funder of last resort or not.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Pratt, I'll take that interjection. You have to have an application by somebody to be able to ascertain the legal framework of that particular organisation. It's a pretty simple concept.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,"<title>National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018</title>",BILLS,2,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:07):  I do understand what the minister is saying in terms of an application. I'm trying to get to the principle here, which is what Senator Pratt was just referring to. Under these provisions—because of the way the national bill has been reworded and because there's no participating government that is equally responsible if people were abused in an organisation that is defunct—there is a bottom line which means that there are potentially survivors who will not be able to access redress because there is no ultimate funder of last resort. That's what I'm trying to articulate, and to find out from government if that is a correct understanding, whether or not someone's applied. Surely, in drafting this bill, you had that concept in mind. What happens when there is a defunct organisation, so there are no corporate responsibilities? It has disappeared. And I admit that it is probably more likely to be non-religious institutions—there could be some religious institutions—where there is no equally responsible participating government. Is that a fact or not? It seems to me that this must have come up in your negotiations with the states and when you were considering this legislation.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:09):  Senator Siewert, perhaps I can assist you in this way. I'm advised that the funder-of-last-resort policy must necessarily have some limitations; otherwise, it may act as a disincentive for financially viable institutions to opt in to the scheme. Importantly, the scheme's legislation facilitates non-government institutions, where they operate as an umbrella organisation, taking responsibility for defunct institutions that fall under that umbrella. In many cases it is more appropriate for these institutions to take responsibility for their defunct institutions than it would be for governments to step in as a funder of last resort. The policy is also intended to prevent non-government institutions from potentially exaggerating the state of their finances in order to have government step in. The policy provides governments with some degree of certainty as to the funder-of-last-resort liability.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:10):  So basically it is the case that government does not want to be the ultimate funder of last resort, for those reasons. But, as I understand it and as survivors understand it—because survivors have been raising this with us—it is the case that people from a defunct organisation, where there is no longer an organisation, will not be able to access redress, because the government is scared of those messages and has not the wit to find other ways to put in this legislation to stop that happening and to make sure those people who were abused in defunct organisations do actually receive redress. That is the fact, isn't it?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:11):  Senator Siewert, I've just advised you what I am instructed is the position. Yesterday evening I also canvassed the situations of governments being funders of last resort. I'm happy to repeat what I said yesterday evening: that funder-of-last-resort arrangements will apply where a government has equal responsibility with a defunct non-government institution for the abuse of a child. The relevant government will therefore pay the non-government institution's share of redress. If a survivor is abused in an institution that exists but has simply chosen not to participate in the scheme, governments will not be a funder of last resort. This approach is necessary to ensure that non-government institutions, where they have the capacity to participate in the scheme, are not disincentivised from doing so. I think my two statements provide you with the appropriate ambit to answer the question that you asked.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:12):  They do actually answer my question, and that answer is: there are some people who don't have access to redress because they were in defunct organisations. I wasn't asking about where organisations refused to opt in. We did discuss opt-in institutions yesterday, but the fact is some survivors will not be able to access redress because the government isn't prepared to act as the funder of last resort where there are defunct organisations.


I want to move on to issues related to people in jail, unable to apply for redress. The provisions are subject to the discretion of the operator. The operator may determine that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the application being made. Can you outline what are classed as exceptional circumstances?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:14):  On what I just read out earlier: as I said, there are parameters for governments to be funders of last resort. Can I just reiterate to you that, until somebody puts in an application—



The CHAIR:  There is a point of order. Minister, resume your seat. Senator Pratt?




Senator Pratt:
  If the minister had listened to Senator Siewert's questions, they were about incarceration and not about funders of last resort. I appreciate you were busy talking to your advisers, but I just might draw the minister's attention to the question.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Siewert, I was seeking to clarify what you'd said before—so thank you, Senator Pratt! Senator Siewert, could you kindly just repeat what you asked? I'm trying to answer and address your question. Puerile interjections from Senator Pratt are not going to assist the situation at this point.



The CHAIR:  Senator Siewert, are you seeking the call?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:15):  Yes. To be fair, I did end my comments on last-resort funding before I asked my question. I will acknowledge that. My question was about the rules around exceptional circumstances for those in jail. The position in the legislation is that people in jail are unable to apply for redress but the operator has the ability to determine, in exceptional circumstances, if they can. I'm asking: what are those exceptional circumstances for people in jail to be able to apply?

Their eligibility will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the scheme operator, and each case will be under the advice of the relevant Attorney-General.

In effect, will the same process operate for both those with a serious conviction and those who are currently in jail?

I note that this provision is, again, subject to the discretion of the operator, and that the operator may determine that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the application being made.

For those with a serious conviction, the process is more articulated in the legislation. Where are the provisions articulated regarding those in jail, to make it the same? We don't take that from the reading of the legislation, sorry.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:25):  There's more detail in the legislation around serious criminal convictions than there is around those in jail. They're treated a bit differently.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:26):  I'm still struggling, sorry, with your answer, going back to the 12 months of the scheme. I'm still struggling with how that's going to be addressed in the reviews. It's a fairly simple fact that the legislation says that it's only under exceptional circumstances, that somebody seeking redress in that last year can only do it through exceptional circumstances. I'm struggling with the answer to: 'What are the exceptional circumstances?' and the answer on the review, because it's the exceptional circumstances that I'm after there. I do appreciate the fact that you've suggested there may be a change to people being able to seek redress in that last year.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:28):  Basically, what you're saying is we can look at all the information, through the reviews, in the run-up to that final year to determine the exceptional circumstances.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:28):  I think your question goes to the interaction of the reviews and also, basically, that last year of the legislation. The point I'm seeking to make is that it may be that, in some cases, those exceptional circumstances will not arise or will not come to the fore for a period of time; therefore, it goes to the point I was making before. As the scheme progresses, it's likely that we will see the numbers as they come through and, at least, have an assessment of what those numbers are and, if I can put it—numbers, review, people becoming more aware. They all lead to a point where, it's our hope, all those people who need to be covered will be covered. Do you see where I'm going, Senator?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:30):  It's good to understand the thinking and the process there; thank you, Minister. I have a question or two around direct personal response. Under the previous Commonwealth bill, a note to clause 50(1) provided for a consequence if a participating institution did not comply with the request of a survivor for a direct personal response—that is, the operator had to include details about the noncompliance in the annual report on the scheme, required under clause 122, which would be presented to the parliament by the minister. This hasn't been included in the national bill. Will it now be included in the rules?

It's not there now, so I can't point to it in the current bill. I'm asking: how will that now be accommodated?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:35):  Okay. If you could take it on notice, that would be appreciated. I've got a couple of quite technical questions. I'm going to try them and see how we go. You may need to take them on notice. Under the national bill, if an applicant does not provide additional information requested by the operator within the designated period, the operator is not required to give a determination until the information is provided. Why can the operator not progress the application in the same way they can if an institution does not provide the information requested within the designated period?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:36):  I'm advised it's in order to not compel survivors. Sorry, let me just seek some clarification on that. Senator Siewert, I'm advised that the legislation provides the parameters in relation to compelling the institutions, but it can't compel survivors. You need the survivors to provide information, or otherwise, for their application to be progressed.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:37):  So what you're saying is that, if an institution is not doing the right thing and providing the information, the application will progress, and that's an incentive for them to be compliant. I can understand now what you're saying in terms of a survivor—that you don't want to have that same compulsion. I've already had survivors talk to me about filling in the form and being traumatised, and then having to take a break and maybe not engage for a while. There are potentially some issues where an application could be progressed without that information. So I'm wondering: is there going to be a process where an application could progress to a certain point without that information, and then stop until that information is gained?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:38):  Thank you. I've got another question now which is similar to the other question that I asked around the direct personal response and noncompliant institutions. Under clause 122 of the Commonwealth bill, the operator has to include details about the noncompliance of institutions in providing information—not just direct personal response but in general—in the annual report on the scheme, which would be presented to the parliament by the minister. This is another area that wasn't included in the national bill. Is that going to be included in an instrument or the rules?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:40):  Can I go to the issue of no minimum payment. We've had some discussion about this, and a number of us mentioned it in our second reading contributions. What are the mechanisms that are in place to ensure that an applicant doesn't receive a really insulting low payment? Is it possible that applicants, for example, could be offered just a couple of hundred bucks? Does the government acknowledge that receiving this kind of offer could in fact be retraumatising to people and the fact that there is no minimum payment could very well retraumatise people?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:43):  Sorry; this is a really, really important issue to a lot of survivors. Let me go back to fundamentals then. Why was there no minimum payment set so that we wouldn't be in the position that we're in right now, where you can't guarantee that some survivors will not get what people have said to me would be an insultingly low payment that would potentially retraumatise people? The question is: why was there no minimum payment?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:44):  I think this is probably an appropriate time to remind the chamber of some of the details. I know that senators have raised some points on the detail of this Redress Scheme. I think I need to not only address this point but make it really, really clearly. We have responded many times publicly, but I do want to make clear the position on this point. The royal commission made recommendations to government on elements of the scheme including redress amounts, funder of last resort and counselling. However, the key principle underpinning the royal commission's recommendations was the provision of nationally consistent redress to survivors and that the Commonwealth government had the constitutional power to compel states, territories and non-government institutions to opt into the scheme. This understanding is wrong. The Commonwealth has no power to compel the states and territories or non-government institutions to join any national redress scheme.


So, as a consequence of that, the Commonwealth has had to negotiate all the elements of the scheme, including redress amounts, counselling and implementation. Without such negotiation, there would be no national redress scheme, and survivors would not have the redress which they have waited so long to receive. I think it's really important, because a number of the comments that have been made in this chamber have been premised on the point that basically the Commonwealth has the power to compel. Can I make that very, very clear: the Commonwealth does not have the power to compel the states and territories or non-government institutions to join any scheme. As a result, we, the Commonwealth, have had to negotiate all the elements of the scheme—all the elements of the scheme—including a lot of the detail that you've asked me about. Without such negotiation, we wouldn't have had this National Redress Scheme. It's really important that all senators understand that the Commonwealth does not have the power to compel the states and territories and the non-government institutions.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:46):  Thank you for the history lesson! Did the Commonwealth talk to the states about a minimum payment for the very reasons that I have just articulated, where a scheme that is supposed to be helping people—and will help people, I should say—will actually end up retraumatising some people because the Commonwealth, the states and the territories and the non-government institutions did not agree on a minimum payment? That's my first question. The next question is: have you talked to the states about how you will address this issue of no minimum payment and what it means to survivors and applicants who get what they describe as an insultingly low payment?

Could I seek some clarification, please, around the position on abuse perpetrated by a child, which was canvassed in the DSS submission, No. 1, which says:


The Rules will exclude from the Scheme any sexual abuse perpetrated by a child, unless the abuse involved physical contact with, or penetration of, another child.


Does this mean that any peer abuse involving physical sexual contact is within the scope of the NRS? The way that response was articulated is a bit confusing, and I'm just trying to clarify that.

If an eligible applicant submits an application involving sexual abuse at two institutions and only one institution is participating, will the applicant be able to access a payment that represents appropriate redress for the abuse at the participating institution and have their application held on file until such a time as another responsible institution opts into the scheme?

This scheme only applies to survivors who were sexually abused, although my understanding under the assessment framework is that, if you were sexually abused, other forms of abuse will be taken into account, such as physical abuse.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:52):  Let me say that I understand that the royal commission recommendations were about sexual abuse. It didn't necessarily rule out those survivors who did not suffer sexual abuse but suffered other forms of abuse. This is a question for you, Minister. Is the government considering, or prepared to consider, how to provide support and redress to those survivors of non-sexual physical or mental abuse in another way? I'm not asking about under this scheme. I already know the answer to that. I'm asking if you are prepared to consider or are considering some forms of redress for those survivors.

Senator SIEWERT

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:55):  I'm advised that the indexation was a recommendation of the royal commission, and it is an acknowledgment of those institutions that did the right thing. It will not be applied for money paid for medical costs or for any money that was not specifically a compensation payment, and anything beyond that is a decision for government.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:55):  I understand that. You said it's a decision of government. Do you mean a decision of government about whether that would be included in the review? In other words, there's deep concern, which we've canvassed in the debate, around people ending up—it goes back to the minimum payment question—with quite small payments. There's a lot of concern in the community about this. So what I was asking about goes to that fact. Will it be considered in the review? Is your answer, basically, that the government will decide that?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:57):  On the indexation, in an answer to a question I put on notice, reference No. 3, at estimates about lawyers' fees, in terms of what will be taken into consideration in terms of indexing past payments, part of the department's answer said:


If legal fees are specified as a separate component, the legal fees will not be adjusted for inflation and then deducted from the person's redress payment.


So it's just the standard legal fee that was charged at the time that will be taken out?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:02):  Last night, we were finishing up the issue of 'funder of last resort'. Can the minister provide any further information around the issue of defunct organisations, where the government isn't equally responsible? Has there been any further clarification overnight of how the 93 per cent figure was arrived at? Is there any confirmation of whether those survivors that were in one of those defunct institutions will or won't be covered?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:03):  I'm advised that the figure that's been used by the minister is a derived figure. I refer you to a document entitled Final information update: during our five-year inquiry. I'm not sure, Senator Siewert, if you have that document. In that document, there's a chart headed 'Proportion of survivors who told us they were abused in a religious institution'. When you look at that chart, you can see a breakdown, and I am advised that that chart assisted the minister and informed him in relation to that figure.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:04):  Not all survivors were abused in religious institutions and, in fact, I think it's likely that some of the survivors in defunct institutions will actually be in non-religious institutions. That's why I want to pursue this a bit further, to find out for those beyond non-religious institutions. I tried to ask this last night: are those survivors that were in defunct institutions, where the government doesn't have responsibility, not going to have access to redress?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:06):  Senator Siewert, it goes to the point that I was making yesterday evening. Until someone makes an application—let me just assume for a moment they say 'organisation X', and we don't know if organisation X is genuinely defunct. It's possible that organisation X may have transferred some of its property. It may be that there is a corporate structure associated with institution X that requires delving into with an examination. That was the point that I was making yesterday evening, Senator Siewert. I know the point that you're trying to make and I'm trying to assist you, but unless somebody comes out and says, 'This is my claim against this particular—'




Senator Pratt:
  You just don't want to fess up as to whether you're prepared to be a funder of last resort or not.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Pratt, I'll take that interjection. You have to have an application by somebody to be able to ascertain the legal framework of that particular organisation. It's a pretty simple concept.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:07):  I do understand what the minister is saying in terms of an application. I'm trying to get to the principle here, which is what Senator Pratt was just referring to. Under these provisions—because of the way the national bill has been reworded and because there's no participating government that is equally responsible if people were abused in an organisation that is defunct—there is a bottom line which means that there are potentially survivors who will not be able to access redress because there is no ultimate funder of last resort. That's what I'm trying to articulate, and to find out from government if that is a correct understanding, whether or not someone's applied. Surely, in drafting this bill, you had that concept in mind. What happens when there is a defunct organisation, so there are no corporate responsibilities? It has disappeared. And I admit that it is probably more likely to be non-religious institutions—there could be some religious institutions—where there is no equally responsible participating government. Is that a fact or not? It seems to me that this must have come up in your negotiations with the states and when you were considering this legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:09):  Senator Siewert, perhaps I can assist you in this way. I'm advised that the funder-of-last-resort policy must necessarily have some limitations; otherwise, it may act as a disincentive for financially viable institutions to opt in to the scheme. Importantly, the scheme's legislation facilitates non-government institutions, where they operate as an umbrella organisation, taking responsibility for defunct institutions that fall under that umbrella. In many cases it is more appropriate for these institutions to take responsibility for their defunct institutions than it would be for governments to step in as a funder of last resort. The policy is also intended to prevent non-government institutions from potentially exaggerating the state of their finances in order to have government step in. The policy provides governments with some degree of certainty as to the funder-of-last-resort liability.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:10):  So basically it is the case that government does not want to be the ultimate funder of last resort, for those reasons. But, as I understand it and as survivors understand it—because survivors have been raising this with us—it is the case that people from a defunct organisation, where there is no longer an organisation, will not be able to access redress, because the government is scared of those messages and has not the wit to find other ways to put in this legislation to stop that happening and to make sure those people who were abused in defunct organisations do actually receive redress. That is the fact, isn't it?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:11):  Senator Siewert, I've just advised you what I am instructed is the position. Yesterday evening I also canvassed the situations of governments being funders of last resort. I'm happy to repeat what I said yesterday evening: that funder-of-last-resort arrangements will apply where a government has equal responsibility with a defunct non-government institution for the abuse of a child. The relevant government will therefore pay the non-government institution's share of redress. If a survivor is abused in an institution that exists but has simply chosen not to participate in the scheme, governments will not be a funder of last resort. This approach is necessary to ensure that non-government institutions, where they have the capacity to participate in the scheme, are not disincentivised from doing so. I think my two statements provide you with the appropriate ambit to answer the question that you asked.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:12):  They do actually answer my question, and that answer is: there are some people who don't have access to redress because they were in defunct organisations. I wasn't asking about where organisations refused to opt in. We did discuss opt-in institutions yesterday, but the fact is some survivors will not be able to access redress because the government isn't prepared to act as the funder of last resort where there are defunct organisations.


I want to move on to issues related to people in jail, unable to apply for redress. The provisions are subject to the discretion of the operator. The operator may determine that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the application being made. Can you outline what are classed as exceptional circumstances?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:14):  On what I just read out earlier: as I said, there are parameters for governments to be funders of last resort. Can I just reiterate to you that, until somebody puts in an application—



The CHAIR:  There is a point of order. Minister, resume your seat. Senator Pratt?




Senator Pratt:
  If the minister had listened to Senator Siewert's questions, they were about incarceration and not about funders of last resort. I appreciate you were busy talking to your advisers, but I just might draw the minister's attention to the question.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Siewert, I was seeking to clarify what you'd said before—so thank you, Senator Pratt! Senator Siewert, could you kindly just repeat what you asked? I'm trying to answer and address your question. Puerile interjections from Senator Pratt are not going to assist the situation at this point.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:15):  Yes. To be fair, I did end my comments on last-resort funding before I asked my question. I will acknowledge that. My question was about the rules around exceptional circumstances for those in jail. The position in the legislation is that people in jail are unable to apply for redress but the operator has the ability to determine, in exceptional circumstances, if they can. I'm asking: what are those exceptional circumstances for people in jail to be able to apply?

If there are other circumstances, then I'm advised that it will be a matter for the relevant Attorney-General to advise the scheme operator.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:17):  We have had the process explained to us during estimates—the process that will occur for those who have had a serious conviction, as opposed to those who are currently in jail. Will that same process of advice from the attorney-generals from each state be sought for those in jail as well? In effect, will the same process operate for both those with a serious conviction and those who are currently in jail?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:18):  Yes.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:18):  In terms of that process, there were arguments put forward that those in jail would be unable to get the direct personal response or the counselling and support services while they're in jail. Do those arguments still hold, or is it being considered that some people in jail would be able to get those parts of the whole redress scheme?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:19):  I'm advised that each state will have to decide how it makes available or provides for those services in the jails, given that the jails are in the jurisdiction of each of those states.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:19):  Is this something that is going to be covered by the rules, and will there be an agreement with the states about how each state is going to operate it agreed up-front, so that it's not determined on a case-by-case basis how somebody will receive a direct response and/or counselling and support services?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:20):  I am going to try to do this as quickly as possible, but these are the sorts of things that we want to understand about the way the scheme is going to operate. So it'll be in the intergovernmental agreement. Each state will then have prescribed a process under which this will happen if somebody applies and is, in fact, found eligible. That will all be agreed up-front, and will people be able to see those intergovernmental agreements?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:21):  I'm advised that it's a detailed answer, and not all the states have agreed in relation to that, so that's why I'm advised it's best taken on notice.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:21):  Thank you. That does answer my question. It's a work in progress. While we are talking about questions on notice, you took on notice quite a few yesterday. Are we able to agree, in the chamber, to a date when we will get those answers back? I'm not accusing you of sending it off to the never-never, but I just want to ensure that doesn't happen.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:22):  A positive thank you? Yes, I'm very sincere when I say 'thank you'. I do have some more questions. Could I move on to applications that can't be made in the final 12 months of the scheme? I note that this provision is, again, subject to the discretion of the operator, and that the operator may determine that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the application being made. Could you outline what would constitute these exceptional circumstances, because, in effect, this takes it to being a nine-year scheme rather than a 10-year scheme, other than under exceptional circumstances?

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:22):  I'm advised that that's a complex answer. I can provide more information on notice and that will form part of the information that we can provide by Friday. But I would go back to the comment that I made yesterday evening that the bill does include two reviews and an annual report to parliament on the scheme.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:23):  I'm not sure how that relates to the question I just asked you in terms of, in the last 12 months people can't apply. Do I then take from your answer that that might change under the reviews? Sorry if I'm missing something here.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:24):  Insofar as those reviews may provide information, other information may come to light in relation to the scheme and, therefore, it ensures that those issues that are identified can be addressed as part of that review process.

(
Western Australia
—
Australian Greens Whip
) (
12:2

):  I want to go back to the question that I was addressing a bit earlier that you took on notice. I had talked about those in jail and those who have a serious conviction. For those with a serious conviction, the process is more articulated in the legislation. Where are the provisions articulated regarding those in jail, to make it the same? We don't take that from the reading of the legislation, sorry. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:25):  It's in the rules. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:25):  There's more detail in the legislation around serious criminal convictions than there is around those in jail. They're treated a bit differently. Doesn't that mean that the issues around those in jail are more subject to disallowable instruments and change in the rules? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:26):  I'm advised, no. Those provisions were not able to be accommodated in the legislation due to time.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:26):  I'm still struggling, sorry, with your answer, going back to the 12 months of the scheme. I'm still struggling with how that's going to be addressed in the reviews. It's a fairly simple fact that the legislation says that it's only under exceptional circumstances, that somebody seeking redress in that last year can only do it through exceptional circumstances. I'm struggling with the answer to: 'What are the exceptional circumstances?' and the answer on the review, because it's the exceptional circumstances that I'm after there. I do appreciate the fact that you've suggested there may be a change to people being able to seek redress in that last year. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:27):  I'm told that on the review, as part of that process, exceptional circumstances can be identified and parameters of exceptional circumstances can be determined. Again, it goes back to the point that I made earlier about the importance of when an application is made and, then, examining the circumstances of that particular application. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:28):  Basically, what you're saying is we can look at all the information, through the reviews, in the run-up to that final year to determine the exceptional circumstances.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:28):  I think your question goes to the interaction of the reviews and also, basically, that last year of the legislation. The point I'm seeking to make is that it may be that, in some cases, those exceptional circumstances will not arise or will not come to the fore for a period of time; therefore, it goes to the point I was making before. As the scheme progresses, it's likely that we will see the numbers as they come through and, at least, have an assessment of what those numbers are and, if I can put it—numbers, review, people becoming more aware. They all lead to a point where, it's our hope, all those people who need to be covered will be covered. Do you see where I'm going, Senator? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:30):  It's good to understand the thinking and the process there; thank you, Minister. I have a question or two around direct personal response. Under the previous Commonwealth bill, a note to clause 50(1) provided for a consequence if a participating institution did not comply with the request of a survivor for a direct personal response—that is, the operator had to include details about the noncompliance in the annual report on the scheme, required under clause 122, which would be presented to the parliament by the minister. This hasn't been included in the national bill. Will it now be included in the rules?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:30):  It's not in this bill. The easiest way is for me to ask is: what has happened to the provision in the previous bill where, if a participating institution didn't comply with a request for a direct personal response, there was a requirement for it to be in the annual report? It's not there now, so I can't point to it in the current bill. I'm asking: how will that now be accommodated?

Senator SIEWERT

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:32):  Just so that I understand: why was it taken out of the national bill itself and put into the instrument, given that it's a pretty important part of the whole Redress Scheme, in terms of the three components? It's pretty important if a participating institution does not comply with the request for a direct personal response.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:33):  I'm advised it's to enable states and territories and non-government institutions to work through that.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:33):  I don't understand why you would need to take it out of the national bill to allow the states and territories to do that. Either they do it or they don't do it, and there is a consequence if they don't do it.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:33):  I'm advised that, by doing it this way, there's a degree of flexibility afforded to it in the event that it does need to be changed as a consequence of negotiations with the states and territories and the non-government institutions.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:34):  I appreciate that. But including it in the annual report is surely something that is—either you do it or you don't do it, from the operator's perspective.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:34):  Senator Siewert, I think if I could give you the outline of that, the technicalities of that—I'll take that on notice and give that to you as part of the package of information taken on notice so we can put the actual, technical answer in for you.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:35):  Okay. If you could take it on notice, that would be appreciated. I've got a couple of quite technical questions. I'm going to try them and see how we go. You may need to take them on notice. Under the national bill, if an applicant does not provide additional information requested by the operator within the designated period, the operator is not required to give a determination until the information is provided. Why can the operator not progress the application in the same way they can if an institution does not provide the information requested within the designated period?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:36):  I'm advised it's in order to not compel survivors. Sorry, let me just seek some clarification on that. Senator Siewert, I'm advised that the legislation provides the parameters in relation to compelling the institutions, but it can't compel survivors. You need the survivors to provide information, or otherwise, for their application to be progressed.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:37):  So what you're saying is that, if an institution is not doing the right thing and providing the information, the application will progress, and that's an incentive for them to be compliant. I can understand now what you're saying in terms of a survivor—that you don't want to have that same compulsion. I've already had survivors talk to me about filling in the form and being traumatised, and then having to take a break and maybe not engage for a while. There are potentially some issues where an application could be progressed without that information. So I'm wondering: is there going to be a process where an application could progress to a certain point without that information, and then stop until that information is gained?

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:38):  Thank you. I've got another question now which is similar to the other question that I asked around the direct personal response and noncompliant institutions. Under clause 122 of the Commonwealth bill, the operator has to include details about the noncompliance of institutions in providing information—not just direct personal response but in general—in the annual report on the scheme, which would be presented to the parliament by the minister. This is another area that wasn't included in the national bill. Is that going to be included in an instrument or the rules?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:40):  Can I go to the issue of no minimum payment. We've had some discussion about this, and a number of us mentioned it in our second reading contributions. What are the mechanisms that are in place to ensure that an applicant doesn't receive a really insulting low payment? Is it possible that applicants, for example, could be offered just a couple of hundred bucks? Does the government acknowledge that receiving this kind of offer could in fact be retraumatising to people and the fact that there is no minimum payment could very well retraumatise people?

 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:44):  I think this is probably an appropriate time to remind the chamber of some of the details. I know that senators have raised some points on the detail of this Redress Scheme. I think I need to not only address this point but make it really, really clearly. We have responded many times publicly, but I do want to make clear the position on this point. The royal commission made recommendations to government on elements of the scheme including redress amounts, funder of last resort and counselling. However, the key principle underpinning the royal commission's recommendations was the provision of nationally consistent redress to survivors and that the Commonwealth government had the constitutional power to compel states, territories and non-government institutions to opt into the scheme. This understanding is wrong. The Commonwealth has no power to compel the states and territories or non-government institutions to join any national redress scheme.


So, as a consequence of that, the Commonwealth has had to negotiate all the elements of the scheme, including redress amounts, counselling and implementation. Without such negotiation, there would be no national redress scheme, and survivors would not have the redress which they have waited so long to receive. I think it's really important, because a number of the comments that have been made in this chamber have been premised on the point that basically the Commonwealth has the power to compel. Can I make that very, very clear: the Commonwealth does not have the power to compel the states and territories or non-government institutions to join any scheme. As a result, we, the Commonwealth, have had to negotiate all the elements of the scheme—all the elements of the scheme—including a lot of the detail that you've asked me about. Without such negotiation, we wouldn't have had this National Redress Scheme. It's really important that all senators understand that the Commonwealth does not have the power to compel the states and territories and the non-government institutions.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:46):  Thank you for the history lesson! Did the Commonwealth talk to the states about a minimum payment for the very reasons that I have just articulated, where a scheme that is supposed to be helping people—and will help people, I should say—will actually end up retraumatising some people because the Commonwealth, the states and the territories and the non-government institutions did not agree on a minimum payment? That's my first question. The next question is: have you talked to the states about how you will address this issue of no minimum payment and what it means to survivors and applicants who get what they describe as an insultingly low payment?

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:48):  I take that as: no, you didn't.


Could I seek some clarification, please, around the position on abuse perpetrated by a child, which was canvassed in the DSS submission, No. 1, which says:


The Rules will exclude from the Scheme any sexual abuse perpetrated by a child, unless the abuse involved physical contact with, or penetration of, another child.


Does this mean that any peer abuse involving physical sexual contact is within the scope of the NRS? The way that response was articulated is a bit confusing, and I'm just trying to clarify that.

If an eligible applicant submits an application involving sexual abuse at two institutions and only one institution is participating, will the applicant be able to access a payment that represents appropriate redress for the abuse at the participating institution and have their application held on file until such a time as another responsible institution opts into the scheme?

Is the government considering, or prepared to consider, how to provide support and redress to those survivors of non-sexual physical or mental abuse in another way? I'm not asking about under this scheme. I already know the answer to that. I'm asking if you are prepared to consider or are considering some forms of redress for those survivors.

There's a lot of concern in the community about this. So what I was asking about goes to that fact. Will it be considered in the review?

If legal fees are specified as a separate component, the legal fees will not be adjusted for inflation and then deducted from the person's redress payment.

Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs (Senator Scullion) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to income tax.


Today I thought, after the first couple of questions, that we were going to go to an election on tax. We saw the government come in and they were agitated, they were excited, and there was a lot of backslapping and self-congratulating going on. I've never seen a question time in recent times start like that. But, of course, it all came to naught. After a couple of questions, they all started nodding off once again. They all had their heads down in their phones, or wherever they could hide from the answers that were being given to the questions, because they know, just like we know, that the tax system they want to introduce over the next six years is an unfair system. They know that it does not stack up to the proposals that the Labor Party is proposing to put before the Australian people. This will be one of the key battlegrounds in the forthcoming election. As I said, I thought that was going to be sooner rather than later but, no, 'sleepy hollow' started again. I think the election is still some time away.


Today we had Minister Cormann trying to justify the fact that the people in Malcolm Turnbull's electorate of Wentworth will be the biggest beneficiaries of the government's tax plan. The people of one of the richest electorates in this country, if not the richest, will gain most from this plan. And this is the other reason I thought we may be looking at an election: they started to throw the word 'aspirational' around; 'aspirations' were coming up again. And I thought, 'Yeah, you can hear an election coming on when the government starts talking about aspirational voters!'


But look at the context in which the term 'aspiration' was used. Minister Cormann was suggesting to us here that the reason the Australian public will accept their tax plan and the fact that the people in Wentworth are the biggest beneficiaries of their tax plan is that everyone's aspirational; everyone wants to be those people. And we're prepared to wait. Australians are prepared to wait until they become some of the richest people in Australia to get the benefits that those rich people are going to be delivered by this government. That's the argument he would have us accept. That is the argument they propose.


Either they think Australians are absolute mugs or they believe their own delusional rubbish. I think it's a mixture of both, to be honest. It's too tricky, it's too shifty and it's absolutely dishonest. It's a con. They know that they've built themselves a hole from which they will desperately try to get out, and they will do things like shifting the debate to a 'goanna's guts' debate. Now, I've never actually heard that term used before but, again, Minister Scullion, when talking about the tax plan, talked about a 'goanna's guts of a tax plan'. I have no idea what that is. It's the same sort of gobbledygook they talk to us about when they're talking about tax reform. It is hopeless. It is shifty. It is distraction.


What they ought to do is start acknowledging that the working people in this country who have average incomes need a tax cut. That's what the Labor Party is prepared to give them. We're prepared to back the first tranche of the government's very modest tax cuts for working people. When we're in government we will double that. But at this time, if that's all the government's prepared to give average income earners in this country, we're prepared to back that in. We're prepared to do that today, but we are not prepared to back in tax cuts over six years—two elections away—that deliver massive tax cuts to those who don't need them, to those at the big end of town, to those in the richest electorates. We're not prepared to do that when we need proper investments in our hospitals, in our schools, in our communities. That's what we want to do. We want to give benefits to average-working-wage Australians. They need a tax cut, and we want to give them that. We want to double what the government wants to give them, and we need to make the investments. If there are to be tax cuts in future for the people at the top end of town, that will be when the economy can afford it. But it will be after our investments in education and in the health system for all working Australians in this country.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (15:08):  For a moment there I lived in the false hope that Senator Marshall was going to give a serious response to the questions that were answered by government members today, but my hopes have been dashed yet again. That can't be considered as a serious response. Labor may claim to have all the plans that they like, but of course they're not in government, so they actually can't deliver anything. They're not in government. They might aspire to that, if they understand what that 'aspiration' might mean. But they're not in government, so they can't deliver. They can make all the promises they like. In fact, in my home seat, where I live, in Braddon, they're making a whole range of promises at the moment, but they have to win two elections in Braddon before they can deliver on any of those promises. They ought to be focusing on the first one, which probably should have happened in October last year, if the truth be known—if the local member had actually fessed up when she should have fessed up back in October—and we could actually have had that process over and done with already.


The coalition has a comprehensive tax plan to deliver to the country. It was brought down in the budget. As a duly-elected government, I think it's quite reasonable that we aspire to have that legislation passed by the parliament. If the opposition want to put an alternative plan in place, they can win government in their own right. There will be an election sometime next year, and they will have an opportunity to do that.


The opposition asks, 'Why won't you adopt our tax plan?' If you look at the Labor Party's history of tax plans, even the ones that they've announced quite recently, you'd understand quite well why we wouldn't adopt their tax plan. For example, look at their absolutely disastrous retiree tax plan that they released earlier this year—the one that they said was well considered, well thought out and well planned. It would rip out from underneath some retirees up to 30 per cent of their entire income. It lasted two weeks before it was modified. The modifications were allegedly to exempt pensioners from the tax, because Labor's well-thought-out retiree tax would actually impact even pensioners.


After the modifications and a bit more consideration of this disastrous nan-and-pop tax that they were proposing we then found that it didn't even actually exempt all pensioners. There were still some pensioners who would be impacted by this tax that would rip up to 30 per cent of someone's entire income from them. It would strip that away, so someone with a total income of $24,000 a year would lose $5,000. Labor claim that these people are high-income earners. They would have a significant lump of income ripped away from them by this disastrous tax plan, which is, I might add, how Labor propose to pay for their magic tax plan.


They claim that their nan-and-pop tax plan is about fairness, yet they'd rip from nans and pops around this country up to 30 per cent of their income to give tax cuts to other people in the community. I don't know anyone who thinks it's fair that their nan and pop lose up to 30 per cent of their income to pay for their tax cut. I wouldn't want my nan and pop to lose up to 30 per cent of their income so that I can get a tax cut. Yet this is how Labor are intending to pay for the majority of the tax cuts that they've got in the system at the moment.


They trot around asking, 'Why won't you support our tax plan?' I'll tell you why, because I don't believe that the nans and pops of Australia should have up to 30 per cent of their income ripped away to pay for someone else's tax cut. I don't think that that's fair. I think that that demonstrates that the Labor Party and Mr Shorten don't understand what fairness is, just as they don't understand what aspiration is. They don't have a decent plan to manage the economy, as the government have. We can afford the tax cuts that we're proposing because we have managed the economy well and kept the economy strong. We have grown the economy, jobs and wages— (Time expired)

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2018-06-19,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (15:13):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Cormann and Senator Scullion. This is a welcome opportunity to demonstrate to the Senate, particularly to crossbench senators, the sharp contrast between the Turnbull government's unfair and divisive tax proposals and Labor's alternative, which was announced today by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. It won't be news to most people in this chamber that most Australians want a tax system which is fair, efficient and responsible—one which spreads the burden of taxation equitably, one which properly funds our schools and hospitals, and one which allows the country to pay down its debts. Australians don't want a tax system which gives breaks and privileges to those who are already well off, which allows large corporations to pay no tax at all or which shifts the burden of taxation onto those who can least afford it—the 80 per cent of Australians who are middle- and low-income earners.


But let's make no mistake: none of the responses today to any questions actually answered the question that was put. Why? It's because the government's tax plan is a fraud. This is the biggest taxing, biggest spending government, and it has doubled the federal debt. What the government is proposing is the tax plan of economic vandals. They are tearing at the fabric of the Australian consensus between capital and labour that has existed since Federation: that capital could make a decent return and people could live well at the same time. The Treasurer has himself said that slow wages growth is one of the biggest problems that the Australian economy faces, but he has no plan to address that. He has opposed every wage rise ever. He has done nothing to reverse the decision of the Fair Work Commission. He has done nothing other than attack and cut penalty rates. 


Today, the Leader of the Opposition gave notice that, next week, he will introduce legislation to stop the Prime Minister's attack on penalty rates. Let's compare the pair. In a final twist of the knife in the heart of working people, this government are refusing to work with Labor to deliver real income tax cuts now. This government can pretend that their never-never land, never-never gonna, six-years-off, fantastical and fanciful tax cuts are real. They are not. They are fooling no-one. If people go back and look at the income tax scale adjustments, it is Labor who has given tax relief. It is Labor who has provided relief to working Australians. It is Labor who has made the tax cuts for working people. It may not come as a surprise to some in this chamber that Paul Keating is a political hero of mine. As a former Treasurer and former Prime Minister, Paul Keating cut the tax scales more than any other Treasurer in Australia's history. The Liberal treasurers have just been pretenders. 


There is a message in all of this for the Prime Minister and for the Treasurer. After five years of a government twisting and turning on itself and hanging on every poll—all 34 of them for this current Prime Minister—no-one believes you any more. Work with Labor; work with us to pass some immediate tax relief for working people. It is affordable, because we aren't proposing to give tax cuts to big banks and to foreign billionaires. What this government is doing is playing chicken with working Australians' lives—whether those people have a good week or a bad week. The government is playing chicken with the tax relief that working people could have. And that is actually typical of this government, with its reverse Midas touch. 


Do you know what happens when Liberal politicians attend their branch meetings? They say they are the government for tax cuts, for no deficits and for limited government, but the truth is they are none of these things. This government has doubled federal government debt—doubled it! They are a government of tax and spend. They voted with the 'all care and no responsibility' of the Greens political party to scrap the debt ceiling. They scrapped the debt ceiling and still claim they are the responsible party of economic management? Please, give us a break. Senator Cormann has proposed tax cuts for large corporations and for foreign billionaires. But I can assure you that, in our first budget, Labor's plans mean we can deliver a winning trifecta in government. As the shadow Treasurer said this morning: bring it on. (Time expired)

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:18):  I rise also to take note of answers from Senator Cormann and Senator Scullion. I thank Senator Kitching, in particular, for that Oscar-winning performance. I have never heard such extraordinary dribble in my life. But that's all right—we will move on from there. 


As Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, I was fortunate enough to hear firsthand from witnesses about the great benefits that will flow from legislating all three stages of the Turnbull coalition government's Personal Income Tax Plan. We heard from businesses large and small, from think tanks, from consulting firms and from industry groups. The overwhelming response from witnesses was that the Personal Income Tax Plan provides much-needed relief to low- and middle-income earners, that it protects against bracket creep and that it does so in a way that maintains the central character of progressivity in Australia's tax system. 


Everyone has heard what is contained in our tax plan. Many people have heard how we are executing those tax cuts, but there has not been enough discussion of why we are implementing the tax cuts and why they are so important. Why do we want to provide tax relief? 


It is because our taxes should be lower; they should be simpler; and they should be fairer. Fairness is one of the key pillars of our Personal Income Tax Plan and arguably the most important, because Australians value nothing more than they value a fair go. That is exactly what the Personal Income Tax Plan delivers.


This bill was met by the Business Council of Australia with the message:


It will deliver a more competitive personal tax system that improves incentives to work and save. It achieves this while maintaining a highly progressive tax and transfer system.


PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that the government's proposed Personal Income Tax Plan provides much-needed relief to Australian taxpayers from the pressures of bracket creep, and it does so in a way which retains the central character of progressivity in Australia's tax system. COSBOA, the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, concluded that the big win for COSBOA's constituents, for small businesses, is the removal of the complexity and the fear that people have about moving into new tax brackets. Contrary to the accusations levelled by those opposite, we heard from many, many witnesses that the tax system maintained its progressivity, something which has been denied today.


Madam Deputy President, can I point you to the distributional impacts of the Personal Income Tax Plan. The Grattan Institute highlighted that high-income earners such as those on the top marginal tax rate would continue to pay a similar proportion of overall personal income tax collections under the government's plan to that under the current system. The Grattan Institute confirmed that progressivity does not change significantly under the coalition's Personal Income Tax Plan. PwC suggested the same thing. There were plenty of witnesses that demonstrated conclusively that progressivity does not change under the Personal Income Tax Plan.


Senator Kitching mentioned that the Personal Income Tax Plan takes place over seven years. Why does it take place over seven years? It's fully factored into the budget bottom line. It's entirely affordable. The budget remains in surplus over that time, and the economy will continue to grow. A long-term plan is fiscally responsible. The budget does return to surplus. It's economically effective. There is more money in the pockets of hardworking Australians. Most importantly, it counters the criticism, which is so often levelled against all governments, of political myopia—which affects those opposite, who are addicted to the sugar hit of a tax-and-spend addiction. Certainly that can be seen from Labor's higher tax collection: retiree tax, housing tax, investment tax, higher income tax, family business tax, savings taxes—a plethora of taxes, more than $200 billion. Senator Marshall suggested that he wanted to go to an election based on tax. I say: bring that on. Bring that on.


The Labor Party doesn't get aspiration; it never has, and Tanya Plibersek proved that today: 'This ""aspiration"" term—it's a mystery to me.' Well, if ignorance is bliss, certainly the member for Sydney must be ecstatic, because Labor is driven by that obsessive preoccupation that redistribution is so much more important than wealth creation.


The coalition will always be a government of aspiration. It will always be a government of opportunity, of having a go, of taking risks, of reward for effort. We will proudly be the flag-bearers for aspirational Australians every single time. The coalition's Personal Income Tax Plan is clear and concise, pragmatic and— (Time expired)

"Keneally, Sen Kristina",ALP,2018-06-19,"



Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (15:23):  I rise to participate in this debate to take note of answers provided today by Ministers Scullion and Cormann. I'd like to start with the questions asked of Minister Scullion by Senator Ketter, where Senator Ketter highlighted that the Turnbull government's Personal Income Tax Plan reveals that the electorates of Hinkler, Wide Bay, Lyne and Cowper, all held by Nationals MPs, are amongst the 10 worst-off electorates. The senator asked Minister Scullion if he'd sought any advice on the inequitable distribution of the Turnbull government's income tax plan and its impact on regional communities. What was the minister's response? The minister's response was to reject the premise of the question.


This is not a point where you get to pick alternative facts, Minister Scullion. These are facts. This is the reality of the Turnbull government's Personal Income Tax Plan. The regional communities are going to be hit hard. They are going to be amongst the worst-off electorates. For example, in my home state of New South Wales that I represent here in this chamber, if you look at the electorate of Lyne and the electorate of Cowper, the second question that was asked to Minister Scullion was: have the members for those areas, Mr Gillespie and Mr Hartsuyker, lobbied the government, raised concerns, picked up the phone and tried to speak to someone about the disproportionate impact on their communities? Well, we didn't hear that. We didn't hear that they have done that. They haven't picked up the phone. Apparently they haven't said a peep about how their communities are being affected unfairly by their Liberal counterparts, their coalition partners in government, and the tax plan that they're seeking to implement. Apparently these National Party members in these electorates in the state of New South Wales are quite happy that another electorate in the state of New South Wales, that of Wentworth, is going to be amongst the best off. What a surprise! Malcolm Turnbull's own electorate is going to be amongst the best off in Malcolm Turnbull's Personal Income Tax Plan.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Keneally, I just remind you to refer to those in the other place by their correct titles.




Senator KENEALLY:
  Thank you very much. We know that, under Labor's bigger, better, fairer income tax plan, 72 per cent of the people of Lyne, or 52,000 people, will be at least $928 better off. Of the people of Cowper, 73 per cent, or 60,000 of them, will be at least $928 better off.


I turn to the questions asked to Minister Cormann, first by Senator Bilyk. She posed to him some facts that we now know as a result of analysis done not only by the Parliamentary Budget Office, which I will come to in a moment, but also by NATSEM. The analysis says that, particularly when it comes to stage 3 of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's Personal Income Tax Plan, there will be higher income inequality; the rich will get more tax cuts than the poor. We know the electorate of Wentworth will be best off under this income tax plan proposed by the Turnbull government. We know that this Turnbull government would like to see tax cuts for multinationals and millionaires and penalty rate cuts for working people.


We also know that, in my home state of New South Wales, in the electorate of Reid 110,000 people would be better off under Labor's income tax plan. They would be better off the tune of up to $928 a year. We know particularly that the financial benefits of stage 3 overwhelmingly flow to the well-off in the community, but we also know from analysis released today by the Parliamentary Budget Office that stage 3 of the Turnbull government's income tax plan will cost $10.4 billion a year by 2028, and it will grow at 12 per cent a year. We know that Minister Cormann and Treasury have done year-on-year analysis of the Turnbull government's Personal Income Tax Plan and they're not releasing it. They told us in Senate estimates that they had that year-on-year analysis but they're not releasing it. They're asking the Senate—they're asking the crossbench in particular—to vote blindly, it would seem, without that type of information.


One thing we also know as a result of Parliamentary Budget Office analysis is that overwhelmingly the financial benefits of stage 3 flow to men over women at a ratio of three to one. Thirty billion dollars of the $41 billion of stage 3 flows to men—not surprising from a government that doesn't believe that we should axe the tampon tax. They are apparently quite happy to see the benefits of their Personal Income Tax Plan flow overwhelmingly to men. The gender bias deserves to be— (Time expired)

"Georgiou, Sen Peter",PHON,2018-06-19,"



Senator GEORGIOU
 (Western Australia) (15:34):  by leave—I advise the Senate that from now on I am the Whip of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party in the Senate. 

",Senate,<title>PARTY OFFICE HOLDERS</title>,<title>Pauline Hanson's One Nation</title>,PARTY OFFICE HOLDERS,10,1
"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-06-19,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:34):  by leave—What we've just heard from Senator Georgiou is further evidence of the absolute catastrophe, the absolute chaos, that One Nation has become in this chamber and, really, all around the country. I'm sure that before long we're going to be hearing from Senator Burston again, and who knows what he's going to say? Who knows whether he's signed up to yet another party? Only yesterday morning he was an Independent and, miraculously, two or three minutes later he was a member of Clive Palmer's new party. Maybe there's been a third change in the last 24 hours.


But really today the focus in the statements we are receiving from Senator Georgiou and, I anticipate, Senator Burston needs to be on the absolute circus that the One Nation party, headed by Senator Pauline Hanson, has become. Just remember that of the 30 members of parliament or senators who have ever been elected in Australia under the One Nation banner there are now 21. Seventy per cent of those people have now either resigned from the party, been kicked out of the party or been kicked out of parliament. Here's another one: Senator Anning. We've got three of them in the room now. All we need is Senator Culleton to come back through and former Senator Roberts to come back through and we can have the full menagerie of One Nation!




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I remember Len Harris.




Senator WATT:
  Yes, there's Len Harris. In fact, I think he's one of the only ones who didn't get thrown out, resign or get kicked out, expelled. Let's forget for a moment the fact that, over One Nation's entire history, 21 of the 30 One Nation MPs or senators have been thrown out for one reason or another and look at things more recently. Let's just think about what's happened since the double dissolution in 2016. I remember very well, because I was there for the induction of new senators, the parade surrounding Senator Hanson and her three new senators: Senator Burston, who's still with us; Senator Culleton, gone; and Senator Roberts, gone. If you look at that photograph of the One Nation senators who appeared down here, the only one still standing as a One Nation senator is Senator Hanson herself. Through her own actions, through letting down her own party members, she has managed to lose three of the four senators she arrived with. Not only that but she's actually managed to lose a fourth in Senator Anning. So this is a person who arrived in Canberra with three senators and has already managed to lose more than that—a total of four.


Obviously I have been very vocal over the last two years about the number of times Senator Hanson and One Nation have sold out their constituency of battlers right around Australia but particularly in my own home state of Queensland. They have sold out battlers on penalty rates by voting with the government to support cuts to penalty rates. They have sold out battlers on everything from childcare payments for low-income families to pensions. At one point they were going to be cutting bereavement allowances for grieving widows, until I and other Labor senators called them out on their behaviour. They have also continued to support this government in its cuts to public health, to hospitals, to schools, to training, to apprenticeships—every kind of government service that is provided to support the battlers Senator Hanson and her colleagues say they stand up for but come down here and vote against. I have lost count of the number of times Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues have sold out the battlers they say they care about.


It's no surprise that they keep doing this. Look at their voting record: all up, over the last couple of years, they have voted with this government, the Turnbull government—a Liberal government that is into supporting the top end of town—90 per cent of the time. If you just look at this year, the calendar year of 2018, One Nation and their senators have voted with this government 100 per cent of the time. Every single time there has been a bill before this parliament, where there's had to be a division and where Labor has stood against some action of the government—cutting health care, cutting education funding, cutting pensions, cutting apprenticeships—every single time Labor has voted against that legislation and tried to stop One Nation and the government from hurting battlers, what have One Nation done? They've toddled over and sat down with their friends in the Liberal Party. We know that's where they really line up. They don't actually care about battlers. They spend all their time out in regional Queensland saying that they care about battlers and that they're going to 'take it up to them in Canberra', but what do they do? They come down here, they get their riding instructions from Malcolm Turnbull and his Liberal Party and they continually sell out battlers.


I've noticed that Senator Hanson has had a lot to say about Senator Burston, her former colleague—one of her most loyal supporters over 20 years. She has actually managed to alienate someone who has been one of her closest confidantes for 20 years. I noticed that when Senator Burston raised some objections about the way the party was being run, Senator Hanson turned on him rapidly and said that she felt incredibly let down by Senator Burston. The only person—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Watt, please resume your seat. Senator Georgiou.




Senator Georgiou:
  On a point of order: what are the standing orders for speeches of this type of nature?



Senator Watt interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Watt, please be quiet. Senator Georgiou, any member at any time can seek leave. It is up to members in the chamber to agree to that leave by saying nothing or opposing that request to seek leave. Senator Watt sought leave and there were no voices opposing that, so he has leave to speak. Thank you, Senator Watt.




Senator WATT:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I'm not surprised that One Nation's last remaining senator, other than Senator Hanson herself, wants to shut this down. They are so embarrassed by their performance and the way that they have continually sold out battlers that they want to do everything they can to stop debate—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Watt, please resume your seat. Senator Georgiou.




Senator Georgiou:
  Point of order: how long will this go for? The clock is not counting down.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That's right. Because there was silence when Senator Watt requested leave—



Senator Watt interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Senator Watt, order. No-one requested a time on it and that's why the clock is not running. Thank you, Senator Watt.




Senator WATT:
  I won't be too much longer. I'm not surprised that Senator Georgiou wants to shut this down. You know, the simple way for him to avoid being embarrassed by One Nation's behaviour in the future is to follow what every other senator from One Nation has done and walk out on Pauline Hanson. That way you won't be embarrassed by coming down here and selling out—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Watt, when you're referring to senators and others please use their correct title.




Senator WATT:
  Okay. As I said, when Senator Burston was the latest person to walk out the revolving door that is the One Nation Party, I noticed that Senator Hanson rounded on him straightaway and said that she felt incredibly let down. She talked about why is she always let down by these people around her? I think that's a very good question. Why is it that after 20 years, 21 out of 30 One Nation MPs or senators have walked out on Senator Hanson?


There's a very serious point here: for all that Senator Hanson complains about being let down by the people around her, the simple truth is that the people who are really being let down by Senator Hanson and One Nation are the very battlers that they say they care about. They say they care about battlers, yet they come down here and vote with Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister, and his Liberals 100 per cent of the time.


As I've said already in this chamber this week, the debate that we're going to have about tax cuts is going to be the ultimate test of One Nation and where they stand. If they actually care about battlers, they will vote with Labor and the tax plan that we're putting forward, which would deliver a better tax cut for about 75 per cent of people in regional Queensland. If they don't care about battlers and if they yet again vote with the Liberal Party like they have every other time this year—100 per cent of the time this year—then we will know once and for all that Senator Hanson and One Nation are not about battlers; they are for billionaires.


It's about time they actually started following through on what they told battlers in regional Queensland and vote against this bill that is going to deliver massive tax cuts to high-income earners, especially in the Prime Minister's own electorate. Vote against that bill and vote with Labor to split the bill and to back the amendments that will back battlers.

Access by government to such confidential advice is, in practical terms, critical to the development of sound Commonwealth policy and robust lawmaking.

  It is the responsibility of the states and territories to fund TAFE and invest in TAFE facilities. The coalition government is leading the way with the Skilling Australians Fund. We've put $1.5 billion on the table for the states to invest in areas of need for skills training. To date, five states and territories have signed up. Each year the coalition government invests a further $1.5 billion under a special purpose payment to the states, effectively for them to use to support the vocational education and training sector. We want to see the states increasing their funding in vocational education and training, investing in apprentices and trainees, and helping us to deliver up to 300,000 new apprentices during the five-year program.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-06-19,"



Senator KETTER

 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:04):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate. It's quite clear that the government's tax plans are fiscally reckless. They are less progressive and they do fail Australian jobs. It's good to see in the newspapers today that, for once, there was accurate reporting of the Labor position on this issue. There was some reporting around the issue of the Senate Economic Committee's report on the personal income tax bill. As Deputy Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, I had the opportunity to participate in that inquiry. The Labor senators handed down a dissenting report in relation to that bill. In our dissenting report, we accuse the coalition of abandoning all hope of budget repair. We also talk about the fact that this government has an abysmal record on debt and deficit by attempting to legislate for the full package of personal income tax cuts, given the well-known downside risks to Australia's fiscal and economic position. 


The position that the government has taken on personal income tax is absolutely irresponsible. What we saw in the course of the Senate inquiry into the bill was that this government has adopted an ideological approach to income tax reform. The government should be looking at outcomes. Is its income tax reform directed at improving workforce participation or is it directed at improving consumer spending? No. These are not the issues which the government has been looking at. Its approach is an ideological one. It comes down to a mantra of lower taxes, looking at bracket creep and making the system simpler. The Treasury officials were obliged to explain that that was the rationale for this piece of legislation. 


During the course of this inquiry, we were quite disappointed at the lack of disclosure on the part of the government. We are entitled to know the total cost over the 11-year period of the Personal Income Tax Plan, which is roughly $144 billion. We, of course, know what the cost of the plan is over the forward estimates but, in the intervening years, we are not privileged or trusted with the information as to the annual costings in that intervening period, which is an absolutely ridiculous situation. The Treasury people were prevented from disclosing that information. We know that they had done the analysis but it fell to the Parliamentary Budget Office when I wrote to the Parliamentary Budget Officer to call for some detail around the costings of the government's plan. So we were able to see a breakdown of the seven components of the income tax plan. 


The Treasury officials were basically instructed to advise us that the figures were too uncertain. Despite the fact that we said, 'Please tell us that information, but you can put caveats around it or put qualifications; give us confidence intervals as to what degree of weight we can place on it,' they were not prepared to divulge that information. That is a ridiculous situation when we are talking about income tax cuts which are going to cost the budget $144 billion over the longer period. 


This is fiscal recklessness on a grand scale. We are assured that we are going to see a return to surplus by the end of the forward estimates but, on the present projections, we are looking at something less than one per cent of GDP in terms of the final surplus figure. That is a wafer-thin surplus. During the course of estimates, I had the opportunity to ask the head of Treasury, Mr Fraser, about his views on the risks associated with the global economy going forward, and he was very unequivocal about the fact that we now have heightened risks in the geopolitical area. That is a huge question mark over the amount of weight that we can place on that and on the level of risk associated with this plan.


During the course of our Senate inquiry we heard that in the budget there are a number of assumptions that underpin this surplus that some might describe as heroic assumptions: the fact that we've got productivity growth in the budget of 1.6 per cent, which is double the average that we've seen historically since the GFC—so, a historic assumption—and assumptions were made on migration. When it comes to wages growth, that's probably the greatest area of concern—a rate of wages growth of 3.5 per cent underpins the budget. Modelling done during the course of our inquiry showed that if wages growth was, for example, one per cent lower than what was being projected, that would have a $39 billion per annum impact on the budget in terms of revenue. The other area we're concerned about is the terms of trade. As I indicated previously, we are going through a period of time of global uncertainty and, if we have global shocks, that also has the potential to impact on our terms of trade. All of these assumptions are very nice for the government to put forward on the basis of this surplus, but I think we are really adopting a very risky approach.


We need to have long-term sustainability when it comes to the budget and when we're talking about the sorts of revenue we're looking at here. We need to ensure that as we go forward we have revenue coming through that is going to pay for the essential services Australians rely on—things like health, education and infrastructure. The moment we see any of these shocks impacting on the budget, we know that a future coalition government cannot be trusted in regard to cuts to health, education and infrastructure.


We also saw some of the assumptions that were underpinning the budget, in terms of behavioural impacts. We saw the tax cuts being directed at the higher-income end. We saw that Grattan advised that changes to marginal income tax rates do not provide much of a disincentive to work for people in the higher-income area when it comes to additional hours. The government would have been better advised to take the billion dollars from the tax cuts to the wealthy and instead put it into child care. That would certainly encourage greater workforce participation. The changes that come in with respect to the personal income tax package are really not directed at achieving anything useful.


I also want to mention here that this government is doing nothing about the rising gig economy, underemployment, stagnating wages, cuts to penalty rates, the theft of superannuation and the gender gap. They are crippled when it comes to energy policy and are ripping billions of dollars out of our education and health systems, yet they want to give billions of dollars to multinationals and to banks. In contrast, Labor would give people earning less than $125,000 a year a bigger tax cut. We believe in a better, bigger and fairer tax system. Under our plan more than four million ordinary Australian workers would be $398 better off each and every year. Labor is taking action to help working Australians with other cost of living pressures and will invest in our hospitals and our schools. We are uncapping an extra 200,000 places at university. We will review and invest in a TAFE system that has been neglected for years. Today is, of course, National TAFE Day, so we should be celebrating our TAFE system. These are measures that are proven to create jobs and foster economic growth. Labor can do these things because we won't be giving out massive tax handouts to business and to banks. Labor has a bigger, better, fairer plan for our tax system and we are ready for government.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:14):  I'd like to start off by commenting on a couple of comments my very good colleague Senator Ketter made there. He talked about the importance of revenue. Revenue is important, because if you don't have revenue, if you don't have a strong economy, then you can't actually support all the things you wish to support, whether they be education, health or national security. One of the problems that the Labor Party has had for a long time when it comes to revenue is that when budget forecasts come from Treasury there's always a span of estimates from a low side to a high side. On my side of politics we always take the conservative view, which is to say, 'Let's plan on the low side, in terms of income, and then regulate our spending accordingly,' whereas those opposite take the optimistic high side in terms of the expectations of revenue. Time and again that brings them undone, not only in government but even in opposition. We saw that frequently during the six years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments.


When Treasury costed Labor's retiree tax, for example, Labor said at the time that they expected to collect revenue of around a figure of $59 billion. With a bit more scrutiny it was then lowered to $55.7 billion, and now it's come down to $45.8 billion. These costings reveal that there are actually huge budget black holes in Labor's costings—in this case around $10 billion in the retiree tax—because of that propensity to overestimate revenue because it sounds good in the short-term.


I'm a great believer in always underpromising and overdelivering, as opposed to overpromising, and in this case the overestimation is bad. Not only is it bad in terms of overestimating; it doubles-down when people then spend what they estimated they would receive before the funds have come in. You've only got to think back to things like the mining tax. Not only was it an ill-considered tax that raised no money—in fact, it cost the government coffers money—but those opposite committed the revenue they thought they would achieve through the tax to other things and then the income from the tax never actually arrived.


The other thing Senator Ketter said was that Labor supports a bigger and better tax system. You can certainly believe that. If you add up all the various measures that they have looked to impose on the Australian public and business, you'll see they come to around $200 billion more in higher taxes. There's the retiree tax, which is around the receiving of refunds on the tax paid on share dividends. There's the housing tax, which is a $20 billion tax on mum and dad investors through the plan to abolish negative gearing for established homes. There's the investment tax, which is a $13 billion increase in capital gains tax for all assets through the halving of the 50 per cent CGT discount. There's the tax return tax, a $1½ billion impost courtesy of Labor's proposal to slap a $3,000 cap on the amount that individuals can claim for getting complex tax returns done. There's the higher income tax, a further $22 billion tax on wages. There's Labor's family business tax, a $22 billion tax on family businesses through Labor's plan to impose a 30 per cent tax rate on distributions from discretionary trusts. Bear in mind that discretionary trusts are the vehicles used by most small businesses because they help to balance out the peaks and troughs of cash flow, but small businesses have also been the engine, the driving room, of job creation over the past few years. In fact, throughout Australia's history small businesses have been the ones that create jobs. So, perversely, Labor are attacking the very people who generate employment, which is what generates the revenue that helps us keep the country going.


Finally, there's Labor's saving tax, some $25 billion worth of new taxes on your superannuation savings. There are measures like lowering the non-concessional contributions cap to $75,000, lowering the high-income super contribution to $200,000 and significantly reversing things like the introduction of catch-up concessional contributions. Part of the reason this was brought in was that we recognised that many people—women, for example—had been out of the workforce for a while and hadn't been paying into superannuation, and so catch-up provisions were made, so that the size of their superannuation nest egg had the opportunity to catch up. We think that's a fair thing that we should be maintaining for the working people of Australia.


As for the tax plans of this government, we have a long-term plan aimed at building a stronger economy in Australia. As I said right at the start, the reason a strong economy is important is that if you want a good health system, a good education system and strong national defence then you need to have a strong economy, because that's what underpins all these things. The tax relief we are looking for is phased in over a number of stages, but it's aimed to both create tax relief for individuals, easing the cost pressures that they're under, and to provide incentives for companies to create jobs. We've seen that those have worked. Over the last 12 months more than 417,000 jobs have been created, 75 per cent of which have been full time. Those who are cynical about those figures can also look at the number of people on welfare: 15.1 per cent, the lowest in 25 years. That means, even with the up and down of people who might lose a job or take a job when a job is created, in net terms we are moving people off welfare and into work. That is the best way of growing a stronger economy so we can afford the things Australia wants: better education, better health and stronger defence for this nation.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-06-19,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:21):  This is a picture of a parrot. It's a Western ground parrot. What do parrots have to do with tax cuts? They have everything to do with tax cuts. There was an excellent article by Lisa Cox in The Guardian today, entitled 'Foreign donations prop up Australia's endangered parrot response'. It is shameful that a German charity has had to contribute $200,000 for the protection and recovery of an endangered parrot in this country, because it is so underfunded in our threatened-species division. Three out of the most endangered birds in this country are in my home state of Tasmania, and the Greens recently uncovered at estimates that the department couldn't even tell us the last time they counted these birds, because the recovery plan hasn't even been funded. The Threatened Species Commissioner hadn't even been to King Island, where two of the three most endangered and likely-to-become-extinct birds in this country reside. We don't even know if they exist, because no funding has gone into this. We have a species extinction crisis in this country. We, shamefully, lead the world in species extinction.


My point is an important one. When we levy taxes, we raise revenue. That revenue is spent by governments on what it considers priorities. Funding has been slashed to the Department of the Environment and Energy, especially to the threatened-species unit. Here we find that German charities are having to pay for recovery plans for our most threatened species. It's disgusting. Where's the money for the public good of looking after our biodiversity and our species? It's not there. Yet we have before us in this Senate, any minute now, legislation for $144 billion in personal tax cuts. That is the government's priority in the sad and sordid tale of this 45th Parliament. Their piece de resistance, their legislation they are going to take to the election, is to give some Australians—mostly wealthy Australians—a tax cut. Nearly 60 per cent of Australians aren't going to get any tax cut at all. Nearly half of the tax cut benefits will go to the most wealthy 10 per cent of Australians. That's this government's priority. It's not funding services, threatened-species recovery plans, schools or hospitals. It is to give a tax cut to their rich mates, which will further add to inequality—arguably one of the biggest challenges of our time. We should run a ruler over everything we do in this place to see whether it adds to inequality or whether it can actually help reduce inequality. These tax cuts, by any measure, will not reduce inequality; they will make things worse. They will make the rich richer and the poor poorer.


If you don't earn an income in this country or you earn a low income because you're a part-time worker or a student or you're unfortunate enough that you have to be on Newstart or other benefits, you get nothing. You get absolutely nothing in this government's plan. So this motion before us today is absolutely correct. This government's tax plan will add to inequality. It will rip the guts out of our progressive tax system. A progressive tax system is one of the best tools we have for tackling inequality and raising revenue to pay for the services that we need.


The Greens will not support this package later today, an arms race in tax cuts. We want to see services properly funded in this country. You cannot take $144 billion of revenue and not expect services to be cut in the future. The western ground parrot is a good example of something that has already had services cut. We actually need to raise more revenue now, not less. Taking $144 billion out is an election bribe—that's what it is: it's a bribe. It's a trick to get votes and to keep the Liberal Party in power. I hope that the Australian people see it for what it is. I'm very much looking forward to both the second reading stage and the committee stage of this bill when it comes before the Senate.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-06-19,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:26):  I too rise to make a contribution in this very important debate on the government's tax plans, which are fiscally reckless, less progressive and fail in the area of Australian jobs. You can't be in this chamber for any length of time without asking yourself a little, 'What is going on here?' Here we have a government that's lost 34 consecutive Newspolls. They had a disastrous double-D election which delivered a crossbench which means that they negotiate with Senator Hanson and other people on every bit of contentious legislation, all created by the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull's leadership.


If we go back to Senator Mathias Cormann's contribution with the Hon. Tony Abbott and the Hon. Joe Hockey with the glass of wine and the cigar and The Best Days of Our Lives playing, they slashed and burned almost every Australian who was receiving some sort of income protection or benefit. We now have a situation which is described this way by our spokesman:


The government's tax plan achieves a rare trifecta. It's fiscally reckless, will lock in a less progressive tax system and will leave Australia less able to support Australian jobs in the event of a downturn.


I must confess that on Saturday I often do have a trifecta, but I do that with a vision of winning and enjoying those winnings. Here we have a government that wants to deliver a trifecta, including a less progressive tax system and being less able to protect Australian jobs in the event of a downturn.


We in the 45th Parliament are being asked to pass legislation which will bind the 46th Parliament and the 47th Parliament. This is quite extraordinary! Stage 1 from 1 July 2018 is fair enough—it's the 45th Parliament's work. Stage 2 is from 1 July 2022. It's quite conceivable that'll be outside the 46th Parliament. Then Stage 3 is from 1 July 2024. It's extraordinary! This government is acting as if it has just won 34 consecutive Newspolls with a 10 per cent margin and has resounding community support and—dare I say it—it's acting as if it has bipartisan support in this chamber. It can't get its legislation through without dealing with a fractious crossbench. Senator Cormann is lauded as this master of patience and for his negotiation ability, but the reality is he has to deal daily with the crossbench in passing any of this legislation.


And this proposal comes on top of the proposal to cut corporate taxes. It's gigantic. Senator Cormann always says, in an overabundance of goodwill and good humour, that he'll display all the relevant information to all the parties so we can all get on board with his grand plan. But the depth charge here is extraordinary. We've had 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth. This plan assumes that we're going to have 37 years. It assumes that we're going to continue to grow exponentially, without any hiccups at all. And the depth charge is simple. All of the stuff they couldn't achieve in the Abbott-Hockey-Mathias Cormann budget—the Hon. Tony Abbott, the Hon. Joe Hockey and the Hon. Mathias Cormann, with that glass of wine and cigar and The Best Days of Our Lives playing in the background—because the community revolted and they nearly lost the next election and the Hon. Tony Abbott lost his prime ministership over it, they're seeking to do with this depth charge into the future: a reduction of national income way beyond this parliament and into two future parliaments. But they figure that if they can get this through and the national income is reduced to that extent, one downturn and we will not be able to sustain the Australia that we currently have. We will not be able to sustain increases to the aged pension. We will not even be able to sustain the pitiful amount we pay to people on Newstart allowances, which is 20 years without an increase.


So, this is the game: 'We're going to give workers and aspirants a tax cut.' But what they're really doing is trying to constrain the income of future Australian governments—of which they have no idea what the composition will be—in terms of delivering service to all the respective participants in this economy. The last words in Senator Fawcett's contribution were about defence, a matter really dear to his heart. But there's no way that the provision of Medicare, defence, human services and the NDIS—any of these valuable and important services—to this country can be guaranteed if we're prospectively handing future income out the window. There will be no future income. If we get the corporate tax cuts through and we then compete with Singapore and Ireland, I don't know where it stops. Ireland is, I think, at 12 per cent, and Singapore at the moment is at 20 per cent. Do we have to go to 12 per cent? Is the $50 billion worth of corporate tax cuts going to be enough in that competitive arena? Then you add this halving, if you like, of future income. How is it possible that we can actually be debating this matter for two parliaments hence? We have no idea what the composition of the Senate will be. We have no idea who will be the successful government. Yet we've been asked to consider this with all seriousness.


The government have been a disaster since they got in. They tried to slash and burn. It didn't work. And now they've come up with this very innovative plan, and we on this side of the chamber are expected to say, 'Okay, yeah: let's do that.' Well, I'm sorry: I just don't think Australians will buy this. And when you dig down into who's actually getting what, there are modest benefits for hardworking Australians on low incomes. Labor will double that benefit. As for the tax-free threshold moving to 32 per cent, or thereabouts, for everybody earning under $200,000—a 32.5 per cent personal tax bracket from $120,000 to $200,000—if we can afford it and we can maintain the services and there's a proper evaluation and discussion and it's done in a rationale way then I'm sure that all parties would agree. But just putting that in place now, guessing that we're going to have 37 years of continuous economic growth, is really unusual and will definitely not be supported by this side of the chamber.


It really just beggars belief that the government can actually come in, as I've said, after 34 negative Newspolls and act as if they have broad community support for this plan, as if they've actually discussed it with the broader community. Has there been any feedback from all of the relevant stakeholders, or are they just going to say: 'Well, we're in charge. We're the government. This is going to happen'? Do they really think that Australians have a hip pocket nerve so big that they'll grasp at any tiny pittance of tax relief and forget that it could endanger valuable services that they get in education, health, transport, defence and, as Senator Whish-Wilson said, the environment? If we do decrease our national income, will we then have to make choices about how much we spend on the Great Barrier Reef? Will we then have to make choices about how much we spend on education? Will we then have to make choices about how much we spend on public transport or—dare I say it?—the infrastructure that connects our economy and makes it grow?


These are the simple propositions that are not answered by this extraordinary policy that's promoted by the Hon. Mathias Cormann, the Hon. Scott Morrison and others. It's quite extraordinary that any government would seek to come into the chamber and say the 45th Parliament will take action in the year 2024, which would probably be the 47th Parliament, when many of us may not even be here and there will be a vastly different composition in terms of the crossbenchers and the like. So I find the whole thing quite extraordinary and, to be perfectly frank, a bit bewildering. We're talking about $143 billion—not million but billion—in new tax cuts, much of it to be delivered in the years 2022 and 2024. It is quite extraordinary. I think Australians will judge it that way and reject it in a very clear, succinct and resounding manner.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-06-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:36):  Labor lies. Australians have come to understand those two words very, very clearly. I go back to the Keating Labor government. The Keating Labor government thought they were going to get done over in the 1993 election, so they actually legislated for a tax cut in the dying days of that parliament. Signed in blood, it was passed through both houses of parliament, where Labor had a majority. But, unexpectedly, Mr Keating won the 1993 election. The first bit of legislation they introduced when they got back into power was to repeal that piece of legislation which legislated the tax cut.


Then you've only got to go to more recent times: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' What was the first thing that happened? There was a bill to impose a tax. At the last election, it was, 'The government's going to privatise and sell Medicare.' Everybody who understood these things knew that was a lie, but, between the unions, GetUp!, the Labor Party and the Greens, Australians at election day only thought, 'Oh, we're a bit worried about this because so many people—Labor, the Greens, the unions and GetUp!—have said the government's going to sell Medicare,' and they were cautious in their vote. But everybody who knew anything about it knew that that was an abject and outright lie, as has been proved by subsequent events. Never, at any stage, was the government intending to privatise or sell Medicare. So those are just four Labor lies, and the mantra—it's in the Australian vernacular these days—really is those two words, 'Labor lies'. So for anything Mr Shorten says, anything Mr Shorten promises, the people of Australia will know that those promises come within the parameters of 'Labor lies'.


On the tax cuts that Senator Gallacher spoke about, when Mr Shorten was a minister in a government, in the economic areas that dealt with these things, he promised tax cuts for business for the obvious reason that if we're going to have investment in Australia—and investment creates jobs for Australians—then we have to be competitive in all things, including the rate of tax we charge on investment and companies. Mr Shorten knew that. That's why he was talking about it. That's why Labor governments back in the Hawke and Keating days actually reduced company taxes. They knew that to have a prosperous and working Australia you did need to encourage the investment of capital.


I'm not terribly bright, but you don't have to be an economic graduate to work out that, if you are a multinational company and you've got a lot of money to invest in a country in building a factory or building anything that will create jobs in that country, you can go anywhere—you can go to Switzerland, France, the United States, Sweden, South America or wherever you like—and do the same things: build a factory and create the same sorts of profits for your company. But if in one country you're going to pay 40 per cent on your profits and in another country you're going to pay 10 per cent on your profits, where are you going to put your investment? As I said, you don't have to be terribly bright to work out that these multinational corporations that invest in Australia and create jobs are going to go where they can get the best deal for their shareholders.


Mr Shorten understood that a few short years ago. Suddenly he's taken the populist approach. He hopes that most Australians will look only at their next pay packet and not to the long-term future. He's running around promising everyone huge tax cuts that he can't afford, that he can't pay for. He just hopes that people won't remember the underlying principle that Labor lies. Once Mr Shorten is in power—should the unthinkable happen—the first thing he will do is renege on the promises that he has made. The second thing he will do, if he sees investment going somewhere other than Australia, is start making it attractive for multinational companies to come to Australia and invest in Australia. Why do I know that he'll do that? Because he already advocated that a few years ago when he was a minister who was in charge of those sorts of economic things. Then Prime Minister Ms Gillard said the same things. They understood. Why have they now changed their tune completely? It is hypocrisy at its greatest. They are hoping that Australians are silly enough to believe them for a little period of time, but I think most Australians simply do understand that Labor lies.


Time doesn't allow me to go through some of the other stupidities in the Labor tax policy, but I will dwell for a moment on Labor's plan to stop Australians receiving refunds on tax paid on their share dividends. This is the reintroduction of double taxation. Mr Shorten is running around telling everyone, 'This will affect only the wealthy.' I'm sorry, but he can't have talked to older people and he can't have talked to people who live in their later years on the returns from investments they made during their working years. They get a substantial part of their income from share dividends. As one person quoted to me, they now find that, because of Mr Shorten's plan, they are going to lose $35,000 of their very meagre income, which is not much beyond that. If Mr Shorten had spoken to retirees, as I have recently, he would know that this is probably the most unpopular tax he has ever talked about.


I for one quite like Mr Shorten promising this, because it has clearly sent a message to older people who've worked hard during their lives and saved some money and put it aside so they can have a better future in their later years. They now know, 100 per cent, that Labor is not for them, that Labor lies. So I suppose, in a perverse sort of way, I appreciate Mr Shorten's promise on double taxation, the franking credits. It has galvanised so many older people that I know to not muck around with their vote next time and not be seduced by the Labor lies but to understand that, if Mr Shorten is Prime Minister, their standard of living and their income will drop dramatically. It's the same with the new taxes on superannuation. This is a direct assault on people who've worked hard during their lives, putting money aside for their savings. They are finding that the Labor Party are introducing some $25 billion worth of new taxes on their superannuation, lowering the annual non-concessional contributions et cetera.


You can only spend money on the Barrier Reef, as Senator Gallacher mentioned, and on education and health if you have an economy that is growing as it has grown under the Abbott and Turnbull governments. We are powering ahead economically. We are scheduled to get surpluses the year after next. Those surpluses will then go into a fund that can spend money on education, spend money on health and do whatever needs to be done on the Great Barrier Reef, amongst every other thing. You can only do that if you've got the money, and you'll only have the money if Australians continue to return the Liberal-National Party to government and take no notice of the Labor lies.

"Storer, Sen Timothy",IND,2018-06-19,"



Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (17:46):  There are numerous problems with the government's personal income tax package. There are questions about its fairness, its affordability and the political wisdom of making tax cut commitments so far into the future. All three issues go to the reasons behind my decision to propose amendments to the legislation that would simply deal with those elements of the package which would come into force at the beginning of next month.


The proposed low- and middle-income tax offset is fair, modest, affordable and provides immediate relief to low- and middle-income earners. These are the people who have suffered most from the wage stagnation which has plagued the Australian economy in recent years and shows no signs of improving. These are also the people who are struggling most to pay escalating bills for services they need and cannot avoid—electricity, for example. Although the offset would not be in their pockets until the financial year after next, it is budgeted through the forward estimates at around $4 billion a year through to 2022-23. The same goes for increasing the threshold for the 32½ per cent tax bracket from $80,000 to $90,000. Its price tag is relatively modest—no more than $550 million a year through the forward estimates—and it takes effect immediately. The same cannot be said for the rest of the government's package. For reasons of equity and fairness, I'm suggesting the low- and middle-income tax offset not be scrapped in 2022-23, as the government proposes.


In short, stages 2 and 3 of the package are bad policy and tricky politics. History tells us that it is imprudent, to say the least, to commit future parliaments and possible future governments to such massive cuts in revenue so far into the future. Stage 2 will not take effect until the years beyond the forward estimates, and it will be six budgets and at least two elections before stage 3 comes in.


Let's look briefly at the consequences of past governments tying the hands of future parliaments on tax. In 1993 Paul Keating promised two rounds of tax cuts if he was returned to office. He was asked shortly before the election how he could guarantee that they would take effect. His response was: 'Because they are l-a-w law. They are legislated.' The voters accepted his pledge in good faith and re-elected his government. Within four months, economic circumstances dictated that stage 2 of his promise be abandoned—and we all know the rest of the story.


It was a similar story in 2007 when Kevin Rudd accepted in large measure the last round of John Howard's promised tax cuts. They were offered at the height of the mining boom and could only be funded on the basis of the bloated revenues of the time. Come the global financial crisis, their introduction put massive stresses on the budget—stresses we are struggling with now and will be into the immediate future. Gross debt has risen to more than $500 billion and is still climbing. Interest rate payments are now running at $18 billion a year. We are paying the price to this day. This is money that cannot be spent on schools, hospitals and on much-needed roads and bridges in my home state of South Australia. This rash election pledge also had dire consequences not just for Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, as their repeated promises to return the budget to surplus failed to materialise, but for Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, when the voters rejected their drastic cuts in the 2014 budget. It is a warning we ignore at our peril. In politics, as in life, there is little worse than making a promise that may not be kept.



The very structure of the tax package is revealing. The fact that stages 2 and 3 are years into the future is an acknowledgment of the budget's fragility. If they were affordable they would be in place immediately. Instead, they are a lure to voters of a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow but not for another seven years. In estimates, Treasury Secretary John Fraser acknowledged that the projections beyond the forward estimates on which the government's figuring depends are subject to increasingly significant error bands. If this is the case, the sensible, prudent, responsible thing to do is for the Senate to vote only for stage 1, which is fair, modest and immediate. Should there be the slightest slippage in what respected economists believe are optimistic projections, to say the least—especially on wages—the result would be even more debt and even fewer services. The likelihood is that this would mean lower growth, more wage stagnation, slower increases in employment and a bigger welfare bill. The only alternative would be to dump the tax cuts in stages 2 and 3. The consequences of that would be on the heads of those who are thinking of supporting them this week. Fiscal responsibility and fairness demand the Senate deal only with the tax cuts immediately in front of them. There is no reason to legislate tax cuts four and six years away except to hold future parliaments to ransom and hold out to voters what may well prove to be false hopes. (Time expired)

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:51):  Labor will be voting in accordance with the principles of fairness and responsibility, voting in accordance with our values and with our principles. That is what Labor does, that is what Labor stands for and that is why we have come to the position today, through our caucus, unanimously, to support stage 1 of the government's tax package. Of course, we have our own bigger and better tax cuts to lower- and middle-income Australians, which we are urging the parliament to support. I take note of Senator Storer's comment that stages 2 and 3 are bad policy. They are tricky politics. That is what we've come to learn about this coalition government and about Malcolm Turnbull. He's very good at the tricky politics and he's very good at going back on his own values and principles.


You won't find that happening on the Labor benches. Labor is taking a much more responsible and fair approach. We are prepared—very much so—to stand by our values. We are prepared to do what we think is responsible. We also are prepared, as we've shown time and time again, to lead on the economic debate. Over the last five years we have led, we have taken risks and we have been the responsible party when it comes to our Australian budget. I believe those risks will pay off, because the Australian people will see the benefits to our country and to them individually. They will also pay off because people will see through the tricky politics and bad policy that comes about in stages 2 and 3 of the government's current package.


We will continue to fight to ensure that low- and middle-income Australians get a fair share rather than the top tax bracket being the largest beneficiary in some six years' time—some two elections down the track. It is just ludicrous that the government is putting forward tax cuts in this way for the top end of town. It's also unfair that the Prime Minister is quite happy for someone on $200,000 a year to pay the same rate of tax as someone on $50,000 a year. That is incredibly regressive. Again, that is why, when you look at this package in its totality, you find that it is unfair.


We have asked the government to split these packages in order to allow low- and middle-income Australians to get the tax relief that they need and deserve as soon as possible. It is up to the government to make its mind up on that, but we have asked that it be done. Tax relief for some 10 million Australians could go ahead on 1 July if the Turnbull government were not holding middle-income Australians to ransom while it tries to defend these other stages, particularly stage 3—its tax relief to millionaires. Millionaires in this country don't need tax relief. Why? They're millionaires; that's why. Someone on $50,000, someone on $80,000, a family trying to make ends meet and trying to get ahead—they do need some tax relief, and that is what Labor's package is all about. Malcolm Turnbull needs to recognise that. I know he probably doesn't understand what it is like to live on $50,000, but he could at least have some understanding and stop standing in the way of tax relief. Tax cuts this year for people like teachers and tradies should not be held to ransom for the sake of tax cuts for bankers and big CEOs. That is what we are asking of this government. We are saying to the Australian people that, if Labor is elected, we will almost double our tax cuts and make them permanent, while asking those in the top tax bracket to pay a little more to help reduce the debt in our country. I think that's fair. That's what Labor stands for. It's decent.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (17:57):  I have to confess that I break out in a cold sweat every time I'm confronted with the Australian Labor Party and their coalition partners, the Greens, lecturing us on matters of the economy. I'm not anti-Labor. As I have said in this place before, I grew up in a Labor household in a Labor suburb and my parents were supporters of the Labor Party all their lives. But I very quickly learnt there are two things that the Labor Party have no idea about, and often the policies and programs they pursue combine the two. I don't intend to spend too much time on the Greens—I flicked on the TV before, and one of the Greens contributors was telling me about extinct birds and how somehow they had some impact on the financial management of the country—but what I do want to say is that the Labor Party cannot manage an economy and they know nothing about rural, regional and provincial Australia. They don't care about it. It's not their base. If you chopped down the Tree of Knowledge in Barcaldine, they would have no reason to leave anywhere with a postcode that ends in three zeros.


Let's look at both together. I was interested in the contribution just made by Senator Singh. If you follow its logic, all corporations are owned and occupied by millionaires. There are hundreds of thousands of corporate businesses in this country that are structured as proprietary limited enterprises for very sound and valid reasons, and they're going to miss out on corporate tax cuts because we have this class distinction happening—that is, if you happen to pay a corporate tax rate, somehow you are a millionaire and you can afford to pay more.

  And superannuation.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Superannuation is a perfect example. We have a Labor policy that is even going to abolish franking credits coming back to many retired Australians, many of them lifelong supporters of the Australian Labor Party. I think that will play out for them at the next election. Senator Williams, don't keep distracting me; I have a core message to get through here in my eight minutes. The Australian Labor Party and the Greens can't be separated on the question of economic management. They left all that dirty offal down all the hallways of this place when they left government—




Senator Sterle:
  Oh, that's a bit harsh!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  leaving it for us to come here with a mop and a bucket to try to clear up an over-$300-billion debt. You want to talk about fiscal management? And I heard the contribution from you, Senator. You want to talk about looking into the future? You should have been here and lectured the Labor Party when they got a clean balance sheet from John Howard and Peter Costello. You should have talked about how you don't make decisions that go into the future. They could have done with your advice about how they racked up this enormous debt.


We pride ourselves on good financial management, good fiscal constraints. It has taken us longer than it ever has before when we've taken over government from Labor and the Greens to try to get the budget back into some semblance of order. Even now it remains a struggle. And I can tell you this: there are only four ways money can be managed by a federal government. One is to borrow more, and nobody has an appetite for that. One is to charge more in taxes and for services. No-one has an appetite for that. The third category is to cut services. Well, everyone puts their hand up to cut services—until, of course, you reflect on a service that affects them. They always want you to cut a service that affects someone else: 'Get the people off the dole,' they say, and, 'Single mothers—punt them.' But if you start to talk about the pension or some other thing that affects them, of course, they have a different view of the planet. But it is the fourth one that is primary to all economic management. This parliament can't get us out of this quagmire that we're in. I've said it before: the only way we're going to get out of this quagmire is to stimulate the economy, where private sector corporations, small businesses and partnerships, in agriculture and elsewhere, pay more in tax receipts into this place, and then we have some expenditure restraints. That's the only way. There is no other formula. You can buy lottery tickets every fortnight on behalf of the government and try to get out of it that way, but that's not going to work.


Because of the limited time, I want to concentrate on the corporate tax cuts. I've been in business for 30 years, and there are not that many people in this place who've been in business for 30 years—and I mean reasonably sized businesses. I'll tell you what happens. This has been my experience. When I got to the end of the year and I'd spent all the money that I needed to spend to operate my business and I'd paid my income tax and other contingent liabilities and made provision for them and I had money left, I didn't pack up and go to Bali to play golf. I promise that in my case I did not.



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I was having a shot at you, Senator Sterle, but you've put yourself into the frame there! I didn't go and buy a bigger house. What I did was reinvest in my business. What were the implications of that? Oftentimes it increased employment so that I could increase the productivity of my companies and they, in turn, could prosper. So, people were employed. They prospered. They came off unemployment. They came into employment. It made a contribution to the receipts of the country. I tried to make myself more profitable and invested in that on many occasions—the advent of technologies, changes in practices. I invested heavily in that. That resulted in us doing a better job—more productivity, making some more money. And if it wasn't making more money then it was having more disposable income left at the end of the year. What did I do with that? I reinvested in the business again, as most businesses do. And when I employed more people I had to get them to do something. They went and poured concrete, or they drove a nail into a piece of timber, or they drove a truck, or they picked up some commodities and moved them from A to B. So every additional cent I got went back into the economy. That meant that the timber yard, the hardware store—all of these other businesses that relied on us as satellites to our business—also did better. They paid more income tax. They employed more people, and they, in turn, spent it.


I don't expect the Australian Labor Party or the Greens—the Australian Labor Party in particular—to understand these principles. Their specialty is to sit and wait until the private sector does well, and then they're waiting there at the door to take a slice of the action. That's what they do. They don't know how to build wealth. They don't know how to create strong business environments. They don't know how to manage the economy. They're waiting to take something off someone else for the effort, the investment and the risk they've made. These tax cuts are responsible, they're needed and, if you have a look at where they've happened in the world, they will promote an increase in our economy and give a benefit to the nation.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (18:08):  I wish to comment on the government response to the Rural, Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report entitled Increasing use of so-called Flag of Convenience shipping in Australiaand move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The government has finally come back with, let's say, a response. This inquiry had gone on for about 18 months. It was a very interesting inquiry by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. Senator O'Sullivan and I found ourselves at many meetings on this important topic. It started with, I think, a report by Four Corners or one of those shows—it was a couple of years ago—on a ship, the Sage Sagittarius, an infamous ship, which was crewed by foreign workers. I say at the outset so that everyone is clear that, at every stage of this inquiry, I had nothing against foreign workers, but I get pretty cranky when they are brought in and exploited, and they replace Australian jobs. I make no apology for that—never have, never will. Aussies must come first. It's pretty simple. I'd love to hear that side agree with me. They won't. They all just look down at their iPads or their iPhones and hope to Christ that no-one was listening and I won't single them out, but I won't single them out because they're all just as guilty as each other.


The Sage Sagittarius had Captain Salas, the Filipino captain. He is notorious. He has admitted to being a gun runner. On his watch, there were two deaths at sea on this ship: Filipino seafarers. Then there was one death when the ship was unloading back in Japan. The owners of the ship had put in a detective working under—what do you call it?




Senator Scullion:
  Cover.




Senator STERLE:
  Undercover, yes, thanks—and somehow, mysteriously, when the ship berthed when it was unloading, unfortunately, he was killed. We're still waiting to find out what the heck happened there. Anyway, that was the crux of it.


I'm just going to quickly go through this. There are some significant recommendations. I have spoken many, many times about this issue in many forums and many times in this place, so I won't go over much old ground, but the committee—and this was a unanimous report—put, I think, about seven or eight recommendations to the government. We said, 'This is what needs to be done.' You must remember that, back in 1992, there was a similar inquiry into ships of shame. I'm sad to inform the Senate and all those poor devils out there listening that nothing has changed.


We have a government that are doing their best—come charging down and attack me, every member of the coalition, if you think I'm lying—and doing everything they can to see the demise of the Australian shipping industry. I've said it many times. No-one has ever yelled at me and said I'm making it up, because that's what they're darn well doing. They can lie through their eyeteeth about how good they are and how they're looking after Aussies and—what was the catchcry?—jobs and growth. That's as long as they're not Australian jobs and as long as it's not in the Australian shipping industry. Where the hell are all our seafarers going to come from—our masters, our skippers, our captains? Where the heck are all our hardworking seafarers going to come from? I'll tell you where they're going to come from with that mob, the LNP, over there: they'll come from Libya, the Philippines, Iran or whatever it is. Unfortunately, that's where it's heading.


And they're not alone. They've got partners in crime. I'll tell you right now: you can put BP and Caltex in that. We used to have Australian seafarers on Australian ships plying their trade between our ports. Not anymore, people. It's all done by foreign seafarers, and that lot over there think it's great, because that lot over there think they're doing a fantastic job. One of my recommendations—it was the committee's, but I chaired it—I want to share with everyone listening. Recommendation 1 was:


The committee recommends that the Fair Work Ombudsman implement a program of inspection for ships with foreign seafarers, to verify that the wages paid on board accord with Australian legal requirements.


We're not making something up. That is what's supposed to happen. What was the response from the government? There was another recommendation I want to share too, and then I'll give you the response. The committee also recommended:


… that the Australian Government provide adequate funding to the Fair Work Ombudsman to implement an inspection program of ships with foreign crews, to assess the payment of wages.


That's pretty simple, not hard at all.


This was the government's response, everyone: 'The Australian government does not support these recommendations.' But here's the rub: 'Furthermore, the government considers that the current arrangements for compliance in the maritime sector are sufficient and the Fair Work Ombudsman is adequately funded to support these arrangements.' Crap. Let me just give you a couple of examples. Geez, I tell you: it's really hard to control myself when I start talking about the shipping industry being torn apart and Australian jobs being exported. Then they lie. Then they can't even tell the truth. They expect us to believe that they're doing this? Let me just give you a couple of classic examples here.


In December last year, there was a ship, a Bahamas-registered vessel called the Diana, which pulled up in Melbourne. The ITF did what they normally do. They got on board. Lo and behold, they found out that this Australian company owns the Diana: Canada Steamship Lines Australia—CSL. Yes, what a great company they are! I really have got my tongue firmly planted in my cheek. In fact, when I pull my tongue out, they're far from a decent Australian company, because they are absolutely guilty of underpayment of wages. The ITF found out. The ITF are prosecuting them. They are an Australian company that have replaced Australian seafarers with foreign seafarers and foreign ships. They're getting ably assisted by that lot over there. CSL Australia also have the vessels Acacia, Adelie and Diana. You know what? What a great Australian company CSL are, because they're even refusing to sign industrial agreements so their workers can be paid Australian wages and conditions! So, Government, there's one of your mates that's out there rorting it and got caught out.


Here's another one. This is why they're telling us the Fair Work Ombudsman is funded well and they're doing a great job. They're not. This goes back to April last year. This is right in the heart of the inquiry. ITF, the International Transport Workers' Federation, lassoed the Aussie charterers of:


… a Norwegian shipping company that was allegedly—


or not allegedly; in the end, that's what they did—


paying its foreign crew a pitiful—


are you ready for this?—


$1.25 an hour while working in Australian waters.


This mob of jokers over there is trying to tell the committee, who worked their backsides off talking to the industry about the deficiencies that have been around for many years—rehashing Ships of shame,from 1992—that there is nothing to see. This is typical of LNP ministers: 'Tuck it under the desk and hopefully no-one will talk about it.' Well, we're going to keep talking about it.


So let's have a look at what they did while they were ripping off these foreign workers in Australian waters. The Fair Work Ombudsman launched an action against a mob called Transpetrol TM, claiming it underpaid no fewer than 61 foreign crew members—here we go!—a total of $255,000 when they worked on the oil tanker MT Turmoil in Australian waters between 2013 and 2015. That is carting BP's and Caltex's products around, because BP and Caltex—yes, the fuel mobs who can't wait to rip into Australian motorists at every opportunity; talk about cartels!—replaced Australian manned ships, as I said earlier, with a chartered Norwegian owned ship. I have to tell you that it just irks me. These are only a couple of examples.


I can go through all these recommendations and, lo and behold, the government doesn't accept any of them. They try to rub a little bit of salt in the wound by telling me, when we are going further, about making sure that environmentally and industrially everything is Mickey Mouse. It's not Mickey Mouse. I'll talk about that too. Here's another one. There was one I saw recently, a couple of weeks ago. Eighty-odd containers fell off a ship coming into Sydney. It was a Liberian registered ship. So what? I'll tell you so what. It was heavy seas. Yes, we know these sorts of things happen. They fell off before midnight, but it was 11 o'clock the next morning before AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, was even notified. I can tell you now: there is no way known that an Australian crewed or Australian owned ship or Australian seafarers or an Australian captain would have waited 11 or 12 hours before they thought they might decide to let AMSA know.


I'll have a lot more to say about this. I will seek leave to continue my remarks. I'm not going away. It is an absolute disgrace in our nation that the LNP government under Mr Turnbull, and previously Mr Abbott, cannot wait to wave goodbye to the Australian shipping industry, Australian seafarers and Australian ships. I've got to tell you: the Americans have the Jones Act, and it's about darned time that we had the same act—I don't care what name you call it. It's about time that we started building Australian owned, Australian built, Australian crewed ships, with Australian seafarers, Australian skippers and the whole lot. I have a lot more to say. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

AUSTRALIAN ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY (TRANSITION) BILL 2018


I am pleased to introduce the Australian Astronomical Observatory (Transition) Bill 2018, to support and give effect to the government's 2017-18 Budget measure 'Maintaining Australia's Optical Astronomy Capability'.


The new measure ushers in change, growth and a bright new era for Australian optical astronomy.


Astronomy and astrophysics are major scientific strengths for Australia. The spectacular discoveries and images created by our astronomers advance scientific understanding, stimulate interest by young people in scientific careers, and inspire all of us to think about our place in the universe.


Astronomy also leads to technological innovations with important spin-off applications valued by society, such as such as digital cameras, satellite global positioning systems, medical image processing software and CSIRO's development of Wi-Fi technology. 


The Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, near Coonabarabran has, since 1974, served generations of Australian and visiting overseas astronomers as one of the world's most productive observing facilities, in scientific output, publications and citations.


In 2010, the Australian Government assumed full ownership of the telescope and established the Australian Astronomical Observatory as our national optical astronomy organisation. The AAO, as it is known, continued to serve the astronomy community as a division of the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, providing our astronomers with excellent observing facilities and services.


At its North Ryde headquarters in Sydney, AAO scientists and technical specialists continued to develop innovative instruments and technologies to keep the telescope at the forefront of discovery, and provide sought-after scientific capabilities to overseas telescopes.


The 3.9 metre Anglo-Australian Telescope is no longer in the top tier of telescopes globally as it had been in its earlier decades. In the last two decades, larger, more powerful telescopes have been dominating overseas: the so-called 'eight-metre' class telescopes (a reference to their primary mirror diameters) and the even larger 'thirty-metre' class telescopes now under construction. 


These large telescopes and their high-performance instruments extend the boundaries of scientific discovery, seeing farther into the cosmos, detecting fainter objects, and resolving finer details. These are the telescopes of the future.


Through its Decadal Planning process, the Australian astronomy community highlighted a pressing, unmet national need for a stable, long-term partnership in a multi-national optical observatory. Such a partnership would provide Australia's astronomers with access to the world's best suite of eight-metre class telescopes and, through this access, enable them to remain internationally engaged and relevant in addressing the most important scientific questions of the era.


Recognising the transformation in the global astronomy sector and this pressing need to maintain our place in the discoveries of the future, the government is prioritising Australia's partnership in front-line multi-national astronomy infrastructure and working with the university sector to ensure that our domestic capability supports this.


On 11 July 2017, the government entered into a 10-year Strategic Partnership with the European Southern Observatory.


ESO, as it is known, operates the world's foremost collection of optical-infrared telescopes on high mountain summits in Chile's Atacama Desert. This includes the renowned quartet of 8-metre telescopes that comprise the 'Very Large Telescope', with their many advanced scientific instruments to analyse the light they collect from distant reaches of the cosmos.


The Australia-ESO Strategic Partnership gives our astronomers long-term, stable access to ESO telescopes at La Silla and Paranal Observatories in Chile.


It will enable our institutions to collaborate in developing new instrumentation, and open the door to Australian companies to tender competitively for ESO contracts at La Silla and Paranal.


The government recognises the ongoing value of the domestic astronomical facilities and the expert capability in the Australian Astronomical Observatory.


Prior to the government's optical astronomy measure in 2017-18, funding for AAO operations was due to terminate by 30 June 2020.


With strong, strategic backing from Australia's university sector, the government's optical astronomy measure is supporting the transfer of the AAO's critical domestic astronomical activities, assets and expert staff from the Commonwealth to new university-led consortia. 


The Australian National University will lead a consortium to continue to operate the Anglo-Australian Telescope into the mid-2020s. By extending its operations by a further five years, we are extending the benefits of this telescope as an observing platform to astronomers, a testbed for new instrumentation innovations, and a community treasure for Coonabarabran. 


The government is working with Macquarie University to develop a national optical instrumentation capability that will continue and further develop the AAO's renowned instrumentation activities. This work will be supported by Astronomy Australia Limited—a not-for-profit company that manages a range of research infrastructure programs for astronomy—through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy.


The new consortium in Sydney will link with other Australian centres of expertise to design and build excellent optical instruments for observatories here and overseas. The capability will have an industry focus to address technical challenges, commercialise Australian innovations arising from astronomy, and potentially develop new applications beyond astronomy.


The Australian Astronomical Observatory (Transition) Bill provides for a smooth domestic astronomy transition from the Commonwealth to the new consortia. It retains key astronomical functions of the Australian Astronomical Observatory Act 2010 to provide a legislative basis for future government initiatives to continue to enable Australian astronomy engagement and excellence.


The government's optical astronomy measure will strengthen Australia's research and industry opportunities in the coming decade, extend the legacy of the Australian Astronomical Observatory and its global reputation, and ensure Australia remains at the forefront of global optical astronomy research.


I commend this Bill to the Chamber. 


COMMERCE (TRADE DESCRIPTIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 2018


The Government is committed to bringing Australian border legislation into alignment with the country of origin labelling safe harbour defences under the Australian Consumer Law.


In 2017, the Government enacted the Competition andConsumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Act2017 to simplify and clarify the safe harbour defences under section 255 of Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act as part of its reform to Australia's Country of Origin Labelling framework. These defences enable a person to make a claim about the origin of the goods sold domestically without contravening the provisions of Schedule 2.


These defences are currently not available to importers who are required to apply a trade description on goods proposed to be imported into Australia.


The Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Amendment Bill 2018 would amend the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act1905 to enable importers to make a claim about the origin of goods, similar to those permitted under the Australian Consumer Law, without contravening the offence against a false trade description.


The alignment would reduce the complexity of enforcing origin marking requirements at the border, allowing the Australian Border Force to focus compliance activities on goods that do not meet the safe harbour defences.


The Bill would also insert an express head of power in the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act to enable the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Regulation 2016 to be amended to incorporate information standards that are in force or existing from time to time. This is currently not possible without an express head of power.


As information standards are amended from time to time, the Bill will enable the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Regulation to be amended to automatically incorporate changes to information standards.


HEALTH INSURANCE (APPROVED PATHOLOGY SPECIMEN COLLECTION CENTRES) TAX AMENDMENT BILL 2018


This Bill reduces the regulatory burden on the pathology sector without increasing the overall taxation burden. It amends the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Act 2000 (the Pathology Tax Act) to require the tax payable on the grant of an approval of an Approved (Specimen) Collection Centre (ACC) to be paid every two years.


The Pathology Tax Act imposes a tax on the grant of an approval, or renewal, of a pathology specimen collection centre. Medicare benefits can be claimed for pathology services provided using specimens collected at an ACC.


The Pathology Tax Act currently imposes a tax of $1,000 for an approval of renewal of an ACC granted for a period of one year. Under the current arrangements, existing ACCs must renew their registration and pay this tax every 12 months. As an interim measure, in 2016, the Government agreed that all new ACCs may only be initially registered for a period of six months, with a $500 tax imposed. These ACCs can then be renewed annually. This requires pathology providers to complete application forms and pay the associated tax twice within a six month period. The interim arrangements were put in place with support from the pathology sector pending the development of the suite of measures to strengthen compliance arrangements.


This Bill will allow approvals to be granted for a two year period and will see no increase to the tax imposed. This Bill will amend the existing Pathology Tax Act to require the tax payable on the grant of an approval of an ACC to be amended from $1,000 annually to $2,000, to be paid two yearly. This will assist in addressing regulatory burden by streamlining administrative processes that the pathology sector encounter with the current arrangements. The rate of the tax has not been changed since the Act was enacted in 1999. After careful consideration the Government has determined that there should be no increase to the tax at this time to ensure that smaller pathology providers are not negatively impacted.


The Department has been, and will continue to engage with key stakeholders prior to 1 July 2018 to advise of the amendment to the tax and the extension of the timeframe for new and renewed ACC applications, including reaffirming the key elements of the measure announced in the 2017-18 Budget.


The Health Insurance (Eligible Collection Centres) Approval Principles 2010 (the Approval Principles) set out the terms for approvals of ACCs. Currently ACC approvals are required by the Approval Principles to be renewed every 12 months. It is intended that the Approval Principles will be amended to extend ACC approval periods to two years to reflect amendments to the Pathology Tax Act.


These changes will be welcomed by the pathology sector as it decreases the effort currently involved in annual ACC renewal.


These amendments contribute to the implementation of the 2017-18 Budget measure 'Pathology Approved Collection Centres — strengthening compliance', which includes new compliance arrangements, strengthening compliance activities related to prohibited practices by increased data collection and analysis; automation of applications, cancelations and renewals through the Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) of the Department of Human Services. These amendments further complement these compliance activities by extending and streamlining ACC approval periods from one to two years, with the tax adjusted from $1,000 each year to $2,000 every two years.


In summary, this Bill will reduce the regulatory burden of pathology providers and will not negatively impact smaller pathology providers as there is no increase to the financial component. The tax will be paid two yearly instead of annually.
