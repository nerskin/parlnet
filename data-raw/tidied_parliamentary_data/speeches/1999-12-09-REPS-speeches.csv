"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—The situation is that the government has been forced to come to this position by the persistent attitude of the Labor Party with regard to the need for a thorough and effective Wood and Paper Industry Council. The alternative of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation essentially continues his attitude and the attitude of the minister for industry over the last few years of essentially an inoperative, ineffective and basically inactive role by the government with regard to industry development.
It is interesting to note that, in contrast to the government's position, which essentially allows the minister to appoint an undefined group of people, the opposition's committee actually talks about a series of objectives, such as international competitiveness and the principles of ecologically sustainable development. It defines the functions of the council. It sets requirements on which the sectors of the industry are represented—hardwood, softwood, pulp and paper—and sets out a number of other requirements with regard to reporting to the general public, the number of meetings to be held, et cetera.
It is really of very little consolation that the minister runs around the press gallery telling people that the greatest thing that has happened in the last 20 years is that the CFMEU might join his committee. The reality is that the opposition's committee stems from the needs of the industry and the needs of the union. In summary, it is pleasing that the minister has at least moved some way from his previous attitude that essentially the industry will operate and development will occur through market forces and we can just sit on our backsides doing nothing.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,9,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I find this all quite interesting. A few fundamentals are associated with representing your own constituency, and the first is to recognise that politics is the art of the possible. The government made it very clear how far they were prepared to go in having a legislative arrangement for a committee of this nature. In direct discussions with the shadow minister, 
 we made that point, to which, as I said in my original comments on this matter, the point was made to us by the shadow minister, `If the CFMEU and the unions are happy with what you propose, that should be good enough,' the suggestion being that they would not be.
We put a proposition to them, and in all honesty they came back with some criticism, which we accommodated. They then wrote us a letter and said, `We find your proposal quite satisfactory,' they having the pragmatism to understand that it was better to have that proposal in legislation than nothing. The shadow minister tries to make the point that what they had was better. That is a view they hold very much to themselves. I do not think it was. I think, for a start, it was too restrictive. I see the member for Bruce has just entered the chamber with a newspaper. You do not want to talk about that; I am just starting to write a letter protecting you blokes. Do not think there is only one side to that argument. If you disagree with me, you are silly. So don't be trying to play that card.
—Order! The minister will address his remarks through the chair. The chair is not silly.
—I know, but we have dopey cows like this coming into the place. We are on a serious subject, and suddenly you think you can isolate one member. You do it! You get out there and do an Andren, and see how you finish up.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That idiot is making claims he has no right to make. I have done nothing other than show an article to the shadow minister.
—There is no point of order.
—It is like another member of theirs who stood up yesterday with a privileged document of a late constituent and thought it was more important to get a political point than represent the interests of that person as all other members in this place would with the normal processes.
—Perhaps the minister would return to the subject of the bill.
—I think that is a good idea. But I thought that was about the lowest thing I have witnessed in this place since I have been here. But let me get back to what we are talking about. What was done clearly demonstrates the agenda of the opposition in terms of this committee. They did not want the committee. They do not want anything to happen in that area, because the green interests of the salubrious western suburbs of Perth now override, in the opposition party, the interests of the western suburbs of Sydney and regional timber workers.
 Let me just tell you what has happened. They threw the baby out with the bathwater in the Senate. Yesterday the steering committee of the action agenda met and included in their numbers, at my invitation, was Mr Trevor Smith, the national secretary of the timber industry CFMEU. Trevor dropped in the day before to discuss this particular matter, and we were in very great agreement that that steering committee's first job should be to put their structures together for the advisory committee we intend to have without legislation.
Yesterday I was criticised because I had said in the second reading speech to the parliament that the advisory committee would be chaired by the minister. That was slung off at. I said the day before yesterday to the union people, `Look, we've put Senator Gibson in as chairman of the steering committee, and I am entirely in the hands of the steering committee as to who is the future chairman.' The union said, `We insist it's you, Minister.'
—You like that!
—I am complimented by it. (Extension of time granted)  The CFMEU is very confident in the government's administration, and I am not going to waste the time of the House by reading back some of their recent press releases. They have made it very clear they are not only dissatisfied with the opposition's approach on these matters but also betrayed. Considering the history of the seat of McMillan—the truck blockades, the 
 truck marches and all those sorts of things—did the member for McMillan go around as he was doorknocking and say, `Listen, fellas, I've got to tell you something. When we get into government, we are going to walk away from the National Forest Policy Statement principles. We are going to betray a promise that the union says the Leader of the Opposition gave to you'?
—Speaking of betrayal, where were you when the workers of Swifts Creek needed you?
—The reference to Swifts Creek is one for the state government to resolve, and the member knows it, and he has not resolved it yet either. But it is a state government issue and always was.
Mr Zahra interjecting—
—It is not even in his electorate, what is more. But the reality of the big deal is that there will be more investment at Swifts Creek when people know the RFA signed for that region is guaranteed in legislation. The member for McMillan snuck under the carpet when the last vote was on. He was absent all day. He was not here when the vote was on.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the minister is casting aspersions about why I was not here for a vote. I was actually there helping the workers of Swifts Creek resolve the problem.
—There is no point of order.
—You have not got them a sawmill, and that was a frivolous point of order. On the day of the vote, the poor old member for Lyons and the poor old member for Bass had to come in here and put their jobs on the line, but little Mr Sneaky writes me a letter.
—Order! You will withdraw that.
—I withdraw it. The fundamental aspect of all this is the two-faced attitude of individual opposition members on this issue. They say, `I am fighting for you boys; I am fighting in the caucus.' I tell you what: you never win. So what are you doing 
 then? I will tell you, Mr Acting Speaker, why they do not win. They do not win because their leader, along with his Oxford mate, Gallop, is more interested in the western suburbs of Perth than he is with the workers of McMillan. I am quite happy for us to turn up there, and the member for McMillan can stand on the platform with me and debate the issue. The CFMEU will organise a meeting any time the opposition like and they can speak on that. In fact we are going to have some meetings in McMillan and we are going to have stop-work meetings so that those people can understand what is happening to them in this place.
Yesterday the industry men—including the union—were in a steering committee. What were they there for? They were there to form this advisory council and it has the full support of the CFMEU because they see it as constructive, and they are insisting that I chair it. You would not give them anything. The opposition knew that they could not deliver on that matter and denied their colleagues an alternative which they had said they would accept—and a meeting which they want me to chair. So they put up a proposition knowing that it would be rejected in this place where the government happens to sit. We will also deal with the other matters that they deliberately put up. The fundamental purpose of the original bill—of which this is an amendment—was to do one thing and one thing only, and that was to guarantee that the agreements made between state Premiers and the Prime Minister had some standing in legislation so that the people who would potentially rebuild Swifts Creek would know that if some action of a future government—which seems more than likely given the way that the opposition has been carrying on—was to damage their investment they would get compensation.

"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—In many respects, I am getting thoroughly sick and tired of having to come in here and speak on the amendments that the Labor Party keep insisting on applying to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . Let us remember what this legislation was all about. I do not think it was ever going to be put in in the 
 first place by the Labor Party. If we go back to 1992 and their National Forest Policy Statement, I do not think they ever envisaged that they would have legislation. I think they wanted—and they made great sounds in 1992 and we supported them on the National Forest Policy Statement—to get the politics out of this whole timber debate. That is what it was all about, and we supported it. In hindsight, I think the Labor Party always planned to leave the politics in because I do not think they planned to have legislation.
When we got into government we continued the regional forest agreement process that had started under the previous Labor government and we finally got some regional forest agreements signed. They could not succeed in getting any signed in all their time. At the same time it was recognised—particularly by the Minister for Forestry and Conservation at the table—that unless there was some legislation which gave some support to these agreements we would go back to the situation that we had five to 10 years ago. I remind the House yet again—and I have done this many times before—that sitting on the wall at Harris Daishowa's office in Eden is a certificate signed by the Prime Minister of the day and the Premier of the day that is not worth the paper it is printed on.
That was the South-East Forest Agreement—or so-called agreement—where all the studies had been done and the decision made on how much timber could be harvested over the period to 2009. A piece of paper signed by the Prime Minister and the Premier you would think would have some standing. But it has absolutely no standing at all. It is not worth anything because all the agreements were broken. That was why we said that we had to have some legislation to back up these agreements. That is what this was all about. So what have the Labor Party done? They have taken it into the Senate and basically made it Clayton's legislation. Don't they trust their Labor premiers? We have Premiers Carr, Beattie, Bracks and Bacon—all Labor premiers—who either are party or will be party to regional forest agreements. Basically, they are saying, `We cannot trust these blokes. We have to have something in this legislation to 
 say that, at any time, we can review these agreements.'
Senators Brown and Greig in the Senate have made it quite clear that the Labor amendments will mean that the RFAs can be thrown out at any old time. In my electorate I have Labor Party people like Senator Sue West and other so-called Labor Party people who would be better off sticking with their Public Service jobs. They are running around saying that the RFA amendments by the Labor Party are there to give security to timber workers. What a load of garbage! Why don't they go and talk to the CFMEU? But what did the CFMEU say? They said that they condemned the federal ALP for their position on the regional forest agreement and accused them of breaking commitments. But here we have Senator Sue West writing to the papers and saying, `Hand on the heart, we are looking after timber workers.' That is absolute garbage!
One of the things they are saying is, `Labor has agreed to amendments to enable Senate scrutiny of the RFAs.' Exactly. But what for? So that they can change the RFAs. These RFAs are for 20-year commitments. If we want investment—and I want investment into my electorate—you have to give it some sort of security. We are going through all the processes—all the conservation, flora, fauna and every sort of study that you can imagine—as part of the regional forest agreement. When that is signed off, and in my case of New South Wales by a Labor Premier, surely they should be happy for that. I totally reject this nonsense that they are writing around in my electorate—Sue West and other Labor people—that the Senate should scrutinise the RFA legislation. That is exactly what they will do and, with Bob Brown in there, he will throw it out.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . It is a great shame that we have not heard from the organ grinder in this debate and that we have heard only from the monkey. I suggest that the contribution of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation to this debate has been nothing but negative and 
 shockingly partisan. That does a huge disservice to forest industry workers. When you have a bloke like the Minister for Forestry and Conservation running around attacking state governments, attacking colleagues and attacking anyone who does not agree with him, all it does is politicise the debate. The forest industry workers in my constituency deserve better than Wilson Tuckey. They deserve someone who is able to bring some bipartisanship to this debate, not just someone who can run around like a ragged old circus clown harassing people and trying to make political points all the time, whilst at the same time dodging the substantial public policy issues which confront this industry.
I turn to talk about the Wood and Paper Industry Council which is what we are here to talk about in this amendment today. This is a quote from the minister:
Noting the recommendation that the Government establish the Wood and Paper Industry Council, Mr Tuckey said that the Government supported the establishment of an appropriate and representative stakeholder consultative body. The final form would be considered by the Government in the context of the Industry Action Agenda  that has been initiated with the wood and paper products industry sector.
When do you reckon he would have said that? Let me tell you: that was in February this year. So here we are in December, after he made that statement in February, finally getting on to a real debate about this. Finally the wheels of government, the processes and all of that stuff that goes on in Wilson Tuckey's mind has finally come around, and we are finally seeing some sort of action on this. That was February, now it is December, and the minister has finally got around to having a debate about this on the last day of parliament for this year. It is an embarrassment to the government, it is an embarrassment to the minister, that it has taken all of this time.
This is a bloke that always goes around saying, `I am serious about helping the timber industry. I am serious about blue-collar workers.' If he were serious, he would have got on with it ages ago and stopped being shockingly political in his handling of his portfolio. I think we could probably name at 
 least half a dozen ministers or colleagues who have received a terrible bagging from Minister Wilson Tuckey. Unfortunately, all this has done is politicise the debate further rather than bringing around some sort of bipartisanship which is what everyone knows is required in this debate.
I notice the particularly high-pitch shrill laugh of the member for Gippsland—I should say the current member for Gippsland. Can I say that in my advocacy on behalf of the people of Swifts Creek in his electorate he was nowhere to be seen. Those people need local representation. They need someone who is going to stand up with them. They do not want hand-outs; they do not want compensation. They want their jobs. When I wrote to Minister Wilson Tuckey about this, where was the intervention and where was the support for those 22 blue-collar workers who lost their jobs? Where was Minister Wilson Tuckey? Missing in action—nowhere to be seen. Until this government starts to respond to the impact which regional forest agreements and forest policy have on these small communities, they are not being fair dinkum; they are not taking their obligations seriously.
Can I also mention the gutting of the forest products laboratory in Clayton this year. What does that do to ensure the viability of the forest and forest products sector? Absolutely nothing. The work which they were doing over there is the sort of stuff which is going to ensure that people in communities like Drouin, Noojee, Neerim South, Traralgon and Morwell will have jobs into the future—not just jobs for another two or three years but long-term, high salary, value adding jobs. On this side of the House, that is what we want to see. We do not want to see just a sustaining of the industry for another 12 to 24 months; we want to see it have a long-term viable future.
If the minister was fair dinkum about standing up for forest industry workers, he would stop being shockingly partisan and he would work with us to try to find a collaborative way through this. The minister said before that he is going to campaign in the electorate of McMillan against me. Well, I hope that he stands for the Liberal nomination 
 for McMillan against me, I hope that he stands as the Liberal candidate against me, because I can assure you, Minister, that you will not be getting elected.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,9,1
"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—We have just heard the greatest load of garbage on this debate that I have heard in a long time and we have listened to many debates. At least now the member for McMillan has bothered to come into the chamber—I think for the first time—to debate this issue. If the member for McMillan and those opposite were really serious about providing the security that claim to be supporting, they would be passing the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 .
We are here at the present moment to talk about this amendment on the Wood and Paper Advisory Council. Let me tell the House that the steering committee had its first meeting yesterday, and Senator Brian Gibson is chairing that committee. The members opposite have been talking about partisanship. Can I inform this House that when the question of who was to chair this committee was brought up it was actually the union, the CFMEU, who demanded that the minister at the table, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, be the chair of this committee. That is how much faith the CFMEU have in this minister by demanding that he chair the committee and actually run this whole debate.
—It is good to see you are a union member.
—The member for Banks is out of his place.
—Because the CFMEU as well as all of the Labor premiers throughout the country know that the only person that they can depend on to get this legislation through is actually the minister at the table. They cannot depend on those members opposite. The CFMEU know and all of the Labor premiers know that they have been let down miserably in this debate by those sitting opposite.
The member for McMillan actually had the audacity—I could hardly believe it—when he was talking about this to say he wants long-term jobs, and he named a lot of the towns in 
 his electorate. The only way for that to happen for any of the timber workers in all of those towns that the member for McMillan mentioned will be by getting this RFA legislation passed. That is the only way the timber workers in all of those towns can have any security about their jobs. They should know—and I intend to remind all of those people in all of those towns throughout the electorate of Mcmillan of this—that the member for McMillan is not supporting this legislation. He is not supporting the very legislation that will provide security for their jobs. That is what this all comes down to.
Those opposite can put up every obstacle that they like, but the real question that goes to the very heart of this is: who supports the timber workers? Who supports the jobs of the timber workers? The answer to those questions is the government. It is not the members of the opposition. The member for McMillan can absolutely object to whatever he likes, but the fact remains—and the people living in the electorate of McMillan will not ignore this fact—that you, the member for McMillan, do not support this legislation that would guarantee them security about their jobs.
—Order! Both ministers should observe standing order 57.
—I want to just quote a report of what Mr Brumby, the Victorian Minister for State and Regional Development, said:
. . . the success of the regional forest agreement process depended on sound scientific analysis, the goodwill of all parties, ""and particularly, communication to the widest possible audience of what all of us would agree to be complex concepts"".
He said there had to be `a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of reserves set aside from forest production.' (Time expired)",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,9,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—Since the member for McEwen has seen fit to talk about the present Minister for State and Regional Development, John Brumby, and the view of the new Labor government towards the timber industry, can I just quote briefly from a document which I have here. I wrote to the Liberal Party Minister for Conservation and Land Management in Victoria, Marie Tehan, on behalf of the workers at Swifts 
 Creek who had lost their jobs because of the closure of that timber mill; 22 blue-collar workers lost their jobs in a community of just 150 people. Since you want to have a talk about this, have a talk about the government in Victoria, let us have a debate and let us get it out on the public record. This is what Marie Tehan said when I asked her to do something to help the workers at Swifts Creek:
The recent events leading up to the closure of the sawmill at Swifts Creek are—
hand on heart—
like the devastating flood event, outside the control of Government.
That is the view of the former Kennett government when it comes to timber workers in Victoria, and that is the view of the former minister when it comes to the workers of Swifts Creek. It all right for you guys to come in here and wax lyrical and have a talk about how terrible the new Labor government is, but it is doing a great deal more for ordinary timber workers in Victoria than the pathetic attempt by the former minister and by the Kennett government.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order of relevance.
—There is no point of order.
—I haven't got to it yet.
—Resume your seat. The honourable member for McMillan has the call.
—I would suggest to those opposite that, before they bring into this House any sorts of accusations that they want to throw around about the Labor Party in government and what we do for forest industry workers in Victoria, they should have a long hard look at themselves. Get out the full-length mirror and have a look at your own record in government, because it is pathetic. It is non-interventionist. You do not understand, still, that people do not want to hear platitudes about what you are doing on a state-wide or nationwide basis; they want to know what you are going to do to keep their timber mill open in their town, to make sure that their kids get to have a job in the town and will not have to leave and go to Mel 
 bourne or Sydney in order to get any opportunities. Here it is in cold hard facts—the attitude of the Liberal government, the Liberal Party, towards timber workers:
. . . like the devastating flood event, outside the control of Government.
We on this side do not think that forest industry policy is outside the control of government. We intend to be interventionist. We intend to make sure that those rural communities that depend on the timber industry do have a future, and that is what we on this side are committed to.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,9,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I want to speak briefly, because I think this segment of a three-part debate could be brought to an end with the agreement of the opposition, because there is plenty of opportunity to cover broader principles. This one is just specific to the issue of the advisory committee.
But a response is needed on Swifts Creek. Firstly, let me say something about the new state government in Victoria. We have had a meeting with Sherryl Garbutt, the new minister. It was very productive. We were impressed with her approach to it. I think the previous speaker was most interested in pointing out that the spokesman now for regional development, Mr Brumby, is also saying, `Let's get on with this process.' With due respect to the previous government of Victoria, they also had a very positive approach to RFAs. The issue of Swifts Creek revolves around the licensing of timber. The owners of the licence—which I think was Neville Smith—shifted the resource over to their other mill. In other words, until that situation is worked out by the state government, there is absolutely nothing that we can do.
I say to you that we implored both the previous Premier and minister to join with us in each putting up $800,000 for Mount Beauty to allow for re-equipping because of the difficulties they will have with resource. We were extremely disappointed that the previous government did not join with us, and I think they paid a price for that. But again 
 the union movement came out and congratulated Lou Lieberman because we have stuck to that promise and the $800,000 is still there.
I want to quickly touch on the research issue. You raised two points. Those people that lost their jobs were primarily employed under a CRC. A CRC is seed money, and it means, of course, a cooperative research corporation. Its purpose is for the industry to fill the gap for continuation. The industry had some serious problems internally; they were arguing with each other about research levies. My response was to get them all in a room and sort it out with them, and they are now very happy with progressing a new system which we have agreed on. I hope that that will result in a much more substantial industry contribution which can be farmed out to CSIRO or someone else. One of the universities is very anxious to employ some of those people. I wrote to them the other day and said, `Get in with some of these sectoral groups and see if you can be their contractor.' Those opportunities have been addressed. But we have got to close on the simple point regarding this committee: it is going ahead.
The member for McMillan talked about delays. Delays? We sent the bill to the Senate twice. They only spoke for 29 hours on it the first time! How can I implement something until I know whether or not the legislation is successful? We gave it two tries. The opposition were determined to make sure that an appropriate compromise could not be reached. I saw the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and the member for Jagajaga yesterday getting across issues and finding a compromise on something that I would say is very sensitive in terms of women's rights et cetera. They found a compromise. Why? Because the member for Jagajaga knew that it was better to get something that was as near as possible to what they wanted than to get nothing. Those are good opposition tactics. But you cannot say that your leader is allowing you to do anything associated with the RFA legislation. You knew from the time before that you could not get your proposal up but you refused point-blank to accept the alternative.
The fact is that, now we have got the message that it is all about blocking and not about contributing, we are going ahead and putting it together in exactly the form that we proposed anyway—and the first meeting was yesterday. We cannot do much more than that. But to suggest we delayed it is silly because quite obviously any minister would await the final outcome of the legislative proposal before they took up a non-legislative proposal. We are going ahead with it. We always said we would. What is more, the people that are meeting now have my personal invitation—delivered to them yesterday—to put to me the structure they want in that advisory committee. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,9,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the House insists on disagreeing to amendments Nos 1 to 15 insisted on by the Senate.
These are all the penultimate issues where the Senate set out to destruct the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . We have had the high sounding comments made in the media by Senator West and others as to how this is such a magnificent improvement to the legislation. I have had the opportunity to respond to that particular comment in the paper and point out that that might be the view of Senator Sue West; it is not the view of the CFMEU, who say these amendments are a betrayal. It is not the view of those people who represent the timber communities, previously known as the Forest Protection Society. They say it is a betrayal. It is not the view of NAFI, the industry representative group. They say it destroys any opportunity for their particular members to be involved. Furthermore, when you get down to the people who quite openly say, `We are dead against the RFAs and the RFA legislation,' at least they come out and say it. Here I refer to Senator Brown, the Australian Greens senator, and the Democrats, through their spokesman Senator Greig. What do they say about the amendments? They say they give them the opportunity to knock off every regional forest agreement, and that is what they are there for 
 and that is their intention. There is no mucking about. They at least have the integrity to tell the parliament. They always have been against RFAs. They want to lock up all the native forests. They believe that jobs will materialise from heaven for all those timber workers that the member for McMillan says are of concern to him. That is their position. I admire them for their integrity, notwithstanding that I contest their logic. They say that, so who are we getting to?
The other interesting thing about these amendments is that we have this arrogance in the Senate that they are smarter than all the state Labor premiers in Australia today: smarter than Peter Beattie, smarter than Bob Carr, smarter than Steve Bracks and smarter than Jim Bacon. Before these things become an agreement, they all sign it too. They say they are good. They have the advice of all their public servants. So who agrees with the Labor senators? Nobody. Their own Premier colleagues do not because it would be an open admission that they signed something that they do not like. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, with experience in that position, would be very well aware where the power lies on forest management; it lies with state governments. They do not have to be dragged, screaming, to the barrier on this issue. They are very tough to deal with and they demand and get what they want because they can otherwise decline to do it.
I drew to the attention of the House yesterday how Premier Beattie is running on with his continued agenda and has said, `I'll do it whether there is an RFA or not.' In other words, why does Premier Beattie need the assistance of his colleagues in the Senate? I note that all of them—including Senator Ludwig, who had a lot to say about protecting people's jobs before he got elected down here—get up and vote that they have got a better solution, but nobody outside this parliament, including a group of Labor premiers, agrees with them.
I have got to say that they are wrong. I have also got to say that, if they wanted to put up a private member's bill bringing in all sorts of other things relative to forest management, there is a process available. This bill 
 had one purpose and one purpose alone, and that was to say that the Commonwealth puts its money where its mouth is and that any future government that changed the rules as agreed in the RFA at the federal level would pay compensation. The member for McMillan is worried about jobs. There are no jobs being lost under the RFAs is being signed—not any more.
—That is not true, though. What about Mount Beauty? What about Swifts Creek?
—Swifts Creek has nothing to do with an RFA. (Extension of time granted)  The member for Eden-Monaro, who is not here, has exactly the same problem. Someone set fire to a little sawmill in his electorate: that was arson. The other one in Swifts Creek was, I think, an accident.
—Why weren't they insured?
—They were not insured, no—and for the same reason. The fact that arson is now a significant factor in sawmills is a reason that very few of them are insured. They cannot afford the premiums, because there are people who are prepared to burn them down. I do not know that that happened at Swifts Creek. What I do know is that there are no provisions under the FISAP arrangements, as written by the Labor Party, that allow us to pay out people on the grounds of a disaster—and I think that is how Marie Tehan might have responded. We can give them business exit only where they lost their resource through the RFA, and Swifts Creek did not.
—They don't want business exit. They want their jobs.
—Of course they do not. The Labor Party in 1992 invented business exit and allocated $100 million to it. The current government, at my request to the Prime Minister, said, `We will convert the remaining moneys to business development.' That is what we are doing, and that is where we have a lot of fights. That is what I am fighting with the Liberals in Western Australia over. They wanted to create a situation—urged on, I might add, by the Labour Party over there who have it even worse; and I can give you 
 a copy of a pamphlet delivered to my home that says, `We are going to sack all these people but we are going to give them redundancy and retraining'—where some 55-year-old sawmill operator has got to go and serve tables in a restaurant.
Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting—
—No. I still said that all of the moneys as allocated in each state remain, provided state premiers can come up with business development projects and the resource to support them. What I am not going to do in Western Australia is be taken in a few years time to Tuckey's Folly because there is a closed-down sawmill with a couple of million dollars worth of federal taxpayers' investment in value adding and a future government, and the office of Mr Gallop, says, `I'm going to cut off their wood supply.' Until those resource issues are resolved and guaranteed, it would be delinquent of me as a federal minister to do anything more. But we are most anxious to do that.
A group of nine small sawmills—they may be partly in the member for McMillan's electorate—have got together and called themselves Terra. I have spoken with them. They have an application in for a very substantial amount of money. They are being so sensible. Nine little guys are getting together with one major investment in value adding. They all feed into it. They have better market access—
—But, Wilson, you have got to help the Swifts Creeks and the Mount Beautys.
—I have just tried to tell you that Swifts Creek, unfortunately, is not a victim of the RFA. Your state government has got to fix it. Those are the rules that you wrote in 1992. It is a simple as that. The same message had to be given yesterday.
—You can't have it both ways—
—If the member for McMillan wants to speak, I urge him to obey the standing orders.
Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting—
—I am not putting a brief for Marie Tehan. What I am telling you is that the FISAP arrangements can only respond to a result of an RFA, usually a reduction in resource. This is not the case at Swifts Creek. But, if the state government or Neville Smith want to rebuild it, we think that is great. All I can say is that where we had an outcome of an RFA at Mount Beauty—and, by the way, it was at the insistence of the state government again; I wanted to retain some of the Wongungarra Reserve for Mount Beauty, which was the best and least expensive solution—we came up with $800,000. What is more, when the state declined to match it, we stuck by it. But that is within our capacity. Swifts Creek is not. It is a simple is that.
But the real issue is that we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars in investments. I am going to run out of time again, and I would like the opposition to give me the opportunity to speak for another five minutes and unless they say something outrageous I will not speak again. The whole thing about it is that everywhere we have gone on this we have taken steps to make sure the RFAs work and that they work to develop the industry, and that is very important because that does create jobs. (Extension of time granted)
Coming back to all those amendments, it is arguable that they are inconsistent with the purpose of the bill. The bill was a simple measure of eight clauses to give a guarantee to everybody who invested in industry that, if a future federal government were to shift the goalposts, compensation could be paid. That has to be looked at in the context of some of the investments around Marysville and other parts of Victoria. There has been an 83 per cent increase internationally in the consumption of panel boards in the last 10 years.	This also identifies the silliness of the attack on woodchips. Woodchips do not only make pie bags, as some people would like us to believe. Australians use 50 kilograms per annum of photocopy paper per capita. Panel boards are made from woodchips. What is more, it is the most efficient use of a log because you can use the whole lot and you can use junk bits of wood that would never go into a 
 sawmill. Woodchips are a very good way to use wood. You get a lot more construction type timber out of woodchips than you would ever get out of sawing up round logs into rectangular pieces. They are now of structural integrity, with OSB being a classic example.
Companies are now importing OSB board from America and turning it into structural members here in Australia. If you want to make OSB in Australia, you invest $300 million. Fancy being the company secretary and going to your board and saying, `Fellas, there's a business opportunity in Australia to make OSB board. It's quite good. Here are all the figures. We can export a bit. We can do all these wonderful things to reduce Australia's $2 billion trade deficit, but there is one little problem—we do not know what Kim Beazley is going to do because Kim Beazley has run off the rails in terms of the National Forest Policy Statement which his cabinet put together in 1992. We cannot get a guarantee from the federal government. If we establish it in Tasmania we can get a guarantee from the state government as they have passed this legislation.' And they are another group that came and begged the opposition to pass that legislation without amendment.
The company secretary continues, `It's all very good as long as you are prepared to trust some future politician.' I do not know how long it takes to get $300 million back, but I guess it is not next week. That is why we want this legislation. If you feel you have to satisfy the Greens and give Bob Brown another seven hours to speak in the Senate, support him  in a private members bill with all this garbage you are trying to tack on to this bill and just pass a simple promise. You say you still support the National Forest Policy Statement, so put your signature to the promise that says, `We back this with money.' Then your opportunities for job creation and investment are on the doorstep.
You have five of the five seats in Tasmania. The minute you supported us in that legislation—and at this point in time you have to come and tell us you will—Tasmania, which is probably the most economically depressed state in Australia, would have a 20-metre start 
 on every other state because they have the quartet. They already have the two pieces of legislation which reassure investors. As I said, Trevor Smith and I know that pulp and paper is the area where we have to get real investment because pulp and paper is where we have a huge trade deficit. It is a good employer. Let me say, from a union point of view, it is much more likely to be organised by them. I recognise that. It is a good deal.
I talk to these blokes and they say, `But, Mr Tuckey, where is the resource going to? We don't even have one on plantations.' All you guys have to do is stand up in caucus and say, `Let's get all this other rubbish out.' If you guys want to do a deal in the room behind the dispatch box with the Greens and make them feel good, give them a private member's bill, but for goodness sake put this guarantee in place on dollars—a guarantee that means the jobs you say you are interested in can materialise. Do not run back to your electorates and say, `I'm fighting for you,' when you know you are not.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—Moments after finally conceding on part of Labor's demand for an effective industry council to drive investment in this industry, the minister comes here and says that we should not tack anything onto the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . He says, `It's a simple bill, so let's leave it as it is.' What he has done on the industry council is what he should do on the overall issues raised by the opposition. Quite frankly, the reality of this debate over many months, the reality which the Western Australian electorate is seeing, the reality which the Australian public are seeing, was summarised in the Sunday Times  of 29 August 1999. They said of the minister:
His record in the timber row is one of intemperate comments, intolerance, lack of compromise and downright bloody-mindedness. Instead of trying to work out a peace formula to settle the bitter dispute between timber workers and conservationists, his inflammatory remarks have made the situation even more volatile.
That is the reality of this debate, that is the reality of the problem, and that is the reality of the difficulties the industry faces. I concede that the minister is right, in that the embryo 
 of this bill is the compensation issue—the failure of the current federal coalition government and the Tasmanian Liberal government to get it right in regard to compensation. That is the genesis of the bill. He is right; it was essentially established to try and make sure that industry is compensated if changes in the political spectrum occur, if there are reasons to back away from these 20-year agreements.
But the bill does not really tackle a wide variety of problems. It is all right for the minister to say that the Labor Party has repudiated the 1992 statement, but this is the same minister who refuses to put in this bill the objectives of that actual agreement. He says, `It's all irrelevant. It doesn't matter. We don't need it.' The fact of life is that this minister has no respect for the broader concepts behind that 1992 agreement. He does not really want to put into effect a lot of the aspects that were raised in that agreement.
Having refused to accept what the Wood and Paper Industry Council has said, the government once again seeks to reject out of hand the Senate's 15 amendments to the RFA bill. Having totally failed in his attempt to bulldoze the Senate into submission, the minister should instead take a deep breath and review his ham-fisted tactics. He seems unable to recognise that the only outcome of his tactics to date has been to further delay bringing the RFA bill into law.
Let me restate the opposition's position. We remain absolutely committed to the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992 and the national RFA process. We remain available to discuss with the government ways to resolve the current impasse with the bill. Unlike the Democrats and Greens, we do not wish to impede the RFA process. But we do have concerns that need an appropriate response from the government. Our concerns about the Western Australian RFA reflect widespread public disquiet in that state—disquiet that has created considerable dissension within the coalition parties. Despite this, the minister pretends there is no basis for any concerns—even as he refuses to hand over any of the promised Commonwealth funding to Western Australia. 
The Senate again seeks the agreement of the House to its original amendments. These can be grouped into eight areas as follows: the insertion of objects consistent with and essentially from the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992; a limited process of public and parliamentary scrutiny for RFAs proposed after 1 March 1999; the requirement that RFAs provide structural adjustment packages for affected workers—it is all right for the minister to come in here today and say that he does not want anyone in the industry sacked, and that he wants everyone to keep their jobs, but the fact of life is that in this industry, and in Australian society, people do lose jobs and they should be provided for—the establishment of a comprehensive and publicly available national forest database; the maintenance of Commonwealth oversight of RFA forestry operations in listed world heritage areas or Ramsar wetlands; a provision whereby the parties to an RFA can amend it, provided they have consulted interested stakeholders; clarification of the Commonwealth's potential compensation liability; and, the requirement that information about the commencement or amendment of an RFA be published in the Gazette.
The Australian public knows these are reasonable requirements in this field. We are saying that the industry will get a guarantee of access to timber for 20 years. The Australian public, the Australian taxpayer, should get something in return. (Extension of time granted) They want some guarantees. They do not want to give this minister, this government, a blank cheque. These are, as I say, essentially quite reasonable propositions. In the same way that the minister has grudgingly conceded part of Labor's drive, with regard to a proper industry council that will do something about investment, it is about time he considered the wide range of amendments that the Senate has proposed. Some of these amendments are clearly contentious but others are absolutely run of the mill.
We are entitled to ask how the government can justify rejecting the Senate's amendment asking them to set up a forest database. Do they fear greater knowledge about forestry matters? Is that the logic behind opposing a 
 database, information, advice, knowledge? Is the minister fearful of that? Why can't he accept an amendment to allow RFAs to be amended by mutual agreement between state and federal governments? What is his objection to publishing in the Gazette the text of the RFA, as requested by the Senate? `What are the difficulties with these issues?', the Australian public might well ask.
The minister seeks to portray himself as the friend of timber workers, so how does he justify rejecting out of hand the Senate's amendment requiring RFAs to provide workers with structural adjustment measures to cushion the negative impact of reduced harvesting levels? I recall the many press releases and articles in which he said that it was dreadful that the Western Australian government was admitting the truth that some people would lose their jobs. He wants us all to close our eyes, put our heads in the sand and pretend that no job losses will occur. But when they do occur the minister is totally disinterested in the outcome for those workers. Basically he says, `It's all bad luck, but we are not going to provide any finance towards their future.'
Equally, we have a responsibility to protect the interests of taxpayers. This includes properly defining the Commonwealth's liability to pay compensation if it takes certain future action. Labor supports the concept of compensation but is concerned that the government's bill provides no specific basis on which it is payable. The minister has singularly failed to point out what is wrong with Labor's amendments to clarify these liabilities by linking compensation to actual losses arising from the curtailment of legally exercisable rights.
Similarly, the minister has failed to identify any aspect of the objects clause proposed by the opposition that is not part of the agreed, by everyone, national goals of the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992—goals that had been agreed to by the Commonwealth and the states. He has not identified any basis on which this objects clause could cause legal difficulties in any state. The government's refusal to accept the objects clause only creates grave suspicion about its alleged 
 commitment to the 1992 National Forest Policy Statement.
The next issue concerns parliamentary scrutiny. Well before the last election, Labor expressed concern that the coalition was seeking, through its legislation, a negotiating blank cheque from the parliament. Our amendments requiring RFA's signed after 1 March 1999 to be subject to a limited process of public and parliamentary scrutiny seek to address this deficiency. These provisions are not perfect, because we have been forced to consider the legislation in the middle of the RFA process. When the bill was introduced, a number of RFAs had been signed, others were in the process of being negotiated and others were still at the early stage of development. The government has consistently failed to acknowledge that these circumstances were not, and are not, of Labor's making. Our amendments seek to give the parliament a limited role in the process—something that is not unreasonable for agreements that we sincerely hope can be sustained for the whole 20 years on a bipartisan basis. While the government has engaged in scaremongering about our procedure, what alternative has been put forward?
In a statement of reasons for rejecting the Senate amendments, the government spokesperson in the Senate said:
. . . if there is a concern that RFA requirements are not been complied with, it is open to parliament to amend or repeal the bill.
If that is the best advice the government can give the opposition, knowing that following it would expose the Commonwealth to an unnecessary compensation liability, it should not be surprised that we might wish to stick to our original proposal, which is far preferable. However, we are open, as we always have been, to alternative suggestions.
As I say, it is all right for the minister to go around this country attacking a variety of governments of whatever political complexion, it is all right to make the popular statements out on the stumps, and run around saying that everyone's job is protected forever and a day, but it is about time he got down to negotiating a reasonable bipartisan approach 
 that will protect this industry and give it certainty for 20 years.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,9,1
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I have been bobbing up and down like a cork here trying to get into this debate.
—A cork's more useful than you.
—Well, you should put a cork in it! I implore members opposite to listen very closely to the statements that the Minister for Forestry and Conservation has made. During this debate I was pleased that, for quite a period, there was silence on the opposition benches, and I think that was because they were momentarily listening to the sense that was coming out of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. Members like the member for McMillan should be listening to the Minister for Forestry and Conservation instead of labelling him with names—he is a boofhead one minute and the minister for logs the next. Those opposite should listen to him, not abuse him.
The CFMEU have done a very good job of assessing this situation. And where do they come down? They come down in support of the minister. Why does the Labor Party not listen to that? I do not know. The obvious thing to consider there is the effort to which the Labor Party has gone, down the road of appeasing the Greens. In effect, we have the Labor Party across Australia doing deals with the Greens in an effort to get preference votes and things like that, and in the process it is alienating its very constituency. This is absolutely laid bare when we consider this particular legislation.
I am talking about the RFA process Australia-wide. In Queensland at the moment, the Labor Party up there has done a deal with the Greens to, in effect, shut down the entire forest industry in stages over 25 years, ending with zero production coming out of native forests in that state. It is appalling. We had a meeting the other day of 16 council representatives. These are councils from all kinds of political persuasions, local government authorities, and they absolutely condemned the agreement that is proposed in Queensland.
We need the regional forest agreement legislation to be robust, and that is the purpose behind the bill we are debating here today. Whether in the end that crazy scheme in Queensland ever gets up or the ones in some of the other states get up, none of them will have any real force at all unless we in this House and in the Senate are able to make perfectly robust legislation to support it.
What is going on? Because of their commitment to the Greens, we have the ALP, in effect, trying to pull the wings right off this legislation. We heard just a minute ago the opposition spokesman driving down expectations out there. Job losses, according to him, are essential, they are part of the system, they occur. The Minister for Forestry and Conservation is doing his damnedest to encourage value adding, to encourage the creation of jobs, and you are saying that it is all just a matter of course. If you follow the recipe laid down by former Queensland Premier Wayne Goss, you would go around to every timber worker, give them a cheque and say, `Never come back to this industry again.' It is a stupid way to go about it.
What comes out of the proposals that the Labor Party is asking us to consider is the idea that we should set up a lawyer's picnic, that we should have objects and things like that which make the legislation open to challenge. On the other hand, we should set up bureaucratic structures—we are going to have a council to oversee something or other in relation to it. Why do we need these bureaucracies? It all comes back to the National Forest Policy Statement. The legislation that we have, unamended, deals with the national forest statement, and that is precisely what we need. The Labor Party is defending lawyers and bureaucrats; we are defending the timber workers.
We have seen a deal in Queensland not only between the Labor Party and the Greens but between the Labor Party, the Greens and the timber industry bosses. Where were the timber workers in that process? They were cut right out, and the position of the CFMEU confirms it. Making half-smart comments about what the minister should do or calling him names is not going to cut the mustard 
 with people who are working in the timber industry. They want to see this legislation passed without amendment—the toughest possible legislation to support effective regional forest agreements across Australia. We do not want to see this continued kowtowing to the Greens by the Labor Party. They need to stand on their own two feet and stop trying to set up a sucker punch for the timber industry from the Greens.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—We can almost conclude this debate, but I was anticipating a couple of other members being able to return to the House. I will respond only to the comments of the shadow minister. He said, `Our concerns are about the WA RFA.' To all the people who keep saying that they have concerns about the WA RFA and that it is fundamentally flawed, I say, `Which bit?' I would welcome the return of the shadow minister to the dispatch box to tell me what particular parts of the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement he has concerns with.
Surely it is not that some people in the western suburbs of Perth do not like it. Surely it has to be that there are fundamentally identifiable flaws in the science. Remember that it was their budget that put together $100 million to pay people whom I find are infinitely of high integrity, infinitely decent people, be they public servants or scientists. They have great academic skills. It is their advice only that is handed on to the task force, the structure of which I think is unchanged from the original created by the Labor Party—that is, Prime Minister and Cabinet; AFFA, as it is now known; and Environment Australia. Those are the people who come along to me and say, `There's the document.'
In relation to the Western Australian document on reserve areas and those things that people sometimes wish to debate, there were three propositions and the one that was actually accepted was the one put by the Western Australian government. After a couple of visits from a couple of wealthy 
 lawyers, they backed down on their own agreement. But it is incumbent on the shadow minister, having said, `We have to review the WA RFA in the Senate because we are concerned about it,' to let us in on it.
Let me now say something about negotiation. We did have negotiation. We were willing to consider such matters—and we made this very clear to the opposition—as a limited objects clause. We have grave concerns about an objects clause because that just opens up the opportunity for people who seem to have heaps and heaps of money to take someone to court after the event when they have committed their billion bucks in a paper making plant and say, `You cannot do this because RFA No. 5 in Victoria does not meet the objects of the act.' That is a great opportunity for a couple of lawyers to make a lot of money. The fact of life is that investors do not want that problem; they want uncontestable arrangements. That is what you achieve with an objects clause: you start to create opportunities for litigation. That is why I think it was totally unnecessary. But we were prepared to have some limited objects that we felt would not open the legislation to that sort of litigation, and we said so.
We agreed to have the annual reports and five yearly reviews tabled in both houses so they could be debated if either house so wished. We were willing to look at the establishment of a parliamentary joint committee to review implementation of the RFAs over their 20-year life, and we were prepared to consider improvements to the public consultation process for the remaining RFAs in Victoria and New South Wales. In fact, the final message that I might admit with some reluctance we passed to the opposition prior to the debate in the Senate was that we were even prepared to have the completed RFAs made available for further public consideration prior to their signing. Why we need to do that, considering the other consultation processes, I do not know. I make the point that in Western Australia there were three propositions put to the people for public consultation known as A, B and C. The eventual outcome was greener than any of them. 
But, again, we have Senator Greig saying, `All those things are flawed with the exception of the Queensland one.' He apparently does not know there is not one in Queensland, so what does he know about the other ones? Why don't they get up clause by clause and identify where the science was wrong, identify where the principles of 60 per cent of old-growth forest and 15 per cent of pre-existing biodiversity has not happened? (Extension of time granted) Why not point to where they are wrong? It is all about `fundamentally flawed' or GMOs or `Frankenstein food'. What has that got to do with the science of genetic modification? Why do we let that sort of talk dictate this debate?
You can go to any of the RFAs. You have the National Forest Policy Statement, which the Labor Party wrote. You have the JANIS criteria, which they authorised and which every parliament in Australia endorsed. That is the test for an RFA, but you never hear it. You can go through 29 hours of Senate debate but show me where there is any serious criticism of any of the RFAs signed—there is none whatsoever. They say, `Tuckey's a boofhead,' or `Someone says this or that'—nothing to say they are wrong.
I think the Leader of the Opposition has doubts about the policy, but I have stuck to that policy religiously. I challenge anyone to look at any of the RFAs, whether or not I was responsible for some of them, and point to where they are grossly deficient as per the NFPS. We cop it every day from the media. You are well aware that Bob Cronin, the retired editor-in-chief of the West Australian, wrote an article in the Australian which was a peer review of the journalistic coverage of the RFA debate in Western Australia. As he said, the Greens were too smart to confuse journalism with facts; all they did was feed them `one-liners and conflict', and that is all they wanted. There is peer review. If you go to the newspapers, that is all you get.
So what I am saying to the opposition is that, if a heap of state premiers have signed or refused to sign RFAs with all the advice they have and all the science behind their departmental structures, which is much more developed than ours, why are a group of 
 senators who get up and use words like `fundamentally flawed' smarter than the people who are involved? And why do we have this ongoing insult and degradation of scientists involved in the process? You can go to Melbourne University and qualify as a medical practitioner, a teacher, a pharmacist or a forester, and if you come out as a forester and you go to work for Norths or someone you are immediately labelled as someone who is taking a dirty dollar. Why? Do those people get a degree at a penitentiary before they come to the forestry school? Of course they do not. They are decent people and, as I meet them, they are very wise. They disagree amongst their fraternity, but you have to feed that out, and we have some very good public servants to advise us on that. There is not one scrap of evidence; the Senate just says, `They are all a mob of mugs not to be trusted.'
The pity of it is that we expect it of Brown and we expect it of Greig, but the Labor Party have a higher responsibility. I think they should put up an MPI and bring in the RFA for Western Australia and stand up on scientific principles and say where it is wrong. And don't go to Pierre Horwitz's lengthy paper, as the Greens do, and pick out one paragraph. When I met with the man he said, `Don't read my paper as one paragraph. For goodness sake, read the lot of it and you will come to a different conclusion.' There is an offer—you get three of those every sitting week. Come out and prove why you are concerned about the WA RFA other than that your leader thinks there are some votes in it, and that is his biggest mistake.
We agreed to a database. We were going to have one anyway. All of these issues were raised with the idea of undermining the fundamental principle. The Labor Party have got plans to change the RFA. They are going to make promises to the Greens and to the western suburbs in the next state election in WA. As they are going to do all of that, the last thing they want is for the dollars and cents part of this legislation to be passed. They have made the admission today that they do not want to get caught up in any compensation. That is why they put up a 
 smokescreen of amendments which they know are not acceptable. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,9,1
"Katter, Bob, Jnr, MP",NP,1999-12-09,"—I rise to strongly support the Minister for Forestry and Conservation in the proposals that are before the House at the moment and also to criticise in the strongest possible terms the consistent behaviour of the Labor Party on these issues over a very long period of time. It seems to me the absolute epitome of hypocrisy for representatives of that political grouping to come into this place and make the statements that they are making. I must also bring the attention of the House to what happens when you listen to the Greens in this country.
On White Wreath Day, there were 2,743 wreaths laid out, representing the number of people who have committed suicide in Australia in the last 12 months. I think 1,800 died from road accidents and 800 died from AIDS, but 2,743 died from suicide. The national health report, which was done in the days of the Labor government, goes back 30 years. It graphs the rise in suicides and the rise in unemployment for young men between the ages of 15 and 35. The graphs over that 30 years are almost identical. The implications are, of course, that the causal relationship is the closest of close relationships: loss of jobs and suicide.
If you want to look at the loss of jobs, the timber industry is the absolute classical case. If you drive north from Townsville, the first town you come to is Ingham. You cannot see the timber mill from the roadway, but it is so big that, if you turn right anywhere in the middle of town, you will run into it. All of these towns have the timber mill right in the main street of town because I suspect that in the early days almost all of them were timber towns. Innisfail most certainly was, so the town grew up around a little timber mill. We have been harvesting timber since the 1870s, and most certainly since the 1880s, throughout all of Far North Queensland.
The timber mill at Foxwood is over a kilometre long. You can walk right through it and not see a soul. No-one has set foot, as an employed person, inside that building since then Senator Richardson closed it down. The 
 next town you come to is Cardwell—it is only a tiny town and it does not have a timber mill and never has had one. The next town is Tully, right on the highway, and 32 men lost their jobs when Donny Day's timber mill closed down. In Innisfail, there were some timber mills—you cannot see them from the road. The next town is Tarzali—I have no hope that that timber mill will continue much longer. They are having enormous difficulties. They are courageous, heroic people to have kept it open.
The next town is Yungaburra where 150 men lost their jobs. This is a huge timber mill: including the buildings associated with it, it is about half a kilometre long. The next town is Mareeba, and half of the entire main street of this town of 15,000 people is occupied by the old Foxwood timber mill.
If you drive north through all of the towns on the northern highway, every single one of them has a monument to the decisions taken by the greenie-leaning Labor Party when they ruled in this country. And Mr Beattie is following them right at this very moment in Queensland. The then Prime Minister, in a most arrogant, cavalier statement, said it would only cost them 800 jobs in Far North Queensland. It did not. I can take you to the mills and show you the employment figures on each of those mills. At the very least, 2,000 jobs went. That is not flow-on jobs; that is direct employment inside the industry.
The interesting thing is that, where the timber was taken from, you cannot establish that there was ever any timber taken from that area because, as the minister said, it was scientifically removed, although not always; there were bad periods. I fought very hard against the logging of Downey Creek. It was not always perfect. Over the last 10 years, before the world heritage declaration, the situation was exactly as the minister has described it. It is an absolute disgrace that science is being ignored. One of my standard jokes is, `What is the classical oxymoron?' An environmental scientist. That is exactly right. I praise the minister in the highest possible way for the stand that he has taken on this issue. (Time expired)

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I move:
That the bill be laid aside.
I do not want to repeat all the things I have said today, but the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  is totally unacceptable to the government because all of the amendments, as I have said, are generally unrelated to the fundamental issue of committing future governments to compensation if they want to change the rules.
In closing, it did strike me that I should say something else about the Western Australian RFA, over which the opposition have admitted they have concerns. At the time of its signing, it achieved the following: firstly, the highest then level of JANIS criteria of any agreement signed. It exceeded criteria in many ecosystems. Secondly, one of the most rigorous assessments of the remaining sustainable yield available from the production forest was done. We did not accept the proposals from CALM, the state agency. When they had completed their work, we turned around and hired Professor Ferguson and Dr Turner from the ANU to review that work and, to make sure that everyone could be confident, we invited the Western Australian EPA, which had been critical of some aspects of the current arrangements on contracted timber roof supplies, to be involved also. They signed off on all the quantities of timber that it was said could be sustainably obtained from the remaining production forests.
We then went to the industry and said, `Look, you've got contracts to 2003 which, on these figures, are clearly unsustainable. Would you accept the new figures, provided it is for a 20-year period?' To their great credit, they said yes. The point was made, `You've always got to have some redundancies.' During those negotiations, a couple of occasions arose when some of the larger employers actually said to me, `There will be some opportunity for some redundancies, Minister, won't there?' I said no, and I fought those comments in the media because I did not want to give them an excuse.
What happened? We have all these environmental outcomes and not one sacking announced. Bunnings, which subsequently closed their workshop, had decided to build new drying kilns for the Karri mill at Pemberton in their workshop. That involved 60 guys in Manjimup. All of a sudden, because of pressure from people who never said one serious word of criticism about all those factors, the state government changed its harvesting regime and the Pemberton mill is going to close. We had one mill that was going to close out of the RFA. That was Nannup. We had two people turn up at the signing ceremony and say that, with government assistance, they were prepared to participate there in a recovery mill, which would have assisted in their very large exporting arrangements on outdoor timber—and all this was put together overnight. Bunnings said, `We can't keep this work force any more. We've got nothing for them to do.' So 60 people lost their jobs.
Over the road, because of the changed arrangements, the state government—so they would not look like fools, because the timber industry went straight back to its unsustainable contracts—chose to take all the wood supply off the receiver of Whittakers. Whittakers were broke for reasons of overcapitalisation and things—nothing to do with the viability of the overall industry. The receiver sacked another 130, and my state colleagues were horrified at these dreadful private sector people. We had just taken away from them all their opportunity to grow their industry, but in fact the state government thought they should have kept paying the wages.
That is what you do when you break the rules, and that is what we do not want to happen. The best way to do it at the federal level is to make sure that there is a price to pay. The shadow minister well knows that all of the decisions on this were taken in his leader's office. If you could get him privately, I think he would be a little bit upset about that. But the reality is that we went so far as to agree to having these particular agreements published before they were signed, which we thought would only add to the springboard 
 effect and the number of people saying, `I told you so,' and further denigrate the opportunities for resource, which is the fundamental for people's jobs.
The reality of all this is that the issue of the simple eight-clause bill, most of the clauses being definitional, was all about a government, a parliament, the two major parties, sticking to their bipartisan position of giving legislative backing to the agreements as signed by a state Premier, whom I assume we do not say is a fool, and the Commonwealth. That is what it was about. If there are other issues of concern or the Senate wants to have another 29-hour debate on somebody's RFA, let them have it. This issue should not be attacked, denigrated and diluted by a raft of amendments, many of which are not seriously related but all of which are designed with one purpose: either to give the senators the chance to knock off the RFAs of their choice—they will not advance any reasons, because they have not done so in about 35 hours of debate—or to undermine that proposal in a way that allows green groups to contest it in the courts. As I said, notwithstanding their own rhetoric, no-one else agrees with them. You can produce legal opinions. That is only evidence of the fact that this thing is going to go to court in the format that you have proposed.
We can argue until we are blue in the face. The people whom we want to invest money and to create jobs say, `Unless you give it to us in an uncontestable and simple form, we're not going to invest.' It is tough enough as it is to try to get people to put up $1 billion for a paper plant that is in a very tough international market, but we want them to invest that sort of money with no guarantee that, if a future government, for whatever reason, decided to do a Richardson on them, they would even get their money back. That just rests our case.
The final issue is that the bill is to be laid aside with the clear intention that, on an occasion later on, it will be reintroduced. It will certainly be reintroduced before the next election, when the member for McMillan and I can get on a platform somewhere—maybe the back of a truck after we have had a 
 loggers parade. The members in Tasmania will have to explain to people why—
—I can't wait, Wilson!
—Well, issue me the invitation. Get the venue, and I am sure Michael O'Connor will get you some people to turn up. The reality is that it is going to happen and that it will be face to face with sawmill workers. I can promise you that. They are very interested in their welfare, and they are not fooled by members of parliament who clasp their hands to their hearts and tell them, `We battled in the caucus but we lost.' They know that in this place people, notwithstanding their party endorsement, are elected as candidates. They can cross the floor. The other day we had a division.
Mr Zahra interjecting—
—I have done it.
—When?
—Check the Hansard . I did it twice against Fraser. Three times.
—How long have you been in parliament?
—Nineteen years.
—The minister will ignore the member for McMillan, who will be silent or he will go outside.
—The next time a Labor member crosses the floor in the interests of their constituents will not be the first time. The last person to do it was Graeme Campbell—and you kicked him out of the party. Graeme Campbell stood up for his people on the gold tax. These are the facts. There is a simple opportunity if you come from Tasmania where a very high percentage of employment and economic activity arises from timber—and they know it, and they go back there and say `We're fighting for you'—to give the ultimate demonstration of support for your state.
By the way, the first time I crossed the floor was on the two-airlines policy when Western Australians paid the same price per kilometre as you did between Sydney and Canberra. We sat out against, and we organised against, the government. We sat with the Labor Party, who did not like the two-airlines 
 policy because Murdoch had a substantial investment in it. The time the member for McMillan crosses the floor will be his first time. I am not holding my breath. This is an issue for people who represent those in rural communities, who want just a simple thing. They want to be able to take a mortgage out or buy a new car on hire purchase and know their present job and the kids' job opportunities are going to be sufficient to pay those sorts of commitments off. That is the issue. They cannot have that security until the federal government puts its money where its mouth is. They know it. That is what they want from life.
As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, we had the Labor Party crying crocodile tears about Manjimup yesterday. I will tell you the biggest worry of pensioners in Manjimup: nobody wants to buy their house if and when they have to move on to a hostel or a nursing home. They have told me that. They know their community and their investments in their community are totally at risk, and they will remain at risk until the members elected to the Labor Party stand up for the people who put their faith in them with their vote. Talk is no good when you have the right to vote. If we were to have a division in a minute, we would see the member for McMillan voting against the motion that this bill be laid aside, thereby giving him the opportunity in the future to cast his vote with the government in the interest of his own voters.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—The Minister for Forestry and Conservation spoke earlier about the arrogance of the Senate in perusing the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  and making a number of amendments. He has spoken of their arrogance in daring to move amendments to this bill. I think most people understand the Senate is a house of review, it is there for a purpose, and if there were ever a bill that needed review and needed some intervention by the Senate it is this bill. It gives guarantees of access to timber for 20 years. It makes the Australian taxpayer subject to paying compensation if things occur in a 20-year period. If unforeseen consequences force a change of policy in regard to access, the Australian 
 taxpayer is going to have to pay these companies money. So for Christ's sake—
—Order! Change your language, please.
—If there is an area that needs this review, it is certainly this bill. We speak about arrogance. The minister essentially says that the public are mindless, they are stupid and they do not know what is going on in the debate about environmental matters. He says that the West Australian  paper is incapable of putting a coherent, detailed argument, that it is all very simplistic and that—the public opinion polls in that state showing 70 per cent to 80 per cent of people disagree with the minister—the general public are wrong. The West Australian  is wrong, Cheryl Edwardes is wrong, Richard Court is wrong, Hendy Cowan is wrong, the National Party as a whole is wrong—everybody is wrong except this minister.
We speak about arrogance. This is the minister who wrote to sawmillers in Queensland desperately saying, `Please give me some reasons to oppose what it happening in Queensland. I do not know the reasons, but please send me responses telling me what is wrong with this agreement so that I can actually oppose it.' We talk about arrogance. The minister is refusing to pay a variety of state governments of different political complexions. They are not all Labor. He is trying to intimidate them by withholding money. He is basically saying that he feels for these workers and that he is going to guarantee all these jobs. He knew from day one that the eventual outcome in Western Australia would mean that some people would lose their jobs.
He is part of a government that is trying the whole time to retreat from industrial relations conditions in this country that have existed over many decades. He is part of a government that seeks to slash workers' wages and reduce their conditions, he is part of the second wave, he is part of what this government is trying to do in relation to those people's living standards, and he has the temerity to come in here today and say that he is their big benefactor, their big protector. The fact is that when workers do lose their jobs they are not interested in why and the 
 past. They are interested in their living standards for the future. They are interested in getting some redundancy payments. They are interested in retraining for the future.
This minister is part of a process which says, `First, we will reduce your living standards with industrial relations changes and, second, if you lose your job in this industry, we are not going to help you recover that job.' We talk about arrogance. In Western Australia, the minister talks about science. The fact is that Minister Cheryl Edwardes has been bellyaching in the last few weeks about the fact that scientists who were supposedly part of the process have now refused to put their names to this process. They are not signing up. A number of other scientists, supposedly part of this process, have said, `We weren't part of it at all.'
—Those are her words, not mine!
—Now he is disassociating himself from Cheryl Edwardes as well. The situation is that this scientific process in Western Australia which was so perfect has been repudiated by the state government, it has led to the break-up of CALM, it has led to a situation where they have walked away from the agreement and it has led to a situation where the scientists who were supposedly, allegedly and implicitly involved in this process have said, `We weren't.' That is what has occurred.
We also heard earlier today the government finally concede that this bill that cannot be amended and that is so dreadful can be changed and can be amended and that we can actually bring in the council. He has been dragged here. He has agreed at last to a council of sorts. He said in the course of the debate that he had no objection to forest data and that it is not the end of the world. He said that there was nothing wrong with it and that he offered it to us.
The reality is that it is overdue. It is time that the minister entered into constructive negotiations to try to get an outcome that will guarantee a bipartisan approach in this industry to make sure that, as he alleges he actually wants, there is a degree of certainty so that people will invest, train and construct new 
 operations. It is time that this minister became part of the process to get a bipartisan agreement to make sure that Australian taxpayers have some control over the way that compensation is going to be paid and that they, through their representatives, have some say on these state agreements. The minister who says that there should not be any public scrutiny or any public control over this is the same minister who slags off the New South Wales and Queensland agreements. It is all perfect, except when he says there are things wrong with it.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,9,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—I want to make a few final remarks in this debate. It galls me to hear the Minister for Forestry and Conservation continually talk about his interest in forest industry workers and forest industry communities. What a farce! What a joke! He has an interest in what the Liberal Party has an interest in, and in what the old Country Party had an interest in, and that is basically making sure that their old Country Party mates in rural Australia—the people who put the money into your coffers every time an election comes around: the sawmillers—get their fair whack and are able to make a great deal of profit out of the access to our community resources.
That is what this bloke has always been interested in. He has been a pretty good advocate of the large timber milling companies and the other companies that make all the profits out of our community resources. As far as his being an advocate on behalf of forest industry workers, he has been exposed time and time again as not being a true advocate on behalf of their interests. This is perhaps best demonstrated by his participation in a government that is determined to take away the right to be able to claim unfair dismissal for companies with fewer than 15 employees. The minister talks about how he has been out there in rural Australia talking to timber millers and workers on the shop floor. I think it is fantastic that he has actually met a few blue-collar workers now. That is great, but it is a shame that it has taken him 19 years of his political life to get out there and actually meet some of these people.
There are quite a few sawmills and timber mills around the place, especially in rural Australia, which employ fewer than 15 people. The minister extended me an invitation to get up on the back of a truck somewhere in my electorate and have a debate with him about the RFA. I welcome that debate, and I can tell you, Wilson, that I will be there. I invite you, Minister—through you, Mr Deputy Speaker—to join with me in a similar debate about why you support taking away the right of those workers in small timber mills to have access to unfair dismissal proceedings when the boss in the rural country town says, `Well, you know, I employed you yesterday, but now I have found out that you're Catholic, so I am not going to employ you anymore,' or, `I understand that you plan on having children in the next couple of years. I do not want anyone who is going to get pregnant, so you're off as well.'
Minister, you would be the person who would be supporting that timber miller—probably the bloke who had given you a few bucks or given the old Country Party a few bucks—and giving them the right to do that. That is your approach, that is a Liberal Party approach, when it comes to whom you represent in rural and regional Australia and in the forest and forest products sector. We do not have that approach. We genuinely support the forest industry workers and the local communities that depend on the forest and forest products sector for their livelihoods. It galls me to have to put up with the minister saying, `We support these rural communities, we really do,' while at the same time he is overseeing the gutting of the Forest Products Laboratory—a laboratory which he knows full well will guarantee a future for those rural communities that depend on the forest and forest products sector.
They are the types of enterprises and that is the sort of public policy which we should be involved in to make sure that these people have a job not just in the next one or two years but over the long term. Hand on heart, he talks about how he is really interested in these small country towns and he names a few of them and all the rest of it. But where was he when the people of Swifts Creek 
 needed a hand? I wrote to him about it and said, `Can you give us a hand? Can you help us out? Can you do something for us? Can you be our champion?' He went missing in action and just parroted the same line as the former Minister for Conservation and Land Management in Victoria, Marie Tehan. She said that, in the same way that they could not have prevented the floods in East Gippsland, they could not have prevented the closure of the Swifts Creek timber mill.
That is not great news for this community or for the 22 blue-collar workers who lost their jobs or for the secondary college which the community worked hard to form and which is probably going to have to close now because there will not be enough students due to the loss of jobs. It will also not help the bloke running the pub who has had to close because he does not have enough income generated from the blokes who used to come in there and have a drink after work. Where was he when the people of Swifts Creek needed him? For that matter, where was the member for Gippsland, the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, in representing his constituents? Maybe he was at an art opening in Balmain or somewhere like that, but I bet his constituents wanting him to be there backing them and giving them some support.
This minister enjoys criticising me personally. Every time I am here we always have a look at the clock and see how long it takes him to get around to giving me a bit of a kick for something. I do not mind it because the more he criticises me the higher my vote goes in the electorate of McMillan. He talks about how I do not support the RFA process. That is just completely untrue. The member for McEwen talked before about how I had not been here for any debates on the RFA. That is also completely untrue. The one time that I was not here for a vote on the RFA was when I was helping the Swifts Creek community in trying to restart their timber mill. The question is: where was the minister when that community needed him? Missing in action.
Whilst we always get the same shrill rantings from the Minister for Forestry and 
 Conservation and we always hear him being shockingly partisan in his approach to this issue, that is not what people in rural Australia—the people who depend on a timber industry for their livelihood—want. They want us to be able to get along in this debate; they want us to be able to find a way through which is bipartisan. That is what ordinary punters out there want. They do not want a minister coming in here and having a go at everyone who does not agree with him; they want someone who can find a way through this difficult and complex issue.
Whilst it is easy to take pot shots, whilst it is easy to criticise, whilst it is easy to be partisan and political, that is not what is required. That is not the difficult public policy challenge. Whilst the minister says to me that he is going to come after me in my seat, I say to you, Minister, that there are plenty of people in the electorate of McMillan who will be standing with me against what you and your government represent, because they understand that you are not fair dinkum about helping rural Australia—you never have been.
You have been shown to be hypocritical in your support for the unfair dismissal of workers in companies of fewer than 15 people, you have been shown to be hypocritical by the lack of action which the government has taken in providing assistance to Gippsland by way of an adjustment package and you have been shown to be hypocritical through all the closures of government service delivery points in the electorate of McMillan—and for that matter the electorate of Gippsland—over the last four years. You say to me that you are going to come to McMillan and you are going to challenge to a debate. I say to you: I will be there with bells on. The question is: will you be there or are we going to have a debate about—
—Order! I have been tolerant of the degree of interjection in this debate, but may I suggest that the honourable member address his remarks through the chair.
—I invite the Minister for Forestry and Conservation to participate in a debate at a timber mill in Gippsland as to why he supports the government's view that 
 it is okay for someone in a company which employs 15 people or fewer to be sacked because they are Catholics or because they might get pregnant or for any other stupid reason which a boss can think of. So you join me in that debate, and I will join you in that debate in McMillan any time.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ronaldson, Michael, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I want to speak very briefly on this matter this afternoon.
—This morning.
—It is very nearly this afternoon. I must say to the House that I am disappointed that the member for McMillan has chosen to use today to defend himself in relation to this debate on behalf of his constituents by attacking those who are endeavouring to do something for his constituents. I heard the comment made before that he protesteth too much, and I think in some respects that it is very right. But I am not talking about the member for McMillan specifically today.
—You already have.
—I am sorely tempted to do otherwise, but I do not think this is the appropriate forum. What I would say is that, if you look at the representatives of the timber workers in my electorate and in the electorates of the member for McMillan and others, if you look at those who have been supporting this protest, if you look at those who have been supporting what this government is trying to do, it is a pure indication of true bipartisanship. What the member for McMillan has failed to understand or recognise is that the representatives of the workers in his electorate and in my electorate in the context of their organised labour representatives, the CFMEU, have backed the government to the absolute hilt in relation to this process.
That sends out two very clear messages. I understand that the member for McMillan is in a very difficult position because he has been told by the Leader of the Opposition what his party is going to do on this and I have absolutely no doubt that in his heart of hearts he knows that the advice of his leader is dead wrong. I do not say that in the context 
 of a negative approach to what he is saying, but the simple realities are that the one group of people who have been driving this process with the ultimate outcome for the survival of the timber industry in this country and the survival of the people that they represent is the CFMEU.
Okay, they might be strange bedfellows and it might be interesting when the minister stands up or when I stand up or when someone else from the government stands up in a timber mill beside union representatives talking to union workers. But the reason that is being done is not that the union representatives think there will be great advantage in their supporting a coalition government—that is obviously not the situation—and it is not that the government members think there will be any great kudos from their standing beside a union representative but that this industry and the people who work in it deserve the very best that this House can deliver.
The problem for timber worker representatives in the Labor Party is that you know as well as I do that what the CFMEU are doing is absolutely dead right. They know what is required for the long-term interests of this industry; they know what is required for the long-term interests of the people who are members of their organisation. That is why this debate does not need to be a partisan one. It should be totally bipartisan.
I appreciate that the member for McMillan is a new member. I have said to him before that anyone who gets elected to this place deserves to be congratulated, and I have done so. But what I am saying to the member for McMillan and the member for Lyons and others is that you have failed, I am afraid, to divorce yourselves from what seems to be the imperative of your leader. What has flowed from that is that you have set yourselves against the CFMEU and you have set yourselves against the workers that they represent, that you represent and that I represent, and the outcome of that is that you are potentially compromising something that should have been not only for the good of the workers but also for the good of this country in the long term. 
—National interest.
—I am reluctant to take the member for Banks's interjection when he is not in his seat, but with the greatest respect to the member for Banks he knows absolutely nothing about this industry. He does not represent timber workers. I am happy to talk to him about the real issues and I am happy to explain to him the views of the CFMEU in relation to this industry. This is not a coming together of two groups who have any interest in promoting the endeavours of the other. The CFMEU are not interested in promoting the endeavours of the coalition. Why would they be? They have never been historically, and they will not be in the future. But the difficulty for the members of the ALP representing timber electorates is that they have not been able to divorce themselves, like the CFMEU have, from the partisan politics of this debate.
—Who's responsible for the partisan politics?
—Christian, you still have a unique opportunity to do something constructive in this debate. The CFMEU have made it quite clear that they are prepared to put aside historical long-term dislike and distrust of a conservative government to achieve something for their members. That is the real issue in this debate for members of the ALP who represent timber workers.
I still hope that there will be an opportunity next year for this matter to be readdressed. I appreciate the fact that the timber worker representatives on the other side are within a party structure. That is okay, I respect that, and I acknowledge it. But the simple fact is that you have to spend time over the Christmas rise talking to the leadership about getting them to respect the fact that the union movement has put aside partisan politics and is taking a bipartisan approach to this.
I have been in this place for 10 years. I have had an interest in politics for a long time. I am starting to look considerably older than my 46 years. But the reality is that I have never seen a bipartisan approach between the union movement and a conservative government, as we are seeing with this issue. This is not because the union movement is 
 expecting a Christmas card from Wilson Tuckey; this is about the fact that they have separated those two issues and are pursuing an agenda on behalf of their workers for the long-term future of the timber industry.
The shadow minister is a fellow that I have had long-term respect for in relation to a number of issues. I have great respect for many of the members opposite who represent timber electorates. But the reality is that you have badly missed the boat on this issue. You have not taken the lead from the CFMEU. You have not taken the lead from the body who ultimately have the primary responsibility for those forest workers. They are the ones who have been doing it for a long time. They are the ones who will be doing it for a long time in the future. I really think that you must look again at how you approach this. It is not too late. I do not think you would lose any credit from anyone in this debate if you were able to turn around your leadership in their support for the CFMEU. And you would, quite rightly, be lauded by the timber workers that you represent.
The real issue that you have got to remember is that this is not a debate about today; this is a debate about tomorrow. That is why the CFMEU are so heavily involved in supporting this process. The easy option for them was to take the today debate in relation to dealing with a conservative government. But they have not done that because they know—as well as you and I do—that this is a debate about the future. I think it brings great credit to them that they have been able to leave the today debate behind and have gone to the tomorrow debate and the future debate. I think they deserve a big pat on the back for it.
—Tomorrow never comes.
—Isn't that a very interesting comment from the member for Banks. That absolutely sums up the views of the leadership of the ALP, of which he is a member, that, `Tomorrow does not come, because we're not worried about tomorrow. We'll worry about the politics of today, because tomorrow will not come.' You have totally summed up your views in relation to this issue. That shows the stupidity of that 
 interjection. That is the key to all of this. The CFMEU and the coalition government are talking about tomorrow. The ALP is talking about today, because tomorrow does not matter when it comes to the politics of this. You have summed up very quickly your views in relation to Australian domestic politics in 1999, and you will wear the penalty for that, my friend. The CFMEU, as I said before, has been prepared to set aside today and take up the issues of tomorrow. It is not too late for that to be done, and I would very much encourage you to do so.

That the amendments be agreed to.
The Senate has referred a schedule of three amendments made to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1999 [No. 2]. These amendments were proposed by the Australian Democrats and supported by the Australian Labor Party. As 
 Senator Tambling outlined in the other place, the government is of the view that all three amendments are unnecessary, and indeed redundant, as the food authority already carries out the functions they propose. Nevertheless, these amendments as proposed by the Senate do not alter the policy intent of the bill and, therefore, the government is prepared to accept them.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,10,1
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—I want to make some brief comments on the bill as it stands. As the Minister for Health and Aged Care has said, three minor amendments have been made. I concur that those amendments are minor and do not detract from the overall nature of the bill. Certainly the Labor Party supported those amendments in the upper house as being minor improvements on the bill as proposed. However, I would like to make it clear that the major changes that were put forward were done here in the House of Representatives with, eventually, agreement from the government. This has led to a situation where even the Democrats in the upper house have conceded that, when the bill got to the upper house, it was in an improved state.
We look forward to seeing how the bill operates in the context of ANZFA into the future, and we will be monitoring that very closely. We wish the bill a very speedy passage.

The position is that the minister in the other place has given undertakings, when the debate took 
 place there, that there would be further consultation. It is proposed, as I understand it, that that consultation will take place not only with the opposition parties but with indigenous groups; and we think that is a good thing. The minister, in the debate, did point to extensive considerations through parliamentary inquiries—and, indeed, beyond the parliament—as the basis for some of the propositions that were put forward in the original bill. He did concede that, from the government's point of view, they have not picked up all the recommendations of the parliamentary committee nor, indeed, all the recommendations of Justice Evatt's report.
In terms of the proposed amendments insisted upon by the Senate—which it is fair say the ALP, the Democrats, Senator Harradine and Senator Brown supported—it is important that I outline the basic principles which the opposition had in approaching the amendments that we moved successfully in the Senate. There were three fundamental principles. The first was the aim of protecting indigenous heritage. We were about effective protection and transmission of what we regard as a living cultural heritage. It is fundamental to the survival of indigenous people as a distinct social group. It is an integral aspect of the way in which indigenous people's identity is continued in the context of non-indigenous economic and social development that is often ignorant of or hostile to indigenous culture and its relationship to the land.
The second principle we relied upon was the Evatt report as the appropriate compromise between indigenous and development interests. We believe the Evatt report on the review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 is the appropriate benchmark for the reform of Commonwealth, state and territory heritage laws. The report is the result of extensive consultations throughout Australia with indigenous and non-indigenous interests. It represents a careful compromise between development concerns and indigenous heritage protection. The proposed amendments are based on the detailed recommendations of the Evatt report. It should be noted that many of the essential recommendations are not includ 
 ed within the government bill, including ensuring that the Commonwealth is a real option of last resort, establishing an independent Commonwealth heritage agency and introducing a range of minimum standards for state and territory accreditation.
The third principle was the relationship between the Commonwealth, state and territory responsibilities to heritage protection. The Commonwealth government has moral, constitutional and international responsibilities to provide heritage protection. Given the reality of the states' responsibility for land management and planning processes, we acknowledge that the states and territories have a role in relation to heritage protection; however, primary responsibility for the scope and operation of heritage laws must remain with the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth must remain a real option of last resort.
The keys to the proposed amendments are: the establishment of a Commonwealth independent heritage protection agency; the Commonwealth remaining as a real option of last resort, primarily through improvements to the principles for Commonwealth protection orders; and the strengthening and increasing of minimum standards for accreditation. (Extension of time granted) The philosophy of the opposition is that we draw strength from the referendum result of 1967 when 90 per cent of the people voting gave the Commonwealth parliament the authority—moral, legal, and constitutional—to intervene in indigenous affairs. We do not say it is exclusive to the Commonwealth; we see it as a partnership approach. Basically, the people voting at that referendum said, `We do not want to leave indigenous affairs solely in the hands of the states.' Up until that time, the Commonwealth had a role in relation to the territories and not the states.
In relation to the heritage protection act, we see a partnership role between the Commonwealth, the states and indigenous interests. We believe that the Commonwealth should benchmark the minimum standards. As we say, the Evatt report should be the basis for that framework. The heritage protection act came into existence before the historic Mabo 
 decision of 1992 and the subsequent Wik decision. It was, historically, a compromise because one of the principles at that time of the then Labor government was national uniform land rights, and that did not eventuate.
In recent times, we have seen a number of cases go to the High Court and currently work their way through the Federal Court. One involved the activist Murrandoo Yanner from Queensland and involved hunting, fishing and gathering. The High Court, by a five to two majority, talked about a living culture, a culture that was evolving and was not static in time. You also have the Yorta Yorta case that is on appeal to the full Federal Court. They have reserved their judgment. Again that is about whether Aboriginal culture is static or continuing, living and breathing. That is where this act is important.
The government has already accepted a number of amendments. On our side we believe that there is an opportunity here. We do not want the opportunity to be missed by this government. We do not want to go down the path of the divisive debate that occurred in relation to native title. That is why we welcome the comments by the minister in the other place that there will be further consultation with not only the opposition parties but also indigenous interests. We believe that if the government comes a little bit further we can have an act that we will all be proud of. Sure, some of it is a compromise, but we say that the Evatt report was the right balance between indigenous and non-indigenous interests. We need to have this framework and this partnership approach because it is about access, heritage and indigenous people being part of the process and not always being cast aside. There have to be proper standards.
We need to recognise the diversity of indigenous communities. It is not the same in the Northern Territory as it is in Victoria or New South Wales. Often there is a misconception that indigenous people speak with one voice. They do not. Their problems are different, just as the problems in the non-indigenous community are different in the different suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. What is important to one section of the com 
 munity is not necessarily important to the other. That is why we need this framework approach, with benchmarks and minimum standards and a partnership approach with the states.
We appreciate that the government has picked up a number of our amendments. But they are not exclusively our amendments. The Labor Party has talked to the Democrats, indigenous interests and other players. We want to keep the lines of communication open with the government because we believe that, with a bit more give and take, maybe on both sides, and with a bit of goodwill we will have an opportunity for all parties to come together. The Labor Party will not abandon Aboriginal interests solely to the states. When it comes to heritage protection, we will not walk away from our constitutional responsibility. We do not believe it is the exclusive province of the states—it is a partnership approach.

(1)	 Clause 36, page 26 (after line 13), at the end of the clause, add:
The independent reviewer is not personally liable to an action or other proceeding for damages in relation to anything done or omitted to be done in good faith by the independent reviewer in the capacity of independent reviewer.
(2)	 Clause 43, page 31 (after line 6), at the end of the clause, add:
(2)	 The independent reviewer is not personally liable to an action or other proceeding for damages in relation to anything done or omitted to be done in good faith by the independent reviewer in the capacity of independent reviewer.
Amendments are proposed to clauses 36 and 43 of the bill to provide an indemnity to independent reviewers so that they will not be personally liable for actions done in good 
 faith. These amendments afford an independent reviewer the same protection as applies to the Director of Indigenous Heritage Protection under clause 19. It was an oversight that this measure was not included in the bill. The risk of legal action against persons undertaking functions under the bill is demonstrated by the current litigation in relation to the Hindmarsh Island case. The likelihood of litigation in future along the lines of the Hindmarsh case is low as a result of procedural changes included in the bill. Nevertheless, without the indemnity, it may be difficult to find suitably qualified persons to undertake the role of reviewer.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,13,1
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—The opposition supports these amendments. I saw them only today but, as the spokesperson for the Labor Party, I think these amendments are reasonable. My view is that an independent reviewer should not be personally liable for an action or proceedings for damages if they have acted in good faith in their capacity as an independent reviewer. It is our view that what the government is doing in this regard is perfectly reasonable, and we lend our support to that. We are not here to take objections for the sake of objection. My approach to indigenous affairs is that, wherever bipartisanship can be achieved, I will struggle to achieve that. If we have to compromise on some things we will, but there are some matters that we will not go beyond.
These are perfectly reasonable amendments. If they were not made, people would be very reluctant to take on the role of independent reviewer. But there has to be the qualification that anything done, or omitted, be in good faith. If it is not done in good faith, if there are other instances showing that there was malice or a whole range of other things, the indemnity should not flow to those people. That is basically, as I understand it, the proposition across the board in other areas and it should apply here. For that reason, I can assure the government we will support them in relation to these amendments.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
I move these amendments to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 , of course, on behalf of the government. Amendments Nos 1 to 4 have been made in response to concerns from a number of groups such as the Australian Superannuation Funds Association that there should be some scope for investments in non-geared related trusts.
These amendments will allow a regulation making power to be used to make an exception. This will apply only to a superannuation fund with fewer than five members that invests in a company or trust which meets the specified requirements. These requirements will include that the company or trust does not borrow; that it does not invest in, or loan money to, individuals or other entities other than deposits with financial institutions; that it has not acquired assets from a related party of the superannuation fund other than business real property; that it does not lease assets to related parties or enter into lease arrangements other than a legally binding lease of business real property to a related party on an arms-length basis; and that it conducts all other transactions on an arms-length basis. The government will consult with accounting and other industry bodies in developing a definition of non-geared company or trust that meets these requirements.
Amendments Nos 5 to 11 have been made in response to concerns expressed about the lapse of time since the original announcement on 12 May 1998. These amendments ensure that the changes to the in-house provisions 
 will apply only from the date of the introduction of the legislation—that is, 11 August this year. As the amendments have only recently been agreed, they are not accompanied by a supplementary explanatory memorandum. I commend the amendments to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—Make no mistake: the passage of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999  through the parliament is the result of yet another behind closed doors deal between the government and the Australian Democrats. Labor will ensure that every one of the 180,000 do-it-yourself superannuation funds in Australia knows exactly just who it was who forced this unnecessary, costly and complex bill upon them: the Howard government and the Meg Lees Democrats.
We will be writing to every small business that operates a self-managed fund, every accountant, every do-it-yourself fund administrator, every trustee, every financial planner and every auditor, particularly in rural and regional Australia, telling them how the Howard government sold them out in relation to this bill. This was a sleeping issue in the 1998 budget. It will come back to haunt both the government and the Australian Democrats.
The government announced back in May 1998 that it proposed these investment rules restrictions, but it backflipped on its announcement some two weeks later. It took almost a year to release draft legislation, another few months to introduce this bill into the parliament—18 months after the original announcement—and then it decided just yesterday in the Senate that it could amend the bill still further, and now we are considering these amendments.
Senator Kemp made a song and dance some time ago about the opposition circulating amendments a few hours before a bill was debated. We saw these amendments from the government on the floor of the Senate yesterday around 10 a.m. It would be the height of hypocrisy for Senator Kemp or his colleagues to ever again criticise the opposition for circulating last-minute amendments. We will not have one more word from them about this issue. 
It is disappointing for the thousands of small businesses out there, especially those in rural and regional Australia, that the amendments resulting from this backroom deal between the government and the Democrats will do absolutely nothing to address the substantial concerns that do-it-yourself superannuation funds have about this legislation. The Howard-Lees amendments will not prevent thousands of funds that have invested in accordance with the law from having to unwind their investments. The Howard-Lees amendments will not prevent thousands of funds from incurring massive additional costs upwards of $2,000 per fund. The Howard-Lees amendments will not address the concerns raised by many do-it-yourself funds and their operators.
Make no mistake: this legislation is an attack on small business. The Treasurer, who is responsible in the first place for this legislation, will be known as small business enemy No. 1. People say that one day he is going to become Prime Minister. There could be a race, indeed, between Kim Beazley and the Treasurer to see who gets there first—a bit like the US and Russia advancing on Berlin at the end of the Second World War.
People who understand the possibility that this Treasurer might become Prime Minister need to understand this: every time an issue involving small business arises—whether it is in relation to banks; petrol companies or large oil companies, as against the small service station owners and franchisees; the retail shopping area involving the large retailers or the smaller retail tenants; the GST or superannuation funds—this Treasurer and this government talk the talk of small business, but they are doing the bidding of big business, and we see it again today.
Quite a few people who have been involved in the Liberal Party have been expressing concern, firstly to the government but more recently to us, about the impact of this legislation. For example, I have correspondence from Mr David Dwyer, a disaffected Liberal Party member in Western Australia, who has written to Wilson Tuckey, the member for O'Connor, and to Arthur Sinodinos from the Prime Minister's staff to express his concerns 
 about the impact of this legislation on small funds. He says in his correspondence:
The legislation restricts investments by self-managed superannuation funds (SMSF) in associated property trusts. These property trusts typically are 100% owned by the SMSF and borrow to acquire property. . . . 
The property is leased to a 3rd party whereby the tenant pays the loan repayments.
In my experience, such investments by SMSF have been a prudent and secure means of investing to provide funds for the members retirement.
(Extension of time granted)
This correspondence from Mr Dwyer comes after making these representations to the member for O'Connor and to the Prime Minister's office and after earlier unsuccessfully taking this issue up with the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. I can understand the frustration of people trying to get a message through to Senator Kemp on any of these issues. Frankly, it is easier to get to a message through to the Mars Polar Lander  than through to Assistant Treasurer Kemp. Mr Dwyer continues:
Under SLAB 4 such investments have to be no more than 5% which because of a SMSF's smaller capital base is simply not enough money to be an effective deposit.
SLAB 4 deems that the superannuation fund in question is associated with the property trust by the trustee of the property trust being a related party. . . . 
The big industry funds do not have this problem as given the size of their individual property trust investments they can afford independent trustees. Independent trustees are too expensive for SMSF.
He goes on to provide us with an example from Manjimup packing shed. We heard quite a bit in the House about Manjimup yesterday. I note that earlier the Minister for Forestry and Conservation was in the chamber. This correspondence went to the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. He evidently took absolutely no action in relation to it, because this bill is now passing through this House.
Turning back to the situation of the Manjimup packing shed, Mr Dwyer says that his clients currently rent the shed from a third party to pack vegetables for the export market. Coming on stream in Manjimup is a developing stone fruit export market of 
 between $5 million and $10 million per annum. The owners of the shed have indicated to his client that they need to sell the property. They are putting pressure on his client to exercise the first right of refusal he holds as a tenant or to find an alternative buyer. The client cannot afford to buy the property outright as he does not have a deposit of $120,000 to $140,000, which is what he would need. He is, however, prepared to pay a commercial rent to a third party. Mr Dwyer goes on to say:
I have several superannuation fund clients who would see this is as a good investment as they are currently only earning 3-4% bank interest and no capital growth.
Prior to SLAB 4 this type of situation was easily solved. The superannuation fund would set up and invest $200 000 in a related property trust, the property trust would borrow the balance ($214 000) and this debt would be serviced by the rent from the tenant. . . . In effect superannuation capital would be utilised in a productive way and still be a suitable investment for the fund.
At retirement the members of the superannuation fund could be paid a pension which in turn is financed by the rent from the property.
In this example the burden of the providing for the people in retirement is met from their own investments over their working life by way of superannuation contributions.
Under SLAB4 such an investment can not be made. The property trust needs a trustee and this trustee would by necessity be a related party of the fund, (For example a separate company but having common directors to the superannuation fund.)
My client is seriously considering vacating the premises and shifting the packing operation to his own farm. Such a move would mean that he no longer packs other growers produce and would thereby restrict the potential of the developing stone fruit export market and current exports from the area.
. . .              . . .             . . .
The investment restrictions in SLAB4 effectively limit the available capital to develop export industries in regional areas.
He points out:
Interestingly, big business is not faced with the same problem.
Wesfarmers/Bunnings recently . . . floated the Bunnings Warehouse Property Trust. This was a very sensible strategy as they were able to raise capital to build more Bunnings stores, which are rented to the operating company. Many of the 
 property trust investors would be superannuation funds.
Yet for my small business client they can not say, `Hey lets get a superannuation fund to buy our premises and lease it back to us.' So that we do not have to tie up our working capital.'
Mr Dwyer concludes:
It would seem that there is one rule for big business and another for small business.
He presents similar evidence concerning the Jetty Motel Resort in Esperance, but I do not need to provide the detail. I think we have managed to make the point. Similar concerns are expressed by others who have made representations. We had correspondence from Love and Partners in Maroochydore in Queensland to the Treasurer, which stated:(Extension of time granted)
I have supported the Liberal-National Party all of my voting life. Your proposals are draconian and near enough to retrospective for me to be entirely incensed. The proposals are unworkable and unless immediate changes are announced, I believe you will seriously erode your voting base. For one, you won't get my vote and I will make serious attempts to influence my client base that has been, and will be, affected seriously by this legislation.
Similarly, the Blue Dandenongs Bulb Farm in Monbulk in Victoria said:
We wish to express our grave concerns about the actions of the Liberal Government during the past 18 months in relation to their treatment of small business and obvious lack of understanding of extra pressures and costs that are being forced upon them.
The budget announcement (later varied by press release) directed at outlawing traditional investments of small Superannuation funds was the ultimate example of irrational and retrospective legislation.
. . .              . . .             . . .
It is difficult to believe that the Liberal Government is targeting people who use self-managed funds in a legitimate way to save for their retirement. . . . Do the Government advisers and politicians have any idea whatsoever of the extra paperwork, bookkeeping and accounting costs that this will create?
. . .              . . .             . . .
It has discouraged small business owners from saving for their retirement. 

Similar concerns were expressed by the Australian Business Chamber. They said of this legislation:
. . . will stifle investment and serve to further concentrate Australia's pool of savings in big funds run by major banks, insurance companies and investment houses.
Similarly, the evidence before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, which has considered this bill since it was last before the House, demonstrates exactly the same impact. There was a submission to the Senate committee from Cleary Hoare Solicitors talking about the impact on Townsville and other regional centres. They refer to the very important role played by self-managed superannuation funds in investments in regional centres. They said:
. . . These investments will not take place unless the small business can gain some benefit from it, eg, the ability to rent the premises built or bought and the ability to have moderate borrowings in the unit trust (without jeopardising the other assets of the superannuation fund), to enable a better asset build up in the superannuation fund.
They went on to describe consequences of the government's changes, which are:
More investment will be driven from the control of the small business to the control of the big end of town (AMP, MLC, banks, public trusts, etc.
There is nothing in the performance of the top end of town to indicate that, in the majority of cases, it will out-perform decisions made by small business persons who control their own superannuation funds.
A very significant source of regional investment (self managed superannuation funds controlled by local small businesses) will cease.
The big end of town will not replace that investment source for regional centres.
Yet again, this government and prior governments will have diminished the control small business and people generally have over their own destinies.
They have produced, in support of that argument, correspondence from Richard Ferry concerning the use of self-managed superannuation funds in the Townsville district. This correspondence says:
Even cities like Townsville have difficulty in attracting major building investment—cities of 40,000 to 50,000 have a significantly more difficult task and those such as Mt Isa almost an impossible task.  

. . .              . . .             . . .
Regional Australia does not enjoy significant growth—if any growth—in property prices. Sales are made not on achieving a significant capital growth over a period, but by relying on the income stream—almost to entirety.
For some 10 years now investments have increasingly been through superannuation funds, often financially geared through unit trusts with the income stream . . . from the property meeting interest and loan redemption. . . .
Most of these investors do business in Townsville on a regular basis (monthly, if not weekly)—they know Townsville and they can see confidence in the changing elements, which from time to time do change.
They say:
If investors are prevented from using self-managed superannuation funds as vehicles to invest in property there will be a further significant deterioration in regional property prices.
Future investment will also be curtailed—therefore growth and employment opportunities in regional areas will significantly decrease.
Many businesses own their own premises through self-managed superannuation funds (including Ferry Property Management)—one would assume a good source of investment. The business operators know and have confidence in the business and its ability to pay rent—the location of the property investment and its prospects for maintaining or enjoying capital growth depend, to a large extent, on the business. Provided the commercial arrangements of rental rates, lease terms etc are commercial reality, these investment possibilities should be encouraged.
(Extension of time granted)
They continue:
Forcing small businesses into public administrative super funds at 5% to 7% return with little recognised growth as opposed to local investment through self-managed funds at 10% (and more often up to 15%) does not make sense . . . 
Local property values will fall significantly as persons divest—not to mention future growth which will be curtailed through the absence of the largest purchaser sector.
It is a very significant submission, and it does seem to be a pity that the government has apparently taken no notice of it.
Similarly, a submission from Michael Beard of Accounting Services Pty Ltd, said:
The positives for the existing arrangements are:
1) small business owners are encouraged to contribute to their own Super. 

2) Property Sales are stimulated and building activity increases.
The negatives for the change are:
1) Small business owners will no longer put money into Super.
2) The only possible winners are the A.M.P.'s who will now get hold of super monies that were previously invested by the Small Business Owners.
The fundamental argument against the change in laws is that successful small business owners are probably better equipped to invest their own funds than the major life offices. Why does the Government want to take the investment decision out of their hands?
No evidence has been presented (that I am aware of) which points to abuse of the system.
Many of my small business clients regard these changes as the final straw in so far as Superannuation is concerned. Most Accountants in this area regard the proposed changes as stupid and counter productive.
That is the kind of evidence that came before the Senate select committee, and that is the reason the opposition has not been prepared to support the government's legislation. This bill is an attack on small business; it is an attack on regions. Also, it mocks the principle of choice. The government comes in here from time to time and says, `Members need to have choice about where their superannuation money is invested.' All these small businesses say, `Yes, we would like to have some choice. We would like to have some say in how our superannuation money is invested.' Then the government comes in here with a bill like that and says, `No, you cannot do it.'
Let me turn now specifically to the government's amendments 1 to 4. The second amendment will allow the government to make regulations to exempt certain assets or classes of assets from being treated as in-house assets. We are not going to support government amendments 1 to 4. As I have indicated, we think that is an enormously wide power. Without having seen the regulations, how can the parliament be sure of what the government is doing? A deal has apparently been done between the government and the Australian Democrats on the issue of closely held unit trusts. Nobody, other than the government and the Democrats, has seen 
 the details of this deal. We have been told that regulations will be introduced, but we do not know what they relate to, how they will operate and what impact they will have on do-it-yourself funds. We do not know when they will be introduced.
—They probably don't know.
—Quite possibly. It is another secret deal done by the Democrats with the government behind closed doors. We do not support the bill, and we will oppose these ham-fisted amendments. The government's amendments relate to section 71 of the SIS legislation, which determines the meaning of in-house assets. Currently, section 71(1)(e) allows the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to make a determination—not a regulation—as to whether an asset shall be taken to be an in-house asset. That determination is a disallowable instrument under section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act. Section 71(5) allows for such a determination to be retrospective; that is, the commissioner's determination given in writing to the trustee of a super fund may be expressed to have taken effect at a time earlier than the time when the determination was made. That is seen as a positive measure as it means that, if a super fund asks for clarification of the status of a particular asset, it can be given in-house asset status from the date the super fund acquired it, rather than from the date the commissioner makes the determination. (Extension of time granted)
However, the government's amendments are allowing for regulations to be included as well as determinations—that is, the government is asking us to allow it to make regulations that can operate retrospectively. We ran into this type of request from the government in a previous debate on the recently passed surcharge tax amendment bills, and the parliament made a clear decision, Labor being supported by the Australian Democrats in the Senate, that the government should not have the power to make retrospective regulations. On that occasion, the government was trying to override the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
Section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act specifically relates to the timing of regulations and states that a regulation has no effect if it 
 would take effect before the date of notification and if the rights of a person `would be affected so as to disadvantage that person' and liabilities would be imposed on a person `in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of notification'. That is, regulations shall generally not be retrospective, particularly if they disadvantage anybody or impose a liability.
It could be argued that if regulations were made about the status or otherwise of in-house assets they would always be positive and that section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act would not come into play because nobody would be worse off. However, how does the parliament determine whether regulations that it has not seen are positive or negative? How can we make that decision when they have not even been drafted?
In the case of the surcharge tax bills, the parliament acted decisively to take the offending provisions out of the bills, and the government accepted the parliament's amendments. Those provisions were going to allow the government to have the capacity to override this part of the Acts Interpretation Act. Indeed, there may be some doubt as to the constitutional validity of the amendments which we are dealing with now. I would encourage those out there who are opposed to this bill—and there are many of them—to take a very close look at these provisions.
Retrospective regulation should not generally be allowed to be made. The parliament has acted on this before, and Labor will not be supporting government amendments 1 to 4 on this basis. They do not address any of the concerns expressed by small businesses, particularly those in regional and rural areas. There is no evidence in support of this legislation, and Labor will be opposing it.
We do not oppose government amendments 5 to 11. They go some way towards removing the retrospective nature of the legislation, and this is something we have constantly expressed concern about. It took the government over 18 months to bring this legislation before the parliament, and it is appropriate that the operative date for the transitional arrangements be the date of introduction rather than the date of announcement. That is because the 
 original announcement was different from the bill that was introduced. All those super funds that acted on the original announcement would potentially have been in breach of the final law. We will be supporting those amendments.
The bill as a whole, however, represents an attack on small business and an attack on regional development, and it mocks the principle of choice. I conclude by briefly referring to the comment by Barrie Dunstan in the Australian Financial Review  this morning concerning this bill and its likely passage. The article is headed, `Why more regulation when existing powers do the job?' Mr Dunstan says:
The Federal Government continues down a tortuous road with its reforms of small superannuation funds' investments.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Again, there is the uncertainty of legislation by media release and, it seems now, by regulations yet to be drafted or announced.
. . .              . . .             . . .
The question that remains unanswered is why the regulators—the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in the past and the Australian Taxation Office now—could not use their existing powers.
APRA identified problem funds in two surveys and the very extensive superannuation legislation provides scope and powers to punish breaches.
Indeed. I think the government and the Democrats would be well advised to take note of those observations.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—I rise to make a contribution to this debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999  to put once again on the record my concern about superannuation legislation and the ongoing discrimination which occurs against same sex couples. The member for Fisher might be bored with this issue and bored with me raising this issue, but the fact is that I have raised it. Now it is in double figures; this is speech No. 11 on this issue, and this is an issue that will not go away. The reason why I have had to give 11 speeches on this issue is that you have a weak, lily-livered government that is unprepared to ensure that a discrimination against a section of our society 
 be removed. Until that discrimination is removed, I will continue to raise it.
The government had an opportunity during this debate to do something. The fact is that, had we supported this legislation, we could have amended it to ensure that the discrimination was removed. However, because we do not support this bill because of its impact on small business and in particular on regional development, we were placed in a situation of being unable to reform superannuation for same sex couples through amendments to this bill.
However, the Democrats were not in that situation. The Democrats were in a situation, one which they find themselves in very regularly indeed, of doing deals behind closed doors with the government to ensure the passage of this government's conservative agenda. The Democrats once again did a deal with the government with regard to this legislation. But the Democrats did something else. Senator Bartlett, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, yesterday moved an amendment in the Senate. That amendment was to add these words at the end of the motion:
. . . and that there be laid on the table, on or before the last sitting day in March 2000, details of all legislative changes that would be required to ensure the recognition and equal treatment of same-sex couples under all Commonwealth superannuation and taxation legislation.
What a reasonable amendment to move. The amendment was about saying, `Let's get the relevant legislation on the table. Let's look at superannuation legislation. Let's look at taxation legislation. Let's look at the changes which are required to ensure that all Australians, regardless of sexual preference, have the same rights as each other.' That is what the debate about same sex superannuation is about. It is not about singling out people for special rights; it is about equal rights for all. As we approach the year 2000, this would have been an opportunity to show there was at least some goodwill.
But what we saw yesterday was quite extraordinary. What we saw was the government threatening to withdraw the whole bill 
 if Senator Bartlett's amendment was carried, because the Labor Party would have voted for it. What the government was saying there was not only does it not support reform—and there is nothing radical in this; this is reform which the Australian superannuation funds support; this is reform which the trade union movement supports; this is reform which the Association of Certified Practising Accountants support; this is reform which all those concerned with any discrimination support; it is reform which is consistent with the Senate committee which reported on superannuation; and it is reform which the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has suggested in a report to this parliament is needed so that we comply with international law—it is also not prepared to bring on a debate and a vote on this bill. The government is not even prepared to consider an amendment, in this case moved by Senator Bartlett, that we have access to the information because, from the point of view of the opposition or the Democrats, it is difficult to draft legislation in the area of superannuation and taxation that will not create anomalies. (Extension of time granted)
I find it absolutely extraordinary that the government is not prepared to accept this amendment. What is also extraordinary, it must be said, is the weakness of the Australian Democrats in withdrawing their own amendment. It is quite a Pythonesque situation when the Democrats move an amendment in the morning, the government says, `Well, we don't like it', so the Democrats then withdraw that amendment. That is an extraordinary situation, particularly in the context of Senator Greig's opportunistic attack on the Australian Labor Party in the Senate during the last sitting over the fact that we had reformed the register of senators' pecuniary interests.
There has been absolute hypocrisy from the Australian Democrats yet again. If they were fair dinkum about getting reform, they should not have withdrawn that amendment, because there was no discussion. I rang Senator Bartlett to find out what was going on, because I did not get a phone call—even though I am the sponsor of the private member's bill which has put this on the agenda. But the 
 response I got was, `Oh, no, we can't talk to the Labor Party.' Why can't they talk to the Labor Party? Because they are too busy talking to the government, caving in to their agenda. They caved in to their agenda on the GST, they got stared down on the superannuation legislation bill and they have been stared down by Senator Kemp on same sex rights for superannuation. The amendment was not even going to fix it, but it would have ensured that we should look at it, that we should have a consideration. It is quite extraordinary.
I just hope that those people who want an end to discrimination do not rely upon the Australian Democrats, because, as we saw, that would not be appropriate. I think also it must be said with regard to this bill that the debate which I saw in the Senate this morning was quite depressing. The homophobic comments of Senator Boswell and Senator Harris were comments which, if made about people's religion, race or gender, would have provoked an outcry which would be on the front page of every paper in Australia. When I switched to the Senate debate this morning I heard comments which were unfortunate and pathetic. I think that Australia has a long way to go if its public representatives can be so fearful of reform.
In fact, the Australian public are a fair way ahead of the position advocated by Senator Boswell. The Australian public have supported legislation to give equal rights to same sex couples. In New South Wales and Queensland there is legislation on the agenda, and the former Victorian Liberal government enacted legislation. The Tasmanian discrimination has been reformed in an appropriate way and there is support from across industry, unions and the community, for this reform to be taken on by the government.
I would like to see the Senate select committee on superannuation have a close look at what amendments are required to legislation to remove the current discrimination. I think that would be entirely appropriate for the Senate to act upon. Because surely now the government must realise that, with the Australian Labor Party, the Democrats and Senator Brown from the Greens, there is broad 
 support for reform. Also, I acknowledge that there are many people of goodwill in the government who know that there must be reform. (Extension of time granted)
But it is unfortunate that the government has not been prepared to bite the bullet. It is unfortunate, perhaps, that strategically this bill is so bad that we cannot support it, let alone move amendments to it, otherwise we would be in the position today of ensuring that there would be a vote on these issues. I can assure the honourable member opposite that there will be a vote on these issues and there will be a vote in the year 2000 and that vote will ensure that the discrimination is removed.
Surely it would be appropriate if the government took a bit of a lead and got the department—with its massive resources which we do not have access to—to have a look at how the legislation might be framed. Would that not be a gesture of goodwill and commonsense? Whilst superannuation in this country remains compulsory, that above everything else, I think, is an overriding concern. When we have something which is compulsory, discrimination is entirely inappropriate on that basis. In expressing once again my opposition to this bill and my disappointment at the actions of the government, I just reiterate my view that it is time for equal rights in superannuation legislation.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I think it is probably time for the member for Wills to take a cold shower and just sit back for a moment and contemplate the significance, purpose and importance of this very important legislation contained in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 .
The bill gives effect to the announcement in the 1998-99 budget to amend the investment rules for superannuation funds. The aim of the bill is to reduce risk to superannuation savings and to ensure that superannuation is preserved for the intended purpose of retirement income. In doing so the bill sets a sound framework for superannuation savings for decades to come.
When one listens to the honourable member for Wills, one could almost believe that the 
 bill does not assist small superannuation funds. The bill provides a significant concession to small superannuation funds to enable them to acquire business real property. Small superannuation funds will now be able to use up to 100 per cent of their assets to acquire business real property for members and to lease such property back to members. This measure has been warmly and widely welcomed by business and other groups.
As we debate financial legislation, I get sick and tired of hearing the Labor Party continue to bag the Australian Democrats. They are people who control the balance of power in the upper house, and most Australians want this parliament to work. Most Australians want us to be able to sit down as adults and talk. The constructive approach taken by Senator Meg Lees and her Democrat team since the election of the government in 1998 has been a refreshing change. The Democrats are prepared to sit down and talk with the government; they do not hesitate to express their concerns. But the ultimate outcome of such consultations is that we are able to have a workable parliament and there has been much real and meaningful reform.
If I were a Democrat, I would be appalled at the way Labor speaker after Labor speaker stands up in the parliament and criticises the fact that the Australian Democrats have ensured that the Australian parliament is workable. The next election will see the Labor Party pay a heavy price for its negativity. I believe the Labor Party stands condemned for criticising the very workmanlike and reasonable approach of Senator Meg Lees and the Australian Democrats.
The honourable member for Wills in his contribution also criticised the government for taking some time to introduce and bring the legislation to completion. The government has taken careful consideration of concerns raised following the initial announcement of the new investment rules in May 1998. The process has included releasing an exposure draft of the legislation in April of this year and allowing a period for public comment. Following comments received on the exposure draft of the legislation, the government has made a number of changes, particularly to 
 provide more generous transitional arrangements. These are included in the bill introduced in August 1999. The government considers that these processes are appropriate and, indeed, it is correct that one should take a reasonable amount of time to achieve a satisfactory outcome.
The member for Wills also suggested that superannuation trustees would have to unwind their assets. The facts are quite different. All arrangements in place prior to 11 August this year will be grandfathered. Therefore, they will not have to unwind those assets.
The member for Wills also claimed that the amendments before the chamber are an attack on small business. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that small superannuation funds benefit from the proposed changes through the increase in the exemption for business real property from 40 per cent to 100 per cent. We cannot overlook the disastrous record of the Labor Party over its 13 years in office, when the Labor Party introduced the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax, which we have substantially reduced. This impacted heavily on small business. Labor did nothing to relieve the crippling burden of taxes on small business yet it has the gall and hypocrisy to come into the House of Representatives and criticise the government for the very positive and meaningful changes we are making to legislation. (Extension of time granted)
The member for Wills also sought to criticise the government for making provision for bringing in regulations. The simple fact of the matter is that regulations are powerful instruments and if the opposition has any problem with respect to regulation, clearly the opposition has certain facilities available to it in this place or in the other place. The government has outlined our changes. We have issued a media release foreshadowing those changes. It is widely recognised in the Australian community where we stand on these matters and we will continue to talk widely with industry, particularly the accounting profession, in relation to these matters. These changes are beneficial.
The member for Wills also suggested that there would be in some way a driving of 
 investment from the small end of town to the big end of town. There is nothing in the legislation to stop superannuation funds from investing in regional Australia. All the rules do is to limit investments in related entities. In fact, regional Australia will be able to benefit from the business real property exemption.
The investment rules apply to both large and small funds. That is, an investment in an entity controlled by an employer or a member will be treated as an in-house asset. In fact, there are some concessions specifically targeted to small funds. Again, I mention the small business property exemption.
It is also interesting to note that self-managed funds have continued to grow strongly since the announcement of the new investment rules. The member for Wills will be interested to know that there has been an increase of some 20,000 funds.
The position taken by the opposition in this matter has been entirely non-constructive. They have not been prepared to support the principle of the legislation that they introduced in 1993. The prohibition on borrowing was one of the threshold issues with the bill introduced by the Labor Party. It was the Labor Party that introduced the prohibition, yet they are not supporting legislation that will maintain the integrity of the rules that they originally introduced.
The superannuation industry is correctly asking what Labor stands for when it comes to superannuation and how they can make a positive contribution to public policy issues. The Labor Party simply does have not a coherent position. It is prepared to do anything and say anything to scrape up a few votes. People do not like such an opportunistic approach to important public policy.
The honourable member for Grayndler re-entered the House, as he said, for the 11th occasion to talk about the impact of superannuation on same sex couples. At the outset, I want to point out that the issue raised is not relevant to the provisions of the bill currently before the chamber. I would, however, like to place on record that the government has already passed legislation which received royal assent on 31 May this year which 
 allows the trustee to pay death benefits to a deceased member's same sex partner where the member nominates the same sex partner to be a beneficiary on the beneficiary form and that partner is a dependant of the deceased member or his or her legal personal representative. That ought to be taken into account when judging the government's position on this matter.
As I said, this is very important and positive legislation. It is legislation which has been the result of wide consultation by the government in the community, and I am very pleased to commend the amendments to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration revealed himself to be sadly out of touch with the real world in relation to small business. We presented the evidence of the impact of this legislation on small businesses in Manjimup, Townsville, Maroochydore and other parts of Australia where they use do-it-yourself funds—
—Manjimup?
—Indeed. Manjimup got a big run yesterday and today.
—What about Wilson Tuckey's area—regional forest agreements?
—Absolutely. Regrettably, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation has shown no inclination whatsoever to support the town of Manjimup with his support for this legislation and its impact on the Manjimup packing shed, as I outlined to the House earlier. He received representations about this matter. He failed to act on those representations. That is to the detriment of Manjimup and, indeed, the broader Australian community.
We have a parliamentary secretary who is sadly out of touch with what is actually going on in small business. He says this is a government which has consulted, but it is a government which has ignored the submissions to the Senate select committee on superannuation concerning the impact of this legislation. Submission after submission said this legislation is not needed, not wanted, and will have 
 an adverse effect on the do-it-yourself funds. Nevertheless, the government chose to ignore those submissions.
We were asked what Labor stands for in relation to superannuation. Well, the former Prime Minister said that would make a cat laugh. Labor has been responsible for building up superannuation in this country, creating a pool of superannuation funds in the order of $400 billion where once there was nothing of that kind, and extending superannuation from 40 per cent of the work force, at the time we came to office, to over 90 per cent.
This government's obligation in relation to same sex couples is to have that matter considered by the Senate select committee on superannuation so that we can have proper legislation drafted. All the practical issues would be worked through. It was Labor that established superannuation in this country and grew it from something like 40 per cent of the work force to the over 90 per cent of the work force it is today through the implementation of the superannuation guarantee.
The parliamentary secretary expressed concern that we were critical of the Democrats. Every time the Democrats choose to function as the third party of the coalition—as the minister says, the third leg of the coalition—we will draw that to the attention of the Australian electorate. As we have been doing with the GST, so we will do in superannuation and every other area where they choose to roll over. They are stared down by Senator Kemp—what a sad fate to be stared down by Senator Kemp—and just do the government's bidding. He is regarded as a joke in the superannuation community, let me tell you.
—On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask the member for Wills to withdraw that reflection on a member of the other house.
—I simply made an observation as a matter of fact that he is regarded as a joke in the superannuation industry and I do not think it is your place to find it offensive on his behalf. I do not think the standing orders provide you with that entitlement. 
—It has been a robust debate, there has been a lot of interjection, so let us continue with the debate.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.	 It is regrettable the Democrats have seen fit to be party to this legislation which the government has not been able to demonstrate any genuine need for, when the evidence before the senate committee provided no support for that, nor did the evidence we have seen in submissions to us all. Indeed, there are many people on the government side of the House who know that we are right in relation to this and are happy to talk to us privately in the corridors about these matters. As a result, we are not prepared to support the government's legislation and are not prepared to support government amendments 1 to 4.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—We agree to the substance of the principles contained in the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1999 . However, we will move several amendments. I understand that shortly those amendments which we have recently finalised will be circulated to government members and other speakers.
I think it is fair to say that this issue has been around since the 1995 case of Teoh in the High Court of Australia, as an issue confronting both the former government and this government. But at the outset of this debate I want to take away an element of controversy which was revealed, firstly, in a media release of 6 March 1998, issued by the current Attorney-General. He opened his press release with:
Labor's continuing opposition to the government's administrative law reforms has allowed an illegal entrant, who is also a convicted drug offender, to remain in Australia despite the government's repeated attempts to deport him.
The Attorney went on in his press release to refer to Teoh's case and also the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the need for legislation, which is 
 contained in this bill, to override that decision. That is the first example.
The second example is an answer to a question without notice from Mr Barresi. Mr Ruddock, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, took the same opportunity effectively to accuse the Australian Labor Party of standing in the way of deportation of criminals because, the government alleged, we were standing in the way of a previous bill which mirrored this Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1999 . I will not read out the Minister's reply to that question without notice, but, again, it was one which was entirely misleading, and unfortunately so, because both the Attorney-General and the minister have sought to malign a very significant treaty, the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Why do I say that they are completely wrong? They are completely wrong because since 1992—bearing in mind that the original decision in Teoh's case was made in 1991—the criminal deportation policy of the government has specifically required those administering the policy to have regard to the principles contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This is reaffirmed by the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The new policy specifically says:
The government takes very seriously its obligation to protect all elements of the Australian community and, in particular, the most vulnerable people within it. The government bears a special responsibility to protect children.
It goes on:
Therefore, I, Philip Maxwell Ruddock, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, hereby declare the following guidelines . . . 
The primary considerations—and they are headed `Primary Considerations'—are set out in paragraph 6 of the guidelines. Those primary considerations are:
In making a decision whether or not to deport a non-citizen, there are two primary considerations,
(a)	 the expectations of the Australian community—
and the next is the relevant one—
(b)	 in all cases involving a parental relationship between a child, or children, and the potential deportee the best interests of the child, or the children.
The guidelines then go on to expand the relevant criteria that have to be applied in considering as a primary consideration the best interests of the child.
So to suggest that the principle in Teoh's case is now an impediment to the deportation of criminals is wrong and grossly misleading—offensively so, irresponsibly so, because it involves a process of maligning a fundamentally important human rights treaty which has been signed by just about every nation in the world, the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
I want to put on the record very firmly that the government has acted with gross irresponsibility in that tactic of trying to accuse the opposition of standing in the way of deportation of criminals. Again I repeat that the fact that the migration officials considering issues of deportation are specifically required by those guidelines to which I have referred to have regard, as a primary consideration, to the best interests of the child or the children involved. So any emotion, any sensationalism which those in the government may want to bring into this debate, is firmly dismissed by those guidelines, and I hope they will have regard to those and will not be repeating the entirely false, grossly misleading representations contained in the press release and in the minister's reply to a question on notice.
But the effect of the bill, as I have said, is substantially to overcome the effects of the decision in the High Court of Australia in The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v. Teoh. In that case the High Court held that where an international agreement is ratified by Australia, a legitimate expectation arises that the administrators will have regard to that treaty in fulfilling their obligations of procedural fairness.
It is important to discuss there the concept of `legitimate expectation', which is an element of the rules of procedural fairness. In other words, the fact that the administrators considering, for example, the deportation of 
 a person convicted of a crime have to have regard to a convention as a legitimate expectation simply means that the person has a right to present argument as to how that convention applies to their individual circumstances. It will not control or determine the day. It is simply giving them the opportunity to argue their case relevantly in terms of the provisions of that treaty to the administrator. So that is all we are talking about in respect of legitimate expectation.
Before Teoh's case it was generally conceded that there were four elements to the concept. One was that where there had been a regular course of conduct which would suggest that someone had an expectation, it would continue. Express or implied assurances made by an administrator or someone in the executive arm of government was the second. A third was where there were going to be significant consequences by departing from that expectation either in terms of economic loss or damage to reputation. The fourth was where someone had satisfied statutory criteria. I think it is fair to say that Teoh's case added a fifth criterion to that concept of legitimate expectation and that is where Australia has entered into an international treaty and has specifically ratified an international treaty.
In terms of international treaties, I should say that they have unquestionably influenced the construction of not only the constitution, but also other legislation and subordinate legislation. It is also clear on authorities of the High Court that an international convention may play a part in the development by the courts of the common law in this country. There are now numerous decisions of both state Supreme Courts and the High Court of Australia to that effect.
So, while we have a situation where treaties are of relevance to Australia, the criticism of Teoh is that it went too far in so far as it is the responsibility of the executive arm of government, relevantly ministers, to enter into treaties and to ratify those treaties. The criticism of the High Court's decision in Teoh was that it effectively gave the executive the power to make law to the extent that it creat 
 ed a legitimate expectation which then had to be applied by administrators.
Two ministers in the former Labor government with carriage of and responsibility in this area—the former Senator Gareth Evans as Minister for Foreign Affairs, as he then was, and Michael Lavarch, the Attorney-General—shortly after the Teoh decision issued a statement expressing that it was not the intention of the executive that treaties so ratified would have that effect. But difficulties do arise from the decision in Teoh.
I have to say that the fear and the apprehension that it was going to have broader effects have largely subsided with the passage of time. Nevertheless, the Australian Labor Party recognises three problems which require addressing through legislation. The first two were identified in the dissenting judgment of Justice McHugh in the Teoh case. In respect of the first one, he said:
If the result of ratifying an international convention was to give rise to a legitimate expectation that that convention would be applied in Australia, the executive government of the Commonwealth would have effectively amended the law of this country.
To the extent that it created a legitimate expectation applying in the exercise of procedural fairness, that statement is correct. I think it is important, particularly in this day and age where all the research suggests that there is much public disdain for what the people regard as the political elite—indeed, contempt, I think it is fair to say, for members of the executive, in some cases justified, in some cases not—that members of the public are reassured that it is not the responsibility of the executive to make law. I think that the thrust of this bill is important in that respect.
The second consequence of the Teoh decision which gave concern to Justice McHugh was, to use his words:
The consequences for administrative decision-makers in this country would be enormous.
He referred to the fact there are currently about 900 treaties; I think there may be even more now. As His Honour pointed out:
Only a small percentage of them has been enacted into law. Administrative decision-makers would have to ensure that their decision-making complied with every relevant convention. 

I have to stop and just contemplate there which member of the parliament would be able to list those 900-odd treaties. I doubt whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the shadow foreign minister would have the capacity to do that. I think it is completely unrealistic to expect all administrators discharging their public service obligations to be aware of the totality of those conventions, how they interact with one another and specifically how they apply to the tasks which they are required by statute, regulations and statutory rules to perform.
I think it is fair to say that to allow that position to remain would be an abdication of the responsibility of the parliament. It is very much our position that there are a number of very important treaties that exist in Australia and people should not be under the misapprehension that treaties exist only in the human rights area. There are fundamentally important treaties regarding defence and intelligence cooperation; cooperation in respect of criminal law enforcement; extradition of criminals; combating the drug trade; protecting our environment; and trade and investment. There is a whole range of occupational health and safety treaty obligations and, indeed, there are numerous treaties of the International Labour Organisation which underpin to some extent, if they were applied at least, safe and fair working conditions in an environment where, increasingly, countries are coming under pressure to undercut each other's trade competitiveness by undercutting the terms and conditions of employees within those countries. To have a safe and secure underbase of ILO conventions is at least some guard against that trend of globalisation.
So treaties have a broad range of significance to Australia. This brings me to a third issue which was not considered by Justice McHugh: that is, the perception that exists in some elements of the community, regrettably some extreme elements of the community, that international treaties are part of some international plot to usurp Australia's political system. They are not that. The fact that Australia enters into an international treaty is effectively a declaration of our sovereignty as a nation, willingly entering into that treaty as 
 an independent nation for our own interests. We effectively contract with other nations, either on a bilateral basis or a multilateral basis, and the fact that we do that is a declaration of our sovereignty.
It is important that we negate that perception that treaties are some form of an evil plot because, as I have said, there are so many fundamentally important treaties to our trade, our defence, our environment and our working conditions. It is important that Australians are educated and learn that treaties have fundamental importance and that we take away apprehensions, nervousness, anxiety—or even at the most extreme and paranoid example—a perception that there is some international plot going on. So with respect to this third area, the substance of the bill is justified, if only to the extent that it will reduce that anxiety. As I said, treaties have a very important part to play in Australia's welfare, both domestically and internationally.
In relation to what has happened since the Teoh decision was handed down on 7 April 1995, I have referred to the statement of Gareth Evans and Michael Lavarch on 10 May 1995. This government followed a similar route on 27 February 1997. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General similarly issued a statement, declaring on behalf of the government that `the act of entering into a treaty does not give rise to legitimate expectations in administrative law which could form the basis for challenging any administrative decision from today's date.'
Subsequently, the government introduced the predecessor to this bill, the  Administrative Decisions (Effective International Instruments) Bill 1997, which lapsed on the prorogation of parliament prior to the last election. It is effectively this bill which has reintroduced that legislation, with one small change. Again, I stress that the Australian Labor Party is supporting the substance of the bill.
Our amendments, which should be being circulated at this time, will be proposing a change in respect to recognising that treaties have effect under Australian domestic law only to the extent that they have been incorporated into legislation or that their sub 
 stance has been incorporated into Australian domestic law by operation of the common law—that is, where the substance of the treaty itself has been incorporated into Australia's domestic law rather than the effect of a treaty by virtue of the Teoh analysis. That will be the difference between the government and the Labor Party at the end of the day when we are considering these amendments.
In considering these amendments, we are aware that clause 7 of the bill specifically preserves the operation of treaties in other respects. It says:
To avoid doubt, section 5—
which negates the effect of Teoh—
does not affect any other operation or effect, or use that may be made, of an international instrument in Australian law.
There are numerous pronouncements of the High Court as to how conventions can be used to assist in the construction of legislation and also with respect to the development of Australia's common law. The most frequently cited passage, I think it is fair to say, is from a decision of Chief Justice Brennan in Mabo and Others v. Queensland (No. 2), which was a 1992 decision. His Honour said in that case, for instance:
The opening up of international remedies to individuals pursuant to Australia's accession to the optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . . . brings to bear on the common law the powerful influence of the covenant and the international standards it imports. The common law does not necessarily conform with international law but international law is a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law, especially when international law declares the existence of universal human rights.
So it is essentially that judicial authority that the opposition will be picking up in its amendments, saying that if the substance of a treaty has been incorporated into Australia's domestic law by operation of the common law—that is, decisions made by judges—it is appropriate in those circumstances for administrators to have regard to those treaties as equally as if that treaty or the substance of the treaty had been incorporated into legislation by an act of parliament.
I have gone on to criticise the government for maligning the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I should also say that a number of other vitally important human rights treaties exist in Australia. They are set out in the Human Rights and Equal Community Commission Act 1996 as instruments of international significance. They include, for instance: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Labour Organisation Discrimination in Employment and Occupation Convention, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, the Declaration of the Rights of Disabled Persons, the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons and the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion and Belief.
We have other fundamental laws that protect Australia's human rights. We have the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which is based on an international treaty; the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which is also based on an international treaty; the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, which is also based on an international treaty; and also, controversially but importantly, the Privacy Act 1988. Moves to take privacy protections into the private sector will be based on international conventions.
There are a number of vitally important international conventions. The position of the Australian Labor Party is that Teoh's case needs to be overturned for three reasons. Firstly, it should not be the case that the executive is even perceived as being involved in a law-making capacity. Under our Westminster system, it is for the parliament to make laws and for the executive to implement those laws. That is the first point.
The second point that I have made is that it would be a complete and total abdication of parliament's responsibility to require administrators to have regard to the whole box and dice of 900 treaties in discharging their public service obligations, in figuring out what treaties interrelate to each other and in applying those to their functions as public servants. That is the second point.
The third point is that there is unquestionably in some elements of the community, albeit sometimes some extreme elements of the community, a perception that international treaties have the potential to undermine Australia's political sovereignty. To take away that baseless fear and concern, this legislation is justified in pointing out that the mere fact that a treaty has been ratified does not have that effect.
Having made those three points, I say to the government that there are a number of fundamentally important treaties—those treaties I have referred to in the human rights area—which Australians are entitled to have applied to their daily lives and which Australians are entitled to expect administrators will apply in the discharge of their responsibilities. I think the government should be doing much more to draw to the attention of administrators, specifically through enactment, their obligations under those treaties and to educate not only administrators but also members of the public about the existence of those obligations.
I have come full circle to where I started, condemning the government for maligning the effect of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is entirely baseless. The government, with considerable regret, has been sitting on a report of the Joint Select Committee on Treaties, which was handed down in August 1998. I was on the committee. It is an excellent and unanimous report in circumstances where government members originally engaged in the task with some suspicion of the effects of the treaty. At the end of the day, at the end of all the evidence and analysis, we saw that the principles contained in the treaty were fundamentally sound.
While we generally consider that our children in Australia are far luckier than most, there are still numerous areas where that is not the case. There are still about 10,000 cases of child abuse and neglect reported every year. There is rising youth suicide, youth homelessness and massive disadvantage, whether we like it or not, in educational and social opportunities. Importantly, the treaties committee recommended the establishment of an office for children, gave guidelines 
 as to how that work should be undertaken and the importance of emphasising support for families as protectors and nurturers of children—as well as their own circumstances where children as individuals need protection, development and nurturing as future Australians.
While we support the thrust of this legislation, the government should be doing much more in the human rights area. It should stop this irresponsible attempt to malign the effects of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and it should implement immediately some of the major recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Treaties on the Convention on the Rights of the Child.",REPS,<title>ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS (EFFECT OF INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—The Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1999 , or the content of the bill, in this form or similar, has been debated in this parliament on numerous occasions since the first version was introduced by a Labor government in 1995. If ever there was a bill that has been examined for its intent, its impact and its implication, it would have to be this one. I looked up the Hansard  record this morning and found no less than 43 utterances on this bill or its predecessor bills in this House since 1995. The detail of this bill—or its predecessors—has been analysed by a variety of speakers from both sides. On three separate occasions the Attorney-General of the day has made a second reading speech. This legislation has been referred to various committees and it has been debated extensively in the other place. There have been enunciations by almost everyone who has a law degree or a passing familiarity with one and who has passed through this House over the past four years or so.
This morning I read the last effort of the member for Barton on the previous bill in June 1997 when it was introduced. On that occasion the member for Barton supported the bill's predecessor. He was not looking to amend it then. In looking back through Hansard one is struck by the shifting positions of the Labor Party members. They introduced a similar bill and, of course, supported it. After they lost government we introduced a similar bill and they supported 
 it. As it lapsed, we again introduced it and now they want to amend it.
I have not read the amendments yet but the picture that emerges over time is one of either a disappointing display of political opportunism or Labor trying to save face, and, in saving face, it seems Labor has two. Nothing in this bill, nor in the bill introduced by the opposition when in government, detracts from Australia's international human rights reputation. Nor does this bill—and neither did Labor's bill—breach our obligations in that regard. Labor rejected that notion in 1995 and again in 1997 but now it makes up for its own lack of policy by doing an about face on principles and policies it once held.
Perhaps the member for Barton is attempting to deflect any memory of Labor's approach to the treaty making process that highlighted the impact of the Teoh case and all the secrecy that surrounded the government's treaty making at that time. This government has revised the treaty procedures, giving a greater role to the parliament, the states and territories and the community in the treaty process, ensuring that treaties are scrutinised before ratification. But this does not obviate the need for the legislation to deal with the effects of the Teoh decision, particularly because of the manner in which Labor made Australia a party to numerous treaties during its time in government.
Given the level of debate that has already taken place, it is difficult not to be repetitious, but I remind the House that this bill is a response to the High Court decision in the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v. Teoh, which was delivered on 7 April 1995. In that case the High Court decided that the act of entering into a treaty gives rise to a legitimate expectation that an administrative decision maker will act consistently with the treaty. If, on appeal, the relevant administrative decision is found to be inconsistent with the treaty, it will be held invalid unless the applicant has been given an opportunity to be heard on the issue.
The High Court held that these legitimate expectations could be set aside by executive or legislative indications to the contrary. The purpose of the bill, therefore, is to set aside 
 the legitimate expectations that might arise out of entry into a treaty; that is, it is a legislative indication to the contrary. The purpose is to ensure that the executive act of entering into a treaty does not give rise to legitimate expectations in administrative law.
I recite the facts of the case only briefly just to put this bill in context and to remind members opposite why they put up a bill in the first place. Mr Teoh was a Malaysian citizen who came to Australia in May 1988 and was granted a temporary entry permit. In July that year he married an Australian citizen. At the time of the marriage Mrs Teoh had four children. Later the couple had three more. In October 1988, he applied for and was granted a further temporary entry permit which allowed him to remain in Australia until February 1989. Before that permit expired he applied for a permanent entry permit, a grant of resident status. In 1990, when his application for resident status was still pending, he was convicted of offences relating to the importation of heroin and received a sentence of imprisonment.
In January 1991 he was informed that his application for resident status had been refused because he did not satisfy the good character requirements—because of his criminal record. On review, the Immigration Review Tribunal recommended that the delegates' decision to refuse permanent resident status be affirmed. He was to be deported. In reaching the decision the panel did not ignore the interests of the children. Claims on compassionate grounds were put forward, but those grounds were not considered to be compelling enough for the waiver of the policy of good character requirements for a permanent resident visa.
Mr Teoh appealed to the Federal Court. At first instance his claim was dismissed, but he appealed to the Full Court, which found in his favour. The then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs appealed to the High Court, which also decided in favour of Mr Teoh. The decision to deport Mr Teoh was stayed until the application for the grant of resident status be reconsidered and determined.
In reaching its decision, the High Court relied heavily on the Convention of the Rights 
 of the Child, a treaty that had not been incorporated into Australia law. The court focused on article 3(1), which provides as follows:
In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.
I remind the House that the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and the then Attorney-General, Mr Michael Lavarch, issued a press release on 10 May 1995 which was said `to clarify the position following the recent decision in the Teoh case'. Senator Evans and Mr Lavarch stated on behalf of the then government:
Entering into an international treaty is not reason for raising any legitimate expectation that government decision-makers will act in accordance with the treaty if the relevant provisions of that treaty have not been enacted into domestic Australian law.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—Yesterday I made reference to the incorporated Manjimup Community Food Centre. Today, the board's secretary, Ms Alison Muir, has advised my office that at no time has the management committee of the Manjimup Community Food Centre made any decision to close this enterprise and that the first the committee was aware of the remarks of the manager, Mr Robert Johns, was when they heard them on television.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this is an abuse of the forms of the House. The matter of the Manjimup centre and the manager's statement that the centre would be closed was a question to the Prime Minister, not to this minister.
—The Minister for Forestry and Conservation is adding to an answer that he gave yesterday, and I will listen closely to what he is saying.
—The managing committee is highly concerned as to the extreme level of anxiety that can be generated amongst their pensioner and welfare client base as a result of the misleading statements of the ABC and the Leader of the Opposition.
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Minister for Forestry and Conservation may have finished but, if he has not, the question that was asked him was about the Queensland forest agreement. That was the question he was asked yesterday. What on earth did that have to do with that particular question?
—The reply that the minister gave yesterday was relative to what was happening to the Manjimup community, and it was in that context that I allowed him to add to the answer.",REPS,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Regional Forest Agreement: Queensland</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1

Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1999-12-09,"—For the information of honourable members, I present a schedule of outstanding government responses to reports of House of Representatives and Joint committees incorporating reports tabled and details of government responses made in the period between 29 June 1999 and the date of the last schedule and 8 December 1999. Copies of the schedule are being made available to honourable members and will be incorporated in Hansard .
The schedule read as follows—
THE SPEAKER'S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO REPORTS OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND JOINT COMMITTEES
(also incorporating reports tabled and details of Government responses made in the period between 29 June 1999, the date of the last schedule, and 8 December 1999)
8 DECEMBER 1999
THE SPEAKER'S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO COMMITTEE REPORTS 

On 7 December 1999, the Government presented its response to a schedule of outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports tabled in the House of Representatives on 30 June 1999. The Government had earlier in the Parliament affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports presented during the present Parliament within three months of their presentation and to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments.
The Government's commitment follows the undertaking by successive Governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity.
The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and Government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last sched

ule was presented on 30 June 1999. It also lists reports for which the House has received no Government response. A schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings.
The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response. The Government's responses to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—In the normal course of things, this motion would have a lot of debate from this side of the House because it is an issue about which we feel strongly. We are going to vote for the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Bill 1999 , and we will support these amendments, but it is a process and an outcome about which we have very profound reservations and qualifications. But we will support the bill and we will support it briefly because the reason this matter is being considered now is to facilitate its consideration in the House so that it can go expeditiously back to the Senate. This will facilitate the conclusion of our proceedings and also ensure that this package is properly passed and the money is made available to the industry before the conclusion of the parliamentary sittings.
Both I and the member for McMillan feel obliged to make some brief remarks: I because of the general nature of the concerns I have and the member for McMillan because of certain specific matters relating to his constituency. I assure the House that, notwithstanding the fact that in the normal course of things this would be a lengthy contribution, I will keep it brief.
The amendments that are being moved are those required by the detail of the regulatory package being put in place within the framework of this bill, and we do not oppose the amendments. But in the normal course of things when this bill came back we would have also been dealing with an amendment from the opposition, for which we had a majority in the Senate, which would have required that this package be reviewed in 2003 before expiry of the scheme and that changes to the tariff regime as a part of that take effect on 1 January 2005.
The government has committed itself to conducting a review of these policy arrangements in 2005 to take account of Australia's APEC commitments and progress on market 
 access, but there is no provision for this review to take place before the legislated tariff reductions take effect or before the scheme expires. This is a bizarre bit of policy. We protested about that when it occurred in the auto industry and we protest again. We had the numbers in the Senate to pass an amendment to require that review be undertaken but we knew that, had we had persisted with that, the government would not have accepted it and we would have prevented the flow of $700 million of assistance to the industry. We will not do that. What we do is point out to industry—and the industry is now well aware—small businesses and the workers that if they want that review in 2003 they will have to elect a Labor government at the next election. There is no other way to get that review. We will make sure that everybody in this industry knows that and that will be an issue at the next election.
The debate here is being truncated with our cooperation so the bill can be passed today, 9 December 1999. The government says we must do this to expedite the package. Let us remember, this package was first announced in September 1997. The final commitment and the agreement was in July 1998. The package was introduced into the parliament in March 1999: sit around and then hurry, that is this minister's approach. So for nine months this legislation has sat on the shelf and then on the last day they truncate the process so there cannot be proper debate and the House cannot consider it adequately.
We will not use that as a reason to further delay $700 million worth of assistance to the industry. The industry warrants it and the jobs are needed. We will not oppose the bills because we want to let the industry get on with its work. But the failure to have a review is bizarre and absurd policy. The delay is merely an indication of this minister's continuing inattention to his responsibilities, his complete lack of interest in industry issues. He is in the wrong portfolio. He shows no interest and no support, and the way in which he has handled this matter exhibits that. We will not oppose these amendments. We will not delay the passage of these bills, but we give very clear notice that this will be a big 
 issue for debate when the next election comes around.",REPS,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM BILL 1999</title>",<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,26,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—In the interests of expediting this matter, I will speak very briefly. This matter is important to my constituency having within it, as I do, two important employers—Rocklea Spinning Mills and the Givoni Clothing Company.
I have spoken to the department on several occasions, and also raised in the industry, science and resources committee the concern that I have that the provisions of the package do not allow those two employers to be able to receive any assistance from the $720 million package. My support and the Labor Party's support for this bill is on the understanding that these two important employers in my electorate are able to receive the same assistance as every other employer in the country. As yet we have been unable to receive a definitive answer from the department about this. However, we have received a broad understanding that those two important employers would be able to receive assistance, and it is on this basis that I support the bill.

"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—by leave—I am pleased to make the ninth annual statement to parliament on Australia's development cooperation program.
This last year has been one of major challenges and change, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia has been at the forefront of responding to those challenges. We have promoted our national interests, in a way which has strengthened our standing in the region and the world. It has also been a year of great achievements, with the aid program playing a practical and positive role in Australia's contribution to the stability and development of our region.
Australian support, including through the aid program, has helped our neighbours emerge from the economic crisis and set out 
 on the path to recovery and sustainable growth.
We have helped Indonesia begin its transition to democracy, with substantial assistance for that country's first democratic elections in four decades.
Australia has been instrumental in the East Timorese being able to choose their own future—and is now playing a strong part in helping them realise that future.
Papua New Guinea—our largest aid partner—has a new government, which is committed to economic reform. Australia is providing solid backing to its reform efforts. Our aid program in Bougainville continues to underpin the peace process on the province.
We have continued to help the island nations of the South Pacific pursue their economic and social reform agendas.
Australia responded quickly and effectively to help the Solomon Islands government deal with the impact of the Guadalcanal/Malaita tensions, including through emergency humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance.
The government has ensured that the aid program is well-placed to play its part. We have provided additional funds to the program for East Timor. In September, the Treasurer and I announced an additional contribution of $35 million over three years to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, HIPCI, to help lower the debt burden of the world's poorest nations. We have assisted East Timorese and Kosovar evacuees in Australia. These commitments will increase official development assistance this financial year to over $1.6 billion. Thus at this stage, our ODA/GNP ratio looks set to increase from the previously estimated 0.25 per cent to 0.28 per cent.
These increases are substantial. But volume is not the only—or even the most important—measure of the government's achievement in the development field. More important are the quality and impact of development. This has been a long-standing concern of mine. And the government has lifted aid quality, as demonstrated by the recent review of Australia's aid program by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD. This peer review by other donor countries conclud 
 ed with a press release on 7 December in these terms:
Australia's development cooperation programme has gone through an impressive process of restructuring and renewal since the last peer review in May 1996. Continuing reforms and adaptations to aid policies and management have improved the quality and impact of the programme. A strengthened approach to programme planning, implementation, and evaluation are an integral part of (the) focus on quality. These reforms put Australia in the vanguard of DAC members' aid management practices.
This could not be a more positive report card on our aid program from our peers. It is really quite excellent.
Governance
The different challenges over the last year have had their own individual natures and circumstances. But, in reviewing the year, we see that a common thread is `governance'.
Governance covers many powerful concepts, including good government, capacity building, transparency and accountability, human rights and the equitable rule of law. It is about what makes a good society—where citizens and groups voice their interests, mediate their differences and exercise their rights, both in the private sector and in the public domain.
Societies in which decisions by government can be questioned and contested are ones in which good decisions are more likely to be made. The process through which governments are forced to pause, consider alternatives and then defend their decisions promotes better outcomes.
This government has recognised the critical role of governance in achieving good development outcomes. In my 1997 annual report, Better aid for a better future, I made governance a specific focus of our aid program. Since then, governance has grown to 15 per cent of aid expenditure, or over $220 million in 1998-99. The program targets four main areas to advance good governance: economic and financial management, law and justice, public sector management and the development of civil society.
The importance of governance has been thrown into even sharper relief this year as we 
 look more closely at some of the key developments, starting with the East Asia financial crisis.
The East Asia crisis
There are many explanations for the crisis. But one explanation which is relevant to all the affected countries is governance—quality of prudential supervision of banks, transparency and accountability of economic decision making and so on. Governance is also the key to the region's recovery and its sustainable future. For these reasons, Australia has sought to strengthen governance capacities within the region.
In last year's statement, I referred to the major $50 million package of economic governance assistance for crisis affected economies. Implementation of the initiative is well under way, with over $40 million of activities now completed or in progress.
To support APEC's response to the crisis, Australia commissioned a study on the impacts of the crisis on children and social safety nets. To address some of the issues highlighted in the study, the Prime Minister announced at the APEC leaders meeting in Auckland a three-year, $5 million social protection facility for East Asia.
Governance was also a major theme of the major international meeting on aid responses to the Asia crisis, which I convened in Sydney in March this year. The meeting went a long way in shoring up greater international coordination and reinforcing political commitment to address the economic and social impacts of the crisis. Delegates emphasised in particular the importance of strengthening governance frameworks to promote a quick and sustainable recovery.
The meeting also endorsed my proposal to establish the Asia Recovery Information Centre. This Internet based information exchange centre is now based at the Asian Development Bank in Manila. It will enhance coordination between donors and regional governments to promote sustained recovery.
Fortunately, the past 12 months have seen the economies of East Asia reviving. The five crisis countries—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Korea—are now 
 expected to have average growth rates of almost three per cent in 1999 and four per cent in 2000. While this is good news, there is no cause for complacency. The situation still remains fragile. There is a risk that the strengthening recovery could reduce the urgency of reform. A continuing emphasis on governance issues is vital.
This point was reinforced by Khun Anand, former Thai Prime Minister, when he was in Australia last month as a guest of the Centre for Democratic Institutions, a body which I established 18 months ago. Mr Anand noted Thailand's achievements over the past decade and emphasised the importance of democratic, open and accountable government in working towards his country's goals.
Within East Asia, mention should be made of Indonesia, which in many ways suffered most from the crisis. As I have indicated, our aid program has been helping Indonesia's transition to democracy and its emerging economic recovery. We provided $14.3 million to support the Indonesian elections. We commenced a $70 million, three-year package of capacity building in economic and financial management. We have provided humanitarian assistance to ensure people have food and medicine and to keep children in schools. We look forward to supporting the efforts of the new Indonesian government to achieve a more prosperous and democratic nation.
Our leadership role in East Timor speaks for itself. We provided over $20 million to the United Nations Consultation Process on Autonomy. Since the ballot, Australian leadership of INTERFET has helped restore security. Australia has also played a critical role in the international humanitarian response, providing basic shelter, food and water to the people of East Timor.
The challenge of building a new nation is great, including developing an open, accountable and efficient government and administration as well as a strong civil society. It will require a major and coordinated effort from the international community. Australia will play a significant role in sharing the burden. Assistance to the East Timorese people—that is, those in both East and West Timor—will 
 total at least $75 million this financial year, including the additional $60 million for the aid program I announced on 22 November.
Papua New Guinea
Turning to another close neighbour, the election of the Morauta government in Papua New Guinea has provided a new impetus for economic policy reform and improved governance.	Australia's aid program is providing support for this reform impetus. On 1 September, I announced that the final payment of budget support to Papua New Guinea, worth some $30 million, would be brought forward. We have provided further technical assistance to the key economic agencies in Papua New Guinea.
In October, our Prime Minister and Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister, Sir Mekere Morauta, signed a new treaty on development cooperation. The treaty will build on the governance results already being achieved through the aid program. It provides for the establishment of an `Incentive Fund', which will reward excellence and promote contestability among Papua New Guinean government agencies and community and private organisations. It will support reform efforts that local communities want, which have real impact and which will last.
During the Prime Minister's visit to Papua New Guinea, he committed $120 million to help retire Papua New Guinea debt and implement structural adjustment programs. While this loan is not aid, it is another demonstration of Australian support for Papua New Guinea's reform agenda and, in particular, Papua New Guinea's re-engagement with the IMF and World Bank.
Australia also continues to support the Bougainville peace process through a program of reconstruction and rehabilitation and logistical support for the continuing peace negotiations. Technical support has also been provided to the Bougainville provincial authorities to strengthen their planning processes.
South Pacific
As well as PNG, other South Pacific countries remain a strong focus for the aid program. Improving governance is one of the 
 keys to helping the island nations achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance. An important tool in recognising and rewarding those Pacific island countries showing demonstrated commitment to essential economic and public sector management reforms is the policy and management reform initiative. This initiative has been steadily increasing over the last four years to its current level of over $14 million and has funded such diverse projects as a new computerised customs system and a regional media training project.
Community involvement
Before concluding my statement to parliament today, I want to acknowledge the Australian community's involvement in tackling the challenges facing developing countries in our region. I have been struck by the generosity of the Australian people and their belief in a fair go for all. Community involvement in the aid program has been further extended through the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development Program. The program, now in its second year, has placed 140 young Australians in the region.
The government has also moved to recognise and strengthen the important relationship between the government and non-government organisations in Australia's overseas aid program. A few months ago I issued a policy statement, which provides the framework for a productive working relationship between the government and NGOs.
Another initiative involving the community is the initiative called Destroy a Minefield, which I launched in November. This initiative will assist minefields clearance in Cambodia. Every $2 raised in the community will be matched by $1 from the government.
Conclusion
With a year of achievement behind us for Australia in general, and the aid program in particular, we look ahead to building on that success. We can maximise the impact of our aid efforts in reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development if we continue to do three things.
First, we need to remain focused on those areas where we have the real capacity to assist. Governance is one of those areas.
Second, we need to be alert and responsive to the rapidly changing environment, particularly in our region. No-one accurately predicted all the tumultuous events that occurred in the last few years. The only safe prediction for the future is that the unexpected is likely to happen—and we need to be able to respond quickly.
Finally, what really matters is that things actually change for the better. I want to see us play our part in partnership with our neighbours, to help them reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. That is the test. The way we do that is to continue to make our aid program professional, driven by quality, and focused on real impact. That way we will make a difference.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Development Cooperation Program</title>,Ministerial Statements,27,1
"Brereton, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—by leave—I am pleased to have this opportunity to respond to the Minister for Foreign Affairs's annual statement on Australia's overseas aid program. There is, I think, an increasing element of casual routine about these end of year statements. Nonetheless, it is a very worthwhile opportunity for me today to reaffirm Labor's bipartisan support for Australia's overseas aid program.
This has been, as the minister observed in his statement, a very big year for foreign aid. I think everyone would agree with that. I would like to make a few points about our international development assistance, especially the implications of our very significant and growing effort in East Timor. On 22 November, the minister announced that Australia would contribute an additional $60 million this financial year to assist East Timor's humanitarian and reconstruction needs. Together with the $14 million previously committed to East Timor, this represents Australia's largest ever contribution to relieving an international humanitarian crisis. It is a commitment that of course enjoys Labor's wholehearted support.
Having visited East Timor as a member of the Australian parliamentary observer group for the 30 August ballot, and more recently in the company of the Leader of the Opposition and my colleagues the member for Cunningham and the member for the Northern Territory, I can only say that the scale of the 
 destruction is quite overwhelming. The task of reconstruction is enormous. This was a very poor society, burdened by decades of oppression and exploitation, which was razed from one end to the other by the pro-Indonesian militia and their TNI backers. It was a systematic and highly organised campaign of vengeance and destruction.
In the history of decolonisation this century, it is difficult to find a comparable case where a new nation was forced to start so near absolute zero. We do not know how many people died. Around 140,000 East Timorese are still in squalid  refugee camps in West Timor with militia intimidation still rife and the risks of disease, including cholera, growing by the day. In East Timor, where the wet season has begun, more than 70 per cent of the homes need to be rebuilt. All their roofs have been destroyed along with everyone's possessions. Schools, shops, public services and health centres all need to be rebuilt or repaired. Roads and other basic infrastructure are in an appalling state of disrepair.
On top of all this, key institutions of an independent nation need to be established—a public service, political and judicial institutions and effective health and education services. Usually a new state would at least inherit working institutions of some sort from the former colonial regime, but this is not the case in East Timor. I do not think anyone can underestimate the challenges ahead for UNTAET and for East Timor's leaders. They will need all the help they can get.
All this amounts to an enormous task, and the demand on our aid budget will be an enduring one. No-one can have any doubt about that. The international community, the EU, the United States, Japan and many other countries have responded generously. But a large measure of responsibility will undoubtedly rest with us. We must be in this for the long haul.
Here can be found an anomaly. As honourable members will recall, on 23 November the Prime Minister announced the Defence-East Timor levy, the so-called `Timor tax'. When he did so, he foreshadowed an estimated $3.683 billion of additional expenditure over the period of 1999-2000 to 2002-2003. The 
 overwhelming majority of this expenditure—$3.562 billion or 96.7 per cent of the total—relates to the Australian Defence Force: $1.355 million for the ADF deployment in East Timor; $529 million on capital equipment; $1.547 billion for force expansion—the raising of two additional battalion groups; and $131 million for the income tax exemption for pay and allowances of ADF personnel on eligible duty outside Australia. All these commitments extend over the current financial year and out to the financial year 2002-2003.
By comparison, the $60 million of humanitarian and reconstruction aid for East Timor in the current financial year amounts to a very modest 1.62 per cent of the additional expenditure outlined in the Prime Minister's statement. Indeed, the commitment announced by the Prime Minister put our overall foreign aid effort into an interesting perspective.
The point I wish to draw members' attention to today is the absence of any forward commitment on aid for East Timor. Unlike the commitments to the ADF deployment and force expansion, this is a one-off one-year-only additional allocation. Obviously, the government considers itself unable to make a forward commitment on aid to East Timor, but the reality of a very large and ongoing demand on our aid program is quite clear. This raises interesting questions for next year's aid budget. Examination of the statistical annex of this year's development assistance budget summary tells a sorry tale of the government's stewardship of our foreign aid.
In the last budget of the former Labor government, in 1995-96, Australia's official development assistance in constant 1998-99 prices was $1.635 billion or 0.32 per cent of GNP. In the first Howard budget, this was slashed by 9.4 per cent to $1.481 billion, and the ratio fell to what was then a historic low of 0.28 per cent of GNP. In the following year there was a further cut of 1.9 per cent, and the ratio fell again to 0.27 per cent of GNP. In 1998-99 the aid budget amounted to $1.478 billion, a slight increase of 1.7 per cent but a further fall in the ODA to GNP ratio of 0.26 per cent. This year's budget involved an aid vote of $1.5 billion, an increase of $22 million over 1998-99. In 
 effect, while it maintained the status quo, the ODA to GNP ratio was projected to fall to a new low of 0.25 per cent.
Since the budget, of course, Australia's East Timor commitments plus the additional $35 million over three years referred to by the minister—for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative—have pushed our foreign aid to slightly more than $1.6 billion. The minister anticipates that this year our ODA to GNP ratio will increase from the previously projected 0.25 per cent to 0.28 per cent.
The question is: what happens next year? Australia will unquestionably be obliged to contribute a very significant amount of assistance to East Timor. We must do that. But, as the minister's statement rightly makes clear, Australia's aid program is much more than East Timor. We have a very large and important commitment in PNG, in the South Pacific and in East Asia. We also have smaller but still important programs in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We are likely to face other significant demands on our resources, not only in our immediate region but also further afield. The challenge for the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be how the aid budget will accommodate new, large and ongoing demands, and they will arise. I would say there will certainly be a strong temptation on the part of the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Administration to accommodate part of these demands through cuts elsewhere in our aid budget: the programs in Africa or South Asia, the two regions where the greatest number of the world's poorest people are to be found. The foreign minister has given no forward commitment on aid to East Timor. Equally significantly, he has given no guarantee that further aid to East Timor or elsewhere in our region will not be at the expense of other established programs further afield.
In his statement, the minister observed that volume is not the only, or necessarily the most important, measure of foreign aid. The quality and the impact of development assistance are what count. No-one would disagree with this. But it is equally true that the level of resources—the actual volume of aid—is critical. It is ridiculous to suggest otherwise. The government continues to pay lip-service 
 to the United Nations 0.7 per cent ODA to GNP ratio target. And lip-service is all that is. As the 1996 Simons report made clear, such a commitment has very little, if any, credibility unless a realistic framework is set for Australia to work towards the ultimate goal. Accordingly, we in the opposition await next year's aid budget with keen interest.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—We have seen one group today the beneficiaries of the government in damage control, because the government failed on their promise that people would not be worse off under the GST. I refer, of course, to the charities. Little less than half an hour ago, the Treasurer announced, together with the Democrats, the deal that they claim fixes the problem. They did not announce it in the parliament and they made it after question time because they did not want to face scrutiny in this place because the deal does not solve the problem. The deal does not address the key issues. It is a backflip, but it does not solve the problems. The fact is that charities are still caught in the GST net, whether they are coming or going. They are not GST free, and this agreement still keeps them in the net. The Democrats 
 have ensured that the charities remain trapped in that net—and it has now become a huge driftnet, dragging in everyone else on the way.
No matter how many entities are established and no matter how much you might like, from time to time, to raise the threshold, these facts still remain. If the charity is below the $100,000 level, it still has to pay GST on its inputs. The GST becomes an embedded tax for charities, and it keeps those charities below the threshold in the GST net. Charities of over $100,000 have to pay the GST, and they have to collect it. That is why we say that these charities are caught whether they are coming or going.
The Democrats have also indicated with the government that they propose to hold further discussions on whether there is need for an inquiry into the impact of the government's tax package on charities. If the Democrats are serious about that, they should join Labor in insisting on that inquiry. We have been saying since October of this year that an independent inquiry is needed to see how the government's tax package impacts upon charities. If the Democrats were serious about it, they would join with us. It is a sham to suggest that they are merely going to hold further discussions with the government on that question.
As for Senator Woodley's claim, as I understand it he said in the press conference today that this agreement was now better than the old arrangements applying to charities because the so-called exemptions apply to a bigger range of goods. That is just patently false for this simple reason: item 140 of the sales tax exemption act exempts charities from all items that they have purchased where they produce a certificate. You cannot have a more comprehensive exemption than that. They are the existing arrangements. I think even the Treasurer might understand that now, having been hit in the face with the pie warmer excuse. The fact is that the charities can get exemptions on all products they purchase for their activities. So Senator Woodley's assertion that his deal today with the government applies to a wider range of issues and products is patently false. Under 
 the GST, they are input taxed or they incur the GST. Either way they are caught coming and going. They are not better off. Although this agreement is a backflip, it is still a sell-out. It does not address the fundamental question.
Let me go to the other issues of groups that have been hit by the GST. Ordinary, battling Australians have been deceived on the GST. They were promised that they would be better off—a deceit exposed by the day. Where will the deceivers be on 1 July when the new tax comes in? John Howard and Meg Lees will be fleeing the country. These two are like Ma and Pa Kettle visiting London. They leave behind the nightmare that they have created. It might sound familiar in the case of the Prime Minister because, when Newcastle had the plug pulled on it by BHP and the Prime Minister was being called upon to go to Newcastle and to deal with the problem, where was he? He was off to Lords.
The minister at the table, Minister Hockey, might be a bit wary because we know where he was on his recent trip on the two weekends in question. This is a patent achievement by the government. Whenever there is an issue to deal with or a crisis, where does the Prime Minister go? He goes AWOL. He goes out of this country. He went to Lords during the Newcastle closure, and now he is trying to construct another cricket match at Lords to get himself over there to avoid the impact and the fallout from the GST.
It is also a tax that the Prime Minister does not understand. This is a man obsessed for 20 years with the introduction of the GST, and he still cannot explain how it works. There is a simple proposition involved in this. If he cannot understand it, how can he expect ordinary Australians to understand it? If he does not know how it applies, how can he expect the millions of small businesses in this country to apply it?
This week we have seen the deceit on charities. We have seen a government unable to explain it. We have seen that they do not understand the new system. We have seen the Treasurer demonstrating with the pie warmer in the face exercise that he does not even understand the system he is replacing it with. 
 We have seen over the last 12 months a growing realisation among Australians that they have been conned over the GST. To win the last election, the government had to produce con after con to hide the real impact of this unfair tax.
Let us go through the promises. This government has said, `Everyone will be better off; there will be no losers. Education will be GST free. Health will be GST free. Charities will not be hit by the GST. No petrol price will increase as a result of the GST. There won't be any special breaks for high rollers. The budget will be more secure. Car prices will fall by more than eight per cent. Insurance costs won't go up by much. Air fares won't go up by much. Books won't go up by much. Prices won't rise more than 1.9 per cent.' Perhaps the biggest lie of all, the biggest deceit of all, is the `simple' new tax—so simple that we will not need to make any more changes for another 50 years, according to the member for Higgins.
Let me just deal with that last issue first. This new tax is so simple that we have already seen more than 1,000 amendments introduced to it within four months of the dirty deal being struck and seven months ahead of its implementation. The member for Higgins has become the Millennium Man. He has beaten the new millennium by introducing 1,000 amendments to his new, simple tax that he said would not have to be touched for 50 years. Within four months, he has touched it 1,000 times, the same way he is going to be touching every purchaser in this country. Every time they go and buy something, his hand will be in their pocket taking out the 10 per cent.
The legislation and associated material is thicker than three telephone books. It weighs in at 5.1 kilograms. Companies registering for this new, simple system have been told that they have to fill out a form of only two pages, but to explain that and the other forms there are 850 pages of instructions—this for the 1.8 million tax collectors that this government is producing. In a stunt about small business paperwork the other day, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business told us that we 
 could have the material he was waving around. Do you remember that, Mr Deputy Speaker? It is strange, because we have made two calls to his office and have failed to get one single sheet from the minister who was in here saying that we could have whatever we wanted when we came around.
Let us go to the promises in detail. Remember the fact that nobody would be worse off? Remember the pensioners, the people who Labor proved through the Senate inquiry had been conned by a system that was designed to erode their compensation to nothing after just a few years? When we demonstrated that, the government changed their rhetoric. They moved from `No-one will be worse off' to `No group will be worse off'. But look at the groups that have been affected by the Timor tax, the Meg Lees tax, the tax that has had to be imposed to pay for our troops because the dirty deal struck with the Democrats cost the budget $1.8 billion. That is what it did, and they say that they need this tax to raise $1.3 billion. If the dirty deal had not been struck, the Meg Lees tax would not be necessary. We have seen a broken promise in that tax. I said before that the Treasurer said that he would not have to change the tax rates for another 50 years. He has changed them within four months and seven months ahead of the implementation. The government said before the election that education would be GST free.
—What a joke!
—Ask any family, as the shadow minister for education knows, whether they think putting a tax on school uniforms, school shoes, transport costs, books, stationery, computer software, Internet charges and playing and attending sports as well as taxing private tuition fees, even music tuition fees—
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—Too right I am being hard about this, because you are being hard on the community. You have ripped them off. You have conned them. You went to the election deceiving them, and we are going to expose that deceit. Parents know education will be hard hit by the GST. The other claim was that health would be GST free. This is also patently false. We saw yesterday the member for Bruce in question time indicating how many 
 creams, ointments and other important treatments for health conditions will be subject to the new tax. It is another con, another deceit.
Then there was the argument that charities will not be hit by the GST. I have already demonstrated how, even with the agreement today, they are still going to be hit by the GST. Remember what they said about petrol? The Prime Minister has been avoiding assiduously this question all week because he knows he is caught. They said, `No petrol price will increase as a result of the GST.' The only way this can happen, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl—and I know you will be interested, because you represent a regional area where the price of petrol often tends to be much higher than the metropolitan—
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—Take note of this, because this is the formula that you will have to defend in another role. It will be achieved only if the government reduce the petrol excise by more than the around 7c a litre that they have allowed for in the forward estimates. If they reduce the excise by even more, they will blow a large hole in the budget. The Treasurer has tried to argue that there is no difference and that, if you take the excise down, the GST will come in to make up the balance. Whilst that is true, it is also true that the reduction in excise comes off the budget. But the GST, as we are constantly told in this House, all goes to the states. If the reduction in excise has to be higher to deliver this government's promise, it is going to further erode the fiscal position of this budget.
Petrol prices will rise for residents in remote and regional Australia, and the price differential between city and country prices will worsen because of the GST. You go and tell your people about the petrol hike that is going to come as a result of the GST. Then we saw the hypocrisy associated with the high rollers. This arose from the Olympic tickets fiasco that the Prime Minister generated when he said that he was going to charge high income earners the GST on Olympic tickets. We have to thank the Prime Minister for putting the GST back on the front page with that little exercise. It has not been off the 
 front pages or the second, third or fourth pages ever since.
Here was a man saying that high income earners should pay the GST on Olympic tickets, but will he put a GST on high rollers in casinos? No. He actually moves an amendment to exempt them. Where is the justice in a GST that falls 10 per cent on every wage and salary earner in this country but where the only real exemption you give is to high rollers in casinos? No wonder people say that when the Prime Minister gets up and talks about economic success they know they are missing out.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—Merry Christmas, Simon.
—Order!
—The member for Hotham. That is a little bit of Christmas cheer to someone who reminds me a lot of Bill Murray playing the character of Mr Scrooge. Do you know that film? You should be running a TV network. We come in here with a valedictory message about the spirit of Christmas and, lo and behold, the member for Hotham exits the chamber not prepared to share in the valedictories, not prepared to share in the goodwill of Christmas. He leaves the Australian people worse off this Christmas. Why? Because of the current taxation system.
Mr Melham interjecting—
—The member for Banks feigns outrage. I kind of like that outrage from the member for Banks—he has some endearing qualities—but I am a little concerned about that outrage. I will be spending Christmas in the electorate of the member for Banks. We will be around the Christmas tree and I wonder how much wholesale sales tax that tree will have on it. I will tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker: the amount of tax on a Christmas tree put up in a family home in the electorate of the member for Banks depends on whether or not it is a real tree. Of course there is no wholesale sales tax on a real tree, but if it is a plastic tree there will be 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on it. We are poor 
 people, so we will be going for the plastic tree. If you put a real tree into a pot, the pot will have 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on it.
We might choose to take a photo of the Christmas tree—although at this stage the Christmas tree does not have any lights on it—and there would be 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on those photos. If we wanted to then frame the photos, there would be 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on the photo frame. Some people in our family do not necessarily choose to eat a lot of sweets on Christmas Day, but for those in the family who do choose to get into some sweets there will be a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax on them. There might be a dinner table around and on that table you might be looking at a tablecloth and some napkins which will have 12 per cent wholesale sales tax on them, thanks to the Labor Party.
The table and chairs will also have a wholesale sales tax on them, thanks to the Labor Party. The television set might come on because we might all want to sing along with the Christmas carols in the joy and spirit of Christmas—we might be enjoying some of the rantings and ravings of the traditional Christmas carols—and that television set has a 32 per cent wholesale sales tax on it.
—How much?
—It is 32 per cent. It might get a bit emotional for everyone and we will be reaching for the tissues, and there will be 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on the tissues. In the spirit of giving, we all get some toys, particularly for the kids. It is important that kids get some sort of wrapped-up present on Christmas Day. But the Labor Party has a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on toys. At Christmas, we might even give a member of the family a new pet—perhaps a little puppy. That puppy needs to be trained and an ultrasonic dog trainer will have a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on it. So there is 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on puppies! Of course Christmas just isn't Christmas unless you have some lights up. If the light fittings are attached, there is a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax. If it is a light bulb, there is a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax. But to put the lights 
 up you need a ladder—because it is hard to reach up high—and that ladder will have a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on it.
What is Christmas without having a Christmas cake or a bit of the old pudding? We always go for a bit of pudding at Christmas, and some of us have more than others. The Christmas pudding is perhaps the key event of the day after the presents have been opened—and of course there is a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on the presents. Under the Labor Party, when it comes to candles there is a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. That is the part where the kids like to blow out the candles and say `Merry Christmas' and move on for an exciting new year. We might even get one of Alan Jones's Christmas carol tapes to run with the Christmas spirit. That tape would have about 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on it. It is a challenging Christmas under the Labor Party. Everyone wonders whether the Labor Party is going to be fair this Christmas. This is the Labor Party that pledges to take care of the battlers. Here I am saying that I am going to the electorate of the member for Banks for Christmas and some parts of that electorate are doing it a little tough.
Mr Anthony interjecting—
—I can assure you that it is not with the member for Banks that I am celebrating Christmas—however much I might find him an interesting guy at times. This Christmas is going to be the hardest Christmas—the last hardest Christmas under the wholesale sales tax of the Labor Party. Why is that the case? Because we came up with a new taxation system that is going to make it a lot cheaper for people to celebrate Christmas in the future. We are doing it for the families of Australia, the hard workers of Australia and for a range of other people. It is not me saying that; it is a journal of record. We do not always agree with the Fairfax Press. I think that is fair to say. We go through ups and downs with Fairfax Press, particularly with the Sydney Morning Herald . But you should look at the recent Sydney Morning Herald  editorial headline `GST—why everyone's a winner. The first independent look at Howard's new deal'. We have 
 seen some terrible editorials in the Sydney Morning Herald  over the years.
—The minister should not display the article indefinitely. He will get tired arms.
—This is something I could hang up for ages. The front-page article is headed `Sole-parent, single-income families reap the big tax breaks'. Isn't that good news? When it comes to the details, every Australian will benefit and particularly families. Remember this is the Labor Party that hits kids' toys with 22 per cent tax. Let us just get the details on the record: families with children, typical families, will gain $40 to $50 a week under our new taxation system. That is an extra $2.4 billion a year for over two million Australian families. That means an extra $140 a year for each dependent child and an extra $350 a year for single income families with a child under five. It also means simplified family assistance, extra child-care assistance and the removal of the assets test for family assistance.
For those people who are on pensions, pensions and allowances will go up four per cent on 1 July 2000. The maximum rent assistance rate will go up seven per cent on 1 July 2000. Pensions and allowances will be guaranteed to remain at least two per cent ahead of any rise in the cost of living as a result of the changes. For senior Australians, the pension rate is up four per cent on 1 July 2000 and the pensioner rebate—the low income aged pension rebate—will be up $250 a year for singles and $350 for couples. And particularly for rural and regional Australia—
—Tell me about it.
—And there is no better advocate for rural and regional Australia than the Minister for Community Services, the member for Richmond, who is at the table. He is always into my ear at question time about the interests of rural and regional Australia. What he says, what we are advised and what will happen is that the cost of diesel for heavy transport will be down about 23c a litre. The assets test for family assistance will be removed. There are lots of other goodies under the coalition government's Christmas tree because that coalition Christmas tree will 
 be taxed not at 22 per cent—like it was under the Labor Party—but at 10 per cent. So it is a tax rate down. Tax down under coalition; tax up under Labor—a pretty simple formula.
We have had the rantings and ravings of the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition during this debate. It has been a long year for him. He looked a little stressed and green around the gills, perhaps because we are getting to the end of a long year—a year when the Labor Party had so much of an opportunity to grab the interests of Australia ahead of their own sectoral electoral interests during the taxation debate. It is really regrettable that, on an issue that has been decided by the Australian people that Australia will have tax reform, the opposition—the federal parliamentary Labor Party—is the only political party in the world outside of Swaziland and Botswana that is supporting a wholesale sales tax regime.
—What happened in Canada when they introduced it?
—The member interjects `What happened in Canada?' I will tell you what happened in Canada. Canada is enjoying great economic growth. The government made the mistake in Canada of not abolishing indirect taxes and not passing income tax cuts to the people when they were put in place. Therefore, the Canadian people were worse off at the point of introduction because they had no abolition of indirect taxes and they had no personal income taxes as the GST came in.
The good news is that Australian people will get income tax cuts from 1 July next year—80 per cent of Australians will pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar. That is between 29c and 31c; that is not between Humpty Dumpty and Hey Hey It's Saturday repeats. That is 30 cents in the dollar that 80 per cent of Australians will get under the taxation system that we are putting in place. We have put in place the most generous personal income tax cuts and the most generous family support systems and mechanisms that have ever been undertaken by a Commonwealth government. Isn't that great? That is great.
It is great because we as a true coalition are giving individuals greater choice about how they spend the money they earn. Instead of the government taking more money out of their pockets in the form of tax and spending it at the discretion of the government, we are saying to individuals, `We will take less tax out of your pocket and we will give you more discretion about how you spend the money you earn.' That is a fundamental philosophical difference between this side of the House and that side of the House. That side of the House is a high tax, high interventionist, big government with big Canberra influence in the lives of every Australian.
Opposition members interjecting—
—If the opposition members disagree with what I say, put up your hands. One hand went up. He is the only person that disagrees with what I say. It is a lonely cast out there in the member for Hotham's Mr Scrooge play.
I am very disappointed that in this Christmas moment the opposition are not joining in the cheer and the celebration of a major change to what Australia is going to be as we enter the 21st century. We are entering a new millennium when Australia has had record economic growth and sustainable economic growth. The Labor Party had some economic growth during its years. I will give you credit for that. But what happened when it hit three per cent? You had Treasurer Keating saying, `Whoa, put on the brakes, raise up interest rates; let's drive the economy into recession.' That was because the Labor Party had failed to undertake the hard reform that meant the car could go faster, that meant the economy could go faster. They failed to take the economy to the mechanic, and therefore it could not travel as fast as we have done.
So we have undertaken industrial relations reform; we have undertaken taxation reform; we have fixed up the budget deficit; and we have got on with the sale of part of Telstra to reduce the debt so that we do not have to spend so much money on interest each year. The great news is that, as we approach Christmas at the end of not just the century, which has been a great century for Australia, but also a great millennium in the history of 
 mankind, Australia is more positive today and more enthusiastic about its future. We feel more vibrant about the future of Australia today than ever before in our history. And that is the way it should be at the turn of each century: positive about the future and enthusiastic about the future. It is a great opportunity for Australians.

"Sidebottom, Peter, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—Tasmanians are a practical people. Unlike the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, we are not too smart by half. Generally, we are a conservative mob, a people who question change rather than just accepting it because it is occurring. We require some proof before we accept miracles. We do not like the idea of selling off our family silver if we cannot see any return for it, and we do not take kindly to others trying to pinch it. If we do not believe that we will gain a benefit from something, if we believe that it will not improve what we have or that it will detract from what we have, we as a people will say no. Love it or hate it, that is the way of it where I come from.
But this is no different from many communities throughout Australia. My community is regional. If one looks at the political landscape lately, one can see that we are starting to be heard. We have some political clout, and it comes from a culture shift. Before you leave, Minister, it is called VVP—remember it!—volatile voting patterns. It means that regional communities are prepared to change their vote, and often. They are tired of being ignored, hoodwinked and patronised by government and big business.
In the last election, my electorate of Braddon, like all federal seats in Tasmania, voted against the GST and the further sale of Telstra. Very simply, they saw no benefit in either of these measures, nor did they see benefit in selling off parts of the Hydro-Electric Corporation in the last state election. They saw no benefit in these measures, and they voted overwhelmingly against them. Unfortunately, we now have a GST and the sale of more of Telstra. But, judging by the results so far of both, Tasmanian electors, and 
 particularly the electors of Braddon, have been right. If they were anxious about the GST one year ago, they are positively frantic now.
Contrary to what is said by the authors of the GST opposite, we on this side do not have to highlight the problems facing battlers when it comes to this new tax system. The confusion comes from the government side—it is all over the shop. Battling small business people in my electorate are attempting now to learn more about the GST. They go to seminars, but they do not often come back any more enlightened. In fact, some come back even more confused; there are more questions than answers.
A few seminars are not going to ease their concerns, but at least they can turn for help to the Taxation Office's information kit. There is some light reading there for the insomniacs amongst us—because they sure as hell will not have time to be sifting through this during their working hours. All the hype about the new taxation system being `more small business friendly' is just that—hype. It makes a small business operator a tax collector. It requires him or her to comply, and to pay for it. We are talking thousands of dollars to do this. And what is their reward? Christmas time, a gift voucher of $200 to offset the cost of the GST. It is a bare fraction of the estimated compliance cost of $3,500 which is facing each small business. In addition, we are talking about additional time to learn, to train staff and so on, all at a time when many regional small businesses are already doing it hard.
You do not have to take my word for it, though—I am just a politician. Minister, you can pick up a copy of the latest State of Our Regions report, you can browse through the Senate report of September 1999, Jobs for the Regions or you can read through Professor Peter Dixon's evidence to the Senate inquiry into the GST in relation to transport and communications, agriculture, forestry and fishing, food and drink, textile, clothing and footwear, and tourism to get ample evidence of this.
Every one of these industries is important in my electorate. They are at the heart of our 
 economic life, and Professor Dixon predicts job losses in them because of the tax system. But you do not have to believe just him. What about Chris Murphy, the Prime Minister's preferred tax modeller? Indeed, even he agrees. This is the man who, as my friend the member for Rankin pointed out, was falling over himself in his critique of Professor Dixon's report to the Senate GST committee to support the Prime Minister's absurd claim that, apart from the tax cheats, everyone is a winner from the tax package.
I am told that, in secret advice to Treasury before the tax package was released, he in fact reported job losses in 12 out of 18 industry sectors. In the evidence he provided to the Senate GST inquiry, he said that there would be job losses in Queensland, Tasmania and the ACT. No wonder this man is the Prime Minister's modeller of choice. On the other hand, he says that it is ridiculous for Professor Dixon to assert that there will be any losers. Then he contradicts himself by pointing to thousands of losers from the government's tax package. Indeed, his own model predicts over 1,000 job losses alone in my state of Tasmania.
Let us look at the impact of the GST on one of these industries: tourism. Tourism is a major job creator in my state. In actual fact, nationwide tourism contributes $16 billion in export earnings and over one million jobs, many of which are in decentralised areas like my own. I would draw attention to evidence given to the Senate Select Committee on the New Tax System by a tourism task force representative. I think it is very important and poignant that we remember these words. The representative made the following observations in relation to the possible employment effects of a GST on the tourism industry. He said:
Our chief findings are that the impact of the reduction in spending across the tourism sector as a result of this package will cost Australia 59,500 jobs of which 34,100 will fall in the domestic sector and 25,400 in the inbound sector. In comparison to the size of their work forces, the Northern Territory, Tasmania and Queensland will be most disadvantaged by job losses. Importantly, regional tourism will also be heavily impacted.
He went on to say:
I cannot understate to you the importance of the impact of job losses in rural and regional Australia. If you lose your tourism job in Sydney or in Melbourne, you have a good chance of picking up a job elsewhere in any number of other industries. If you are a waiter in a B&B in south western Tasmania or if you are a retrenched miner and you have put your redundancy payout into a barra boat in Cairns, you have all your nest egg in one basket.
More specifically, those in the north-west region of my electorate are already bracing themselves for the fallout from the new tax. In fact, some of their fears are being realised already in terms of tourism. Take, for example, a recent announcement that fares on Tasmania's tourism flagship, the Bass Strait passenger ferry, Spirit of Tasmania , are to go up by 7.2 per cent on 1 July next year.
The airlines, too, are putting up their fares by seven per cent. For Tasmania and my region that is significant because visitors to our beautiful state cannot just jump in their cars and go across the border for a holiday. To get there they have to travel by air and sea.
Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.
—When you consider that the vast majority of our tourism trade comes from interstate, the GST has the potential to cause enormous damage. But if it costs more—and there is no doubt that it will—some people just will not come. Last year Tassie attracted over half a million visitors. We want more, not fewer. Tourism generates jobs, and we need more of them not fewer. What brings the dilemma even closer to home for me is that the west north-west region attracts over a quarter of all visitors to Tasmania. At a time when our traditional industrial base is shrinking, we have a growing tourist industry. It offers new hope and it brings valuable tourist dollars into the local economy. Today even the Prime Minister noted that the Mersey-Lyell region in my electorate has one of the highest levels of unemployment in Australia. So why would you tax it? The tourism industry will be less competitive as a holiday destination because of this; less able to compete for the tourist dollar against other states and less well equipped to absorb the impact of the GST.
When we talk about the goods and services tax we generally relate it to goods, but people fail to realise that we will be taxed on services. The services include electricity and gas bills; telephone bills; postage; haircuts and hairdressing; buses, trains and taxis; RSL and sporting club memberships; home and contents insurance and car insurance; plumbing; and lawn mowing and gardening. We will pay a tax for these services. We are not used to paying taxes for our services, and the battlers of Australia will pay that price.
The words of Eddie Cantor's song `When I'm the President, when I'm the President, there'll be no holes in doughnuts', are about as wishful as this Prime Minister's electorate pledge that battling Australians will not be losers as a result of the GST package. There will always be holes in doughnuts, Prime Minister, and under this government's GST the battlers will have to battle harder and longer.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—It is particularly interesting to follow the member for Braddon who, by his own admission, said that he was not smart by half. He certainly illustrated that in the debate this afternoon. In fact, the presentations by the member for Hotham and the member for Braddon remind one of a David Copperfield night at Las Vegas. Their presentations were like the disappearing trick: none of the battlers in Australia will gain any benefits from the GST changes, it is all illusory, no benefits will accrue and no study on the benefits has been carried out.
It is important and interesting to note the comments of three independent observers about whether or not the battlers of Australia are better off under the GST proposals. The first comment is by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, who hardly holds a biased political position. On 11 November this year, he said:
Our Starting Point has always been that the imposition of the GST should not have an effect on wages because wage earners will gain more from the accompanying fall in income tax rates than they will lose from the introduction of the GST. The net effect of the tax changes will be to increase the disposable income of wage earners more than the 
 increase in their expenditure, as is evidenced by the fact that the package involves a cost to the Budget.
Those are the comments of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, who says from his independent position that the average wage earner in Australia will be better off: not maybe will be, possibly could be or won't be; he says they will be better off.
Neil Warren of the University of New South Wales, who is regarded as one of the leading tax experts in the country, said when he examined the net effect of the changes after inflation had been allowed for—and I quote the industry tax report—that his result was that `everybody will be better off'. Not some, but everybody—particularly the battlers in this country. The Labor Party, which had 13 years to try to fix the situation for the battlers of Australia, failed to do so. We had the highest levels of inflation that Australia has seen in its contemporary history, inflation rates of up to 19 per cent, and now we have the lowest inflation rates in 30 years. This is the context in which the average wage earner in Australia is operating. So, whether we look at it in terms of inflation rates, whether we look at it in terms of interest rates, which also are amongst the lowest we have seen in 30 years, or whether we look at it in terms of unemployment rates, which are as low as we have seen for at least ten years, there is no doubt the average salary earner in Australia is better off, particularly with the very low unemployment rates we have seen right across the country.
We should also look at what Access Economics said. There is no doubt that everyone says Access Economics is an independent economic group. What do they say about the battlers? They did an eight-page review and calculated the impact of the package—including income tax cuts, increased family assistance, social security payments and the extra cost of the GST—on 11 family types. The result of their study was that families with children, including and especially battlers on about $30,000 a year, benefit most from the federal government's proposed GST package. Their analysis shows that everybody comes out ahead, particularly sole parents, 
 with single income couples on $30,000 with children doing best.
It shows that families with children and two incomes of about $30,000 also do well, with a child under five gaining them $49.54 per week, or a 9.6 per cent rise in disposable income. Those with children aged between 5 and 13 years get $50.88 per week, or a 9.7 per cent increase. No matter which group you look at, sole parents who receive an income will get an increase estimated by Access Economics to be 11 per cent in disposable income and families with dependent children and a single income in the $30,000 to $35,000 bracket will also gain nearly 11 per cent.
Whichever way you cut it, and whichever truly independent expert you ask—and I hear lots of quoting of the Tourism Task Force, but Chris Brown, who is a lovely guy, is not an economist, and even within the tourism industry there was a lot of criticism of the comments made in terms of projected job losses—what can be seen very clearly from these objective reports, firstly by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, secondly by Neil Warren, the independent tax expert from the University of New South Wales, and thirdly by Access Economics, which is, by any standard, one of the most highly respected economic institutes in the country, is that everybody is going to be better off. Sole parents and those with several children are going to be significantly better off—some by more than 10 per cent per year—when you take into account the family bonuses and the income tax cuts, because 80 per cent of Australians will be paying no more than 30 per cent in overall income tax payments. That is a huge benefit to middle Australia and to the battlers right across the board. It is a great plus for Australia.
The families package which was announced is part of the GST proposals that will provide assistance worth more than $2.4 billion each year to about 2 million families, and that will be an enormous plus. The costs normally associated with the average family will mean that they are compensated in terms of significant tax cuts right across the board. Canada is used as an example but, while they had a 
 GST imposed, they did not have the tax cuts that we will see here in Australia.
What about the pensioners? The pensioners will receive a minimum four per cent increase in the size of their pensions. There will be an automatic two per cent and then a two per cent rise which relates to the amount that they will be above the CPI. Of course, if the CPI is found to be 2½ per cent, they will receive a 4½ per cent increase, and so they will be significantly better off than they are now. Even Access Economics will tell you that they are better off.
Independent retirees are often brought forward by the opposition as being worse off, but Access Economics clearly indicates that they will be better off. There is a payment of up to $2,000 to compensate independent retirees for the impact of the GST. For older Australians, there is a special retirees supplementary bonus. The aged persons savings bonus of up to $1,000 is most significant.
We will see the total removal of the wholesale sales tax and all the endemic taxes there. The tax of 22 per cent on our family car will come down to 10 per cent. That will mean that Australians will be paying less for their cars, and that must be a great plus. For the average working person in this country, there will be a significant lowering of costs. When you add the basics of the cost of a car being reduced and the significant tax cuts so that 80 per cent of Australians will be paying 30c in the dollar, that is a bonus for Australia. The tax on videos, televisions and so on will come down from 32 per cent to 10 per cent, and so there is a significant boost to Australians.
In conclusion, it is clear that the member for Hotham and the member for Braddon are simply ignoring what will happen under the GST. It will be a great boost for Australia in income tax reductions, family bonuses, the payment to pensioners and independent retirees, the great stimulus to the Australian economy, the lowering of the staple cost of such items as cars from a tax of 22 per cent to one of 10 per cent, and the removal of the iniquitous wholesale sales tax. Across the board, battlers, middle Australia and low income earners will be significantly better off. From this side of the House, we commend the 
 GST for its impact on Australia. (Time expired)

"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—by leave—I had the honour to lead the Australian Delegation to the 30th Session of the UNESCO General Conference, held in Paris in November. Australia is a founding member of UNESCO, the organisation responsible within the United Nations system for the promotion of education, science and culture.
We have been active in the organisation throughout its history and are presently the ninth largest contributor in accordance with a contribution scale set by the United Nations.
For these reasons and because of the important role that UNESCO can play in promoting basic education in developing countries, the government attaches much importance to this organisation.
Australia's election to the executive board
An important objective for Australia at the conference was our election to the UNESCO Executive Board as the nominated candidate of the Pacific subgroup of the Asia-Pacific region. We were successful, obtaining one of 
 the largest votes we have ever achieved. We have already begun our two-year term on the board, represented by Professor Ken Wiltshire of the University of Queensland who, as Chairman of the Australian National Commission for UNESCO, is widely known and respected within the organisation.
UNESCO reform
UNESCO has had a number of successes in recent years, including, for example, the World Science Conference held in Budapest in June-July and the Education Conference in Melbourne. However, it has also been subject to some well-founded criticism for poor management practices and a lack of focus in its program activity on core functions—those areas where UNESCO has the capacity uniquely to add value.
One of the government's major objectives during this year's conference, and during our current term on the executive board, will be to give strong support to improved management in the organisation.
It was therefore pleasing that, together with others, we were able to achieve a consensus on a zero nominal growth budget for the next biennium (2000-2001). This budget approach will require significant administrative and managerial efficiencies to ensure that budgeted program activities are carried out.
Australia's election to the Finance and Administration Group of Experts
Likewise our contribution to efforts to promote managerial reform will be facilitated by our recent appointment to a 12-member group of experts on administrative and financial management.
Election of a new Director-General
One of the most important events during the conference was the election of a new Director-General to replace Mr Federico Mayor who had served two six-year terms. While there was no guarantee, the expectation was that the new Director-General should come from the Asia-Pacific region as none of the previous incumbents, in the 50-year history of the Organisation, had come from this region.
Members will be aware that, in keeping with the importance we attach to the reform 
 of the organisation and consistent with our active engagement in it, Australia nominated Gareth Evans for this position. Despite a very credible campaign which attracted much interest, he was not successful.
The new Director-General, Mr Matsuura of Japan, has already outlined in some detail the strategy he proposes to follow in revitalising UNESCO and refurbishing its image. His thoughtful and determined approach has attracted widespread support amongst members.
Australia will give Mr Matsuura its full support in his endeavours and we look forward to working with him, including through our membership of the executive board.
Pacific Island involvement in UNESCO
Australia is a member of the Pacific subgroup of the Asia-Pacific region within UNESCO. During the conference we worked very closely with the Pacific Island Delegations and were deeply appreciative of the strong support that they gave to our executive board candidature.
The importance attached by Pacific Island countries to UNESCO and to its programs is reflected in the growth in membership—from six Pacific members in early 1989 to 16 members after Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia joined during this General Conference.
One of our priorities in the period ahead will be to develop further the excellent relations with these countries and to build on the support that we are able to offer them in UNESCO.
Australia's election to the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee 
During the General Conference there was a meeting of the states party to the World Heritage Convention followed by a meeting of the World Heritage Committee, of which Australia is a member. At the meeting we were successful in being elected to the Bureau of the Committee, as the vice-chair for the Asia-Pacific region.
This outcome gave us the opportunity to pursue our objective of hosting the committee meeting in the year 2000 in Cairns and 
 serving as chair of the committee. As Senator Hill announced over the weekend, Australia's invitation to host this meeting was accepted on 3 December at the 1999 session of the committee held in Marrakech, Morocco.It was clear during the extraordinary session of the committee, as it has been at other meetings, that the effort that Australia puts into protecting its natural and cultural heritage is widely regarded as being at the forefront of world practice.
The committee meeting in Cairns will also give us the opportunity to place a special emphasis not only on Australia's world heritage properties, but on the importance of extending the reach of the convention into the Pacific region.
As Senator Hill said on the weekend, `Cairns is a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef and Queensland's Wet Tropics, providing us with an excellent opportunity to showcase Australia's exemplary standards in World Heritage management.'
Youth
The UNESCO General Conference was also notable for the particular emphasis it gave to youth participation. UNESCO, through its Associated Schools Project, and in cooperation with the French Government, hosted the World Parliament of Children, marking the 10th anniversary of the entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Australia was represented at this important occasion by students Caitlin Goss from Queensland and Ryan Hall from Victoria. The parliament produced a youth manifesto which was formally presented to the General Conference. It will also be tabled at the millennium session of the UN General Assembly in New York.
The Associated Schools Project I have just mentioned forms a valuable global network of schools which places particular emphasis on education and exchanges in the fields of heritage, sports and drugs. I had a productive discussion with the secretariat official responsible for the project and I look forward to its wider implementation in Australia.
The General Conference also had a Youth Forum at which Australia played a particular 
 ly prominent role. Not only did Professor Wiltshire, as co-Chair of UNESCO's Youth Council, address the forum, Australia was elected to the Youth Forum's Drafting Committee, and the two Australian delegates, Mia Handshin and Cameron Forbes, played a leading role in the debate on UNESCO's youth strategies and its youth agenda into the 21st century. The Australian delegates worked in close cooperation with their colleagues from the Asia-Pacific region.
Bilateral Meetings
I took the opportunity at the Conference to meet bilaterally with a number of colleagues including Mr Claude Allegre, French minister for national education, research and technology. My discussions with Mr Allegre included the recent signing of an MOU by Mr Allegre and Dr Kemp on education collaboration and mutual recognition of qualifications, which provides a good platform for ongoing dialogue on education cooperation.
I also met with Mrs Margarethe Vestager, Danish minister of education and ecclesiastical affairs, with whom I discussed increasing the utilisation of information technology in teaching, reforms in adult education and improving the quality of education through enhanced teacher skills. I also met with Mr Kadel Asmal, minister of education of the Republic of South Africa.
These exchanges were useful and provided valuable opportunities to explain Australian education policies and to learn from the experience of others.
Conclusion
Let me conclude by paying tribute to the work done in supporting the involvement of the Australian government in UNESCO by the Australian National Commission. The commission has amongst its members some of the most eminent Australians in their field who contribute to the work of the commission in their own time and often at their own expense. The effectiveness of the Australian National Commission is widely recognised by other national commissions, many of which have sought to follow the Australian model.
Australia's participation in UNESCO enhances our national standing through 
 showcasing Australia's expertise in such areas of human endeavour as bioethics, oceanography, hydrology, indigenous culture and education. It brings direct benefits to Australia in terms of consultancies and trade in services that flow from the contacts that are made during the various meetings. But most importantly our active and effective participation can contribute to the needs of countries, particularly those less well off than Australia, through the improvement of basic education standards, the promotion of bioethics and the protection of heritage and human rights. I present the following paper:
30th Session of the UNESCO General Conference",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>UNESCO General Conference</title>,Ministerial Statements,34,1
"Brereton, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—by leave—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak briefly in response to the parliamentary secretary's statement concerning the 30th session of the UNESCO General Conference. As the member for Adelaide noted, Australia is a founding member of UNESCO going all the way back to 1946—a great year; the year of my birth. We have certainly been active in the organisation right throughout its history. We have given great service to it and made a major contribution to it. Names like Barry Jones and Gough Whitlam are synonymous with an exceptional Australian contribution to the organisation.
As the parliamentary secretary has reported, Australia's candidate for election as Director-General of Unesco, the former member for Holt, was unsuccessful. Gareth clearly ran a characteristically energetic campaign but I think we all know that we were overwhelmed by the enormous resources that the Japanese were prepared to put behind their candidature. The outcome was, I think, UNESCO's loss. For many of us, I think there are some lessons in our pursuit of other international candidacies from that experience.
I am pleased that Gareth is now moving to a new job as President of the International Crisis Group, a role which I am sure will provide plenty of opportunities for his very considerable talents. I was absent from the parliament on his last day here. I was in New York at the UN General Assembly but I was pleased to take this opportunity to wish him 
 well and all the very best in his new endeavours.
The member for Adelaide notes some progress in reform of UNESCO. There is no doubt that it has long been an organisation in great need of reform, in great need of revitalisation. We, on this side of the House, will follow the efforts of the new director-general very closely and with considerable interest. We will also follow the performance of government here in Australia as we serve on the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee. The aggressive, indeed, shameless, campaign to block listing of Kakadu on the world heritage endangered list was something that brought no credit on the Australian government whatsoever. In conclusion, one can only hope for an improvement in our government's environmental diplomacy.

"Lieberman, Lou, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I present the 11th report from the Publications Committee, sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber.
Report—by leave—adopted.
—I ask leave of the House to make a statement concerning the activities of the Publications Committee.
Leave granted.
—The Publications Committee presented a report on the future of the parliamentary papers series in December 1997. In accordance with the undertaking given in this report, the committee wishes to provide an update to the House on two of the recommendations and also to comment briefly on other matters in the committee's sphere of responsibilities.
As members would be aware, the parliamentary papers series is a mechanism to 
 access government information by researchers, students, the general public and parliamentarians. As an indexed and annually numbered series of the significant documents which are presented, it is considered a valuable tool. Traditionally, access to the series was only available in print format through state, parliamentary and university libraries. Recommendation 2 of my committee's report in 1997 stated:
Ministers should ensure that agencies for which they have responsibility fulfil the obligation to produce sufficient copies of documents for the parliamentary papers series. A report identifying those agencies which default should be tabled in each House every twelve months.
The committee noted the government, in accepting this recommendation, stated:
The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet wrote to all secretaries of departments and heads of agencies in March 1998 about their responsibility to provide copies of tabled reports for inclusion in the parliamentary papers series.
As in 1997, the committee continues to find that Commonwealth agencies need to be reminded of their obligation to provide sufficient copies for the parliamentary papers series. The committee is now in a position, however, to inform the House that there are no Commonwealth agencies in default of their obligations to provide copies of reports tabled in 1996, 1997 and 1998 for the parliamentary papers series. The committee intends to provide a further report to the House on this matter later next year. The committee also recommended in its 1997 report that:
. . . agencies producing parliamentary papers should publish the documents electronically as well as in print.
As I mentioned a moment ago, documents contained in the parliamentary papers series have traditionally only been available in hard copy. The committee has monitored developments with respect to the availability on the Internet of, in particular, annual reports of Commonwealth agencies and reports of parliamentary committees. The committee is pleased to advise the House that there has been a significant increase in parliamentary and government information available to the public through the Internet since the committee's report was presented in 1997.
The committee also notes the recent Australian National Audit Office report, entitled Electronic service delivery, including Internet use, by Commonwealth government agencies, which stated that 91 per cent of agencies surveyed in this ANAO report had an Internet site to facilitate access to information about those agencies and their services. In relation to parliamentary proceedings, the committee welcomes the recent tabling of a video by another committee, with which I am associated—the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs—illustrating the work of a parliamentary committee and elements of the report of that committee, entitled Unlocking the future, dealing with a review of Northern Territory land rights.
Also, we welcome the recent report called It's your House by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure. This report comments on strategies to increase access to and involvement by the public in House of Representatives committee activities, and in particular the use of audio and video links, appropriate promotion of committee activities in the media and to school students, more innovative development of Internet sites and the extension of televising of House proceedings to committee hearings, particularly through web casting.

I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House first to consider amendments Nos 1 to 7, 9, 10, 15 and 16 and, when those amendments have been disposed of, to consider amendments Nos 8, 11 to 14, 17 and 18. I move:
That amendments Nos 1 to 7, 9, 10, 15 and 16 be agreed to.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,41,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—The opposition's position in relation to the amendments coming back from the 
 Senate to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999  is as follows. There are four amendment categories coming back from the Senate: first, bribes paid to government officials in Australia will cease to qualify as tax deductible; second, environmental gifts to approved environmental bodies, either by way of absolute donation of land or through entering into an environmental covenant over the land, will obtain tax deductible status; third, donations of property worth more than $5,000 to political parties will qualify for only $100, not the $1,500 proposed by the government; and, fourth, tax deductibility will be denied for contributions to private funds where those private funds are engaged in providing moneys or other benefits to political parties.
I am always conscious that my colleagues are very enthusiastic to hear my contributions, but it has also been suggested to me that the sooner we get through this bill the sooner the Senate might be able to rise and, therefore, their enthusiasm might be tempered by that knowledge. I will therefore endeavour to keep my remarks brief. There are two things that are said to be inevitable in life: death and taxes. With the Howard government, there has come a further inevitability, and that is tax laws amendment bills. This one is  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999 , and they go up to  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 10) 1999 . Alongside that stream this year we have seen a new tax package, the GST bills, and then more recently the business tax package. So lots of taxation laws amendment bills.
I will consider each of the categories of amendments coming back from the Senate separately. First, bribes paid to government officials in Australia will cease to qualify as tax deductible. The bill introduced by the government proposes to deny tax deductibility to bribes paid by Australian firms to foreign government officials. There are some exceptions: where the moneys paid are only to speed up processing or where they are related to essential services, such as telephone, mail, water services, et cetera. Labor, and indeed the whole Senate, have no problem with that 
 proposal. It received unanimous support in both the House and the Senate.
Labor's amendments extend that principle which has unanimous support to also deny tax deductibility for bribes paid to Australian government officials. Surely, it is against the public interest for our tax laws to grant a tax deduction for the moneys associated with a serious crime, the crime of bribery. Accordingly, Labor's amendments seek to deny tax deductibility for bribes paid to Australian officials. That principle should not be at issue. It is a principled position taken by Labor and the Senate, and the government should simply accept these amendments.
The second category of amendments relates to environmental gifts to approved environmental bodies either by way of absolute donation of land or through entering into an environmental covenant over land. They will obtain tax deductible status. This group of amendments covers environmental gifts. The amendments extend the government's proposals for increased tax concessions for philanthropy to environmental philanthropy. The amendments propose to create a new type of philanthropy where land-holders donate land of conservation value to approved environmental bodies or, if they enter into environmental covenants over land that they continue to own, the land-holders will be able to claim as a tax deduction the economic loss that they incur as a result.
That seems to me to be a pretty fair proposition. It will be a significant incentive for land-holders, many of whom will be farmers, to conserve remnant ecosystems. At the moment, the situation is that the land-holders generally face an economic incentive to clear the land of its natural habitat. We are aware of great problems, for example, in Queensland but also in other states in relation to land clearing. At present, the economic incentive is there to clear the land and to put it into production either from crops or grazing. The proposal in the amendment which would provide the tax deductible status for these gifts has the support of the Senate, has the support of the entire environmental movement, has the support of the CSIRO and, we suspect, the support of Senator Hill as well.
He came to the Senate to oppose the amendments, but indicated that he actually agreed with the principles behind them. That shows that he supports the proposals, but I suspect that he cynically wants to announce them himself next year and claim them as his own. (Extension of time granted) This legislation is bringing in a new regime of taxation for philanthropy. This bill is therefore the appropriate place to deal with measures that relate to environmental philanthropy, and Labor will be opposing the government proposal to not agree with the Senate amendments.
The third area of amendment is donations of property worth more than $5,000 to political parties qualifying only for up to $100 rather than the $1,500 proposed by the government. An insidious part of the Prime Minister's proposals, which has nothing to do with philanthropy, is his proposal in this bill to have the taxpayer subsidise wealthy benefactors of the Liberal Party. This bill proposes that in the case of taxpayers who give a gift of property worth $5,000 or more to a political party the donor should get a tax deduction of $1,500. This is an outrageous policy which is rejected by Labor and, fortunately, by the Senate. This would have subsidised wealthy political donors and it is without any justification whatsoever in public policy terms. People are free to donate to political parties as they choose, but they should not get a substantial taxpayer subsidy if they happen to be wealthy enough to provide gifts of property worth more than $5,000.
Labor's amendments, which were supported by all the non-government parties in the Senate, simply treat these types of donations as other cash donations to political parties are treated—that is, to limit the tax deductibility to $100. This essentially nominal figure allows equal access to tax benefits for all people who may donate to political parties, both those of means and those of limited means—whereas the government's much higher proposal will simply subsidise the much better off. We reject the use of taxpayer's funds in this regard, just as we reject the use of taxpayer's funds to bankroll 
 shonky political front operations such as the Greenfields Foundation, to which the final amendment relates and to which I now turn.
The final set of amendments relates to denying tax deductibility for contributions to private funds where those funds are engaged in providing moneys or other benefits to political parties. This takes us into the somewhat shadowy area of Liberal Party fundraising. It is worth recounting some of the debate that occurred in the Senate to understand the origin of this amendment, which indeed has arisen expressly from the Senate's consideration of this bill and was not put forward prior to that. Senator Faulkner referred to the Greenfields Foundation in the Senate and to the fact that it has been described as a charitable trust by one of the trustees, Mr Bandle. In a leading Australian newspaper on 23 July 1998, Mr Bandle said:
We are set up as a charitable trust and we have written cheques of approximately $80,000 to charities so far.
Senator Faulkner went on to say:
I want to be absolutely assured that we do not have donations or gifts provided to the Greenfields Foundation, which is a charitable trust, whereby those donors receive a tax deductibility for those donations and whereby at some time those donations, which are not disclosed, go to the benefit of the Liberal Party.
He asked for an assurance from Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, that this would not happen and indicated that, if he were able to receive such an assurance, the matter would be closed. He made reference to the fact that the Greenfields Foundation had a history of endeavouring to get around the disclosure provisions in the electoral act and that it had loaned a very large amount of money to the Liberal Party under the most generous of commercial arrangements imaginable. It had also donated a very small amount of money to charities.
So it was not making direct donations, as one would understand the dictionary definition of `donations', but it was loaning massive amounts of money to the Liberal Party. In that way, it endeavoured to get around the disclosure provisions of the act. Senator Faulkner continued to assist the Assistant Treasurer by seeking from him an undertaking 
 that the Greenfields Foundation would not be operating in this way. The Assistant Treasurer, however, was not willing to take up any of these offers. The opposition came to the conclusion—indeed, it found it very difficult to come to any other conclusion—that the government's intention was to try to shonk its way through in relation to the Greenfields Foundation and to allow a vehicle for either private individuals or major corporations or companies to provide donations to a shonky organisation like the Greenfields Foundation.
The donors themselves received tax deductibility and of course there is no public transparency in this. (Extension of time granted) There is no disclosure of those donations and the donors get tax deductibility. That is not good enough, and no-one would defend the integrity of the electoral laws or the tax laws in such a situation. On that basis we had the fourth set of amendments to deny tax deductibility for contributions to private funds where those funds are engaged in providing moneys or other benefits to political parties. I have now indicated the opposition's position in relation to the four areas of amendment.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,41,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—The government is keen to have this legislation returned to the Senate before it rises for the evening. That is why I have not traversed the reasons that the government is prepared to agree to the Senate amendments. We obviously would have preferred that the Senate had not made these amendments, but we accept the reality of the numbers in the Senate. The government is therefore prepared to move that the Senate amendments be agreed to. Naturally, we do not accept the matters raised by the honourable member for Wills as having any veracity.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,41,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I move:
That amendments Nos 8, 11 to 14, 17 and 18 be disagreed to.
With respect to Senate amendments Nos 8, 11 to 13 and 17, these amendments propose significant additions to measures contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 
 1999  that will provide taxation incentives for personal and corporate philanthropy in Australia. Broadly, the amendments provide that, where a property owner covenants a property for conservation purposes and that results in a reduction in the value of the property, any reduction in the value of the property should be treated as a tax deduction.
The amendments also extend the ability to deduct amounts over five years to such donations; and also where property is donated a capital gains tax exemption should apply. Substantial changes like these need to be considered in depth in the context of their cost as well as their effectiveness. Any decisions need to be taken within the budgetary constraints of government but also with the objective of getting the most effective outcome in terms of conservation. Accordingly, we have moved that the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.
With respect to the other amendments, Senate amendments Nos 14 and 18, these amendments propose changes to the measure that will allow tax deductibility for donations to what will be known as `prescribed private funds'. Broadly, prescribed private funds will have to operate in the same way as ancillary public funds but will not have to seek and receive funds from the public. The purpose of the amendments is to preclude a fund that provides funds to political parties from being a prescribed private fund.
Item 6 of schedule 5 to the bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 such that a fund can only be a prescribed private fund if it is established solely for the purpose of providing money to a fund or institution that is listed under subdivision 30-B of that act. If a fund is established to provide funds to any non-listed institutions, it cannot be a prescribed private fund. Political parties are not listed in subdivision 30. The amendment therefore is unnecessary, and we therefore wish that the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,41,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—I want to talk only about what I will call, for the sake of simplicity, the `Greenfields' amendment, the one to which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance 
 and Administration was just referring. The most powerful arguments that the government can put either in the Senate or here against this amendment is the argument that they think it is unnecessary. I have to say that is not what you would call an overwhelmingly powerful argument. I think it is also untrue, which I will come to in a moment.
But what it does show is there is not an argument against it on the merits. They say the purpose of it is achieved but they say it in a way which leaves open several loopholes which cause us some concern. I am not in the slightest doubt the government knows what the loopholes are. So if they are doing that and they are not referring to it, and if the loophole is used in the way which I will refer to and the party which is the majority party of the government would be the principal beneficiary then you cannot blame us for being a bit dubious.
It is true that if a private fund of the sort referred to in this provision, like Greenfields, makes a donation then the consequences outlined by the parliamentary secretary apply. But it is by no means as clear to us, certainly not to me, that other sorts of benefits which such a trust might provide—say, the Greenfields Foundation to the Liberal Party—would have the same effect; for example, if they provided a loan. There is nothing that says explicitly to my satisfaction that if the Greenfields Foundation provided a loan to the Liberal Party they would be excluded. What is it that the Greenfields Foundation does? It provides loans to the Liberal Party. Surprise, surprise! Perhaps it is not covered. We kept pursuing the Assistant Treasurer in the Senate to try to get him to cover this point and, in his usual comprehensive manner, he failed to do so. I was trying to listen attentively to the parliamentary secretary and I did not hear him refer to it either. So there, for one, is a serious loophole.
The second problem is that if an organisation is scheduled as a private fund, there may subsequently be a disallowance, for example. One of the other protections that is claimed is that the listing of such a private fund is a  disallowable instrument. It is a while since I was in the Senate and we do not do much 
 disallowance business in the House, but my recollection is that the regulation applies until it is disallowed. You only need a body to be on the schedule for 24 hours to get all the money through it that you ever wanted to put through.
So the existing provisions are less than watertight, to put it politely. They leak like a sieve. So, for that reason, we are concerned that this provision can be abused. We do not want a provision that says that we can abuse it, either; we want the provision to apply equally to us and to every other political party in the country. There is no body that equates to the Greenfields Foundation in relation to the Labor Party. But some time in the future some other political party might have a similar body. We do not want it to be eligible either. We do not want any political parties to be able to use this backdoor mechanism.
I was very concerned that the Prime Minister, when I asked him about this in question time this afternoon, would not give a commitment to vote for an amendment that prevents abuse of this provision. I am concerned that the government is persisting with its opposition to this amendment. I am concerned about what it says about the integrity of our political system and the integrity of our tax system. We will persist in our strenuous pursuit of this amendment.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,41,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I just want to stress that the `Greenfields' amendment is unnecessary as the government would need to make a regulation to make the Greenfields organisation a prescribed private fund. And even if the government were disposed to do so, which it is not, the Senate could disallow such a regulation. So that is why we indicate that this particular amendment is unnecessary.
With respect to another matter raised by the member for Fraser, a fund can only operate in relation to its principal purposes. If it is making loans to political parties, it is not carrying on for its principal purposes. Therefore, it could not be a registered private fund.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—Unfortunately, I address this place once again concerned over the regressive actions of the Howard government. I refer in this instance to the proposed removal of the office of the Australian Taxation Office at Cannington in my electorate of Swan and the transfer or loss of over 600 staff. It is necessary to briefly look at history to understand the folly and to appreciate the reasons why the office was established in Cannington and why it is crucial to the local area.
In 1991 the Cannington office was established for certain reasons. It brought the Taxation Office out of its centralised location to the people. The office was designed to serve the 350,000 people in the southern area. The siting of the office was based on good commercial practice due to its being a modern facility which included excellent community access from public transport routes and large areas for parking which would provide a good working environment for staff. The decentralised office would help alleviate the overcrowding in Perth traffic and alleviate parking in the CBD. These factors took into consider 
 ation the operational requirements of the ATO, the need for modern accessible communities and also community access.
However, the government has decided to relocate the facility back to the Northbridge city office. In doing so a number of questions need to be asked. These questions are important to the 600 plus staff who would be affected by the move and the thousands of taxpayers who use the facility annually who would be concerned over any relocation to a centre 15 kilometres away.
In discussions with the stakeholders in the process, including the staff, the union, the local business community and users of the Cannington facility, I have established a number of questions that need to be put to the Treasurer. Amongst these are: will there be any job losses in the associated support industries such as security, cleaning and ground staff? What has been resolved over the accommodation issues? Contrary to the comments of management, queries exist over the lease arrangements and extensions to the central office which have not been specified, and also the lack of available space for staff. All these issues remain unresolved. It is important that the Treasurer also answer questions pertaining to the negative externalities from the move. These include the increases in traffic congestion and the extra time taken in journeys for the public and staff.
There is another issue that also warrants consideration. It goes to the heart of the sort of environment that this government seems to encourage—that is, the shabby and non-transparent manner in which the decision was made. It is quite obvious from the correspondence I have seen that the strategy to relocate was taken well in advance of any consultation with staff or any real discussions with members of the local community. In effect, as usual, absolutely no real dialogue occurred.
Of course the usual lip-service occurred with no meaning, and I can understand the staff having developed a thick hide due to the decline in morale in the service. I can also attest that I have noted much of the correspondence from the ATO management to the staff. I can indicate to members of this House 
 that I was taken back by the glaringly `past tense' syntax of that correspondence that either was poorly covered up or they simply could not be bothered to disguise. I put it to the Treasurer and members of this House that these decisions had already been made and that the involvement of members of the community, staff or users of the ATO would not have really mattered.
I am also compelled to ask the question: what rate of commercial rent is paid at the Cannington office, a suburban complex, as against the Northbridge inner city office? I would also like to see highlighted any calculations on the negative impacts of the centralising of taxation services. If 600 regular staff and thousands of customers are removed from the local area, what is the flow-on effect of the loss of that expenditure on the region? Discussions with interested parties indicate that the impact will be as high as $20,000 per week. That figure is not inclusive of the loss of office rent and associated services. This is particularly relevant given that the area has an unemployment rate of 1.5 per cent above the state average with an annual income for the majority of the population of less than $30,000. I believe that the actual costs in transferring the operations coupled with the hidden extras will be so high that the true costs will never see the light of day. The ATO has an obligation to release this information to stakeholders.
In conclusion, I call on the ATO to reconsider the centralisation of the organisation. By continuing to embrace a decentralised office at Cannington, the ATO would continue to make ATO staff available directly to the public, continue to develop an important service that benefits the local community, alleviate congestion, and allow staff and local taxpayers efficient and effective service in their area. I call on the Treasurer and the management of the tax office in Western Australia to abandon this proposal and keep the service where it is needed—here in Cannington.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Swan Electorate: Australian Taxation Office, Cannington</title>",Adjournment,45,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
The amendments being considered tonight demonstrate the government's commitment to consultation and concern that the new tax system be fair to all Australians. The first amendment provides benefits to the charitable sector and was the subject of representations from the Australian Democrats. It would be appropriate at this time to recognise the constructive role played by the Australian Democrats in the implementation of Australia's new tax system.
The first amendment extends the 50 per cent cost of supply test to non-commercial supplies by charities to 75 per cent. The 
 second amendment again provides benefits to the non-profit sector by lifting the threshold under which branch units of charities can opt out of the GST system. This amendment responds directly to a request from the charitable and not-for-profit sector to significantly reduce compliance needs. The third amendment relates to the funeral agreements and responds to requests from the funeral industry for clarity with respect to the transitional provisions as they apply to the funeral industry.
It is interesting to note that the Australian Funeral Directors Association and the Australian Cemeteries and Crematoria Association have commended the government's approach in making these amendments. In fact, the Assistant Treasurer has received a letter dated 2 December from the Australian Funeral Directors Association stating:
On behalf of all members of the Australian Funeral Directors Association and the Australian Cemeteries and Crematoria Association, please accept our thanks for your recent undertakings to amend legislation relating to the transitional provisions for GST and the funeral industry.
The outcomes as described in your correspondence of 30th November, 1999, were very pleasing and, may I say, very sensible. The amendments have certainly provided clarity and relative ease in the application of GST, particularly for prepaid funerals.
That is an absolutely wonderful recommendation and letter of support from the funerals association. I commend the bills and these amendments to the chamber.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (INDIRECT TAX AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—As I said earlier this evening, a couple of certainties in life have always been said to be death and taxes. Under the Howard government, a further certainty is amendments to taxation laws. We had Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 10) 1999  on the Notice Paper . Here before us we have the second amendment bill to the government's GST legislation. Indeed, that amendment bill to the GST legislation has now been amended on around 1,000 occasions. We are seeing, in the dying minutes or perhaps hours of this parliament this year, the government come in with further amendments dealing with issues associated with prepaid funerals and charities.
The fact is that embracing the GST is like cuddling a porcupine. At every point the government uncovers problems. In this case it is problems raised by the charities. We will not oppose this legislation, but it does not solve the problems. We welcome the fact that the government has been able to make some changes, but they do not solve the problems. Charities are still caught in the GST net. They are not GST free. This agreement keeps them in that net. As the shadow Treasurer said this afternoon, charities remain trapped in what has become a huge driftnet. The situation is that if a charity is below the $100,000 level it still has to pay GST on its inputs. The GST becomes an embedded tax for charities. It keeps those charities that are below the threshold in the GST net, so they are caught coming and going. The other thing that came out of this afternoon's new and revised deal between the government and the Democrats is the idea of an inquiry.
—A sleazy deal.
—A sleazy deal indeed. I point out to the House that on 19 October Labor called for an independent tax review for charities. So, if the Democrats are serious about the inquiry that they suggested this afternoon, they should do it. We will support them. We indicated that back on 19 October. We stand ready to have an inquiry into the impact of the GST on the charitable and non-profit sectors. If the Democrats are fair dinkum about their inquiry, they will join Labor in ensuring that such an inquiry takes place.
I have been reminded of the hour by one of my colleagues—probably acting on behalf of many colleagues; it is a sad reflection that I am able to be done over by one—and, in light of that, I will conclude my remarks here. But it is clear that this will not solve the problems. They will continue to haunt this government as the charitable and not-for-profit sector recognises in the months and years ahead just how the GST will impact on them.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (INDIRECT TAX AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—These amendments are like rotten fruit: they are shiny on the outside and rotten on the inside. Nothing announced today in the coalition-Democrat deal on charities changes the fact that all charities are to become tax collectors for the Howard government. Their fundraising activities will still be hit by the GST. They are caught coming and going. It does not matter whether they are under $100,000 or over $100,000, they will all become tax collectors for the Howard government. They are the front-line tax collectors for the Howard government. The Howard government is taxing compassion and it is taxing the volunteers. These amendments will not ease the burden on the charitable sector of Australia.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—On 30 November, the Howard government released the Downstream Petroleum Products Action Agenda. It was prepared by the minister's department and the oil industry. It has only one objective: to make the case for mergers in the oil refinery industry, which will be supported by the government on a case-by-case basis. It follows two decisions this year by the ACCC not to approve joint ventures between the oil majors because they would lead to less competition and had not been justified as being in the public interest.
The refining industry does face a number of serious short-term and long-term problems but these should have been addressed through a full public inquiry. The government did not obtain an independent report for this policy review, in their case such as from the Productivity Commission. Instead, they managed the process to produce the outcome the oil industry wanted. The result is a report setting out the problems the industry faces and suggesting that the solutions have more to do with mergers than investment.
The industry's objectives and the ACCC public interest test are in direct conflict. The ACCC's public benefit test guidelines say:
Economic development, eg in natural resources, through encouragement of exploration, research and capital investment—
whereas the oil industry's eight-point plan for getting benefit from joint ventures says the opposite:
Improved `capital efficiency' by reducing future investment requirements, eg, for clean fuels, through the ability to make the best use of each refinery's capabilities and existing hardware—
An option canvassed in the report to `invest for 500ppm sulphur diesel now, if the investment will pay prior to the mandated requirement for 50ppm sulphur diesel, and close the refinery prior to 31/12/2005' when the higher standard becomes effective shows the risk Australia faces from this flawed policy process.
The oil majors must be made to accept that there has to be significant investment, not just in clean fuels but also with the objective of having an internationally competitive refining industry in Australia. Long-term policies should not be driven by short-term price pressures resulting from availability of cheap imported fuel because of the Asian crisis. If the oil majors are permitted to replace local refining capacity with imported product, there will be less competition and they will be able to raise prices on both imported and local fuels. It is not just the loss of local jobs and investment. Ultimately, it will be the motorist and Australian business that will pay.	I am concerned the report dismisses restricting merger proposals to exclude `outlier' refineries like Port Stanvac, because that would reduce the benefits obtained by the companies.
South Australia needs a full range of refinery facilities. These facilities are at risk. The technical and commercial issues to keep them open should be dealt with now, not after a merger proposal is approved. Port Stanvac's work force is doing everything it can to make the refinery internationally competitive. They deserve much more than the government's active 
 participation in the loss of their livelihoods. Australia needs an internationally competitive refining industry that will invest in this country's future. The ACCC must withstand government pressure to interpret the public interest test in the light of this report.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Downstream Petroleum Products Action Agenda </title>,Statements by Members,49,1

That the bill be now read a second time. 

This bill provides for the extension of the current statutory self-regulation framework of the migration advice industry until March 2003 and includes several measures to enhance its effectiveness.
In 1997 the government decided to move the migration advice industry to self-regulation through a period of statutory self-regulation.
The government agreed to consider a further move to voluntary self-regulation at the end of two years.
Statutory self-regulation is subject to a sunset clause and ceases to operate on 21 March 2000. The government was therefore committed to reviewing the effectiveness of the operation of statutory self-regulation before that date.
The government has now reviewed the operation of the current arrangements to decide on the most appropriate regulatory model for the migration advice industry beyond March 2000.
The government has found that the industry is not yet ready to move to voluntary self-regulation in view of continuing significant consumer protection concerns, national interest issues and the special nature of the migration advice industry.
In particular, the government has significant concerns about the vulnerability of the client group to exploitation and the ethics and conduct of a small group in the industry.
Given the vulnerability of clients and the potential for malpractice in the industry, it is clear that voluntary regulation of the industry would not be desirable or viable at this stage and that statutory self-regulation should continue.
The review confirmed the appropriateness of the government's decision to introduce the existing statutory self-regulation framework.
The review found that the MIA—that is, the Migration Institute of Australia—acting as the Migration Agents Registration Authority (the MARA) has demonstrated its commitment to the objectives of consumer protection and its capacity to undertake industry regulation.
The MIA, acting as the MARA, has already established sound disciplinary and mediation processes that should continue to increase consumer protection, competence and ethical standards in the industry.
The review of statutory self-regulation was undertaken by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and steered by an independent reference group.
A number of members of the reference group had assisted the government in the 1997 review of the industry.
As in 1997, the most recent reference group was chaired by Mr Ian Spicer, former President of the Confederation of Australian Industry.
The reference group included individuals with a broad understanding of the industry.
In particular:
	 one member was nominated by the MIA;
	 another member had considerable knowledge of community concerns; and
	 a further member was formerly a Minister for Immigration—that is, the Hon John Hodges.
The review gave careful consideration to the performance of the existing arrangements and sought input from over 40 stakeholders.
Particular consideration was given to the views expressed by the industry body.
In its role as the MARA, the MIA has indicated its strong support for the measures included in this bill.
In extending statutory self-regulation, the government has recognised the achievements of the MARA in establishing the self-regulation framework.
All stakeholders have expressed support for the continuation of the existing statutory self-regulation framework at this stage of industry development.
In deciding that it is not yet time to move to voluntary self-regulation, the government has taken account of the fact that the industry is at an early stage of maturity and there is only limited experience with the current arrangements.
Statutory self-regulation has been in place for fewer than 18 months. Some major elements, such as the continuing professional development requirements, have been in place for fewer than 6 months.
While the MIA's coverage of the industry has expanded substantially since statutory self-regulation was introduced and has continued to increase over the last few months, there are still only 30 per cent of registered agents who are members of the MIA.
This would not be sufficient to support a move to voluntary self-regulation when current arrangements expire in March 2000.
There will be another review of the industry in two to three years to re-examine the state of the industry and gauge its progress.
I would expect that at that time it will be possible to assess how far the industry can develop and how well it can sustain voluntary self regulation.
The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs will be setting milestones in conjunction with the MARA to monitor the development of the industry in relation to:
.	 improvements in competence and ethical standards;
.	 the extent of MIA industry coverage and its performance in the industry regulation role; and
.	 changes to consumer awareness that would support a less regulated environment.
The extension of statutory self-regulation until March 2003 will provide an opportunity for some of the important industry values being promoted by the MIA and the MARA to be more firmly entrenched in industry practice.
Many industry stakeholders have confirmed, to the review, the need for continued improvements in the ethical standards and competence in the industry and protection available to consumers.
This bill includes two new measures to this end. Other measures will be addressed through amendments which require more complex drafting, which I expect to introduce next year, and through regulation amendments.
The bill includes amendments to make publication requirements relating to decisions by the MARA to cancel or suspend an agent's registration more cost-effective.
Currently the MARA is required to publish full details of any decisions to cancel or suspend an agent's registration in the Saturday edition of a national daily publication, including the evidence for its decisions and its findings on any material details of fact.
Although the intentions behind this requirement are to protect existing and potential clients and to promote agent and community understanding of appropriate ethical standards in the industry, in practice, the requirement has resulted in costly advertisements swamped by excessive detail, with little visual impact and little communicative value.
The amendments in this bill maintain the basic requirements that the MARA should publish its decisions to suspend or cancel an agent's registration and the grounds for its decisions in prescribed publications.
However, the MARA will no longer be required to publish full details of the evidence and its findings on material facts relevant to the decision, saving money for the industry body and thus ultimately agents and consumers.
The amendments will also give the MARA the discretionary power to publish some or all of this detailed information about cancellation or suspension decisions in an expanded variety of formats and methods of publication relevant to its target audiences, including on the Internet and in specialist newspapers.
The amendments will also give protection to other persons publishing in good faith a copy or fair summary of the MARA's decisions.
Together, these amendments will mean that the MARA will be able to use appropriate channels to communicate more effectively—to clients, agents and the general community—its decisions to suspend or cancel an agent's registration.
This bill also provides the MARA with powers to ensure that clients of inactive and deceased agents are not unduly disadvantaged by the agent becoming inactive or as a result of the death of the agent.
Therefore, the MARA will be able to require certain agents—for example, those whose registration has been suspended or cancelled—to provide copies of relevant client documents to the MARA for forwarding to clients.
This will enable clients to continue their cases with another agent or to manage their cases themselves, ensuring that critical deadlines in relation to a client's visa applications or reviews of applications are not ignored.
The MARA's ability to do this will be discretionary. There may be cases such as multi-agent practices in which the MARA does not need to intervene.
However, the relevance of this power was highlighted by the recent closure of the largest migration advice firm in Australia.
Fortunately, this company voluntarily made files available to the MARA.
However, if such a situation occurs after the commencement of the bill, and if the firm or agent does not make files available to the MARA voluntarily, the powers in this bill will provide a basis for the MARA to require that relevant documents be copied, and that those copies be given to clients.
The closure of this particular migration agency is being closely evaluated by my Department and the MARA to identify any further issues which may need to be addressed within the industry regulation arrangements.
In conclusion, this bill extends the protection that is available to consumers under the current arrangements and will continue the progress that has been achieved in the last 18 months towards enhancing competence and ethical standards in the industry.
I commend this bill to the Main Committee. I present the explanatory memorandum.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1
"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—It is Christmas time, so I will not speak for long and I will be very nice to the minister this morning. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1999  is another bill—amongst just about every one that has come up for debate in either this or any other chamber—that we have supported. We support the sunset clause being extended until March 2003. I have had the opportunity on a number of occasions to talk to the industry association, and I am quite convinced that they are doing everything they can to ensure that the migration advice industry is cleaned up as best it can be.
I am aware that, from time to time, there is a lot of public concern, and I am sure that my colleague the honourable member for Chifley will say later that there are always complaints about shonky migration agents which come to members of parliament. In most cases—probably in every case—they are not registered and are not fair dinkum. We need to make sure that justice is seen to be done and that appropriate consumer regulations and mechanisms are in place to protect what are most often people who cannot speak the language, do not know our systems and are very easily conned into handing over money for something that, in many cases, is of no value to them.
This bill simply extends the current arrangements for the regulation of the migration advice industry. It also amends the Migration Act to provide more efficient methods of warning the public of the suspension or cancellation of an agent's registration and enables the Migration Agents Registration Authority to protect the rights and interests of people whose migration agent has died or has been deregistered.
I recently went to one of MARA's conferences in Brisbane, I think, and I was quite impressed with their education schemes for making some of their registered migration agents aware of what it is that they are supposed to do. I noticed that something like 40 per cent of all registered migration agents are lawyers. That is a problem in the sense that lawyers do not particularly want to be part of any industry body but their own. In this case, it really is an important facet of the migration advice industry that everybody should be involved in a whole group. To be truthful, I do not see why they do not join the industry association because the industry association are the ones that in effect form MARA under this legislation and, if you want to be a migration agent, you come under that umbrella as well.
I noticed that something like 38 per cent of complaints received by MARA concerned lawyers, although it does not appear that MARA referred any of these complaints to a disciplinary body for lawyers. It is a bit hard for a disciplinary body of lawyers to make some sort of value judgment as to whether someone in the migration area has made a mistake or done the wrong thing. That is something the immigration minister might be prepared to look at. He will get support from me on that for sure.
The opposition supports this bill. We thank the minister and those in the minister's office for the extra information they gave to Senator Cooney and Senator McKiernan, who were quite interested in knowing some of the details of the review. I have had a good look at the review, and I think it has been very wide ranging. It has come up with a number of better initiatives for making this system work better. Given that this self-regulatory scheme has been in place for only a year, it is sensible that we extend it for a few more years. I noticed as well that it will be reviewed again during the next three years. I do not propose to say anything more about this. It is a measure that the opposition welcomes.
In conclusion, all my dealings with the industry association have been good. They are always willing to talk to me and, I am sure, other members of parliament as well. I think that migration agents do not deserve to have the reputation now that they have had in the past. Yes, there are some shonks still around and, yes, I am concerned that only 24 per cent of registered migration agents are actually part of the industry body. It is the industry body that are looking at further education and the development of expertise, so they might want to redouble their efforts in that regard. But, given that they have only been travelling for a year, I think we can give them another three years and then review them again to see how they are going. I will leave it at that and  remind the minister again that, on the last day we are here, we are again in a bipartisan mode.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—It is my pleasure to rise to support the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1999  today and to commend the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for bringing it forward. The minister has proved himself to be a very capable and effective minister in managing a fairly difficult portfolio, not the least of which has involved the events that have emerged over the last several years and, more particularly, in the last couple of months. This is part of an effective administration that, for the most part, has received bipartisan support. I think that is an appropriate way to go. It is difficult to manage at the best of times. There are lots of international sensitivities. I was very pleased to note that the shadow minister for immigration, the honourable member for Bowman, also supported the bill today. It is good to see such bipartisan bonhomie and Christmas spirit at this time.
In terms of the provisions of the legislation, it is appropriate that the sunset clause be extended for a further three years and that the voluntary code which has been in existence be given time to operate and to show its effectiveness. There is no doubt that the management of migration agents is a difficult area. In the past, in the area of migration agents, as the shadow minister said, there has been a tendency for a lot of shonks to operate. People have been encouraged to use every trick in the book in order to stay here.
During our inquiry into the treatment of refugees, there was an open admission by a lot of the people who were dealing with refugees that some of the agents clearly did not have ethical standards. This piece of legislation is about standards in the industry. It is about ensuring appropriate supervision of agents. It also provides the ability to take away the registration of agents where they have demonstrated unethical behaviour. It is not in the interests of those migrants who come here or those who are going through the process of applying for citizenship or migration to this country to be fooled in terms of the appropriate channels or requirements.
There are four registered migration agents operating in my electorate of Cook. Jian Wang and Ying Feng Lui operate from the suburb of Miranda, and John Shanahan and Bobby Halim are based in Sylvania. These agents assist friends and family members of my constituents who need advice concerning visa categories for relatives' applications, and also asylum seekers wanting assistance in putting their claim together.
The operations of these agencies are assisted and overseen by MARA, the Migration Agents Registration Authority. Since March 1998, when the minister appointed the Migration Institute of Australia to act as the Migration Agents Registration Authority, it has performed well in ensuring that migration agents have served their clients well. Minister, seeing that you are in the chamber, it is appropriate to congratulate you on taking that step in terms of registration. It is also appropriate that we would want to see more of the agents belonging to the 
 association. That is the appropriate way to go if they want to undertake the necessary training that is available to them.
MARA has focused on the ongoing education of agents, not on exercising coercive punishments such as by imposing fines or other penalties. The ultimate sanction is that their registration is taken away. It is similar in many ways to the situation involving travel agents, where a self-regulating authority is in place and where deregistration can occur. The authority has managed entry into the group of registered agents, their re-registration, the fielding of complaints, the initiation of disciplinary proceedings, and generally the maintenance of industry standards.
The role of MARA is set out in section 316 of the Migration Act. It produces an annual report and has a code of conduct. It also produces newsletters for members and continuing professional development kits and mediation kits, and runs a web site for which it provides fact sheets.
During the last 12 months the authority has held eight mediations. The authority believes that the mediations are an overall success enabling the parties themselves to establish an agreement to their dispute. Of the eight mediations held to date, five achieved an agreement to which both parties adhered. From these five successfully mediated agreements, five have resulted in the authority deciding to take no further action on the complaint.
This bill has certainly enhanced the authority's power in regulating the industry. It allows for the better warning of clients and migration agents by indicating a particular agency's standing within the group, overseen by MARA, and by providing information on whether an agent is fully accredited. It safeguards the rights of clients of deregistered or deceased agents.
In August 1999, over 3,000 people were left unrepresented in their applications to the department of immigration and appeal bodies for various classes of visas when Barlow and Co. went out of business. Obviously they had spent a lot of money in the process of their claims and paid it to Barlow. Suddenly Barlow went out of existence and all assistance that had been given in the past just went for nought through the business collapse of this organisation.
In response, this bill contains measures designed to ensure that people whose migration agent has been deregistered will be able to continue with their migration or review applications without disadvantage, and I think that is a significant step forward. There may be further amendments to part 3 of the Migration Act in response to this collapse and these amendments will be included in an omnibus bill at a later date. In summary, I commend the minister for bringing forward this legislation. It is appropriate that we continue the close supervision of agents. This voluntary code is appearing to work. We would encourage more agents to belong to the association to get all the benefits of the training and newsletters et cetera. It is good to see such bipartisan agreement on such an important part of migration activities in this country.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—I notice that the Christmas spirit has been referred to. I hope honourable members do not think I am a heathen by virtue of my contribution. I certainly do support this bill but I would be less than honest if I did not say that I do have quite a number of reservations about the activities of migration agents. Very briefly, in 1997 the government commenced statutory self-regulation of the migration advice industry and appointed the Migration Agents Registration Authority, MARA, to establish a regulatory body for the industry with the aim to eventually move towards self-regulation.
The bill expands the Migration Agents Registration Authority's powers to access files where the registration of a migration agent is cancelled or suspended; where the agent has become incapacitated, dies or is voluntarily deregistered; or where a migration agent's registration expires; and to provide copies of relevant documents to clients. This will, of course, maintain and strengthen consumer protection and contribute to the integrity of the migration and humanitarian programs by promoting an ethical and competent migration advice industry. 	I certainly think that this is a very worthy objective, but I think the agents risk their industry if they fail to rigorously ensure that they have an ethical industry, including the self-regulatory body MARA.
It is important to recognise that currently MARA has  jurisdiction only over registered migration agents. In the majority of cases the only disciplinary sanction that MARA has against a registered migration agent is to cancel or suspend their registration. Once an agent is deregistered, he or she is no longer within the jurisdiction of MARA.
As the shadow minister has already mentioned, 40 per cent of migration agents in 1998 were lawyers and 38 per cent of the complaints arose from those agents. It seems to me to be absolutely absurd that a solicitor acting as a solicitor can be disciplined by his professional body for errors or whatever, but, notwithstanding the fact that MARA has the power to refer these matters to the legal disciplinary bodies, no referrals have occurred to date in relation to acting as a migration agent. I make this point: from my experience of the constituents that come through my front door, I do not see that they are less exploited by migration agents who happen to be solicitors than by the ones that are not solicitors. I think this is a blight on the legal profession and it is a real weakness. I do not think a solicitor should be secure in his legal profession irrespective of what he does as a migration agent. That is completely abhorrent to me and I think it is abhorrent to any sense of fairness and any sense of justice.
The honourable member for Cook, who made a contribution to this debate, referred again to the case of Barlow and Co., Australia's largest legal practice specialising in migration, which collapsed. They had some 3,000 clients on their books, some from my electorate. If a firm of solicitors collapses and they have moneys in their care on behalf of clients, that money is protected. If a legal practice that wholly or partly practises in migration law collapses, why should the migration clients of that practice not be indemnified as well? I would be very interested, as I always am, to hear what the minister or the department may have to say about this matter. There are contradictions. If my assertions are wrong in this I am more than happy to be advised otherwise, but I suspect they are not.
I see a lot of people about migration issues in my electorate. In fact, I can say that approximately—and we do keep records of it—80 per cent of the people who walk through my door come to me about migration matters. I will just say this: I have always had a practice in my office of trying to tell them exactly what the honest situation is. Some people would love to hear that miracles can be done or that, through the intervention of their federal member, we will be able to ensure that they stay here. There have been some exceptional cases, and I would be less than gracious if I did not acknowledge the fact that the department has always bent over backwards to assist me in those cases. But when people want to apply for a refugee status or a protection visa and we know that they have absolutely no basis for sustaining it, then we tell them so.
Indeed, I came from the old school which said it was never a backbencher's responsibility to say no, it was the minister's. I have changed that in terms of migration—we are now no 
 longer sending on requests for ministerial discretion when we are more than confident that it will not be exercised. In fact, we tell constituents now that we will not deal with their case when they are being handled by a migration agent.
Sometimes people come here on a visitor's visa, stay for a while and find that they love Australia. They have been reunited with some relatives or they see the marvellous opportunities here, and they want to apply to become permanent residents. I am quite convinced they would make excellent citizens, but they cannot apply. So they go to a business migration agent, who will probably get them to apply for a protection visa. If the protection visa is not approved, there is an opportunity then to appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal, then the Federal Court or, indeed, to seek exercise of the minister's discretion. That will take about two years and will also take up several thousand dollars.
This is what really upsets me about migration agents. The point I want to make is that the migration agents that act this way do so totally dishonestly. The only way it can be justified is if the client says, `Can you leave me here for two years? I am prepared to pay several thousand dollars for that privilege,' and the migration agent replies, `I will exercise every option available to you but in the knowledge that you will never succeed.' But of course that is not what they are told and that is not the way they apply.
I really resent it if, when every option has been exercised, the migration agent sends them off to my office to ask me then to make representations. Perhaps, Mr Deputy Speaker, coming from Tasmania you do not have so much experience with it—
—I do.
—That is interesting. These people, I feel, in the main are very vulnerable. I am intensely proud to have in my electorate a lot of Filipinos—the largest concentration in any LGA—and also Indians, Pakistanis, Fijians and Lebanese. All these groups of migrants tend to get awfully exploited. They make a wonderful contribution not only to my electorate but also to this nation, but they are being exploited by migration agents, in my humble opinion.
Essentially, when the system of migration agents was first established, the idea was that people could go to them for a reasonable fee and get some advice or assistance in filling in a form and lodging it with the department. That is an appropriate role. But I do not think it is appropriate that the stricter migration guidelines in this country are used to exploit people, to extract money from them by way of fees in the knowledge that their case is absolutely hopeless. I am not suggesting that for us to tighten up in this area is easy, but everyone in this game has a vested interest in a much cleaner system of migration agents and would benefit from it.
I turn now to my last complaint. Let us remember that 40 per cent of migration agents are lawyers. There is a schedule of fees that a solicitor or a barrister can charge. I think that the disciplinary body would not be too happy, for example, with a charge of $500 for one letter. Yet, by and large, when solicitors practise as migration agents there appears to be no control whatsoever over the fees that they can charge for certain actions. Again it is a case of double standards. If someone is legally qualified, the overwhelming disciplinary mantle should be that of the legal profession. I would suggest to the legal profession that it is outrageous that a solicitor can be disciplined for some of his charges when acting in the law other than in migration, but when acting as a migration agent he is allowed to charge—without penalty, without review, without discipline—whatever he likes.
To summarise: the opposition is supporting this measure. In my own electorate I have quite some experience of migration agents. Just this year we have changed some of our practices, after a number of years, in response to problems with migration agents. I would like to see the continuation of migration agents but there is a desperate need for even tougher measures. In particular, it is necessary to get away from the double standards that apply to members of the legal profession when they act as migration agents.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MIGRATION AGENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1
"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—in reply—I would like first to thank my colleagues for their support for the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1999 . It would be of grave concern to me were the sunset clause to operate and the existing arrangements that we have for supervision to fall. I do want to thank the member for Bowman, as well as the members for Cook and Chifley, for their support for the legislation.
I will not repeat the comments I made in the second reading speech—they stand as printed—but I particularly want the member for Chifley to know that I share many of the concerns he raised. Let me just say that. I and the shadow minister are both members of the legal profession.
—I was gracious enough not to mention that!
—Quite frankly, I emphasise from time to time, and I will do it here, that the legal profession has certain values, ethics. I can see one of my colleagues over there who has even taught law. Some of those ethics that I was taught when I was a young practitioner involved not only my obligation to my client, but also my obligation to fellow practitioners and to the court.
I often say when I speak to migration agents, because there is no court that applies to them, that there is a wider obligation they have to the community of which they are a part that requires some cognisance of the broader national interest. That means that you have a migration program which operates with integrity, a program in which you do not set out to find ways and means to undermine it. I have to say that I think—and members will know that I hold this view very strongly—that there are some who have no cognisance of the wider national interest. If they see a loophole, they believe it is there to be exploited, regardless of its impact.
I have to say that I am very much aware of some of the unconscionable charging arrangements that some members of the profession are involved in. I want members of this committee to know that I have personally raised matters with the Law Society of New South Wales relating to the conduct of members of the legal profession. I have not waited for them to be considered by MARA. I believe that they were of sufficient concern that a representative body of the profession ought to have been active in taking them up.
Members will know—and this relates to the comments from the member for Chifley—that not all migration agents are involved in the practice of misleading their clients. Sometimes they tell them, because the client comes in simply wanting a work opportunity, that by using the system they can get them a year or two. Some advertisements, of some members of the profession, for people to come forward who have exhausted all other remedies—even been to other agents—say, `If you come and see me you can join my class action, which I have under way right now, which will enable you to apply lawfully for another bridging visa.'
Members may not know the background reasons for why bridging visas have to operate as they do. It is a very simple reason: we have detention facilities normally for about 900 people 
 in Australia. If we were to arrest and hold every unlawful that we located and everybody involved in legal proceedings or making applications to me or using the tribunal processes, we would have to have detention facilities for 10,000 people. Bridging visas are not issued to enable people to go out and get work. They are issued for a very practical reason: that is, unless we have some basis upon which they can be held in the community while they undertake their lawful entitlements, we cannot properly detain them. That is the only alternative that remains available to us.
Why did I raise another matter with the Law Society of New South Wales? I came across a letter that had been written by a solicitor who had initiated a class action on behalf of clients. All of the class actions that we have had to date have failed. There are some that are still before the courts, but all of those where we have had a judicial decision taken have failed. The letter I saw in this case from a member of the legal profession was to the clients of a failed class action, encouraging them to send another $250 so that they could be part of an appeal. I guess that is not unreasonable. When the solicitor then says that, in addition, there will be no accounting for the money that is paid by the client and, further, there will be no refund of any of the money paid, I consider that highly unethical. I guess I was right because the Law Society counselled the solicitor. He was told to tell the client that he would account for the money.
There are problems associated with running an administrative scheme, and MARA is in a difficult position. They are in the same position that we face in relation to any of the so-called rights that people have, such as the right to practise. If we are going to take away somebody's livelihood, there has to be evidence. The reason we cannot act against half the shonks is that they cover their tracks so carefully. The people involved, particularly if their actions have failed, may have been removed from Australia. The prospect of getting evidence against some of these people is extremely difficult. Somebody might say, `Try to push the envelope.' You push the envelope and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act operates. They are back off to the courts.
This supervision really involves the protection of shonks. The difficulty we have is that there is not a ready appreciation in this field that ethics are required. Every time I go to the MIA—they are almost sick of me coming through the door—I tell them that we need ethical standards. You have to have an appreciation that in this field there is a wider Australian public interest.
I think it is important in discussing these issues for people to know that there is a will on the part of the government to do something about it. I will look for any creative ideas to enable us to do it more effectively. I am sure, as the honourable member for Bowman indicated in his remarks, that there will be support from the agents who are ethical. I am sure there is a desire on the part of the MIA to deal with these matters, but, as has been said, when 70 per cent of the industry do not bother to join the industry body and you get the ethical people in it and the others outside, the task is fairly difficult.
I want to conclude by saying that I appreciated the compliments paid to me by the member for Cook, and I thank him for that. But I particularly want to thank the member for Chifley, not because he is lightening the load in my office but because I think the approach that he is taking is absolutely right. It is the approach I took as a backbencher in not misleading people as to the outcomes that can be achieved. I think it is just exploitation of the vulnerable to hold out hope where none exists. Yet we know that the exploitation of the vulnerable is 
 to hold out hope and to take more money off them. A far better approach by disciplinary bodies, including the legal disciplinary bodies, is not in challenging the scheme because it might require solicitors to come in and be a part of it, but ensuring that appropriate standards are met would speak well of the law societies and similar bodies and I think would lift the esteem in which the profession is held in the eyes of the public, where they could be far more proactive. I hope some of my friends in the profession one day have an opportunity to read these remarks.

"Stone, Sharman, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
The War Crimes Amendment Bill 1999  repeals section 22 of the War Crimes Act 1945. The act was amended in 1989 prior to the fall of the Iron Curtain to enable trial in Australia with respect to conduct engaged in during World War II in Europe. Although the usual practice would have been to extradite persons accused of such crimes to the country where the crimes occurred, it was considered at the time to be politically unacceptable to extradite persons to countries behind the then so-called Iron Curtain. Some years ago the Iron Curtain fell, fortunately, and many of the republics—including Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania—are now independent states and have been accepted as members of the Council of Europe. Australia has in the past been prepared to enter into extradition arrangements with any country that is a member of the council.
The government is actively pursuing the possibility of establishing modern extradition arrangements with many of these newly independent states. However, even if a modern extradition relationship were in place, it would still be impossible for those countries to comply with an extradition request while section 22 of the War Crimes Act remains in force in our country. Effectively, section 22 of the act provides that, where a person's extradition from Australia is sought for conduct covered by the act, no surrender for extradition is possible unless the requesting country establishes a prima facie case. Thus, notwithstanding a modern extradition relationship with these countries, if the offence for which the extradition sought is a war crime, then the requesting state must provide a prima facie case.
Because of the differences between civil code and common law countries, the practical effect is that it would be virtually impossible for a civil code jurisdiction to successfully seek the extradition of a person suspected of a war crime. The concept of a prima facie case is determining sufficiency of evidence, and it is one to which most common law countries are accustomed. However, those countries which operate under a civil code system—for example, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania—do not use this test in criminal proceedings. The practical issue is that the laws of evidence in common law systems are such as to make it very difficult for a civil code jurisdiction to supply evidence in an admissible form.
The repeal of section 22 will remove the fundamental barrier to Australia's cooperation with the international community in relation to suspected war criminals.
This is not to say that extradition of a suspected war criminal would be automatic. Any requests for the extradition of a suspected war criminal would be subject to the general extradition arrangement with the requesting country. Such arrangement must include all the usual safeguards spelt out in the Extradition Act 1988. All that the amendment will do is to remove an additional onerous requirement that relates only to the extradition of war criminals. This government sees no reason in principle why this practical impediment to the extradition of war criminals should be retained.
The amendment to the act will not have any financial impact. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill to this committee.",REPS,<title>WAR CRIMES AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,51,1
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—The opposition supports this legislation, the War Crimes Amendment Bill 1999 . By way of background, it is useful to put ourselves back into the frame of mind that existed at the time the provisions relating to extradition of alleged war criminals from the Second World War were enacted. It was a period where the world was convulsed with outrage in relation to the atrocities that had been conducted in Germany and in the countries that Germany had occupied—the forced deportation of many millions of people and the extermination of millions in the gas chambers of the Nazi war machine. There was a sense that the world had to enact a framework that would deal with those who had perpetrated such atrocities.
Nonetheless, there was another mind-set that also applied and that was a fundamental distrust of the legal regimes of many Eastern European states. That was because, at that time, those states were part of the larger empire of the Soviet Union or certainly subject to their dominion. It was a widely held view that those regimes were prone to distort historical records and that their legal systems provided no framework that was adequate for this country to respect in relation to those charged with criminal or quasi-political offences of this nature. I only say quasi-political in the sense that they arose out of the conflagration of war. The Soviet regime, having itself lost, I think, something in the order of 20 million dead as a result of resisting a German invasion, was felt to have such an antipathy to those who might be charged with offences that the normal protections of the legal system could not be guaranteed.
In the Cold War climate that I grew up in as a young man, there was still the lasting aftermath of a campaign in Australia to have the Communist Party of Australia proscribed as an illegal organisation and a widely held view that it would have been improper for us to send back to Eastern European countries persons against whom charges even of this nature were made to face trial and the penalties that would have applied in those eastern bloc countries, unless we ourselves formed a view that there was a substantial and probably conclusive case against them.
That was the framework in which the extradition provisions that currently apply were made, which require, before a surrender to another country of a person against whom extradition is sought for these offences, that an Australian tribunal must first satisfy itself in relation to the prima facie case that exists against that person. That is a not insubstantial hurdle when we are dealing with very different legal regimes. It is not an insubstantial hurdle even when we are dealing with similar legal regimes that understand a common law system of what actually comprises a prima facie case. But when we are dealing with civil law countries—and most of Europe does operate on a civil law environment—the knowledge base to put together 
 effectively an application for extradition is limited. That has been in part the root reason why, in the law of extradition generally, we have moved away from the requirement for the establishment of a prima facie case.
There is a hold-over in this area which still remains on the statute books. It is now thought appropriate to, in a sense, align the provisions that relate to extradition for the general run of criminal offences with those that we will now be enacting with respect to alleged war crimes. That will facilitate more readily the surrender to countries which were formerly part of the Soviet bloc, including Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, of persons who are asserted by those jurisdictions to be in Australia, if any such assertion is made, and against whom they assert evidence is available to establish proof of guilt in relation to atrocities that occurred during the Second World War.
My briefing to date from the department is that no intention to file an extradition application currently stands. But it may well be that, over time, these provisions are exercised. I know that my colleague from Melbourne Ports has put questions on the Notice Paper in relation to a Mr Ozols and he has raised this matter with me. It may well be that the authorities in the country where he is alleged to have been a significant and senior participant in a number of atrocities may feel it appropriate to seek such extradition. There may be others. By changing the law in this manner we do facilitate that.
There are always arguments that ought to be taken seriously with respect to those who have come to Australia after World War II that amongst those persons were some who were not seeking to make a new home in Australia as a result of circumstances which we would all regard as perfectly understandable and justifiable but who, it is asserted, had been involved in these atrocities. In those circumstances, I think the whole Australian community would want to see those persons brought to justice, whether in this country or overseas.
Of course, when we did have the regime that formerly applied—that is, the prima facie regime—when the former Labor government came to office and was confronted with substantial allegations that there were persons living amongst the Australian community who had been involved with these events, the response that was then made was to establish a special investigation unit which was resourced to assess those matters and to prepare them for prosecution. A number of prosecutions did take place.
For a variety of reasons the basis upon which the SIU was established was that, rather than facilitate extradition, the trials should take place in Australia. That, in itself, gave rise to a whole series of complexities. Perhaps that was a bad decision, in retrospect. It is easy to be wise in hindsight, but perhaps it was a bad decision because of the difficulties in bringing witnesses to Australia and in establishing proof of materials held on files in those countries which were then still subject to Soviet domination.
A whole range of other such issues did make those trials particularly difficult and, as history will show, either acquittals or discharges for reasons of ill health or the age of the accused meant that we obtained no convictions. I must say that I do not think that outcome has stilled the disquiet amongst those who suffered at the hands of the Nazi war machine. Perhaps there are still some living amongst us in this community who should be better placed on trial and account to history for the actions they undertook.
The opposition is content to support these changes. We accept that the international legal circumstances in respect of both the former Soviet Union and the states which were subject to it have changed and that we should apply the same regime to those extraditions as apply 
 in other areas. That is not to say that somebody charged with an extraditable offence is entirely without some opportunity for an examination of the matters alleged against them. There are a series of processes, often much litigated already in this country, where people are made subject to extradition requests. The extradition requests are subject to a range of discretionary matters in the end which the minister must consider before a surrender is made.
So it is not as if a case cannot be made either administratively or later at a political level to the minister that a surrender request must be acceded to if there are some circumstances wherein it is asserted that the legal regime in those countries is still not appropriate to enable a fair trial. There may indeed be some argument advanced to that effect in respect of particular matters. Nonetheless, I think the generality of this legislation is now most appropriate, and it indeed fits with the way in which the international community has seen appropriate to regard extradition and, as importantly, reflects the continuing abhorrence by the Australian community of the Holocaust and those who gave rise to it.
With those remarks, I indicate that the opposition does support this legislation. As I said, there are many things that perhaps with hindsight we might reflect on in relation to the conduct of matters previously. But it is not an area where I am content to say, as some amongst the Australian community do, that these are events in the dim, distant past which should be allowed to fade from memory. To the extent that properly based evidence is available to establish the fact of willed participation in these terrible events, I do not believe we, as a parliament, should ever stand in the way of the proper trial and punishment of such persons.",REPS,<title>WAR CRIMES AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,51,1
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—The War Crimes Amendment Bill 1999  provides for the repeal of section 22 of the War Crimes Act. The effect of the repeal of the legislation will be to facilitate extradition proceedings of suspected World War II war criminals residing in Australia to countries with civil legal codes and, in particular, to former Soviet bloc countries. The bill will bring the evidentiary requirements for the extradition of suspected war criminals into line with those of other criminal offences in Australia, subject to the Extradition Act 1988.
Section 22 of the War Crimes Act was originally introduced in response to concerns over judicial processes in the former Warsaw Pact countries. Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, there were concerns that individuals who faced extradition to countries in the Eastern bloc would not be subjected to the same judicial standards that could be expected in the West. As a result, an additional requirement to establish a prima facie case in the Australian courts prior to successful extradition of alleged war criminals was introduced. While the prima facie requirement was in response to concerns about Soviet bloc countries, it also had the effect of applying to all civil law jurisdictions. A prima facie case is a feature of the judicial system in common law countries and ensures that, at a relatively early stage of proceedings, there is sufficient evidence to establish grounds for a preliminary case against the accused. However, it is not commonly employed in civil law countries and, because of the significant differences in the evidentiary procedures of the two codes, it has been almost impossible in practice for countries with civil codes to extradite suspected war criminals from Australia.
With the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet empire, judicial processes have considerably improved in what was once the Eastern bloc. The Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as well as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, 
 Slovakia, Slovenia, and Russia, have all reformed their legal systems, and their criminal and civil justice systems have met requirements for admission into the Council of Europe.
Australia has, in the past, been prepared to establish extradition arrangements with any country that is a member of the Council of Europe, such as France and Germany. The rationale then for demanding that a higher threshold of guilt be established prior to extradition of suspected war criminals to the Eastern bloc is no longer evident.
Section 22, however, continues to create impediments in establishing extradition arrangements with civil law countries that may have cause to request the extradition of suspected war criminals from the Second World War residing in Australia. The repeal of this provision for extra evidentiary requirements for war criminals prior to extradition will also bring Australia into line with war crime extradition procedures in Europe. Neither Britain nor Western European countries retain additional evidentiary requirements in respect of the extradition of war criminals. As has been referred to, the rights of individuals in Australia facing extradition continue to be safeguarded by the Extradition Act under which the Attorney-General also retains a residual discretion to decline the surrender of a person to a foreign jurisdiction.
The effect then of the legislation will be to remove a significant impediment to the extradition of suspected Nazi war criminals. It is a further attempt to reduce the possibility that Australia should be used as a haven for war criminals or individuals who are suspected of having committed crimes against humanity and are sought by other jurisdictions.
The issue of suspected war criminals residing in our country has received considerable prominence in Australian public debate in the whole period since the Second World War. Indeed, as early as 1947, allegations were made in Australian newspapers that former Nazis and Nazi collaborators had managed to enter Australia.
From the 1950s to the 1970s, law enforcement authorities received a number of reports about individuals suspected of involvement in war crimes during World War II. There were also a number of extradition requests from communist countries. None of these requests were acceded to.
According to the final report of the Special Investigations Unit of the Attorney-General's Department, the US also failed to receive significant assistance from Australia in response to their requests in the course of the eighties. Throughout the 1980s, the Office of Special Investigation of the US Justice Department made a number of requests for assistance with suspected war criminals residing in Australia who were potential witnesses to investigations in the United States.
In 1986, ABC Radio broadcast a series of programs called Nazis in Australia. The series, by journalist Mark Aarons, contained a number of documented serious allegations about suspected Nazi war criminals who had come to Australia since the Second World War. Following Mr Aarons's revelations, the Australian government appointed Mr Andrew Menzies to conduct a review of allegations relating to the presence of Nazi war criminals in Australia. Mr Menzies found that it was more likely than not that a significant number of persons who committed serious war crimes did enter Australia and that appropriate further action needed to be taken.
As a result of the Menzies finding, the government amended the War Crimes Act to enable war crimes to be dealt with in Australian courts. An investigative unit, to be known as the Special Investigations Unit or SIU, of the Attorney-General's Department was established 
 under the direction of Mr Robert Greenwood QC. The SIU operated from 1987 to 1992. During that period it conducted 841 investigations into suspected war criminals residing in Australia. Of the 841 investigations, 819 were suspended due to a number of factors, including that the suspects were found to have been deceased, living abroad or unfit to stand trial. In other cases, investigators were unable to substantiate the allegations, there was insufficient evidence and in some cases the accused had been previously convicted abroad.
There were, however, four cases that were referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Three of these cases went to trial. Two were unsuccessful, a third was abandoned on medical grounds and, in 1992, the SIU was closed down by the Labor government before charges could be laid against the fourth suspect. In 1995, Robert Greenwood, the former director of the SIU, launched a strong attack on the then government, accusing it of actively frustrating and undermining the operation of the SIU.
It is interesting that the then Labor finance minister, Peter Walsh, in his autobiography, Confessions of a failed finance minister, said that, as finance minister, he tried to prevent the establishment of the SIU and hoped that `the crazy exercise would be terminated'. It is instructive that Mr Walsh made this additional claim:
Whatever moral force the argument for the War Crimes bill had, was somewhat diluted by the contemporary behaviour of the Israeli Army in Gaza and the West Bank . . . 
One would hope that former Senator Walsh's views did not play a role in the previous government's decision to close down the SIU.
It did become apparent, however, from the three trials that were conducted, that it is very difficult to successfully prosecute in Australia individuals who are alleged to have committed crimes against humanity in other countries, particularly when those crimes occurred some time ago.
Australia is not the only country to face the challenge of bringing to justice suspected war criminals who have migrated to their country. Both Canada and the US have been confronted with numerous cases of suspected war criminals in their jurisdiction. They have responded to those cases with a variety of measures, including revocation of citizenship and deportation of more than 50 individuals found to have been engaged in crimes against humanity.
In Australia, there is still public concern over suspected war criminals residing here. The most prominent of those persons is a Mr Konrad Kalejs. Mr Kalejs immigrated to Australia in 1950 and gained citizenship in 1957. He travelled to the US soon afterwards and became a successful property developer. In 1984, he was arrested in the US, and deportation proceedings were commenced against him. He is accused by the US Justice Department of having been a senior officer in the Latvian auxiliary security police, a pro-Nazi unit that killed tens of thousands of people during World War II.
In 1994, the US Federal Court of Appeals determined that Mr Kalejs should be deported to Australia. According to the judge, Mr Kalejs was:
. . . a key officer in a unit that killed tens of thousands of innocents. Kalejs and his unit had two other duties besides killing Jews in the Riga ghetto . . . The unit joined the German SS in so-called anti-partisan activity, which was little more than a cover for arresting and murdering civilians.
In 1994, Mr Kalejs was deported to Australia. In 1995, he left Australia for Canada where he was arrested, declared persona non grata, and, in June 1995, returned to Australia.
In September 1995, Kalejs was again arrested at Toronto airport after making a second trip there, and he was detained by authorities until his immigration hearing. On 18 August 1997, a Canadian immigration tribunal ordered Mr Kalejs deported back to Australia and found that he had been `an accomplice to the acts of murder, forcible confinement, enslavement and torture.' The tribunal found that Mr Kalejs had `violated the laws of war and committed war crimes, or crimes against humanity.' The Canadian tribunal also found that Mr Kalejs `was a party to the offences of murder and kidnapping.'
Mr Kalejs was deported back to Australia. The office of the minister for justice has advised that the DPP concluded that the evidence available here is insufficient to launch a successful criminal prosecution against Konrad Kalejs.
In November 1997, Latvia made a mutual assistance request to Australia for documents concerning genocide and war crimes involving Mr Kalejs. I am advised by the minister's office that, following a comprehensive review of relevant departmental files, a considerable amount of documentation on Mr Kalejs was provided to the Latvian authorities in response to their request for assistance. Australia also has had discussions with Latvia and Lithuania with a view to establishing extradition arrangements with those countries.
It is important to note that this legislation is not in response to any one case or individual; rather, it is designed to regularise our extradition arrangements in respect of accused World War II criminals who may be seeking sanctuary in Australia. As the minister has said, this move sends out a strong message internationally that Australia is not, and will not be, a haven for suspected World War II war criminals.
The challenge for our society is to find a way in which we can work with the international community to ensure that principles of justice apply to those involved in crimes against humanity who may seek a safe haven or refuge in Australia. It is a tragic reality of the second half of this century that crimes against humanity, atrocities, war crimes and attempted genocide did not end with the end of the Second World War. Indeed, if we look at Rwanda, Cambodia, the attempted extermination of people in Iraq, and more recently in East Timor, it is apparent that such acts of carnage have not abated as the 20th century draws to a close.
The moral imperative from the extermination of more than six million Jews during World War II was to never forget but, as time draws on, the memory of the international community does drift.
There are some who argue that many of those who were engaged in war crimes during World War II are now old men, that time has moved on and that we should forget the past. There are those who argue that it is too difficult and too costly to bring to justice men who have committed crimes many years ago. Indeed, there are some who even argue that we should not concern ourselves with crimes committed in a foreign land.
But the rule of law is not some fashionable policy from which we can pick and choose. If a man lives in our midst who is responsible for the deaths of one or 30,000 civilians, do we not have a responsibility to see him brought to justice? Can there really be time lines on mass murder? Can we seriously evoke a forgive and forget response to those who have committed crimes against humanity?
Dr Colin Rubenstein, the executive director of the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, argues:
. . . neither the passage of time nor vagaries of location should become pretexts for inaction in the pursuit of justice. 

If individuals who reside in this country have committed crimes against humanity in other countries, then we should take every measure possible to assist in bringing those individuals to justice. As Mark Baker, the Melbourne University history academic, has written:
A passport is not a confessional box where one secures absolution from guilt.
In the period following World War II, inadequate vetting procedures created favourable circumstances for suspected war criminals to seek sanctuary in Australia. If a crime can be graduated, it is hard to envision a more heinous crime than that committed by individuals who have been complicit in genocide, the deliberate effort to destroy a national, racial or ethnic population. Future generations will not judge us well if we do not take every measure possible to bring to justice those who have committed crimes against humanity. This bill is an important part of that process. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.",REPS,<title>WAR CRIMES AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,51,1
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—The War Crimes Amendment Bill 1999 , concerning the extradition of war criminals, will be some small consolation to the Australian public and even smaller consolation to those who still suffer with memories of the atrocities committed during World War II, many of whom are my constituents. As has been outlined by the member for Kooyong, there are strong reasons of legal uniformity for supporting this bill, which changes the level of legal proof needed by countries seeking extradition of war criminals from Australia. Bipartisan support for this bill should not lead the government, particularly the Minister for Justice or the Attorney-General, to think that there is approval for what some regard as their inaction in tackling these issues of war crimes since this government has been in office.
In all fairness to this government I would say, however, that it is probably not the only one whose handling of this issue is legally, ethically and politically problematic. Our inaction in Australia is currently affecting our reputation overseas. Only last weekend, the influential US current affairs program 20/20, watched by an estimated 60 million viewers around America and hosted by America's premier current affairs interviewer Barbara Walters, alleged that mass murderers are able to live comfortably in Australia without fear of prosecution, as compared with the United States, which has continued to regularly prosecute and deport Nazi war criminals.
The current government's response to these queries since it has been in office was summed up by the Attorney-General in 1997. Indeed, it was taken up again by the minister for justice in her various media appearances on Monday in response to the 20/20 program. I would sum up their attitude as insouciance and inaction. In my view it is, quite frankly, embarrassing. The minister told the 7.30 Report that she would not look into these matters herself. Rather, in a bureaucratic sidestep, she said that this was a matter for the Australian Federal Police. She knows full well that the Australian Federal Police are under the clear impression that the government does not want this matter raised or prosecutions recommenced.
One gets the impression from the media appearances of the minister for justice that she has kept herself in splendid ignorance of some of these issues: benign neglect, the blind eye to the telescope. At least that is how she came across in her response to the 20/20 program, when Mr O'Brien interviewed her on the 7.30 Report. She was asked whether she supported a past government's decision in 1992 to disband the Special Investigations Unit. The SIU was set up within the Attorney-General's portfolio to investigate and prosecute, under the amended War Crimes Act 1945, any individuals found to be residing in Australia who had committed crimes against humanity during World War II.
We know that the minister for justice was not in government then, but she claims to have been advised that one of the cases that had been put by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, regarded by the unit as its strongest case and above the three cases which had been unsuccessful, did not proceed because the Director of Public Prosecutions decided there was not enough evidence to proceed.
We know that this is simply not true. The minister and the government know that. After three unsuccessful prosecutions, mounting pressure from the then Liberal opposition and growing expenditure, policy fatigue set in. The then government announced that it would close the Special Investigations Unit. With only weeks until the closure of the unit, something of a battle developed between the SIU and the then Attorney-General and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions over the fourth and most significant war crimes case, PU38, involving a gentleman called Karlis Ozols, who has been mentioned a number of times by previous Attorneys, so I am not doing anything unusual in mentioning his name here. Ozols was a volunteer in the SS auxiliary, the Arajs Commando, and still lives peacefully in Melbourne. He should and could have been dealt with by Australia's legislation if the recommendation of senior independent counsel, Mr Peter Faris QC, had been addressed. This is in direct juxtaposition to the minister's ill-advised comments that nothing further could be done on this matter, according to her advice.
On 28 June 1992, Faris concluded his advice to the DPP, estimating that, while some research still needed to be completed, it would take only another three months to have all of the evidence prepared for trial against Ozols, that there was already a prima facie case for mass murder and war crimes. Mr Faris set out a number of charges and advised, `It would be wrong to shut the investigation down. Justice demands the investigation be completed.' The DPP sought to continue the investigation but the then Attorney-General resisted and referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police where the file has remained in a drawer. No prosecution was ever commenced; the investigation was not completed.
In March 1996, of course, the government changed hands and in 1997 a statement by the present Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, announced that the case was concluded and that there was little chance of success in pursuing it to finality. The documentation surrounding Karlis Ozols remained tightly restricted by the Federal Police and the Attorney-General's Department until late 1997. Indeed, the full circumstances surrounding Ozols was never put in the final report of the SIU to parliament.
In June 1992, Faris, the former head of the NCA, had gone through all of the charges, particularly as far as Mr Ozols was concerned. It is interesting to consider the three charges that he specifically put. Let us have a look at some of them. The first was that Mr Ozols was involved in killing people himself, as a lieutenant in the Latvian SD at Maley Trostenets. Mr Faris said there was a prima facie case that Ozols had committed war crimes between July 1942 and 27 September 1943 at Maley Trostenets. The second charge that he suggested there was a prima facie case for advancing was in the Minsk ghetto where, as the commander of the Arajs Commando, Ozols was directly and indirectly responsible for deaths.
Finally, Faris said that between 8 and 9 February 1943, Ozols and other members of the Latvian Arajs Commando under his command assisted the Germans in killing more than 2,000 Jews in the Slutzk ghetto. Mr Faris and the SIU were not concerned about issues of identification which were so important in other cases that have been considered around the world, including the very famous issue of Mr Ivan Demjanjuk  and his identity. First of all, 
 Mr Faris established that there were overseas witnesses and then he established that there were local witnesses, some of whom I have spoken to personally. Some of them were about 12 or 13 and had known Mr Ozols all of their lives.
Thirdly, was a killing order from SS Obersturmfuhrer Strauch in which Hilfsbeamten or supernumerary Ozols name was specifically included as a person responsible for various killings. Finally, in the state court of Hamburg in 1979, the German government requested an interview and extradition of Mr Ozols to participate in various other trials that were taking place against members of the Arajs Commando. The German court established all of the details of Mr Ozols' presence at all of the three incidents that Mr Faris QC recommended, via the DPP, to the Attorney-General as the reason for a prima facie case being necessary.
In North Queensland recently, a person who some would describe as an elderly pensioner has been charged as the alleged perpetrator of the murder of two children that took place more than 20 years ago. No-one in this parliament would suggest that because this gentleman is an age pensioner no charges should be pursued against him. The statute of limitations does not apply, according to any of us, to the charge of murder, and I think it is simply being consistent that we ought to apply it in these cases ourselves. The member for Kooyong spoke of the moral imperative that drives a democratic society like Australia in these kinds of issues, in remembering why we participated in that great struggle for democracy during the Second World War. I believe that this moral imperative should have been behind all of our actions in dealing with all of these issues, including the government's welcome amendment to repeal section 22 of the War Crimes Act 1945.
If people feel that perhaps these issues do not apply to Australia, I remind them of events that took place immediately after the dropping of the Special Investigations Unit and the policy fatigue that took place at that time. I go first to what happened in Bosnia. The war crimes that took place there led to the United Nations setting up special war crimes investigators. Ironically, the person who is now most prominent in seeking prosecutions against war criminals in Bosnia and Serbia is our own Graham Blewitt, who was the last head of the Special Investigations Unit that was too early sent into legal oblivion by a previous government and whose work should have been taken up by the current government.
If we look at the disgraceful situation perpetrated by Indonesian military authorities in East Timor after the 30 August referendum, the widespread international community view and the view of the UN Human Rights Commissioner is that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have been perpetrated in East Timor by the then military authorities of Indonesia. If people feel that in dropping our interest in war crimes we have in any way contributed to this expectation in some areas of the international community that war crimes and crimes against humanity such as those perpetrated in Bosnia and East Timor have in any way been lessened, we stand partially to blame for that development.
I conclude by indicating my support for these amendments to the War Crimes Act 1945. I hope that the now democratic countries of the Baltic take the opportunity to use Australia's new ability to assist them in extraditing the two or three people who have been talked about internationally as people who may be in Australia and who, according to the democratic and historical experience of those Baltic countries, it is seen as essential to bring to those countries for trials and examination of their activities during World War II against citizens of those countries. I commend this amendment to the War Crimes Act 1945.",REPS,<title>WAR CRIMES AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,51,1
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—I think we all agree that we do not want to see Australia a haven for war criminals. The War Crimes Amendment Bill 1999  that we are debating here today will lead to the repeal of section 22 of the War Crimes Act. That will mean there will no longer be any need to establish a prima facie case prior to the extradition of people overseas for trial on issues in relation to alleged war crimes.
One of the important principles involved is that international boundaries should not allow a person to evade criminal justice. One of the things that is referred to again and again in the literature surrounding this legislation is the fact that over the years we have seen, across the world, closed borders. Those closed borders, and the lack of ability to view proceedings behind those borders, have resulted in and facilitated fairly lurid media headlines from time to time when it has not been possible for a trial to proceed because of allegations occurring on one side of the boundary and people existing on the other side of the boundary.
For example, I refer to some of the headlines that have gone before in the Australian Jewish News such as that on August 27 this year. It said, `Nazis in Australia: too late, says expert', and the article refers to media revelations that Australia secretly recruited known SS members, former Nazi storm-troopers and Nazi party members to work here as scientists and technicians after World War II. The same article states:
Not every German was a Nazi and not every Nazi was a war criminal.
But there is in that kind of a lurid presentation of the details a clear imputation that some of those people may have been involved in war crimes.
What is a war crime? I will not go into all the details here. A war crime is defined in sections 6, 7 and 8 of the War Crimes Act. I am quoting here from an article by Gillian Triggs:
A serious crime is a war crime if it was:
(a) committed:
	 (i)  in the course of political, racist or religious persecution; or
	 (ii)	 with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such, and
(b)	 committed in the territory of a country when the country was involved in a war or when the territory of the country was subject to an occupation.
War is defined by section 5 to mean war `in so far as it occurred in Europe in the period beginning on 1 September 1939 and ending on 8 May 1945'.
That basically sets out what the War Crimes Act is dealing with, but I can go on into the article by Gillian Triggs and look at the consideration of people where, as I stated earlier, the allegations involved activities that were alleged to have occurred on the other side of borders that were for some time closed. I want to refer now to a case involving Mr Polyukhovich and the article by Gillian Triggs. She says:
Mr Polyukhovich was seventy-two when, on 26 January, 1990, he was charged with nine offences (later amended to eighteen) alleging the murder of twenty-four men, women and children and of having been knowingly involved in the murder of 850 Jews in the Ukraine between 1941 and 1943. The day before he was to appear in the Adelaide Magistrates Court committal proceedings, Polyukhovich was shot in the chest and wounded. This delayed proceedings but did not cause them to be terminated.
A litte further on in the article she says:
Polyukhovich was committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court of South Australia on two charges relating to the killings of six people. 

In other words, prima facie evidence was found to exist in that case—that is, prima facie evidence as established within the Australian judicial system.
The subsequent trial of Polyukhovich in the Supreme Court of South Australia came to an abrupt end when the indictments were quashed for lack of evidence. Apparently the court was not satisfied as to the credibility of the witnesses and was not prepared to allow such evidence as there was to go to the jury.
That case indicates an example in which prima facie evidence was found to exist. What we are dealing with here is the idea that it is not necessary to find prima facie evidence, and that is certainly the case in all other matters apart from allegations of war crimes. In all other matters, dealings between international authorities occur because of extradition treaties on which there is no necessary evidence at all. All that is needed to be established is that there is a domestic law in Australia—in other words, an extradition agreement with that other country—and that there is an allegation and a request from that country for that to proceed.
When we consider the needs for extradition, under the Extradition Act 1988, which will become the relevant act once section 22 of the War Crimes Act is repealed, there are protections in place. I want to refer in particular to the protections given to the Attorney-General. Before someone can be extradited, the Attorney-General has to be satisfied that there is no extradition objection in relation to the offence; that on surrender to the extradition country the person will not be subjected to torture; and that, where the offence is punishable by a penalty of death, special circumstances apply.
The Attorney-General must consider one of the following alternatives: one, the person will not be tried for the offence; two, if the person is tried for the offence, the death penalty will not be imposed on the person; three, if the death penalty is imposed on the person, it will not be carried out. Further, the Attorney-General can satisfy himself or herself that a special assurance has been given in relation to the person. I am not covering all the specific details, but the Attorney-General also has discretion to consider that the person should be surrendered in relation to the particular offence.
The international principle is that extradition proceedings have no function in determining whether someone is guilty or innocent. They are simply an administrative matter. Is the person concerned liable under our law to be surrendered up to another country to face trial? In other words, do we recognise their law and do they recognise ours? That is the basis on which an extradition agreement exists or does not exist.
In the past there have been questions about whether people extradited to Warsaw Pact countries, under the former Warsaw Pact, would be provided with a fair trial. We have all heard allegations—it is probably a clear fact—that under those regimes there were political juntas and military juntas conducting show trials. There would be real concern in the mind of the average Australian that those things would have been occurring. However, since the collapse of the Soviet empire and the break-up of Yugoslavia, many ex-Warsaw Pact nations are now moving towards the mainstream in terms of their governance and in terms of their legal system.
I think we would all have seen the notes that have been issued illustrating this bill which list a number of countries from that area. Is there any reason why we should not develop extradition agreements under our law with those particular countries? Can we establish those agreements? I would submit that we should be setting up those agreements. As I said, those borders have been an impediment for years to the proper review of people's behaviour or 
 crimes alleged against them. Now is the opportunity to clear the air on those issues. Therefore, obviously I commend this bill.
We would have to establish an extradition treaty with those nations before we would be obliged under our law to give up someone. I had a particular look at some of those ex-Warsaw Pact nations. I asked myself, `What other ones are there, apart from the ones listed as moving down this path? Are there some recalcitrant ones?' Obviously there are. For example, what is the position with Serbia? Would Australians in general like to see someone extradited to Serbia? I think many people would be concerned about that. Clearly that is not going to happen because we do not have any extradition agreement with them. We have nothing within our domestic law that would require an Attorney-General to give up someone for trial in Serbia.
As these nations move towards the mainstream in terms of their governance, then we can make these agreements and we can then see justice done. Where there is an allegation made, it can be followed down the burrow. People can then determine whether there is a case to answer under the appropriate regime, and the decision can be made.
There have been some examples. In 1997, Latvia sought documents regarding alleged genocide and war crimes by Mr Kalejs during the Second World War. It is possible that Latvia may seek to extradite Mr Kalejs when it has completed its examination of all this material, and an extradition treaty would facilitate that. By removing this requirement for an examination of prima facie evidence in such a case, Australia is clearing the way for such a thing to occur.
Another example occurred when Lithuania sought information from Australia on alleged war crimes by Antanas Gudelis of Adelaide. A report in the Australian Jewish News of 30 July 1999 says:
Mr Gudelis, 87, immigrated from Germany with his wife 50 years ago and became an Australian citizen. He is suspected of the mass murder of civilians in the Lithuania town of Kupiskis during World War II.
The article goes on to say:
Mr Gudelis was previously investigated by Australia's Special Investigations Unit (SIU), but prosecution did not proceed. The SIU was set up in 1987 following allegations of alleged war criminals . . . It investigated a number of cases of alleged war criminals under the War Crimes Act 1945.
Four cases were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, but none was successfully prosecuted before the SIU was closed down by the Federal Government in 1992. The government has been criticised since then for lack of political will on the issue of alleged war criminals living in Australia.
I think this legislation puts an end to that kind of criticism.
—Why?
—Because it provides the opportunity for these people to be tried in areas where these things are alleged to have occurred. It is reasonable for people to continue to actively question the government on this issue because it is a very emotional one, but I do think that by opening the door for scrutiny overseas by the very people who are making the allegations, and by not keeping this impediment of prima facie evidence, Australia is coming to a position that is workable. I would be interested to hear what the member opposite has to say about that.
It is a situation that is difficult. It has raised tremendous expectations in the past, only to have them dashed. I do not anticipate that that sort of thing is going to stop in future just because we do this, particularly so many years after the fact, but the point is, steps are being taken.
I would like to reiterate that the end of the communist era means that these issues can be opened up to scrutiny. They can be tried in an environment which Australians would have trust in and would believe to be accurate. It means that the system in those countries is increasingly transparent. We in Australia need to facilitate the flow of justice in relation to these very emotional issues.
As I said, this bill opens the way for that to occur. I welcome the support that has been forthcoming from members opposite in relation to it. It is important that such an emotional issue does not degenerate into a point scoring exercise. On the whole, that kind of temptation has been avoided in the past, and I hope that will continue to be the case in the future. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.",REPS,<title>WAR CRIMES AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,51,1
"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—It is my pleasure to speak on the War Crimes Amendment Bill 1999 , and I support the legislation. However, I have to say this legislation is long overdue because it is at least seven years since most of the Iron Curtain countries gained their independence and yet we are only just acting on this matter now. It has been far too slow in coming.
Both sides of the House are, I think, open to criticism in relation to this matter. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry is correct in saying that the whole episode of war criminals from the Second World War in relation to Australia—and the approach of all governments—is a very sorry story. The fact is that, during that period after the war, a number of Nazis, fascists and people of very dubious background were allowed into Australia. When I consider the sorts of checks we make now on people who have legitimate reasons to come to Australia, as compared with what we did then with regard to some people whose background and motivation were amazing, I think this matter needed to be examined.
I have been around for a few years. In 1987, thinking that we would be doing something, I supported the bill which set up the commission. By 1992, when there was not a single successful prosecution, those of us who took an interest in the matter were appalled. Not only had it cost the nation several million dollars but, as the honourable member for Denison has now pointed out in relation to this bill, we were frustrated by certain other factors. One was that in every case, rather than dealing with this matter in cooperation with other countries, we thought we would simply deal with it by trying people, or thinking about trying people, under Australian law with Australian practice. They would then have to pass the stricter criteria that are at present in our system.
That would have been okay if our nation and certain sections of our bureaucracy had not covered up the fact that, when these characters came to Australia at that time, some of them knew of their background. Why has there not been an inquiry into this matter? We have all sorts of parliamentary and other inquiries but we have never had an inquiry into this very serious issue—the cover-up of war criminals who came to Australia after the Second World War. Yes, we had a War Crimes Tribunal established, but its business was to find individuals, not to look into the question of what actually happened in the Australian processes that allowed these people to come during that period. This is very serious: I am not sure that we have learnt from our history.
I take this opportunity to say that I hope the parliament at some stage looks into this matter, looking into the role of our intelligence agencies, our immigration department and other bureaucracies that were involved in covering up the fact that some of these people who came 
 out here had been directly responsible for the killing of a large number of innocent people, including Jewish people.
I now turn to the question of what happened when we did form the War Crimes Tribunal and the sorry tale from 1987 to 1992—we never got a single conviction. We have been criticised in international circles about this. I remember that, at the time they wound it up, we were told that we had done our best and we had gone around trying to find information. In the case of the one person they managed to actually get before a court, it did not proceed in the end because they claimed that the information was not sufficiently powerful in relation to our judicial system.
One wonders whether it would not have been better to start up an investigation into what actually happened in terms of the total process rather than set up a narrow tribunal that looked into the prosecution of individuals. Why were all those people who came here—they may since have died or there may not be sufficient evidence of all their misbehaviour—allowed into this country? Why were they not checked? Who covered up for them? We never investigated that.
We are now being told by the minister in her second reading speech that the reason for this amendment is that things have changed in Europe, and that some of the countries that were behind the Iron Curtain are now part of the European family and we therefore needed to make some extradition treaties with them. But there is a problem: we have suddenly discovered that the criterion called the prima facie case that we have in the legislation under section 22 does not apply to all countries. Not all countries have a similar criterion. Why we suddenly discovered this after all these years is an interesting question.
As the honourable member for Blair said earlier, even if we formed these extradition agreements with Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and several other countries in the former Soviet Union and perhaps even countries in the former Yugoslavia, because they have a different system of dealing with this—that is, a civil code system instead of the same criminal code system of the kind that we have—we still would not be able to get the extraditions going. That is why we want to get rid of section 22. I agree with that; the only thing is that we should have done it years ago. Many of the people who have been guilty of these crimes have now passed away or they are very old, and the possibility of putting together evidence, even under the civil code system, becomes much more difficult.
Having said all that, I think we should now actively take advantage of the passing of this legislation and say that Australia is ready to cooperate with these countries in cases like this. We should, firstly, speedily ensure that we have extradition agreements and, secondly, where there are requests from these countries, deal with them under the civil code system of that particular country so that people can be extradited and dealt with for the things that they have done.
I said earlier that maybe we have not completely learned the lesson of that previous experience. I would be interested to know whether the War Crimes Amendment Bill or the War Crimes Act as it stands will actually be applicable to the crimes against humanity issues that have arisen in relation to a number of places. I am referring particularly to former Yugoslavia. Will this legislation allow us to carry out extraditions against people who may have been involved in crimes against humanity in the former Yugoslavia? Will this legislation ensure that people who may have come from the former Yugoslavia who may be guilty of crimes against humanity are covered by the amended War Crimes Act? I would be interested in the minister's response to this issue.
The terminology has changed in international forums from `war crimes' to `crimes against humanity'. This is important because of what happens in internal civil war type situations. In situations where there are ethnic conflicts within a particular country, there is no formal declaration of war but there are crimes against humanity. Will this amended legislation be able to deal with that sort of issue? If not, I would suggest that we have missed an opportunity to actually get Australia involved in an international effort in relation to these matters.
We have had a number of sensational incidents in relation to this term `crimes against humanity', the most famous being the Pinochet case in Britain, where Spain requested the extradition of the former president and dictator Mr Pinochet for crimes against humanity committed while he was president of his country.
Let us assume that we had a Pinochet type personality here in Australia and a country requested the extradition of that person. Would this legislation, as amended, cover that sort of incident? Would it cover that type of case? If not, why not? If we have amended legislation, why haven't we taken account of this matter in order to deal with that sort of contingency? And you do not have to be a president. You can be a significant player who has been responsible for crimes against humanity in one of these situations—in a civil war, in an ethnic conflict or, as in the Pinochet case, where the crime is against one's own people.
I would be interested to find out whether the amended legislation is going to cover these situations. If not, I would like to say that I am pretty disappointed that it does not and that there ought to have been further amendments to this legislation to deal with that sort of issue. If the intention of this legislation is to overcome bottlenecks in relation to the past, in relation to 30 or 40 years ago, we should also have learnt from the hard lessons of that time and be ready to deal with more contemporary cases.
We are talking now about dealing with crimes against humanity in relation to East Timor. We have made quite a bit of fuss about that, and of course I agree that we ought to be pursuing it. But what about our own legislation? For example, what if somebody from Indonesia manages to become a permanent Australian resident or citizen and it is discovered that that person was involved in East Timor human rights abuses? Would that be covered under this legislation?
I think it is very important that we confront these issues. We do not want to be left with the following comment made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry at the end of the Australian process when he said:
Now we have the benefit of 10 years to look at the legislation that was adopted—
that was the 1989 amendments to the War Crimes Act—
we can see that it failed. It not only failed to deal with that one situation, it failed to deal with the other cases.
What is left is a situation where the information, the allegations, the research is all out there and there's still more that can be conceivably done if the government was willing to devote the resources.
Perhaps that point ought to be taken on board as well. Perhaps we have not devoted sufficient resources in the right way when dealing with this issue.
As we move towards the new millennium and we look at casting off some of the worst aspects of our history, one of the worst things in our history has been the fact that war criminals were able to come to Australia and survive here when they had done awful things and that, by the time we got around to doing something about it, many of them had either 
 passed away or the evidence had disappeared. We have not even seriously investigated why all of that happened.
When we are facing up to the future, when we have seen the situations that have occurred in various places around the world, especially in the former Yugoslavia, and we know that there may be people here who have been involved in some of these crimes, let us make sure that we have the weapons, that we have the legislation and that we have the political will to pursue any such people so that we do not repeat the episode which occurred after the Second World War in relation to the Nazis.

"Stone, Sharman, MP",LP,1999-12-09,"—in reply—I thank all members who have contributed to this debate. It was pleasing to hear that members of the opposition support the very important amendments contained in the War Crimes Amendment Bill 1999 . In particular, I was pleased to see the support from the opposition shadow minister for justice and customs, the member for Denison.
The member for Calwell, Dr Theophanous, raised a number of important issues. For example, he talked long and hard about the amendments contained in the bill being about 10 years overdue. It is indeed a shame that the previous government did not listen to the member for Calwell, who was part of that government. No doubt he called for those sorts of amendments in his time but the then government did not listen or respond. The good news is that this government has acted very promptly indeed, so we have before us today this bill which repeals section 22. This bill was introduced in 1998 but it lapsed when parliament was prorogued and it has been reintroduced very promptly following the re-election of the government. On that front, I should think that the member for Calwell is somewhat better pleased with the performance of this government in relation to the matter.
The member for Calwell was also very concerned in that he felt there had never been in this country any investigation of potential bureaucratic cover-up in relation to alleged war criminals slipping through the net immediately after the Second World War, and since, coming into this country. He alleged that perhaps there was some bureaucratic cover-up at that time and there had never been any concern from any government of the day to check allegations which I presume have been made over a number of years.
Under Prime Minister Robert Menzies there was an independent inquiry which looked at whether or not there was any incompetence or deliberate cover-up in terms of people coming to this country who were potential or alleged war criminals. I refer the member to Parliamentary Paper No. 90/1987, which will give him access to the findings of that inquiry. I will read briefly from paragraph (3) of the section headed `Findings':
While Australian officers in Europe endeavoured to prevent the acceptance for migration to Australia of persons responsible for war crimes, and these endeavours must have prevented many war criminals from entering Australia, there were serious limitations, particularly in early years, in numbers and geographical spread of staff available to do the necessary checking and equally serious gaps in the data against which Australian security officers would have made their checks, particularly in relation to non-Germans. These limitations and gaps would have made possible the entry of persons responsible for war crimes although the number of persons so admitted would have been a minute proportion of the enormous number of persons who migrated to Australia in the post-war years.
Paragraph (4) refers to chapter 7 of the report in the following terms:
. . . no person admitted into Australia under arrangements with U.K. or U.S. intelligence agencies, to the knowledge of Australian authorities, appears to have been the object of charges or allegations as to 
 commission of war crimes although there is a possibility that, particularly before 1956, former employees of such agencies may have entered Australia without the knowledge of Australian authorities.
Certainly, the Liberal government of the day tried very hard to sort out if there were problems deliberately perpetrated when it came to letting people into this country who should not be here.
The member for Melbourne Ports was most concerned about the US current affairs program 20/20, which screened last week. It suggested that it is quite an easy thing to live in Australia as a war criminal. The member for Melbourne Ports was quite rightly concerned about Australia's reputation if that sort of thing were true, and he seemed to think that that in fact was the case. That television program was followed up last week by the 7.30 Report.
Of course, the member for Melbourne Ports, like the US 20/20 producers and Australia's own 7.30 Report producers, failed to stress the fact that we have very different systems in place when it comes to how we go about prosecuting alleged war criminals. For example, the US uses the Immigration Nationality Act 1952, which allows for the deportation of any alien who was simply associated with the Nazi government or any area occupied by the forces of that government with any established Nazi assistance. There is no need to prove a suspect has any personal involvement in any war crime. The proceedings are civil. So the association has to be proved only on the balance of probabilities. As well, if the suspect concealed wartime activities when applying for a US visa and that concealment was found to be a wilful and material misrepresentation, then that is also additional grounds for deportation.
On the other hand, Australia must, under the War Crimes Act 1945, prove the actual commission of a war crime within the meaning of the act or an ancillary offence such as aiding and abetting beyond a reasonable doubt, and it is subject to rigorous criminal, evidentiary and procedural requirements. The suspects have the same rights in Australia under the law as any other Australian suspected of committing a serious crime. So the Australia government of the day—and I think most of us would agree it would continue—was concerned that the fairness of the Australian criminal justice system should not be perverted for the sake of easy popular convictions based on inadequate evidence.
Deportation was not an easy option under Australian law. Until 1998, there was a limit of 10 years before the commission of an offence of giving false information in applying for Australian citizenship after which a person would no longer be liable for deportation for that offence. In 1998, our government removed that time limit, but the effect of the amendment was prospective only. Therefore, people who have already received the benefit of the time limit cannot be deported now under the amended provision. I hope that the member for Melbourne Ports understands that we have different systems. It is easy to say that the US has many points and Australia zero, but that is comparing apples and pears. Let me reiterate that the War Crimes Amendment Bill 1999  deals with very serious issues of a long time ago, but time has not indeed dimmed any Australian's sense of justice when it comes to prosecuting and assisting with prosecutions of those alleged of war crimes.
Section 22 imposes a specific requirement for the content of extradition requests to Australia with respect to conduct which would be covered by the act—in other words, certain crimes committed in Europe during World War II. Currently such requests must be accompanied by the presentation of evidence which establishes a prima facie case that the person has committed the alleged war crime. The main justification for the repeal of section 22 is that it is no longer 
 appropriate to include this onerous requirement for war crime extraditions, particularly following the emergence of newly independent states in Europe from behind the Iron Curtain.
In principle, Australia is interested in establishing modern extradition arrangements with these countries which have now been accepted as members of the Council of Europe. So the enactment of this bill, together with the completion of these new modern extradition arrangements, will increase significantly our ability to cooperate with other countries which seek our assistance in bringing alleged World War II criminals to trial. I think all Australians would be with us today in agreeing that this is a very important amendment. I commend the bill to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.
—If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail, I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,1999-12-09,"—Today I would like to pay tribute to all the members of the Lilley Pricewatch team. They do important work detecting price rises in supermarkets. They act as a thermometer detecting heat seeking price rises.
The Pricewatch surveys were commenced by my predecessor, Mrs Elaine Darling, and they have been carried on by me since 1993. From relatively humble beginnings, the survey has expanded to a total of 27 supermarkets located within and adjacent to the electorate of Lilley, which is situated in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. A fixed basket of 38 grocery items is surveyed at irregular periods by a group of volunteers. Naturally, we have no prior knowledge of any promotions or specials involving items included in our basket and we record both the everyday shelf price and a special price, if applicable.
We take extreme care to ensure the accuracy of our surveys. On receipt, they are scanned to establish whether any apparent errors are recorded. If uncertainty exists, a second check of the store is carried out. The results are maintained on spreadsheets which provide the data to enable an analysis to be carried out. For much of this year, we have been reporting price increases at a rate three times the increase in the CPI and that is a matter of extreme concern.
In particular, I would like to pay tribute to a number of people from the Pricewatch team: Mavis Sinclair, Gaye Tatasciore, Edwina Anderson, Valmai Fisher, Carol Langfield, Brigit Langer, Eunice Jenkin, Bernie Kingston, Louin Wright, Noeline Coran, Sylvia Davey, Gregory Hughes, Christine Gordan, Ben Thompson, Gwen Thomas, Janette Ryan, Bobby Flanagan and Jules Shegog, Joan Ross, Claire Don, Rona Belton, Lola Palmsellers, Karina King, Ailsa Tryst, Gwenneth Smith, Maisie Llwellyen, Donna Smart, Louise Koster and Janette Bohan.
The other thing that there is a lot of community concern about is increases in the price of milk. This year, in Brisbane, the price of milk has risen something like 12 per cent, and that is when there has been an official inflation rate of 1.1 per cent. The price of a litre of milk 
 was $1.17 at the beginning of this year and it is now $1.32. Many people living in the northern suburbs of Brisbane are extremely concerned and have written to me about this matter. For example, a letter from Taigum said:
I am thoroughly disgusted at the increases in milk prices. We have two children to encourage to drink plenty of milk so they grow up healthy and have strong bones and teeth, but the more it costs to buy each week, the less I encourage them to drink.
From Boondall:
My husband and I receive a Carer's Pension and are caring for three intellectually disabled people (also on Pensions) in our own home. We have no other source of revenue—savings or super. If these types of price rises continue and are not off-set by pension rises, we will soon find it impossible to care for our charges.
From Deagon:
With the rise in the price of milk, we are now in a situation where it is cheaper to give our children Cocoa-Cola than to provide them with this necessary nutrition of milk, and have no doubt this will happen with the poorer people of our country.
People are being savaged by price rises. I am extremely concerned that this is yet another example of price increases being introduced ahead of the GST. If price increases on milk are already outstripping inflation 10 times over, what will happen to the price of milk when the rate of inflation is five per cent, as has been predicted by analysts like the Commonwealth Bank and now the Reserve Bank? KPMG, in a government sponsored study, have already predicted a GST from 1 July will add at least 7.5 per cent to food prices and this will be on top of the pre-GST price rises currently hitting consumers.
If the Howard government and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission cannot protect families from price hikes on basic dietary necessities like milk and bread before the GST is introduced, I am extremely concerned at what actions we can expect in a post-GST environment.
Following the increase in the price of milk, I decided to look at the legislation to see whether the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would do anything about it. I was surprised to find that they could do nothing about it unless there was a special reference from the Treasurer to the ACCC about milk in Brisbane. Accordingly, I have written to the Treasurer, Mr Costello, saying:
. . . I earnestly request that you exercise your powers under s.18(1) of the Prices Surveillance Act 1983 and require the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission to hold an enquiry into the two price rises by Pauls Limited and the two rises announced by Dairy Farmers which have occurred since deregulation. Although the rises did not coincide exactly, they became effective within one week of each other.
The terms of reference should include an investigation into the possibility of collusion in setting prices and also whether Pauls Limited is using its pre-eminent market strength to manipulate the Brisbane market.
